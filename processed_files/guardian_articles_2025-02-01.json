Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs against European Union nations.Trump signed three executive orders on Saturday imposing tariffs of 25% on all goods from Mexico and Canada, the New York Timesreported. Trump imposed a 10% tariff on Canadian oil exports, as well as a 10% tariff on items from China.The Times reported that Trump’s tariffs were scheduled to go into effect on Tuesday. An official told the newspaper that these tariffs contained a retaliation clause that would ratchet up American tariffs if Mexico,Canadaor China tried to place their own tariffs on US goods in response.Trump is imposing the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The president cited the US opioid crisis when imposing his executive order, laying much of the blame for drug trafficking on Canada.In a post onTruth Social, Trump said: “We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all. I made a promise on my Campaign to stop the flood of illegal aliens and drugs from pouring across our Borders, and Americans overwhelmingly voted in favor of it.”The country “played a central role in these challenges, including by failing to devote sufficient attention and resources or meaningfully coordinate with United States law enforcement partners to effectively stem the tide of illicit drugs”, Trump claimed.View image in fullscreenTrucks enter the US from Canada at the Pacific Highway port of entry on 1 February 2025 in Blaine, Washington.Photograph: David Ryder/Getty ImagesTrump’s office said that Chinese officials had failed to prevent drug precursors from being shipped toMexicoand used by cartels. He also alleged that Mexican drug traffickers have an “intolerable allience with the government of Mexico”.In afact sheeton the tariffs, Trump also cited the “threat posed by illegal aliens” in his decision.Trump’s decision to levy a 10% tariff rate on Canadian energy products seems to be some sort of recognition that tariffs can spur higher prices. The White House has contended that tariffs will not fan the flames of inflation.Goods from these three countries comprise more than one-third of imports into the US, including apparel, medicine, electronics and steel, the newspaper reported. Despite Trump’s warning that they would be met with ramped-up tariffs, Canada and Mexico said they would meet his plan with tariffs on US imports.Ontario premier Doug Ford said: “Canada now has no choice but to hit back and hit back hard. Canada has so much of what America needs: high-grade nickel and other critical minerals, energy and electricity, uranium, potash, aluminum. We need to maximize our points of leverage and use them to maximum effect.”Canada reportedly said it would impose tariffs on Florida orange juice and whiskey from Tennessee, as well as Kentucky-made peanut butter. All three states are represented by Republican senators and voted for Trump in 2024, the Times notes.Claudia Sheinbaum, the president of Mexico, said that her country should move forward with a “cool head” and a planned retaliatory response, per the Times. The newspaper noted that Trump did not engage in any serious negotiations with these countries before issuing his decision.Sheinbaum,during a speechat an unrelated event, minutes after news of Trump’s tariffs came through, appeared to rally her base. “When we negotiate with other nations, when we talk with other nations, we always do so with our heads held high, never with our heads down,” she said.In a statement released onsocial media, Sheinbaum said: “We categorically reject the White House’s slander of the Government of Mexico having alliances with criminal organisations.” She proposed establishing a workforce with Trump to combat the issues he has with Mexico, saying: “Problems are not resolved by imposing tariffs.”The tariffs could have dire repercussions for Mexico. “We have to remember that 40% of Mexico’s GDP are exports,” said Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis at Grupo Financiero Base, adding that the Mexican economy could enter a “severe recession” if the tariffs were maintained.The American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico, which represents US companies in Mexico, said the tariffs would hit both economies and “fail to address the real challenges of security, migration, and drug trafficking,” adding that, “America First does not mean America Alone.”Economists have repeatedly sounded the alarm that higher tariffs will raise prices on consumer goods for Americans, exacerbating an increasedcost of living. Trump did recognize on Friday that his tariffs could prompt “temporary short-term disruption”.He said he hoped that Americans would understand why he was imposing them. “Tariffs don’t cause inflation,” Trump claimed. “They cause success.”Washington senator Patty Murray posted onsocial media: “Trump’s tariffs will cost families – literally. It’s not Mexico or Canada or China who pays for these increases, it’s YOU. And you’ll feel it on your wallet everywhere you shop.”Colorado governor Jared Polisagreed: “Trump’s tariffs will be a tax on Coloradans and American families, and increase the cost of everything from food to gas. Trump’s tariffs make us less competitive, hurt people and quite frankly make no sense.”Jason Smith, the ways and means committee chair, championed the tariffs. “President Trump is delivering on his promise … The tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China send a powerful message that the United States will no longer stand by as other nations fail to halt the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants into our country,” he said in astatement. “These measures will also bring in billions in new revenue to the US government.”The Tax Foundation, a conservative group, has estimated that Trump placed $80bn in tariffs on approxiately $380bn worth of products in 2018 and 2019. The foundation described this as “one of the largest tax increases in decades”.Joe Biden’s administration kept the majority of these tariffs in place, and increased tariffs on an additional $18bn of Chinese goods, including semiconductors and electric vehicles.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMexicoChinaCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

Heathrow confirmed it had asked Frontier Economics to do the work. It has published an ­executive ­summary online, not the entire report.The New Economics Foundation (NEF) thinktank ­criticised the chancellor on Saturday night for the ­justifications she gave for backing a third ­runway, saying it also believed the methodology used had ­previously been judged unreliable by the Department forTransport.View image in fullscreenThe report by the Frontier Economics consultancy said a third Heathrow runway could increase potential GDP by 0.43% by 2050.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianAlex Chapman, senior economist at the NEF, said: “It is very concerning that the chancellor appears to be basing her support for Heathrow expansion on a figure from a report commissioned byHeathrow airport.“Even more worrying is the fact that the methodology they have applied is one that the Department for Transport has previously decided is not fit for purpose, and that the report uses forecast data supplied by the airport itself.“Heathrow expansion represents a major threat to the UK’s climate goals and flies in the face of scientific advice. To ensure that the claimed economic benefits are concrete, assessments should be carried out by independent government economists following best-practice methodology.“NEF’s analysis has identified a wide range of weaknesses in the economic case, which have emerged since it was last fully appraised in 2015. Not least, the decline of business air travel, the surge in outbound leisure travel and the negative impacts on wider regions of the UK – all of which erode the potential growth benefit.”Analysis by climate crisis website Carbon Briefsuggests that, using the government’s own figures, SAF will barely cut emissions by 2040, and any reduction will be wiped out by rising flight numbers.Separately, in 2023,the Royal Society foundthat to grow enough crops – biofuels – to make all UK aviation fuel sustainable would require about half of UK ­agricultural land.A spokesperson at Frontier Economics defended its record as a well-regarded consultancy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We recognise this is a complex issue; our report is clear about all aspects: the costs, the benefits, the overall impact and the uncertainties.Aoife O’Leary, chief executive of non-governmental organisationOpportunity Green, said increasing the number of flights in and out of the UK would not drive the economic growth Reeves was so desperate to deliver.What would Heathrow third runway mean for pollution, emissions and noise?Read more“Business travel represents a dwindling share of flights, while foreign tourists coming into the UK and boosting our economy are ­outnumbered three to one by UK tourists leaving the UK to spend money abroad, taking net £41bn out of the economy. “If the government wants growth, better options for investment include boosting connectivity outside London with improved domestic public transport.” She also said that SAF was “essentially a mirage”.She added: “Yes, these fuels are biofuels made from crops, cooking oils and other sources of plant biomass. But producing them takes up huge amounts of land, endangering food security and biodiversity. “Indeed, very little of these fuels even exist today and producing them at anything like the scale that will be needed to decarbonise aviation would be totally incompatible with any notions of sustainability.”The Treasury was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow third runwayThe ObserverHeathrow airportAir transportAirline industryRachel ReevesClimate crisisLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, he was labelled a “high-value” customer who, when he stopped using the platform, the company was keen to “win back”.A judge found that while he may not have opted out of marketing, the man was in the depths of a gambling problem and had not properly understood how his data would be used. Mrs Justice Collins Rice said his ability to give consent was impaired as he “was not making decisions … on a fully autonomous basis at all” and ruled that Sky Betting & Gaming’s use of his data was unlawful.Campaigners said this weekend the ruling could have ramifications for the wider industry and called for an investigation into the potentially unlawful profiling and targeting of problem gamblers. The Gambling Commission has implemented a series of measures to ensure better safeguards for customers, but campaigners say the industry has repeatedly failed to identify gamblers who are at most risk of harm.In England there are almost 1.6 million adults who gamble who may benefit from some type of treatment or support forharmful gambling, according to the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID).The OHID reported in 2023 that the annual number of excess suicide deaths in England associated with problem gambling or a gambling disorder was between 117 and 496.View image in fullscreenIn 2023 up to 496 suicides were associated with problem gambling.Photograph: Qi Yang/Getty ImagesWill Prochaska, leader of the Coalition to End Gambling Ads, said the ruling revealed the “frightening” level of tracking and targeting used by gambling firms and said that Sky Betting & Gaming’s practices were “indicative of how the sector operates”. “We’re very concerned because we know this is widespread,” he said.Charles Ritchie from the charity Gambling with Lives that supports families bereaved by gambling urged regulators to act. “Operators are using data and algorithms to target people with more incentives to gamble when they should be using that data to meaningfully intervene,” he said.The case against Bonne Terre Ltd, trading as Sky Betting & Gaming, came after a man who lost £46,000 requested records of the data the company held on him. Through those documents and subsequent legal disclosures he discovered the company and its partners had collected hundreds of thousands of pieces of data that were used to profile and target him.The data filled more than 2,400 spreadsheets and had been used to predict his behaviour and select him for targeted marketing campaigns. In 2017 and 2018 he was sent at least 1,389 marketing emails offering him free bets and special prizes and encouraging him to spend. He often deposited money as a direct result. He is now seeking compensation for financial losses and for the unlawful use of personal data. A further hearing is expected to decide how much he is entitled to. “I lost 10 years of my life to gambling. I believe I – and a lot of others – should have been protected better,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Betting and Gaming Council, which represents gambling firms, declined to comment.The case follows occasional interventions by the gambling and data regulators. The Information Commissioner’s Officereprimanded Sky Betting & Gaming last yearfor unlawfully processing people’s data through advertising cookies without their consent. In 2023, Paddy Power was fined £490,000 by the Gambling Commission for breaching social responsibility rules after sending a promotional push notification to customers who had signed up to exclude themselves from gambling.But the claimant said he hoped the case would lead to a wider investigation into the gambling sector, which is heavily reliant on online tracking, profiling and marketing to push its products to customers.Currently, many companies rely on consent as the basis for using similar practices to those detailed in the high court case. But the ruling raises the question of whether other companies that market to problem gamblers, who could be considered unable to freely consent due to the compulsive nature of their gambling, are also breaking the law.The Gambling Commission said it expected all operators to be “carefully considering” the latest judgment along with the ICO ruling against Sky Betting & Gaming in September. “Operators can only collect and use data to attract customers in ways that comply with data protection laws, with a focus on preventing gambling harm,” a spokesperson said.The Information Commissioner’s Office said: “Uncontrolled tracking intrudes on the most private parts of our lives and can lead to harm. We continue to monitor this area and will not hesitate to intervene when necessary.”Explore more on these topicsGamblingThe ObserverMarketing & PRAdvertisingData protectionInformation commissionernewsShareReuse this content"

It was unsealed under theGazaceasefire deal after all Israeli women held alive in the strip were released.It is a vital conduit to Gaza – the only crossing that does not connect to Israel – and its closure caused international outcry for trapping the vast majority of urgent medical cases inside Gaza. It also made aid delivery more complicated and expensive.The resumption of regular crossings, for a set number of patients with urgent medical needs, marks a significant moment in the complex ceasefire agreement.Fifty children were meant to leave on Saturday but two died before they could be evacuated, some were critically ill and could not be moved under the current conditions, and doctors had lost contact with some families, said Zaher al-Wahidi, head of the Palestinian Information Center at the Gaza health minister.Even the current quota of 50 a day was far too low to meet desperate needs inside Gaza, he added.1:11Hamas releases three more hostages from Gaza under ceasefire deal with Israel – videoLast week the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for 2,500 children to be immediately evacuated from Gaza for medical treatment after meeting US doctors who said the children were at imminent risk of death in the coming weeks.View image in fullscreenA man holding a baby at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City prepares to be evacuated for treatment.Photograph: Bashar Taleb/AFP/GettyThe handover of the three Israeli hostages, Yarden Bibas, 35, Israeli-US citizen Keith Siegel, 65, and Israeli-French citizen Ofer Kalederon, 54, triggered the release of 183 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza held in Israeli jails.They included a prominent political prisoner and more than 100 people from Gaza detained after the 7 October attacks and never charged or tried, but also 72 people serving long or life sentences for violent offences.View image in fullscreenYarden Bibas travels in a military helicopter to Sheba hospital in Ramat Gan, Israel.Photograph: GPO/AFP/Getty ImagesAn aid worker,Mohammad al-Halabi, who Amnesty International deemed a prisoner of conscience, was returned to Gaza for the first time in nearly a decade. He was detained in 2016, held without trial for more than six years, then convicted in what the rights group described as “deeply flawed proceedings”.The handover of the Israeli hostages in two locations – the southern city of Khan Younis and at Gaza City’s port – was far more orderly than a chaotic release earlier this week that briefly threatened to upset the terms of the ceasefire deal.Inside Israel, joy at welcoming back Bibas was mixed with fear about the fate of his wife, Shiri, and young children Ariel and Kfir, who were seized and held hostage separately from Yarden.View image in fullscreenOfer Kalderon is reunited with family in Ramat Gan, Israel.Photograph: Maayan Toaf/ReutersVideo of Shiri holding on to her children as she was kidnapped by Hamas gunmen from the Nir Oz kibbutz became an enduring image of the 7 October 2023 attacks. Her son, Kfir, was just nine months old when he was abducted.They are listed among 16 Israelis still due to be returned in the first phase of the ceasefire, eight of whom are known to dead. Because living women were prioritised for return and Hamas is now releasing male hostages, many in Israel say hopes the family will be reunited alive are fading.The Israeli government has expressed “grave concerns” for their wellbeing. Hamas said the trio, kidnapped separately from Yarden, were killed in 2023.Map of Gaza showing Rafah crossing into Egypt.Seventeen of the 33 Israeli hostages due for release in the first stage of the ceasefire have now been released in exchange for 400 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.Saturday marked the first time detainees were returned to Gaza; the deal includes the release of 1,000 Palestinians from the strip. Buses carrying 111 of them were greeted by joyful crowds in Khan Younis.Some of the detainees were led out of prison with their hands handcuffed over their heads, wearing a bracelet inscribed with a threatening message, prompting outrage among International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) employees coordinating the release, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.The bracelets read: “The eternal nation does not forget, I will chase down my enemies and defeat them”. The ICRC later reminded both parties to the deal “of their responsibility to ensure transfers are carried out safely and with dignity”.The truce, which began on 19 January, is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the Hamas militant group. The fragile deal has held for nearly two weeks, halting the fighting and allowing for increased aid to flow into the tiny coastal territory.View image in fullscreenThe Israeli hostage Keith Siegel is handed over to the Red Cross.Photograph: Mohammed Saber/EPAThe Rafah crossing, long a lifeline for Palestinians, had been closed since Israeli forces took control of the surrounding area in May 2024. The first crossings this year took place after buses were seen collecting the sick and wounded from Gaza hospitals.Over the past 15 months, Israel’s campaign against Hamas in retaliation for the militants’ 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel has devastated Gaza’s health sector, leaving most of its hospitals out of operation, even as more than 110,000 Palestinians were wounded by Israel’s bombardment and ground offensives, according to the Palestinian health ministry.In addition to injured people leaving, with a quota set to include Hamas fighters, the crossing could allow aid groups to boost supplies into the strip.Negotiations are due to start by Tuesday on agreements for the release of more than 60 remaining hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza in a second phase of the deal.Freed Gaza hostage told Starmer that Hamas held her in Unrwa premises, her mother saysRead moreAfter the latest releases, Israel and Hamas are due to begin negotiating a second phase of the ceasefire next week, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely.

There should be mass graves and the Rwandans took care to evacuate theirs,” said Muyaya.Who are the M23 rebels and why is there fighting in eastern DRC?Read moreHundreds of Goma residents were returning to the city on Saturday after the rebels promised to restore basic services including water and power. They cleaned up the neighbourhoods littered with debris from weapons and filled with the stench of blood.“I’m tired and don’t know which way to go. On every corner [there] is a mourner,” said Jean Marcus, 25, one of whose relatives was among those killed in the fighting.M23 is the most potent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo’s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world’s technology. They are backed by about 4,000 troops from neighbouring Rwanda, according to UN experts, far more than in 2012, when they first captured Goma and held it for days in a conflict driven by ethnic grievances.Map of DRC showing Goma.As the fighting raged on with the M23 rebels on Saturday, the Congolese army recaptured the villages of Sanzi, Muganzo and Mukwidja in South Kivu’s Kalehe territory, which had fallen to the rebels earlier this week, according to two civil society officials, who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of fears for their safety.The central African nation’s military has been weakened after it lost hundreds of troops, and foreign mercenaries surrendered to the rebels after the fall of Goma.UN peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix said on Friday that the M23 and Rwandan forces were about 37 miles (60km) north of South Kivu’s provincial capital of Bukavu, covering almost the same distance in the previous two days since they started advancing along Lake Kivu on the border with Rwanda. Lacroix said the rebels “seem to be moving quite fast”, and capturing an airport a few kilometres (miles) away “would be another really significant step”.The seizure of Goma resulted in a dire humanitarian crisis, the UN and aid groups said. Goma serves as a humanitarian hub, critical for many of the six million people displaced by the conflict in eastern Congo. The rebels said they will march all the way to Kinshasa, 1,000 miles (1,600km) to the west.UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told a briefing on Friday that the World Health Organization and its partners conducted an assessment with Congo’s government between 26 and 30 January and reported that 700 people have been killed and 2,800 injured in Goma and the vicinity. Dujarric confirmed to AP that the deaths occurred during those days.‘I curse this war’: hunger and fear in Goma after rebel takeoverRead moreThe rebel advance has left in its wake extrajudicial killings and forced conscription of civilians, UN human rights office spokesman Jeremy Laurence said on Friday.He said: “We have also documented summary executions of at least 12 people by M23” over 26 to 28 January, adding that the group has occupied schools and hospitals in the province and is subjecting civilians to forced conscription and forced labour.Congolese forces have been accused of sexual violence as fighting rages on in the region, Laurence said, adding the UN is verifying reports that Congolese troops raped 52 women in South Kivu.Goma’s capture has brought humanitarian operations to “a standstill, cutting off a vital lifeline for aid delivery across eastern (Congo),” said Rose Tchwenko, country director for the Mercy Corps aid group in Congo.“The escalation of violence toward Bukavu raises fears of even greater displacement, while the breakdown of humanitarian access is leaving entire communities stranded without support,” she said.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In 2015, IS-Somalia splintered from al-Shabaab, a much larger and more widely known jihadist organisation affiliated with al-Qaida, which controls parts of southernSomalia.Trump said on Saturday that he ordered strikes on a senior IS attack planner and others from the organisation.The president wrote in a post on Truth Social: “These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United States and our Allies.“The strikes destroyed the caves they live in, and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming civilians.“Our Military has targeted this ISIS Attack Planner for years, but Biden and his cronies wouldn’t act quickly enough to get the job done. I did!“The message to ISIS and all others who would attack Americans is that ‘WE WILL FIND YOU, AND WE WILL KILL YOU!’”Trump did not identify the IS figure or state whether they were killed in the attack. The US secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, added that an initial assessment indicated multiple operatives were killed. He said no civilians were harmed.“[It] sends a clear signal that the United States always stands ready to find and eliminate terrorists who threaten the United States and our allies, even as we conduct robust border protection and many other operations under President Trump’s leadership,” he said.Somali American Democratic representativeIlhan Omar, commended the strike, saying: “It’s my sincere hope that Isis and Alshabab will be defeated and the people of Somalia will see an end to terrorism.”Estimates for the total number of active members in IS-Somalia have varied widely, but UN, US and Somali government officialsbelieveit has about 300 to 700 members, approximately half of whom are believed to be foreign fighters who have entered Somalia.The Puntland regional government has been involved in its own month-long operation against IS-Somalia following a deadly attack it carried out against Puntland’s security forces in December.A Puntland official said its forces “had been involved in a low intensity conflict with the group for almost a decade and have cleared more than 200km of territory of their presence since this operation began”.In a post on social media, Puntlandthanked the US and the United Arab Emiratesfor their support.The Somali president’s office said that Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was informed about theUS militaryaction targeting senior IS leadership in northern parts of the country.“He acknowledges the unwavering support of the United States in the fight against international terrorism and welcomes the continued commitment under the decisive leadership of presidentDonald Trump,” the office said in a post on X.The strikes took place a day after the Somali president made an appeal to Trump in an interview with the Washington Post “not to pull out the American advisers and consultants who are supporting the training of our special forces”.Trump has opposed the deployment of US troops in faraway conflicts and withdrew soldiers from the country in 2020, relying primarily on airstrikes to degrade jihadist organisations operating in Somalia. He has ordered more airstrikes in the country than any other US president.A strike, which also targeted IS militants, was carried out in coordination with Somalia last year and killed three members of the group, the US military said.After the strikes US officials briefed media saying that they targeted Abdulqadir Mumin, who they said quietly became IS’s global leader, but experts have expressed doubt that he held such a senior role.Explore more on these topicsSomaliaIslamic StateUS militaryAfricaDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

None of the officers sustained major injuries.Ch Supt Stephen Jones said: “I appreciate that this will have caused understandable shock and concern in the local community. However, I would like to make it clear that there is nothing to suggest that there is any wider threat to the public.”Police said the motive for the incident was still unclear but that there was no wider threat to the public.Alex Davies-Jones, the Welsh Labour MP for Pontypridd, called for people to be mindful of speculation or misinformation while police carried out investigations.The suspect remains in custody.Explore more on these topicsWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Everyday folk such as the Prince of Wales, Princess Eugenie, Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece, the Blairs, the Johnsons and the Beckhams have all ­previously enjoyed Birley’s hospitality, according toTatler, a touchstone for ­middle England sensibilities.On the eve of the event, Farage warned GB News viewers that if Reform achieved electoral success at the next election, he was “quite sure that the establishment won’t exactly come out with a tray of gin and tonics” to welcome him. Far more appropriate for the Dulwich College old boys’ golf society captain and his guests last week were champagne and “jeroboams of white burgundy and double magnums of Tempo d’Angelus”, according to theTimes.Various wealthy businessmen who have demonstrated distrust of the British establishment by donating money to the Conservative party joined Farage at Oswald’s. Among them were Reform’s treasurer, the billionaire property developer Nick Candy, the near-billionairenon-dom campaignerBassim Haidar and the businessman Mohamed Amersi, whofailed to win a defamation actionagainst Charlotte Leslie, a former Tory MP, in 2023.Candy’s wife, the former singer and actor Holly Valance, was there too, as was Lady Victoria Hervey, once famous for being famous andnow famousfor campaigning for the release of Ghislaine Maxwell and taking selfies with Maga politicians in the US alongside Liz Truss.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage and Nick Candy on 10 December 2024.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesThe event raised at least £1m, Reform said afterwards, and the party moved on to Essex on Friday for a rally, after which Farage’s right-hand man, the multimillionaire property developer Richard Tice, batted away enquiries about James McMurdock, the Reform MP for South Basildon and East Thurrock who spent 21 days in custody after his conviction forassaulting a former girlfriend18 years ago.Oswald’s was quiet on Friday night, with just a couple of chauffeurs doomscrolling in their limousines in Albemarle Street as they waited for their passengers, and a few partygoers in vertiginous heels chatted with their companions.Birley was not around to ­discuss the party, a doorman ­promised; he owns two London clubs and another in New York – an empire to replace that created by his father,Mark Birley, founder of several West End establishments. The most famous was Annabel’s, named after his son’s mother, Lady Annabel Goldsmith, who went on to marry James Goldsmith, the founder of the Referendum party.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has not solved the problem. “I wake up in the middle of the night coughing and I can’t go back to sleep because the smell is so strong,” she said.Dionne is one of a number of residents who told theObserverof their concerns that LEMB’s mismanagement had left the estate of more than 1,000 properties in disarray, with damp, vermin infestations and a raw sewage spill not being adequately addressed.AnObserverinvestigation has found that in the year to March 2024, LEMB wrote off about £375,000 on “celebration gifts” for residents and spent £46,000 on a foreign trip for board members. It named one of the estate’s community centres after its chair, while another is being rented by a cargo company. LEMB, which described the chair in one of its magazines as its “rock of ages”, has also accused Lambeth council of trying to murder him – an allegation the authority dismisses as false.View image in fullscreenLeaks on the Loughborough Estate.Loughborough Estate is a sprawling postwar site near Brixton in south London. A three-bed flat on the estate can sell for up to £400,000, and 255 private leaseholders pay up to £1,800 a year in service charges to LEMB, while 969 of the properties are for council tenants. The landlord is Lambeth council, but since 1995 LEMB has been the tenant management organisation (TMO) tasked with undertaking day-to-day maintenance and repairs.TMOs were set up in England and Wales in the 1970s to allow residents to manage their housing through local, volunteer-led grassroots organisations. Right to Manage regulations introduced in 1994 allowed TMOs to also take charge of repairs, maintenance and rent collection. However, some TMOs have been criticised by residents for mismanagement. The campaign group NoTMO compiles lists of what they call“rogue” organisationsthat they believe have been negligent or misused their power. The Grenfell inquiry report published in September found that the tower’s TMO, Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, was “a bullying overlord”.Helen Hayes, the local MP for the Loughborough Estate, says she receives a high number of complaints about LEMB’s management and is calling for “proper accountability” for all TMOs in the UK.View image in fullscreenA corner of the Loughborough Estate.Photograph: Sophia Evans/the ObserverWhen theObservervisited the Loughborough Estate last month, there were at least 10 fridges left in a corner of the site. A slide in a nearby play area for children was broken. Resident Leah*, who has a seven-year-old daughter, said that last winter there was a sewage leak near the play area.Nagema Adair, who has lived on the estate for 22 years and says she has experienced mould for the past five, said she had given up complaining to LEMB. “You already feel on the bottom because you’re on an estate, you’re in a council house, and to be treated like this makes you even more down. You just feel neglected. You feel that you’re not worth it.”LEMB has a £3m annual budget and, according to annual financial accounts to March 2024, it wrote off £374,151 of “costs in relation to celebration gifts for residents which will be distributed in the coming years”, and spent a further £46,390 on a trip abroad “during which time they considered a number of issues impacting LEMB”.LEMB raises additional income by collecting rents from the hire of two onsiteonsite community centres. However, when theObservervisited what is advertised on LEMB’s website as Community Centre 1, it displayed signage for a Nigerian-based cargo firm. Six blue oil drums appeared to be being stored inside the centre.Records at Companies House show at least two British companies registered at this address: KJ Cargo/Shipping – which is described on one of its websites as “one of the UK’s most reputable and highly respected International Freight Forwarding company” and on its Nigerian website as a “wholly owned Nigerian company, with global reach” – and MMAC Energy, which says on its website that it works on “economic recovery and sustainability of Nigeria’s oil and gas resources”. Neither company responded when approached by theObserverfor comment.A spokesperson for Lambeth council said they were “extremely concerned” about the reports of oil barrels. “These were immediately reported to the fire brigade,” they said. “We are seeking answers on why they were stored there in the first place and we are investigating the community centre’s use.”London fire brigade confirmed that it had undertaken a full inspection of the site and that the barrels had been removed by the time they arrived.The other centre, the Peter Shorinwa Community Centre, is named after LEMB’s chair. Shorinwa became chair of LEMB in 2011, and LEMB refers to him in its 25th anniversary magazine as the “Rt Hon”, describing him as “an able Leader and Fearless. LEMB’s rock of ages”.Disagreements between LEMB and Lambeth council date back to 2012, when Lambeth council removed LEMB’s control of the estate due to concerns over its finances as well as several alleged breaches of the management agreement. LEMB denied these allegations, and when arbitration concluded with a settlement in 2015, residents voted for it to return. All management responsibility was restored to LEMB in 2016.In 2019, Shorinwa was found not guilty at Inner London crown court after being charged with fraud following allegations by Lambeth council.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A spokesperson for the council said: “These criminal allegations against the council are completely false claims, and we are concerned that they are being made.”View image in fullscreenTim Gingell runs the Loughborough Voices WhatsApp group.Photograph: Sophia Evans/the ObserverSome residents are now seeking to oust LEMB. Tim Gingell, who has lived on the estate for more than 30 years, runs a WhatsApp group with more than 100 members called Loughborough Voices, many of whom want to remove LEMB as managers of the estate. A continuation ballot, where residents can vote to keep the current TMO or return responsibilities to the council, is overdue. “We want to start a completely new TMO,” Gingell said from his eighth-floor flat. “We want a resident-led, transparent approach.”In the meantime, Gingell is collecting evidence of maintenance issues on the estate. Images on the WhatsApp group include footage that appears to show sewage backing up to the brim of a resident’s bathtub.Last February, Shorinwa sent a letter to all residents accusing Loughborough Voices of “degrading our estate” and “trying to create pandemonium and dissatisfaction”. The letter also says: “anti-social behaviour will be met with strong resistance … your identities are known so stop now … before it is too late.” In a letter sent to all residents in October, Shorinwa accused Loughborough Voices of “unhealthy, unacceptable, unbecoming, self-seeking and anti-social behaviour”.Gingell and other Loughborough Voices organisers have also been sent a cease and desist letter by LEMB’s lawyers, who accuse the group of “illegal and disruptive behaviours”. Gingell said: “My head is so far above the parapet I can’t really turn back. And I’m not really afraid of LEMB.”The fall and rise of the council estateRead moreA Lambeth council spokesperson told theObserverthat it was aware of residents’ concerns and was taking action through site visits and performance monitoring as well as “meeting the residents and highlighting their concerns with the LEMB in a bid to get them resolved”. It added: “We will continue to push for improved performance from the LEMB.”Hayes, the local MP, says she receives “a high number of complaints from residents on the Loughborough Estate relative to its size”. She added: “Residents have told me that they are sometimes reluctant to report problems because of how they will be treated. Communication from LEMB is variable – sometimes issues are addressed but I have also received correspondence which is rude and defensive.“It is important that there is proper accountability for all TMOs for the services they provide to residents, in the same way as councils and housing associations are accountable for the services they provide.”Shorinwa and LEMB did not respond to repeated requests for comment.* Some names have been changedExplore more on these topicsHousingThe ObserverCommunitiesLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To Andreessen, a veteran of decades of technology booms and busts, it was like the Soviet Union getting the first satellite into orbit in 1957 and shocking America.The next day, shares in several of the world’s biggest companies plunged – including the biggest fall in US market history for microchip maker Nvidia, which lost nearly $600bn. Investors believed DeepSeek’s achievement meant China would no longer need so many American chips; that US supremacy in AI was under threat or already over; and that the Silicon Valley giants, who had only a week earlier announced a $500bn AI investment plan, were spending much more money than they needed. The Chinese AI labsaidthe training cost for one of its base models had been just $5.6m.In the biggest week for AI since the launch ofChatGPTin November 2022, DeepSeek’s app, with its jaunty blue whale logo, became the most downloaded free app on Apple’s app stores in the US and UK as people rushed to find out what it was about.But was the world’s largest autocratic nation about to leapfrog the west in AI? What might it mean for control of a technology that many fear could be pressed into malicious use in cyber-attacks, the production of biological weapons and thought control? And given AI is widely considered to now be one of the main playing fields of geopolitical competition, where did this leave US hopes of maintaining supremacy by suppressing China’s progress with export bans on microchips that are key to progress?Tremors had been rumbling out of DeepSeek’s laboratory in Hangzhou, outside Shanghai, for a while. Some experts had been quietly impressed by the developments overseen by DeepSeek’s boss, Liang Wenfeng, a 40-year-old hedge fund entrepreneur. But it wasn’t until last Wednesday that a proper earthquake hit. The firm publisheda 22-page paperunveiling the DeepSeek R1 model, boasting of “powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviours” and saying it is comparable to Open AI’s 01 model, and even better in some areas.Liang was said to be on holiday as his team’s creation upended not just markets, but also the geopolitical calculus between the US and ChinaWhile Google, Meta andOpenAItypically swaddle their new releases in marketing hype, DeepSeek’s matter-of-fact approach was clear from the soporific title of its announcement: “Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning”.The model was free to use and it seemed pioneering in the way it was engineered to be more efficient than ChatGPT-o1, OpenAI’s $20-a-month reasoning model. It used less computing power as it had been engineered only to activate the relevant part of the system to answer the query. Performance that cost other companies billions seemed to be available for millions.In response, OpenAIannounced the launch of a new reasoning model, o3-Mini, on Friday that will be made available to all users, including people on ChatGPT’s free tier.Liang was said to be on holiday for lunar new year as his team’s creation upended not just markets, but also the geopolitical calculus between the US and China as they vie for supremacy in AI with all its economic, political and military potentials. Around the world, experts tried to make sense of how the Chinese had made necessity the mother of invention and found a way around a shortage of chips.Jimmy Goodrich, an adviser on technology to the Rand Corporation, told Reuters: “It’s been long known that DeepSeek has a really good team, and if they had access to even more compute, God knows how capable they would be.”“I confess I hadn’t heard of them,” said Michael Wooldridge, a professor of the foundations of AI at the University of Oxford. “[They] appear to have built something which is as capable as a GPT class model, not necessarily better, with something like a hundredth of the resources.”By midweek, DeepSeek had disappeared from app stores in Italy after the data protection regulator demanded reassurancesHe says the development “pulls the rug out from under Nvidia”, meaning a far greater number of developers can build AI models, making it a “much more accessible technology”.Mike Gualtieri, a principal analyst at Forrester Research, says that accessibility will widen the number of startups that can create their own AI models. But also, the bigger US tech players, with their considerable data processing firepower, could accelerate their own development.“The companies that already have a lot of chips, or access to them – the OpenAIs and the Googles – once they apply these [DeepSeek] techniques, they can experiment more rapidly,” he said.In London, hopes and fears were in conflict. The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said he would not download the Chinese app, surely aware that anything he typed in or uploaded would be stored in China and that all Chinese firms are obliged under the national intelligence law to “support, assist and cooperate” with intelligence efforts.But, as a minister tasked with using AI to deliver economic growth, he was “really excited” by the breakthrough. It seemed to show that skills, rather than brute-force computing power funded by hundreds of billions of dollars, were more important than previously thought in making significant AI breakthroughs – good news for the research-heavy UK tech economy.By midweek, DeepSeek haddisappeared from app stores for Google and Apple devices in Italyafter the data protection regulator demanded reassurances about what personal data is collected. The Dublin Data Protection Commission also demanded from DeepSeek explanations about its “data processing conducted in relation to data subjects in Ireland”.When it ruminated on how “in China, the primary threat is the state itself”, the whole screed of “thinking” was deletedIn the US, where Donald Trump signedan executive orderto “solidify [the US] position as the leader in AI”, the arrival of DeepSeek was like a needle scratching across a record. Trump called it a “wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win”. Or as one X user parsed his message: “Get back in the code mines.”It didn’t take long for suspicions to take hold. David Sacks, the White House AI adviser, said: “There’s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled knowledge out of OpenAI models, and I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.”OpenAI’s founder, Sam Altman, said he thought it was “legit invigorating to have a new competitor”. But then, a day later,his company saidit was “reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models”.It also became apparent that DeepSeek would censor itself in real time when its answers might be politically embarrassing or challenging for the CCP. In Brazil, one user showed how DeepSeek began thinking about a question about free speech in China by wondering whether to include issues like Beijing’s crackdown on protests in Hong Kong; the “persecution of human rights lawyers”; the “censorship of discussions on Xianjiang re-education camps”; and China’s “social credit system punishing dissenters”.Then, when it ruminated on how “in China, the primary threat is the state itself which actively suppresses dissent”, the whole screed of “thinking” was deleted and DeepSeek apologetically asked the user if he wouldn’t mind talking about maths or logic problems instead.Users could see what the chatbot really thought and the effect of the CCP on free speech; to see it all in action was unintentionally subversive.It was another week in which the strange world of AI got stranger and the stakes rose higher.Explore more on these topicsDeepSeekThe ObserverArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAIComputingChatGPTChinanewsShareReuse this content"

I started watching sports’The singer-songwriter on the advice from Nick Cave that changed her life, acting in The OA and her guilty pleasureSian CainSat 1 Feb 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2025 14.03 ESTShareWhat’s the best piece of advice you have ever received?I don’t want to be name-droppy, but this advice definitely came at a time in my life where I really needed to hear it. In 2013, when I was on tour with Nick Cave, I was having a problem with my partner at the time. Our biggest fights always broke out when I would go on tour, because he felt like I was choosing my career over having a relationship.So I asked Nick: “I’m sure you and Susie have a lot of fights about how often you can tour. What kind of work do you do to find the balance?” And he said: “Well, Susie and I fight, but never about my job. That’s my work. That’s everything to me. And she knows that, so we don’t fight about it.”From gay clubs to Maga anthem: the absurd, contested history of the Village People’s YMCARead moreMy mind was blown. I knew this is something that I need in my life. So when I came back from that tour, I started making big changes.What’s been your most memorable interaction with a fan?There was a woman named Ariel who was very sick. She had a lot of breathing issues and was waiting for a lung transplant. She came to multiple shows and befriended me and my bandmates. I remember we were in Charlottesville, Virginia, and I saw her in the street with a friend. They were in tears, telling me how much our music meant to them, and how it helped Ariel through all her hospital stays and every time she had to do her breathing exercises. Her parents would help her come to all of our concerts and she was always upfront. I would sing Seventeen to her at the end of the show.We stayed in touch over the years and we had one last talk on Zoom before she decided to go into hospice care. It was really, really intense. She was scared, but also really at peace. She had a profound effect on all our lives. I wrote Afterlife around the time she died.Afterlife by Sharon Van Etten & The Attachment Theory.You are a musician who doesn’t like jamming. How does that work?As I’m getting older, I’m just giving less of a damn, you know? But I tend to be solo during the writing process. I am also trying to connect more with my bandmates [The Attachment Theory] – I am trying to let go and grow as an artist and do things that I don’t normally do. So this album is the first time I’ve really jammed. It came after a week of rehearsals for the last tour, when I was really tired of hearing myself. I asked, “Could we just jam?” Then we ended up writing two songs in like an hour and it left me feeling very inspired. That’s what sparked the idea to start writing together.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsYou acted in the cult hit Netflix show The OA. If it hadn’t been prematurely cancelled in 2019, how would you have ended it?It’s funny because I know what they wanted to do with it. I’ll say it because who cares! Every time the season changed, it was going to be more about the life of one of the captives. If I got my season, I think it would have been about being in a band. I am very curious how that would have taken shape. But how to end it? I don’t know. Waking up from a dream and none of it had happened?I’m a little embarrassed about my experience on the show because I’m not an actor.

It came with the house that I moved into when I was about five or six. My mum tells this story about when we first moved in – I’m one of five kids, so it was very chaotic, everyone was running around, claiming rooms and exploring the house. It was an old Victorian fixer-upper – boxes were everywhere and everyone was getting splinters just from running up the stairs. My mum couldn’t find me, so she kept looking and looking until she heard me quietly crying under this baby grand. I had found safety underneath the piano. It became a place where I would find comfort – my mum would find me just playing a note and matching the tone of the note, which is how I learned to sing. I had no idea as a kid, but that moment, I think, really began that course of seeking solace in music. I’m so curious if that piano is still there. I’ve thought about knocking on the door.What is your most controversial pop culture opinion?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

There are some really, really short skirts out there, and also extremely baggy stuff – why can’t you just wear clothes that fit you? How do people walk around with half of their ass hanging out of their skirt? Is that comfortable? I’m not saying don’t wear it. I’m more concerned that you aren’t comfortable. Oh, I’m so boring!What pets do you have, what other names and what other nicknames?We have a rescue dog named Lindy. He’s named after a boy called Lyndon that my son had met only once at the time, but he left a profound impact on him. Sometimes we call him Lindylooloo or Digger, because he loves digging in the dirt. He is a wire-haired, mangy-looking freakazoid. I don’t know if Lyndon actually knows if a dog has been named after him. I would love for them to meet some time. That would be so sweet.What is the weirdest thing you have done for love?Manic Street Preachers: ‘The band feels like something you can go into battle with against the world’Read moreI started watching sports. I’ve never been a sporty person, but my partner’s from North Carolina and his family are hardcore UNC [University of North Carolina] fans. I stopped paying attention to sports as a kid. But major league and college sports are completely different worlds. When I started following these college kids and watching profiles on them and how they’re literally playing for their lives, because it’s make or break for them at that level, the games become so intense. When we get together to watch games, everyone is wearing Carolina blue. I laugh at myself sometimes, but it brings us comfort. I’m still learning all the rules. I love all the rivalries and the camaraderie and the back stories, which has really surprised me.If you had a sandwich named after you, what would be in it?One of my guilty pleasures that stems from my early days working at Ihop [International House of Pancakes] – I would do mashed potatoes on toast with gravy. It would have to be white gravy and it would be open faced on rye bread. I would get the bottomless coffee too. Together – the mashed potatoes on toast with white gravy, with the coffee – is theSharon Van Etten. Without the coffee it doesn’t work. Very starchy, but very tasty.What are you secretly very good at?I used to tap dance. I haven’t taken classes, but I did theatre and stuff, so I can do a Liza Minnelli impression. I don’t have tap shoes any more, but if I’m feeling spicy and I’ve got shoes that can clickety-clack, I will rip out my time steps. It’s not like a whole performance, it is just a little taste. It depends on how spicy I am, but it makes people giggle. I’m not the most graceful person by any means – in tap dancing, there’s a fine line between an elephant in a china closet and Fred Astaire.Sharon Van Etten & The Attachment Theory is out 7 February (Jagjaguwar)Explore more on these topicsMusic10 Chaotic QuestionsSharon Van EttenPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps it’s the sheer fact of not being at home, surrounded by to-do lists – but according to these sleep, design and health experts, there’s a science behind a good night’s sleep.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.From the size of your bed to the cotton of your sheets, to the clutter in your bedroom to the lighting in your bathroom, they share their tips and best buys for a great sleep, wherever you are.Find the temperature sweet spotThe Hilton hotel chain has enlisted Dr Rebecca Robbins, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard medical school and associate scientist at Brigham and Women’s hospital, to help improve the sleep of its guests. An overheated room can interrupt deep sleep cycles as the body wakes to regulate temperature, so Robbins advises a strict temperature range of 18C to 20C at turndown: “We call this the ‘thermal neutral zone’ within which a person is not likely to sweat if they are too hot or shiver if they are too cold.”View image in fullscreenSize really does matter: the bigger the bed, the better, as in this Hilton hotel roomMake space for sleepOne reason hotel beds are so comfy is their generous size, says Sarah Smith, CEO of Soak &Sleep, which supplies bedding and linen to boutique hotels as well as consumers. She cites research by the National Bed Federation, which found two adults sharing a double bed (135 x 190cm) have the same sleeping space in relative terms as a single baby in a cot. “A superking (180 x 200cm) is essentially the size of two singles – that is the space two individuals should really be sleeping in.”Smith adds that a lot of hotels usezip and linkmattresses (two single mattresses joined together, which can be separated to make twin beds) for practical reasons, but they also make the bed more comfortable because “each side has its own separate spring unit, so when you roll over you don’t disturb the person next to you”.Dim the lightsAt Premier Inn, corridors leading to rooms are lit with soft pools of light as “research suggests peoplebehave more calmlythan if it is brightly lit, and make less noise”, says the hotel chain’s head of product, Sarah Simpson. At the sleep-focused Zedwell hotel in Piccadilly Circus, guests enter the lobby from the street through a dark “transitional corridor”, designed to relax you after a day in the city. “We call it quiet design,” says the company’s head of hotels, Halima Aziz. “The idea is to encourage people to be calm by creating this hushed environment.”A spring-based mattress is best – and don’t forget the topperFor spinal alignment, temperature regulation and overall comfort, the best option is a spring-based mattress, says Simpson. Robbins agrees because, unlike a foam structure, “the metal coils provide tremendous support while allowing for airflow”.All good hotels also use mattress toppers, Simpson says. “The right one won’t disguise the mattress, but will add an extra layer of comfort.” Premier Inn uses toppers with a gel-infused layer designed to cocoon the body while “wicking away moisture” to keep you cool, says Simpson, while beds at the five-star Six Senses hotels have extra-thick organictoppershandmade in Devon using cashmere and wool, both of which have natural temperature-regulating properties.View image in fullscreenPrevent light leakage by hiding curtain tracks behind a pelmet, like these at the Hyde London City hotelLayer up your windowsHotels use curtains to block light, muffle sound and make the room feel like a refuge from the outside world, says interior designer Ali Childs, who designed rooms at the chic Devon B&BGlebe House. To replicate this at home, introduce as many layers of window dressing as you can afford, ideally “a sheer curtain for privacy, a roman blind to block light and a pair of full-length curtains over the top”, says Childs.Tom Thorogood, the co-head of interiors at hospitality design specialistsStudio Moren, says that on all hotel projects (most recently Hyde London City) he specifies curtain tracks either recessed directly into the ceiling (so the top of the curtains sit flush with it) or hidden behind a pelmet, which is then Velcroed to the walls to prevent light leakage. Another detail is ensuring curtains overlap when they are drawn – installing acurtain trackwith an overlap arm will achieve this at home.Much of that ‘aaah’ feeling when you slip into a hotel bed is down to the pressed linenIf you can afford it, buy Egyptian cotton“The fibres are naturally longer so can be spun into a finer yarn, creating a softer piece of linen,” says Smith. For hotel-style bedding that balances durability with softness, she recommends 400-thread-count sheets with a sateen finish. “A sateen weave (as opposed to a percale) has a lot more yarn sitting on the face of the linen so it feels really soft; there is a lustre to it.” Ironing your sheets makes a difference, too. “Much of that ‘aaah’ feeling when you slip into a hotel bed is down to the pressed linen,” she adds.Add a flat sheetAnother hotel trick is to layer an additional sheet underneath the duvet, which is folded over the top and tucked in under the mattress to create a “pocket” for you to slip into. Smith says the impact of this is partly psychological: “It makes the bed look opulent. Before you’ve even got in, you feel it’s going to be a nice experience.”Match the pillow to your sleeping positionPillow menus exist because there is no one-size-fits‑all pillow, says Robbins. Stomach sleepers (lying face down) will need very little support. “We recommend they sleep with hardly anything,” she says. Back sleepers need a pillow that supports their neck without lifting their head too high, while side sleepers should opt for a generous pillow that elevates the head so it aligns with the spinal column.Streamline the middle-of-the-night loo tripAmanda Al-Masri, VP of Wellness at Hilton, says the addition of low-level motion-sensor lighting in rooms means guests don’t have to switch on the main bathroom light at night. Trymotion-activated under-bed lightsfor something similar.And Childs likes to add a generous rug around the bed so guests’ feet touch something soft when they get in and out.View image in fullscreenA large fabric headboard at Glebe House in DevonGet a large fabric headboardFor the signature “heavenly bed” atthe Westin London City, Studio Moren designed overscaled fabric headboards to help muffle sound and make guests feel cocooned, says the design firm’s associate Ed Murray. “We would always suggest a fabric headboard in a hotel room, even on top of timber panelling, and a rug or fitted carpet, as they help control reverberation.”The same design trick is used in luxury air travel to help guests nod off, saysPriestmanGoodedirector Daniel MacInnes, who worked on first-class suites for Lufthansa and Qatar Airways. “Fabric padding in the area around the seat means you’ve got this soft wrap around you that stops you feeling like you’re in a plastic tub when you recline.” In Lufthansa’s first-class cabin, the “whole suite is wrapped in material so there are very few hard surfaces, and curtains in the entry muffle sound from outside”.View image in fullscreenThis Lufthansa first-class cabin is surrounded by fabric panellingTry bamboo pyjamasSix Senses hotels have asleep wellness programmethat offers guests pyjamas made from bamboo, which helps keep the body cool at night. “The material is naturally breathable, hypoallergenic, and maintains a temperature three degrees cooler than cotton, making it ideal for sensitive skin and comfortable sleep,” says the hotel group’s wellness pioneer, Anna Bjurstam. TryNightirefor organic bamboo sleepwear.From nightcaps to nightmares: the many ways alcohol disrupts your sleepRead moreAvoid bare lightbulbs“I don’t ever like to see a bare bulb in a hotel room,” says Childs, who advises that task lighting (such as spotlights) should be kept to the bathroom or dressing areas, with lamplight around the bed. She also avoids hard glass or metal pendants in the sleeping area, which can interrupt the feeling of softness. The latest Premier Inn room design has removed ceiling spotlights altogether in favour of LED uplights around the headboard, which bathe the ceiling in a warm glow. These “wash lights” are also used by airlines in business and first-class sections to give footwells and aisles a calm, ambient light that doesn’t disturb rest. “The effect is far more intimate and subdued than direct lighting,” says MacInnes.Some LED lightbulbs produce a lot of blue daylight spectrum light, which can interrupt bedtime by suppressing the release of the sleep hormone melatonin. For this reason, Larry Traxler, senior VP of design at Hilton, recommends “choosing warmer red or yellow bulbs at the bedside at 2400 Kelvin colour temperature, which is closer to candlelight”.Bathe (or shower) before bedHotel rooms with standalone tubs that encourage you to have a pre-bedtime soak can also help you drop off faster, says Robbins. “There is a decline in core body temperature at sleep onset, so a warm bath or shower before entering the cooler bedroom environment can accelerate this.”We try to minimise anything distracting. Controversially, that includes removing televisionsLull yourself to sleep with soundChenot Palace Weggis in Switzerland has a sleep cycles programme where guests check into “sleep rooms” with walls coated in noise-absorbing fibreglass, and a sequence of sounds is played at a frequency of 5Hz. These “binaural beats” (sound in the 5-8Hz range) promote relaxation and calmness, helping the brain transition into deeper sleep, says the Chenot group’s chief operating and science officer, Dr George Gaitanos. ThemyNoise apphas a range of customisable binaural beats that support sleep.Get a pre-bed hit of bergamotMost hotels avoid a standard in-room fragrance as it can be divisive, says Al-Masri, but common areas are often scented to promote relaxation. The Zedwell hotel lobby smells of lavender,bergamotand ylang-ylang, as studies show all three support a good night’s sleep. Rather than filling your bedroom with fragrance, Robbins recommends massaging a small amount of sleep-focused aromatherapy oil into your temples before bed.View image in fullscreenGuests sleep in clutter‑free, oak-lined ‘cocoons’ at Zedwell Piccadilly Circus hotelPhotograph: Iana IanakievaReduce visual clutter“Just 10 years ago, you’d walk into a hotel room and there would be paper and stuff everywhere,” says Al-Masri. “We try to minimise that now.” With research showing a cluttered bedroom has animpact on sleep quality, zoning the dressing and sleeping areas like a hotel room can create a more restful environment. At the Zedwell hotel the rooms designed byNeri&Hufollow a simple Japanese aesthetic, with beds positioned in bare, oak-lined “cocoons” so there is nothing in your eyeline when you nod off. “We’ve tried to strip back anything that could distract you from sleep. Controversially, that includes getting rid of TVs,” says Aziz.Explore more on these topicsSleepHealth & wellbeingHotelsHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The fabled diary (probably a Surface Pro now) has snapped back open. The cigarettes are doubtless replaced by a Vaporesso vape.The new film,Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, again starring Renée Zellweger, is being released into cine­mas on Valentine’s day, which feels appropriate. One of the most emotionally charged days of the year for the return of one ofBritain’s more emotionally charged exports.In the new and fourth film, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) has been killed off in a landmine accident in Sudan (though he could be glimpsed in flashback). The dastardly Daniel Cleaver, played by Hugh Grant, returns (he was awol in the third, 2016, film,Bridget Jones’s Baby). Bridget has two new love interests. One, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, is her son’s teacher (I sense a Darcy proxy). There’s alsoLeo Woodallas a younger man from a dating app. An age gap loosely tying in with the ­cinematic trend for older women with younger men: Nicole Kidman inBabygirl, Anne Hathaway inThe Idea of You, and now Bridget with her Tinder squeeze.View image in fullscreenBridget, living her fantasy with Daniel Cleaver, played by Hugh Grant, in the 2001 Bridget Jones’s Diary.Photograph: AllstarStill, noteveryoneis mad about Bridget in the positive sense. For her fans, she’s the ultimate everywoman: messy, relatable, floating along on a tide of mid-price chardonnay. For others, she’s to blame for all the ills that have ever befallen modern womankind. And now? Do people love Bridget? Despair of her? Or is it that we demand too much of her? As we welcome back Bridget Jones, is it time to get off her case?Never mind her hapless ­demeanour and signature big pants, Bridget Jones is also huge global business. It’s a foundational UK cultural franchise – one of the most successful, and both female-led and female-facing. The first film,Bridget Jones’s Diary,grossed $280m. It has longevity, too. It’s 30 years sinceHelen Fielding­created Bridget Jones’s diary for a column in theIndependentnewspaper, 29 years since the first book and it’s still selling.If “bums on seats” is the ­metric, there’s a core, enduring ­fondness for Bridget Jones that extends to the cast.When I interviewed Zellwegerfor the release of her 2019 Judy Garland biopic,Judy, she was clearly keen to revisit the character (“I do know that Helen has written another book, so maybe …”) . Zellweger has now said she hopes it’s not, as billed, the final film.Just like that other 90s phenomenon, Oasis,Bridget also has a freshly minted Gen Z following. They seem to enjoy all the gags, ­observations, digs (“smug marrieds”, ­“fuckwittage”). Maybe more ­surprisingly, they also relish Jones’s chaotic honesty regarding her love life, smoking and calorie counting.Still, some criticisms against Bridget haven’t been without foundation. In retrospect, did Zellweger putting on weight,Raging Bull-style (so that Bridget could lament about it), result in a hyper-successful body-shaming franchise? In the films, the very concept of single life in London – indeed, London itself – looked sanitised, verging on steam-cleaned.Then there was Bridget’s promotion of dementedly frothy and frivolous womanhood (subliminal message: leave the thinking to the chaps!).View image in fullscreenBridget and another love interest, her son’s teacher Mr Wallaker, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, in the new film.Photograph: Photo Credit: Jay Maidment/Universal PicturesExhibit A in the case against Bridget Jones was her ­submissiveness around men. The ditzy drooping in adorable pyjama bottoms. Her glee when ­pursued by the amusing but wolfish, quasi-predatory, toxic romcom cad Cleaver. Though some of us had more issues with wet-blanket Darcy (was he supposed to be all women could really cope with?). Was Bridget the ultimate Pick Me girl? Was the whole concept Very PoorFeminism?By the time ofthe third film, in 2016,the concept of “Bridget Jones” itself seemed dated, worn, out of step. A creation not up to the task of manhunting in the app-heavy/online porn-ravaged grim new ­reality. Was Bridget Jones still ­everywoman or more of a dating woes dinosaur?Richard Curtis has nowapologised for the body-shaming and lack of diversity in the first two Bridget movies– as well as in some of his other films. Elsewhere, Grant has spoken about intervening in the new script about how Cleaver would be portrayed, which sounds wise. Post #MeToo, what amounts to office sexual harassment by Cleaver in the first films was never going to fly today, nor was Bridget lapping up any alpha male attention she could get.While it may be a stretch to imagine Bridget cooking crystal meth in her kitchen, director Michael Morris could herald a toughening of toneThere have been other significant changes in the Bridget camp. The new director is Michael Morris, who madeTo Leslie(the defiantly abrasive film ­starring Andrea Riseborough as a ­single mother who wins the lottery). Morris also worked on theBreaking Badspin-offBetter Call Saul.While it may be a stretch to imagine Bridget cooking up crystal meth in her bijou London kitchen, it could herald some toughening of tone. Moreover, the book that the new film is based on was a more poignant offering from Fielding (who had the experience of her own partner’s death, in 2016, to draw on).View image in fullscreenHelen Fielding at the world premiere of Mad About the Boy in Leicester Square, London, last week.Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImageIn truth, Bridget Jones needs to have changed. She isn’t just single this time round – she has to be older (in her early 50s). Singledom itself has changed, leastways the female mortal dread of it. Even in jest, it can’t be portrayed as some existential sinkhole of broken dreams. According to some reports, modern women are happier (and less fearful) than men about being single.Nevertheless, the key ­question remains: why is Bridget Jones almost uniquely held to account for sins against modern womankind? One might wonder at the pressure for her to “represent”. Is the idea of her being a good or bad role model somewhat reductive in itself? Male movie characters from the same early noughties era, such asAmerican Pie’s Stifler or Jason Bourne, never felt such heat.Put into perspective, Bridget’s weight obsession seems less a kind of unilateral feminist faux pas than part of a wider cultural ­framing, from the same comic annexe of British culture that produced “Does my bum look big in this?”.Similarly, romcom storylines ­continue to proliferate in everything fromBridgertontoOne Day(which Woodall also starred in). Certainly, the ongoing Bridget-bashing seems odd in a climate where the ­adaptation of Jilly Cooper’s naughty 80s-eraRivalsis widely celebrated. EvenSex and the Citygets off rela­tively lightly when you consider that Carrie Bradshaw’s entire ­character profile was moping about in nice shoes, waiting for Big to commit to her.Isn’t it time to ask: why are we specifically hard on Bridget Jones? Did she let us down? Did we somehow expect more from her? All these years later, is it all just a tad hypocritical?Fielding has said of her ­creation: “With Bridget, it was about the gap between how you feel you’re expected to be and how you ­actually are”. Quite. In some ways, it’s as if Bridget has been dragged into the realms of documentary (to be held accountable), instead of being accepted as a fictional character.We’ve forgotten that Fielding intended to lampoon how women were perceived to be, with a ­pastiche of inner dialogue. That Bridget was envisioned not merely as a ­manifestation of female faults, but also a shrug about them.Is this why Gen Z has taken to Bridget? Perhaps reading the old books and watching the films, her moans (Men! Weight!) seem almost radical now. This, after all, is the generation forced to doom-scroll, “ghost” and “breadcrumb” through their own problematic romantic realities, and only be strong about it.Young women know what it’s like to be constantly expected to be “filtered”. Say what you like about Bridget Jones, but she’s been ­anything but that.Explore more on these topicsBridget Jones' DiaryThe ObserverWomen (Society)FeminismBridget Jones's BabyBridget Jones: the Edge of ReasonHelen FieldingWomen (Life and style)featuresShareReuse this content"

I was working as an editor on an anthology of short stories when a piece by Sam came across my desk. We emailed back and forth for a while, working on the story, but I never met him in person.A few months later, I was out in town with some friends and noticed he was there. While we’d never crossed paths in real life, I knew what he looked like. In my fairly inebriated state I decided a great way to introduce myself would be to walk up to him and start reciting excerpts of his story. I don’t know what I was trying to achieve, but I made an impression and he was obviously flattered.At the end of the night he sort of just hopped in my cab and followed me homeWe started chatting and at the end of the night he sort of just hopped in my cab and followed me home. It wasn’t creepy at all but I definitely wasn’t letting him come in. We chatted outside my place for hours and when I called it a night he asked for my number.After that we started hanging out; it wasn’t serious and as I understood it he was planning to relocate to Europe in the coming months. As the weeks rolled by I eventually asked him about his trip and he told me he wasn’t going. I thought, “OK, this guy must like me.” After about a year of casual dating I put some pressure on and told him to have a think about how serious he was, because I didn’t want to get any deeper if he didn’t feel as strongly as I did.After a few days he came back, declared we were on to a good thing and asked if I wanted us to live together. I was still testing the waters, so I agreed on the condition he move in with me and my brother into the tiny flat we shared. I figured if he could handle that, this relationship might actually work out.The moment I knew: he gave the homeless man his number in case he needed someone to talk toRead moreBy 2006 Sam had proposed and we took off for Europe together on an extended adventure – sort of a trial marriage before real life set in. It was about 10 weeks into the trip and we’d been spending an extreme amount of time one on one. We had been travelling through Italy and Germany, I’d hardly spoken to anyone but him for a month and I was homesick. On a long, cross-country bus ride I finally cracked. I told him I wasn’t sure if I could keep spending so much time with just one other person.Without missing a beat he said, “That’s fine, I can be whoever you want me to be”, and promptly launched into the most ridiculous impersonation of his very ocker Aussie cousin Ben, who I’m very fond of. He was hamming up the accent, doing all the mannerisms and just having a lot of fun with it. He went on for about 10 minutes without breaking character.View image in fullscreenSam and Melanie Kinsman on the Yorke Peninsula, South Australia in 2024As he made a total show of himself on this bus just to put a smile on my face and ease my worries, I finally let my guard down. I knew I could trust this person to do whatever it takes for us and that he’d always approach life’s hiccups with good humour and creativity. I didn’t have to test him any more.One person can never be, and should never feel as though they have to be, your whole world. Of course he couldn’t be everything and everyone; but as he pretended to be someone else just to make me laugh, I knew it really was him who meant the most to me.Tell us the moment you knewDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

Thouusands of years of evolution and desire, of empathy and curiosity, hardwire us to stare. The sight is visceral, electrifying, irresistible. It is familiar and forbidden; innocence and sin. The naked body is there in the bathroom mirror every morning, but to see another always feels like stumbling on a secret. A salt-twist of narcissism heightens our emotions, so that looking at a nude feels very different from admiring a watercolour landscape. Ethics come into it. In the history of portraiture, it is the nudes that are the most honest, or the most exploitative – or sometimes both.Photographs are part of the fabric of everyday life for all of us, in a way charcoal sketches or oil paintings are not. So when a nude is not a sketch or a painting but a photograph, the intensity ratchets up. The polite distance of the art gallery experience is stripped away, leaving gut reaction and raw emotion. All of which is to say: nothing like a nude photograph to get you by the jugular.At any given moment in culture, the bodies we see around us reflect the thoughts that are in our heads. Fertility, in early art. The heroism and physical prowess of the male body, in the classical era. An obsession with a narrow definition of womanly beauty, as gender roles diverged. The body means something new in every era. Nudity is not as simple as it looks.And above and beyond all of this, the body is beautiful. In Richard Avedon’s 1961 portrait ofRudolf Nureyev, the fine-boned delicacy of his ribs is breathtaking next to the gnarled sinews of his haunches. The sweet grace of his arms tells the story of how he changed dance by copying the gestures of female ballet dancers. The determined jut of his chin seems to hint at the story of his defection from the Soviet Union, just a month before this portrait. His lush nakedness surely foretells the sexual revolution that is about to spring into action. No wonder this was the man on whom Mick Jagger is said to have modelled his iconic frontman prance.The body is politicised terrain. Gender and race are laid bare. Pornography looks over your shoulder, while you lookThe body is politicised terrain. Gender and race are laid bare. Pornography looks over your shoulder, while you look. The history of nude photography – particularly portraits of naked women, taken by (presumably fully dressed) men – is the history of objectification. Jean-Paul Goude’s portrait of Kim Kardashian is an artefact of a changing hierachy of female beauty, in its unabashed celebration of her bottom. A giant peach at the dead centre of the shot, it is the bullseye on which the studio lights are trained. This is the photograph that will show future generations that bottoms were to the early 21st century what breasts were to the late 20th. But there is so much more going on besides. An echo ofMan Ray’s 1924 image Le Violon d’Ingres, a rear view of model Kiki de Montparnasse, sound holes painted on her back turning her body into a violin. But while de Montparnasse gazes impassively away, Kardashian makes eye contact with the camera. Trappings of her wealth and status – diamonds, champagne, opera gloves – emphasise her agency, in the billion-dollar empire she has built on this body.These photographs trace the parameters of what is beautiful and what is ugly, what is normal and what is strange, what is acceptable and what must be hidden. Born in 1811, conjoined twins Chang and Eng Bunker were exploited as a circus act for much of their lives, paraded for shock value. In the portrait here we see them smartly dressed, meeting our gaze proud and unruffled. We are invited to see them not as freaks but as equals. A century and a half later, model Winnie Harlow, who has depigmentation from vitiligo, challenges us again to rethink what we expect to see on a glossy Vogue cover. Nadav Kander’s portrait of actor Adam Pearson, whose face is distinctively shaped by the benign tumours caused by neurofibromatosis, is deliberately simplistic in its composition. A peaceable stillness interrogates any instinct to look away.‘There are images no leader ever wants to be seen’: 33 pivotal US presidential moments captured on cameraRead moreSometimes, looking at the body takes place within the frame. Haley Morris-Cafiero’s self-portraits, Wait Watchers, are a snapshot not of her body size but of society’s judgment of it. The artist stands to the right of this photo, staring at us, while the beautiful young couple to the left seem to be staring at her. The empty space in the middle of the frame asks us to pick a side. Elliott Erwitt’s photograph ofArnold Schwarzeneggerdraws you in with those giant muscles. Then you notice another audience, who got there before you. Hundreds of faces are tilted up to the podium, transfixed into stillness, as if Arnie has just stepped out of a spaceship, or a time machine from the future.The human body is a breathtaking machine of mind-boggling complexity and heart-stopping resilience. We are awestruck by the tiny “Benetton baby”, captured by Oliviero Toscani, umbilical cord intact and already bellowing with fury. Joe McNally’s portrait of Phan Thi Kim Phuc and her baby is a historical record of her napalm injuries, but the trust and tenderness in their closed eyes, skin-on-skin cuddle transforms it into a story not of war and violence, but of peace and love. Body language can be tragedy, drama, romance – even comedy, as in Aleksei Goloborodko, the most flexible man in the world, juxtaposing his unique contortion skills with the market-stall familiarity of his Nirvana hoodie.These photographs show us our bodies as we have never seen them before. Edward Weston’s captures a transcendental elegance in his lover Charis, as she dips her face from view like a resting swan tucking its head beneath a wing. The late Ren Hang, whose nude portraits of queer Chinese youth challenged government censors, lines up a mountain range of undulating bottoms. Arno Rafael Minkkinen’s self-portrait, pale limbs sandwiched between those of a silver birch, has a mischievous otherworldliness. It is as if you could step inside the frame, and into a magical world. There is nothing like an image of a body to expand your mind.Picture captions by Hannah J Davies and Gabrielle SchwarzLe Violon d’Ingres, 1924By Man RayView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Man Ray 2015 Trust/DACS, London 2025When the artist Man Ray photographed the back of his model and lover Kiki de Montparnasse, then layered a violin’s f-shaped holes over the print, it became one of surrealism’s defining images – and sparked debate about the power dynamics between artist and muse, and objectification of the female body. In 2022, it sold for £9.8m at auction – the most for any photograph in history – and a century later, people still get tattoos of the marks in homage.Generation Wealth, 1998By Lauren GreenfieldView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Lauren Greenfield/InstituteHer photography and films may have explored extreme wealth, society, body image and how they come together in a poisonous cocktail of self-interest and envy, but Lauren Greenfield retains a nuance and empathy even when examining the most rarefied members of society. In her 2018 documentary Generation Wealth, she met people before and after plastic surgery, among them Sydelle, who had a facelift in 1998 and is shown recovering after the procedure, with raw, peeling skin. Sydelle told Greenfield, “When I was in my 20s, people would always ask if I was a model. And then it got to, ‘Did you model?’ in the past tense. Now they don’t even ask me that. In American culture, unless you’re young, thin and beautiful, you’re discarded.”HJDWinnie Harlow for Vogue Netherlands, 2023By Nikki EsserView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nikki EsserThe past decade has seen a shake-up in the world of fashion, with the biggest magazine of all showcasing more diversity than ever. In 2023, Canadian supermodel Winnie Harlow, who has the skin condition vitiligo, graced the cover of Vogue’s Dutch edition in this shoot by Nikki Esser. In the interview inside, Harlow said, “I’m starting to see more models with vitiligo, I think that’s so beautiful. When I was little, I felt like I was the only person in the world with it.”HJDKim Kardashian breaks the internet, 2014ByJean-Paul GoudeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Jean-Paul GoudeThe day after Kim Kardashian appeared bare-bummed on the cover of Paper with the headline BREAK THE INTERNET in 2014, the magazine’s website accounted for nearly 1% of all online browsing in the US. In another image from the shoot, she pops champagne with a coupe glass balanced on her behind, flaunting the “slim thick” beauty standard (tiny waist, big bottom) Kardashian and her sisters popularised in the 2010s. The images sparked memes, outrage and imitations, as well as serious considerations about the look’s racial history.The champagne photo is a re-creation of Jean-Paul Goude’scontroversial Carolina Beaumont imagefrom 1976. The internet may not have been broken, but it was shaken.GSRudolf Nureyev, Paris, July 25, 1961By Richard AvedonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Richard Avedon © The Richard Avedon Foundation/National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian InstitutionRichard Avedon took this portrait of Rudolf Nureyev in Paris in July 1961, a month after the ballet superstar defected from the Soviet Union while on tour with the Kirov company. Nureyev transformed the role of the male dancer in ballet, advancing a physique and technical standard closer to what was expected of female dancers at the time – and assuming centre stage in the process. Here, Avedon’s trademark sparse white background ensures all the focus is on Nureyev’s gravity-defying pose.GSAdam Pearson, 2024By Nadav KanderView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nadav KanderFormer TV researcher Adam Pearson got his big break as an actor in the 2013 film Under the Skin. His facial condition – attributed to neurofibromatosis, which causes non-cancerous tumours to grow along nerves – was a key plot point, creating a moment of connection between a human character, played by Pearson, and Scarlett Johansson’s alien protagonist. His most recent film, A Different Man, saw him act opposite Sebastian Stan and continue to challenge ideas around image and prejudice. In this portrait by Nadav Kander, Pearson is rendered in an almost painterly, old master fashion. “I often say my disability is the least interesting thing about me,”he told the Guardian recently. “Don’t get me wrong, it’s still pretty goddamn interesting. But there’s more to me than that.”HJDNude (Charis, Santa Monica), 1936By Edward WestonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © 1981 Center for Creative Photography, Arizona Board of RegentsArt critic Hilton Kramer wrote that for modernist photography pioneer Edward Weston, the body was a “revelation of forms both voluptuous and abstract”. Here, his assistant (later wife) Charis Wilson is seen as a kind of sculpture. “When I ducked my head to avoid the bright light,” she later recalled, “Edward said, ‘Just keep it that way.’”GSUntitled, 2012By Ren HangView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Ren Hang (‘Wild’), Posterbook ed by OstLicht Wien, die Nacht Publishing 2015“China doesn’t allow outdoor nudity,” Ren Hang once said. “I’m careful taking pictures outside. If I see police, I’ll run. But I’m not hiding.” The self-taught photographer regularly ran into trouble in Beijing for his erotically charged images of naked figures arranged in striking and surreal poses. He nearly always used friends as models – often queer Chinese youths – giving precise instructions, then snapping with a simple point-and-shoot camera. Sometimes the subject appears in nature or the city; other times – as in this sea of bums – inside. In Hang’s photos, curator Nathalie Herschdorfer writes in Body: ThePhotographyBook, “bodies are mingled in a playful and sensual way” through creative composition.GSUntitled, 1999By Alison LapperView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alison LapperShe is perhaps best known as the subject of Marc Quinn’s 3.6m-tall marble sculpture, created while she was pregnant with her late son Parys, which sat atop the fourth plinth in London’s Trafalgar Square from 2005 to 2007. But Alison Lapper’s own contributions as an artist – including a first class honours degree in fine art and an MBE for her services to art – should not be overlooked. Having noticed physical similarities between her own body and the ancient Greek statue the Venus de Milo, Lapper – who was born with shortened legs, and without arms – has represented herself in sculptures, photographs, drawings and digital images. In this triptych of self-portraits, the artist, who overcame child cruelty and later suffered domestic abuse, is shown first defiantly staring down the camera, then gazing away mysteriously and finally, with her back turned fully to the camera, withdrawing herself from view.HJDOscar Pistorius on the cover of Time, 2013By Pieter HugoView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pieter Hugo/Time MagazineRarely has a fall from grace been as shocking as that of trailblazing Paralympian Oscar Pistorius, jailed in 2014 for killing his girlfriendReeva Steenkamp. The Time cover image, taken by Pieter Hugo for the New York Times, was to become one of the last pictures of Pistorius as we knew him: during his trial, he removed his famous “blades”, highlighting what his defence described as his vulnerability when he fired at Steenkamp, whom he claimed to have mistaken for an intruder.HJDSunscreen, 2014By Haley Morris-CafieroView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Haley Morris-Cafiero“It was almost scientific and clinical – I call them mundane performances.” So says Haley Morris-Cafiero of her Wait Watchers series, which saw the photographer and academic set up her camera in crowded locations – among them Florida’s Ormond Beach – to capture herself (on the right here) and the looks of passersby. As for what was really going through their heads, Morris-Cafiero says she “can’t speculate … But the images I chose capture those open-ended moments. There were other images where people were obviously making fun of me, and those were not nearly as interesting because you know what’s happening.” Her images went viral and became “one of the catalysts for a body image conversation, which is wonderful”.HJDNew Born Baby (Giusy), 1991By Oliviero ToscaniView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Oliviero Toscani 1991“Why would you want to see clothes in an advert? If you want to see the clothes you can see them in our shops.” This irreverent statement sets out the logic behind the controversial ad campaigns Oliviero Toscani masterminded during his tenures as art director of Benetton, from 1982 to 2000 and 2017 to 2020. For Toscani, who died last month, advertising was about grabbing people’s attention: his best-known campaign images included a man dying of Aids, a priest and a nun kissing, and two horses copulating. He argued that his work also put important social issues in the spotlight but, unsurprisingly, the ads drew criticism for their insensitivity. This raw image of a newborn girl named Giusy, with the umbilical cord attached, is among Toscani’s most censored images.GSProperty of Jo Spence?, 1982By Jo SpenceView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jo Spence Memorial Archive, The Image Centre, courtesy of Richard Saltoun GalleryBritish activist, writer and photographer Jo Spence was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1982. She began documenting her illness and treatment in a four-year series entitled The Picture of Health. This was not just a way to process her experience but also a “research project on the politics of cancer” – challenging the hierarchies of the medical establishment and shifting power back to the patient. Doctors had told Spence she needed a full mastectomy to remove the cancer but, after extensive research, she insisted on a lumpectomy, and took this self-portrait while preparing for it. The uncertainty of the words scrawled over her left breast alludes to the traumatic ordeal of being “marked up for amputation” by doctors. Spence described the image as “a pre-operative talisman to remind myself I had some rights over my own body”.GSVäisälänsaari, Finland, 1998By Arno Rafael MinkkinenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Arno Rafael Minkkinen, courtesy of Persons Projects and The Helsinki SchoolThe Finnish American photographer Arno Rafael Minkkinen has been taking his nude self-portraits in nature for more than half a century. This image of him squeezed between birch trees in Finland exemplifies his decades-long project of merging his body with the natural world. “The idea of slipping between these two dalmatian dudes”, as he calls the trees, wasto show “we are basically equal in the visual camp of things. We are just like the trees that grow, thrive and eventually tip over back into the earth or lakes.”GSThe original conjoined twins, 1865Photographer unknownView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Blank Archives/Getty ImagesBorn to Chinese heritage parents in 1811 in Siam (now Thailand), Chang and Eng Bunker were joined at their sternum and via fused livers. They were brought to the US as a circus act and went on to settle in North Carolina and marry sisters with whom they fathered 21 children. They died aged 62, hours apart. The siblings are shown here in their later years, finely dressed but looking serious. Their biographer, Yunte Huang, says, “In early photography, people worried that the more pictures you took, the more of your soul you were going to lose, so you wouldn’t smile.”HJDSonam, 2023By Steph WilsonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Steph WilsonWhat does a mother look like? That is the question driving photographer Steph Wilson’s ongoing Ideal Mother project, and it prompted wig-maker and hair artist Sonam to suggest wearing a prosthetic moustache modelled on her father’s from the 1970s. She also chose to wear a bindi in homage to the culture of her motherland. The image, with its playful mix of masculine and feminine elements, won the 2024Taylor Wessing photographic portrait prize– and a negative public response that took Wilson aback. “The policing of motherhood seemed to be more of an issue than I’d first understood,” she says.GSThe most flexible man in the world, 2018By Heidi’s BridgeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Heidi’s Bridge/Condé NastRussian-born Aleksei Goloborodko, a contortionist with Cirque du Soleil’s Luzia show, has been dubbed the most flexible man in the world. Goloborodko – seen here in an image originally published in GQ magazine – began contorting his body at the age of four, and dreamed of joiningCirque du Soleilfrom the age of eight, when he first auditioned for the company in Moscow. The 30-year-old trains for five or six hours a day, comprehensively stretching his body before he begins. His act elicits different reactions. “Sometimes audiences are scared, sometimes impressed, and sometimes they have no words,” Goloborodko said in a video filmed by the circus producer. “To see people think it’s a miracle, that’s the biggest motivation I can get.”HJDTwo Men Fencing, 1887By Eadweard MuybridgeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Eadward Muybridge, courtesy ofKingston Heritage Service, 2010In 1872, rail magnate Leland Stanford hired Eadweard Muybridge to find out if horses lift all four legs off the ground when they run (they do). Between 1883 and 1886, using multiple cameras with high shutter speeds, Muybridge made 100,000 further images of animals and humans moving in front of a precise grid. “History remembers him in fragments,”wrote Rebecca Solnit(also his biographer), “as a landscape photographer, as a technical innovator, as a key figure in the long march to motion pictures.”GSLisa Lyon, 1982By Robert MapplethorpeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation. Used by permissionLisa Lyon started weight-training after meeting Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1977. Two years later she became a minor celebrity when she won the first professional female bodybuilding championship. For Lyon, it wasn’t just about fitness, but “creating a new aesthetic and a new standard of beauty”. She wanted to appear neither masculine nor feminine but like “a sleek, feline animal”. Robert Mapplethorpe, known for his stylised black and white portraits, met Lyon at a party in 1979. “I had never seen a woman like that before. It was like looking at someone from another planet,” he said. Their collaboration resulted in 200 pictures in the next few years.GSSerena Williams in the Pirelli calendar, 2016By Annie LeibovitzView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Annie Leibovitz/© PirelliFor decades, the Pirelli calendar was known for its artful, risque images of supermodels. But in 2016 the Italian tyre company broke tradition, hiring Annie Leibovitz for a series of portraits celebrating women for their professional accomplishments. According to Leibovitz, this shot of tennis superstarSerena Williamswith her muscular frame on full view is “not a nude but a body study”. Williams herself is a vocal advocate for body positivity and diversity. As she once put it, “I love representing the beautiful dark women out there.”GSSydney 1 (Opera House), 2010By Spencer TunickView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Spencer Tunick,instagram.com/spencertunickHe began photographing people naked on the streets of New York at sunrise in 1992, and soon Spencer Tunick was staging mass nude shoots in public spaces around the world, winning fans including Lady Gaga. Here, 5,200 people gather on the steps of Sydney Opera House. Grouped together, the bodies lose their individuality. As one participant said, “It doesn’t feel sexual, it just feels tribal, a gathering of humanity.” Tunick’s goal is to challenge views of nudity and privacy. “Before I worked with groups outdoors, the only place to see nudes was old paintings, rock albums or tourist postcards,” he says.GSThe Pregnant Man, 2008By Kristian DowlingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kristian Dowling“I had seen them on Oprah and had all these preconceived ideas,” Kristian Dowling says of his first meeting with Thomas Beatie and his then wife Nancy. As a photographer for Getty Images, Dowling had pinballed straight from the Cannes film festival to the small city of Bend, Oregon. There, he would spend two weeks with the transgender dad-to-be, who was becoming a tabloid fixture in an era when positive trans representation was rare. But, to Dowling’s surprise, the “pregnant man” and Nancy were “just a normal couple, who desperately wanted a child … two people madly in love”.HJDThe man behind Body Worlds, 2003By Murdo MacLeodView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianGunther von Hagens was once described by the Guardian as having cultivated an image that is “part Dr Frankenstein and part Leonardo da Vinci”. The German anatomist, pictured opposite one of his creations, has preserved thousands of dead bodies by adding plastic polymers in place of fat and water. While they were initially made for medical teaching, public interest led him to show them at his wildly popularBody Worldsexhibitions, changing the way millions of people have viewed their own bodies. Perhaps unsurprisingly, von Hagens plans to undergo plastination when he dies.HJDUntitled, 1985By Rotimi Fani-KayodeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Rotimi Fani-Kayode, courtesy of Autograph, LondonThe late photographer came to Britain in 1966, aged 11, after his family fled the war in Nigeria. His trailblazing nude portraits capturing Black, queer life in 1980s London challenged the homophobia of Margaret Thatcher’s England during the Aids crisis. “Photography is the tool by which I feel most confident in expressing myself,” he wrote. “It is photography, therefore – Black, African, homosexual photography – which I must use not just as an instrument, but as a weapon if I am to resist attacks on my integrity and existence on my own terms.”HJDHumanae: Work in Progress, ongoingBy Angélica DassView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Angélica DassSkin colour is often summed up by racial categories such as “black” and “white”, but there is a much greater spectrum. Angélica Daas’s Humanae series takes that reality very seriously, matching subjects – 4,000 and counting, from all around the world, and from newborn babies to those nearing the end of their lives – to their exact Pantone colour equivalent. In a 2016 Ted Talk, the Black Brazilian photographer explained how combating racism had informed her work. “Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other,” she said, calling them a “mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label”.HJDSelf-Portrait (Back with Arms Above), 1984By John CoplansView image in fullscreenPhotograph: The John Coplans TrustA veteran of the second world war, British artist John Coplans spent much of his life in the US, where he lectured on design at the University of California, Berkeley, before going on to become one of the founding editors of the magazine Artforum, as well as a museum curator. In the 1980s he published books on photographers and began his own photographic experiments, which he called auto-portraits and created using a live-feedback video camera with an automatic shutter. In a 1990 interview, Coplans said, “The principal thing is the question of how our culture views age: that old is ugly … So I’m using my body and saying, even though it’s a 70-year-old body, I can make it extremely interesting.”HJDPhan Thi Kim Phuc with her son, 1995ByJoe McNallyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Joe McNally 2011Phan Thi Kim Phuc was just nine years old when she was depicted running naked from a napalm attack in South Vietnam, in a Pulitzer prize-winning photograph credited to Nick Ut and titled The Terror of War (the authorship of the photo hasrecently been disputed). Phuc, widely known as “napalm girl”, has gone on to become a Canadian citizen, Unesco goodwill ambassador and peace activist. Photographer Joe McNally got the opportunity to photograph her 23 years later and recalls, “I was very direct with her. I said, ‘Look, Kim, I have to see your scars. I have to see the damage that was done.’ And she understood.” There was, McNally says, a “wonderful happenstance” to the fact that Kim had just given birth to a baby, Thomas. “That little guy gave us the excuse to show a delicate moment between mother and son. He did us another huge favour by going to sleep immediately, so he just nestled on her shoulder.”HJDDiana Nyad, 2011ByCatherine OpieView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Catherine OpieIn 1978, aged 28, Diana Nyad tried what no one had done before: to swim from Cuba to Florida – 110 miles across treacherous open waters. She failed, but three decades later decided to try again. She finally made it – as documented in the 2023 biopic starring Annette Bening – in 2013, at 64, after several attempts. This photo was taken after her third, which she had to abort 90 miles in, thanks to jellyfish stings (the welts can be seen on her skin). Yet her expression, captured by photographer and friend Catherine Opie, remains resolute. As Opie says, “Growing older is not a death sentence. We are vibrant beings with incredible power.”GSArnold Schwarzenegger at the Whitney Museum, New York, 1976By Elliott ErwittView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Elliott Erwitt/Magnum PhotosThe expressions on the faces of the mostly male crowd veer from delight to bewilderment – and maybe jealousy – as they see the hulking future Terminator star up close. This image, taken by the photographer Elliott Erwitt in an exhibition titled Articulate Muscle: The Male Body in Art, shows Schwarzenegger at his iron-pumping peak, raising society’s expectations around male bodies and moving them on from the days when, as he revealed in his memoir/fitness guide Arnold, his growing physique had divided opinion among girls at his school. Some were attracted; others said his “repulsive” muscles gave them the creeps.HJDUntitled (Body of Dominick Didato), 1936By WeegeeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: International Center of Photography/Getty ImagesShocking as it may be today, the photographer Weegee, born Arthur Fellig, made his name in 1930s and 40s New York with grisly images of crime scenes – complete with their victims. Here, he captures the body of gangster Dominick Didato, slumped over on the pavement, his hat and gun strewn beside him. In Flash, his biography of Weegee, Christopher Bonanos said Weegee “was in the business of grabbing images that functioned as little one-act plays, both comedy and drama”, communicating “in a visual language both tabloid-reading subway commuters and arty museum curators grasped right away”.HJDHumanly Impossible, 1932By Herbert BayerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Herbert Bayer, Bridgeman Images © DACS 2025This playful self-portrait is part of a series of surrealist photomontages made by the Bauhaus-trained artist. Influenced by the New Vision photography movement, which espoused experimental image-making methods, Bayer blew up a print of himself holding a sponge in front of a mirror and painted over it to make it seem as if a slice had been removed from his arm. He then used an old-school airbrush before rephotographing the image twice – each step further hiding his handiwork. Today, of course, we all know there is little relationship between the bodies we see in photos and reality.GSThese 31 images show how the representation of bodies and society’s attitudes towards them have changed over the years.

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toNaomi Larsson PiñedaSat 1 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTShareEric, 76Violet is beautiful, she always has been, and as Miss Fifi she puts on sexy underwear, which really turns me onWhen Violet and I first got together almost 30 years ago, we had sex every night. That lasted for 12 years. We’d have sex in all kinds of different positions and she made it very exciting for me.Sex with her has always been absolutely fantastic, but about 10 years ago I started having difficulty getting hard. Due to my age, I’m now much less able to have an erection and I can’t ejaculate during intercourse. When you’re young, you don’t think about what’s going to happen when you’re an old man. It’s incredibly disappointing, and it makes me feel inadequate.We discussed using Viagra, but Violet was against it as the erections can last quite a long time. Still, she recognised what was happening and she has helped me a lot. To build my desire, she created a character: a very sexy woman called Miss Fifi.We have sex at least once a week now, and she uses her hands to make me ejaculateViolet is beautiful, she always has been, and as Miss Fifi she puts on sexy underwear which really turns me on. We also use prompt cards we got from a Valentine’s Day game which say things like “massage”, “romantic romp” and “long hug with optional bottom squeezing”, so we’ll put these on each other’s pillows to indicate what we want to do. I must admit it’s very helpful for me because I’ve always been a bit embarrassed talking about sex and asking her to do things in the bedroom. If she leaves the massage card on my pillow, that’s her telling me that she fancies having an orgasm. I know that afterwards she’ll probably want to go straight to sleep, so the following day she might do the same for me, give me a massage and give me an orgasm.We have sex at least once a week now, and she uses her hands to make me ejaculate. I can still have intercourse with her and it’s lovely, but I just can’t orgasm. I’ve always loved penetrative sex and feel incredibly close to her that way, so I do miss it. I don’t feel that using hands is as loving. But I know that she does all this for my sake, as I’ve always had a strong sex drive, whereas I suspect now she could probably take it or leave it. I’m so grateful to her for still wanting to please me.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

I said to myself: “You know what men really like, it’s down to you, girl.” So, on a particular meeting I took the initiative and just went down on him, and that was the beginning of it all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It was every day, sometimes more than once, but usually in the evenings as we both worked. You would expect it to wane over the years, but it never really did. Only in recent years when Eric has had difficulties due to his age have things started to change. Although the desire is very much still there for Eric, he gets frustrated that he can’t always do what’s required when he wants to.Sometimes I’ll go the whole hog and do the stockings, suspenders and high heelsSex is really high on Eric’s priority list whereas, as I get older, I need a bit more coaxing. Still, I would never turn him down. I would quite happily hang up my boots and not bother now, but I know that would be hugely frustrating for Eric. What bothers me is the impact that my waning desire might have on him, so I try to put that out of sight. And, of course, once we get started it’s no problem at all.Miss Fifi always wears very sexy underwear and behaves in an overtly sexy way, which is not usually my style. This has been the real spark that’s helped him through it. Miss Fifi is stimulating for both of us. It’s not just a question of wearing a sexy bra and pants, sometimes I’ll go the whole hog and do the stockings, suspenders and high heels. He really loves that. He’ll normally ask me if Miss Fifi is around tonight, and that’s an indication that we’ll have a bit of a romp at bedtime. Miss Fifi still prevails – I think our sex life has contributed to the length and happiness of our marriage.Explore more on these topicsSexThis is how we do itRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This isRSPB Geltsdale, and it will now be the organisation’s largest English bird sanctuary when the society announces this week that it has bought land that expands the existing reserve by a third.“This is going to be a reserve on a different scale from many of our other sites in England,” said Beccy Speight, the RSPB’s chief executive.“We are going to achieve an abundance of species and a size that will be unmatched for bird reserves elsewhere. It is going to demonstrate what is possible when it comes to rewilding and protecting birds.”Geltsdale is already home to birds that range from curlews to golden plovers and from merlins to ring ouzels. It is also one of the few places where hen harriers nest in England. Last year, hen harriers – one of Britain’s most persecuted raptors - produced eight chicks at Geltsdale.Elsewhere, the bird – sometimes known as the ghost of the moor – has been pushed close to extinction because of illegal killing and nest disturbance.Other birds that proliferate at Geltsdale include short-eared owls, black grouse, lapwing, redshank and snipe, and it is hoped that the reserve will soon attract a host of new species, including golden eagles.The RSPB’s already sizeable reserve at Geltsdale will now be expanded to cover 5,500 hectares (13,590 acres) thanks to the purchase of the new chunk of land for an undisclosed sum. “We started working here in the 1970s and ended up owning roughly two-thirds of the site, while we leased the other third,” said Dave Morris, the RSPB’s area operations manager for Cumbria and Northeast England.“Now we have purchased that last third and own all of Geltsdale, which will allow us to create a reserve that stretches from the valley floor to the top of Cold Fell, and which will be inhabited by birds that thrive in so many different habitats.”At the lowest levels, dippers and wildfowl – even osprey – are now making appearances. Then, further up the hillside, black grouse, nightjar and whinchat are becoming common. Nearer the top, on the open moorland, ring ouzels and hen harriers can be seen.View image in fullscreenThe area is one of the few places in England where hen harriers nest.Photograph: Pete Morris/RSPBThe reserve’s recently augmented size means that it is now only beaten, in terms of area of land covered, by two other RSPB sites:Forsinard FlowsandLoch Garten, Abernethy, both in the Highlands.“Geltsdale is now the biggest in England,” said Speight. “And that size makes such a difference. When you walk through the reserve during breeding season, it is incredible. The place just swarms with birdlife.”Crucially, the reserve includes a working farm, and much of the future rewilding work that will be carried out to create the multimillion pound restoration project that is planned for Geltsdale will involve developing ways for agriculture and nature to work together, added Morris. “That has to be a key goal,” he added.View image in fullscreenCurlews can be seen in Geltsdale.Photograph: Jake Stephen/RSPBAn example of the problems to be tackled is the issue of cattle grazing. “Cattle have traditionally been fenced in,” said Morris. “However, birds like black grouse will crash into these fences and kill themselves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion“So we have turned to technology for a solution: a system of invisible fencing is going to be installed.”This odd-sounding technique involves fitting cows and calves with collar receivers that can pick up GPS signals, which are then used to create virtual grazing areas for the animals. If one approaches the edge of its delineated area, its receiver detects the boundary and starts to emit a sound that rises in pitch or eventually delivers a mild electric pulse as the animal tries to cross the boundary. In this way, the animals are contained within a fixed area of land without the need to erect fences.“That’s how farmers will manage cattle in that landscape. It will allow them to move these unfenced areas and effectively emulate naturalistic grazing by wild, large herbivores,” said Morris.View image in fullscreenBlack grouse will be protected by a new way of allowing cattle to graze, avoiding dangerous fencing.Photograph: Andy Hay/RSPBIn addition to invisible fencing, the practice of heather burning has been halted. This was carried out on the old grouse shooting estates of Geltsdale in order to encourage new shoots to grow and provide food for the grouse. However, this practice released the carbon dioxide stored in the peatland below andhas been stopped.Similarly, moorland drains have been removed, which will let sphagnum moss – the building block of peat – to recover, a move that also helps to restore the area’s ability to store carbon dioxide and limit the rate at which the gas helps to heat the atmosphere.It is also planned to continue with work to restore streams whose courses have been channelled so that they follow more meandering courses, retaining water for longer periods so that fish can spawn more easily. This in turn will attract avian predators such as osprey.“I think Geltsdale is a real symbol of hope because it shows what the uplands could be like in terms of the abundance of birds and other species,” said Speight. “When you are in it, you get a real feeling of space, and a sense of how the uplands could be.”Explore more on these topicsRSPBThe ObserverWildlifeClimate crisisAnimalsBirdsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her story of a girl locked in a cage with 39 women in an underground bunker on a nameless world was published in 1995 then slid into obscurity.Something has changed since then, because the novel’s tale of sisterhood and survival has become one of the hottest reads this year, drawing comparisons to Margaret Atwood’sThe Handmaid’s Taleand Octavia E Butler’sParableseries of novels.IWHNKM, as it is known in hashtags on BookTok, the ­community of TikTok users who havemade ­reading cool again, is in such demand that bookshops in the US have ­struggled to keep it in stock.In the UK it has become “a bestselling staple of fiction sections across our bookshops”, according to Waterstones’ head of books, Bea Carvalho. Its publisher, Vintage, which reissued the novel in 2019, sold 45,000 copies last year, an elevenfold rise on 2022.The novel has also appeared on the must-read lists of Service95, a newsletter, book club and website set up by Dua Lipa, one of a growing group ofcelebrities in music and fashion using their clout to support literature.“It’s described as speculative fiction/sci-fi, but it’s quite desolate in its writing in a way I haven’t found with other books,” said Hali Brown, who runs the Books on the Bedside TikTok account with her sister Hana.View image in fullscreenBookTok reviewer Hali Brown.Photograph: @booksonthebedside/TikTokThe narrator is the youngest of 40 captives and too young to remember her past. “All the guards are men,” Brown said, “and that’s all the women know about gender. They never really understand why they are there or how long they would be kept for.” Or any sense of time at all.They may be on Earth. They may discover the reasons why they are there. They may find other people. Or they may not.“It’s quite bleak but incredibly ­powerful,” Brown added. “It was unbelievably gripping for something so desperate.”Rather like the questions posed by the post-apocalyptic novel, there are few clear answers to why it has become so successful. Harpman was a Belgian writer who died in 2012 aged 82. Her family fled to Casablanca during the second world war in fear of persecution for their Jewish roots.The novel’s translator, Ros Schwartz, said she was ­gobsmacked by the turnaround of the book’s fortunes. “I guess it just strikes a chord with the younger generation, which it didn’t at the time – and whether that’s to do with ­publicity or whether it’s completely random, I don’t know. That’s one of the wonderful things about publishing – you never know.”Brown lists the book’s qualities as being “accessibly written” and “not very long” (about 200 pages), as well as resonating with the modern ­political context of attacks on ­women’s rights and diversity at work.“There’s lots happening in terms of women feeling like things are going backwards and not really ­understanding why or how that’s able to happen,” she said. The ­politics of Harpman’s world are sparse, unlike other dystopian fiction such asThe Handmaid’s TaleorThe Hunger Games. “Its political understanding of the world, I think, is relatable to a lot of young women,” Brown added.Perhaps another reason for the book’s success second time round is that Schwartz revised her ­translation with the benefit of two decades’ more experience as a translator, with works including a fresh version of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’sThe Little Princeand honours such as becoming achevalierin the FrenchOrdre des Arts et des Lettres.Schwartz’s first attempt in the mid-90s used words that were often ­similar to their French counterparts. The effect of the more direct ­translation was to make the ­narrator seem too erudite for a young girl kept in a cage without education and no ability to read or write. “So I went through it and got rid of all the Latinate ­language. It was about ­finding the right voice for the ­narrator that didn’t make her sound over-­educated but without making her sound stupid or a caricature.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England were encouragingly quick out of the stalls but, not for the first time, were unable to kick on when it really counted. Instead it is the reigning champions, Ireland, who are up and running, courtesy of an uninterrupted blast of 22 second-half points that condemned Steve Borthwick’s side to a seventh defeat in their last nine Tests.Talk about a game of two contrasting halves. Initially a bristling England were right up for it and led 10-5 at the interval. They reckoned without storming, game-turning tries from Bundee Aki, Tadhg Beirne and Dan Sheehan and a collective Irish power surge that allowed the hosts to weather a slightly sticky first 40 minutes and grasp a potentially vital try bonus point.Maro Itoje leads from the front but can’t fix England’s familiar frailties | Gerard MeagherRead moreTwo late scores for Tom Curry and Tommy Freeman did at least earn England a losing bonus point, with the Harlequins wing Cadan Murley also claiming a try on his first international appearance. But this was a sporting movie that, in various forms, England fans are now used to watching. Rugby matches are played over 80 minutes and the final reel is becoming all too familiar.Last-quarter weariness, questionable depth in certain positions. Brittle self-belief … the bottom line is that England’s bench is still not managing to ride to the team’s rescue in the way Ireland’s replacements, say, seem capable of doing. Unless that changes very soon, starting at home to France on Saturday, England are not going to be anywhere near the winners’ circle when the tournament concludes next month.Under the new leadership of Maro Itoje, they had travelled over hoping for rather more on a cool, grey, expectant Dublin afternoon. And initially it did seem as if the afternoon might just yield something unexpected. No one was hungrier to make an early impression than the mustard-keen Curry twins and a serious amount of pressure was being heaped on the young Irish No 10 Sam Prendergast. Ben Curry was at the young fly-half constantly, disrupting Ireland’s kicking game and rushing the home conductor. And amid the swirling chaos it was England who struck first. Ollie Lawrence made inroads down the middle, Marcus Smith swung the ball to his left and Henry Slade put in a lovely deft left-foot grubber that sat up perfectly for Murley. Debut tries do not come much sweeter.Quick GuideStuart Lancaster exits Racing 92 after European flopShowThe former England head coach Stuart Lancaster has left Racing 92 with immediate effect. Lancaster’s 18-month spell with the Paris club has ended after they failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the Champions Cup, finishing second from bottom in their pool. They have also struggled domestically and sit 12th in the Top 14, just two points above the relegation zone. Owen Farrell joined the club last summer but has been affected by a groin injury, hampering his ability to contribute to their season.PA MediaPhotograph: David Winter/ShutterstockWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The visitors were still ahead at the half-hour mark but that was largely thanks to Irish profligacy. Twice, with advantage being played deep in the English 22, the hosts failed to nail the opportunity and when Ronan Kelleher did finally crash over the score was ruled out because Beirne had illegally held back Itoje at the preceding ruck.View image in fullscreenCadan Murley scores the opening try to give England hope.Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty ImagesThere was also a snap and crackle to England’s tackling and a determination to live up to the pre-match pledges to give it a real go with ball in hand. The aerial contest was also proving competitive and the stadium, already subdued, started to resemble a library on a public holiday.The hush was abruptly broken, though, when Ireland did finally storm back into the visiting 22 and, with a warning having already been issued, Smith was sent to the sin-bin for clear offside as England desperately tried to snuff out the danger. Still, though, Ireland were having trouble hammering home the final nail and Prendergast was learning the hard way that Test rugby is a relentless education.It was a major moment, then, when James Lowe, slightly isolated on the left, managed to force his way past Alex Mitchell’s tackle and threw an inside ball to the supporting Jamison Gibson-Park who cruised over to put the hosts on the board. Lowe and Gibson-Park both grew up in New Zealand but their contribution to Irish rugby continues to be highly significant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIt always felt like a contest, however, with further twists and turns to come. Another slicing linebreak, this time from Ben Earl, put England into another promising position and a penalty from the now-returned Smith gave his side a five-point half-time lead. For keen students of Anglo-Irish rugby history this was no minor detail: the last time the side leading at half-time in this fixture in Dublin lost the game, before this weekend, was in 1983.Ireland 27-22 England: Six Nations player ratingsRead moreSitting back and relying on lucky heather or four-leaf clovers, however, was not going to seal the deal for England. Now was the moment to show they could now pump up the volume and win the tight games they mostly lost last year. Ireland, though, were just getting started. Murley failed to gather a high ball and ended up in all kinds of strife in ‘coffin corner’, leading to a prolonged blockade in the English 22. Again England’s close-quarters resilience was outstanding and the Irish attack neither sharp nor precise enough until, at last, the stocky, powerful Aki skittled Smith and Mitchell down the left to drag Ireland level.They were soon ahead for the first time, courtesy of a long Prendergast penalty after a slightly debatable lineout call had gone against Itoje. But who would deliver the killer thrust? Crucially England’s penalty count began to mount and Beirne’s 64th-minute score, swiftly followed by another stretching one for Sheehan, split open a contest that had previously felt in the balance.It also tees up another intriguing weekend in round two. Wales’s travails in Paris do not bode well for their forthcoming trip to Rome while Ireland must now head to a suitably encouraged Scotland. And England? There is still much to solve if they want to pip France to the winning post this Saturday.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025The ObserverSix NationsRugby unionIreland rugby union teamEngland rugby union teammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Just 18 months after he joined Al-Hilal,Neymarand the Saudi club haveagreed to terminate his contract, allowing him to return to Brazil and rejoin Santos. Al-Hilal paid £77m to sign Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain on a salary of £2.5m a week. He will be paid 85% of that for the remainder of this season, meaning he cost the club £322m for seven appearances, three assists and one goal. Like so much of Neymar’s career, it all seems such a dreadful waste.His is a story almost designed to highlight the iniquities of the modern game, from the impossible pressures placed on young players to the curse of celebrity and financial excess. Neymar’s great misfortune was to emerge just after Lionel Messi. Argentina had seemingly found a second Diego Maradona, soBrazilneeded a second Pelé. When, in June 2011, the 19-year-old Neymar scored the opening goal in the final as Santos won the Copa Libertadores for the first time since Pelé had inspired them to the trophy in 1963, it seemed they had found him. But, of course, nobody can live with such comparisons and so Neymar remained always a prisoner of his potential.A familiar tale as Steven Gerrard departs Al-Ettifaq with relegation fears in the airRead moreNeymar’s status as the great Brazilian hope meant he was indulged. There had been an incident in 2010 when, a week after missing a penalty in the final of the Copa do Brasil (which Santos won),Neymarwas brought down in the box in a league game. His coach, Dorival Júnior, insisted somebody else should take the penalty, at which Neymar threw such a tantrum that he had to be placated by the linesman. He then turned his back on the penalty and rowed with his captain. But when Dorival called for him to be suspended for two weeks, he was sacked by the board.Perhaps even more damaging was the way referees protected him. It may only have been subconscious but to see Neymar at the Copa América, a few weeks after his Libertadores success, was to see a player who had no way of processing officials who didn’t instinctively give him every decision.The gnarled defenders of Venezuela and Paraguay set to work and Brazil drew two of their three group games. When they were eliminated in the quarter-final, Neymar was so ineffective he was withdrawn in the 80th minute. “It’s always me, me, me with him,” the former midfielder Carlos Casagrande said on O Globo’s coverage. “He’s forgotten or maybe he never knew that football is a collective activity.” Neymar-centricity, the whole game becoming his psychodrama, would become a familiar feature of Brazil at major tournaments.When he was 21, Neymar left Brazil for Barcelona. It wasn’t his fault that Spanish tax authorities discovered that the fee was not €57.1m as originally reported but €86.2m, €45m of which went directly to his parents, but it somehow felt characteristic of the greed at the highest levels of the game.The scandalled to theresignation of Sandro Rosellas the Barcelona president and his replacement by Josep Maria Bartomeu, under whomthe club’s finances deteriorated, precipitating the current crisis.View image in fullscreenNeymar’s presentation as a new Santos player.Photograph: Sebastião Moreira/EPAAt first Neymar struggled to adapt to the pace and physicality of the European game, and he scored just nine goals as Barcelona won nothing in his first season. That only increased the pressure on him at the2014 World Cupin Brazil. Although there was widespread sympathy when he fractured a vertebra in the quarter-final, his petulance had irritated many while the general hysteria that surrounded his injury was indicative of the emotionally fraught world elite players have to navigate.The following season was his best as, with Messi and Luis Suárez, he won a treble, scoring the last goal inthe Champions League final. But within a couple of weeks of that victory over Juventus in Berlin, he faced Colombia again in the Copa América, reacted stupidly to predictable provocation, was sent off for a backwards head-butt and then remonstrated so vociferously he ended up with afour-game ban.International tournaments were never kind to him, although he did help Brazil end their slightly baffling yearning forOlympic gold in Rio in 2016when most of the continent’s elite were playing in the Copa América Centenario. The World Cups of 2018 and 2022 brought quarter-final exits; in both tournaments Neymar flickered but ultimately frustrated.His defining move, though, washis 2017 transferto Paris Saint-Germain for €222m, more than doubling the previous world record, not only delivering for their Qatari owners a talented player but also making a show of their economic might while inflating the market, pushing up prices to a level it was very difficult for clubs without enormously wealthy state-backers to match. The collateral damage for football was vast and cemented Neymar’s position as 21st-century football’sZelig, somehow always there as the game took another lurch into sordid absurdity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Walking out of the stadium in Kazan after that World Cup defeat to Belgium in 2018, I passed between the marsh and the car park and saw, silhouetted against the breaking dawn, Neymar standing, head bowed, by the team bus. It was a curiously intimate moment, his sadness, his awareness of the expectation upon him, his crushing disappointment palpable.Neymar has reportedly taken a 99% pay cut to return to Santos (easier to do, of course, when you’re still getting £2.125m a week from the Saudi club you’ve just left). Hopefully that is a sign of somebody reassessing his priorities and remembering that once he played not for money or preferment or accolades, but because he enjoyed it. In our end is our beginning – but it is a very different Neymar, older, less optimistic, chewed up by football, who returns.Explore more on these topicsNeymarInside footballBrazilAl-HilalcommentShareReuse this content"

Their highest earner is thought to be the goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez, at about £200,000 a week.Rashford had been keen on a move to Barcelona but barring a late twist he will be confirmed as a Villa player before the window shuts at 11pm GMT on Monday. Asensio, who spent almost a decade with Real Madrid, has 38 Spain caps.

There have been very few games in which they’ve dismantled the opposition. They have won fewer league games by more than three goals than Tottenham have, but ended the day nine points clear at the top with their closest rivals to play the defending champions on Sunday. IfLiverpooldo, as they surely will, go on to win the title, it will have been an old-fashioned sort of success, a league won not by the spectacular or the flamboyant but by consistency and calmness, by ruthless accumulation.This was Liverpool’s sixth 2-0 win in the league; more than a quarter of their games so far. It’s a scoreline that speaks of control, of winning games with a little to spare, taking freakish equalisers, ill luck and odd refereeing decisions out of the equation, without being flashy and demanding overexertion: 2-0 is the scoreline of champions. Arsenal, like Liverpool, began the season with a pair of 2-0 wins but, since then, they have won 2-0 only once.Salah halts Bournemouth’s charge and sends Liverpool nine points clearRead moreWhen optimistic Arsenal fans looked at the second half of the season and noted that Liverpool had some tricky away games to play, this was one of the fixtures they would have earmarked as having the potential to cost Arne Slot’s side points.Bournemouthhad beaten not only Arsenal at home but also Manchester City and Nottingham Forest. And they could easily have taken a point off Liverpool, Antoine Semenyo and Marcus Tavernier clattering shots against the post.There has been a sense with Liverpool that they have played teams at the right time, just at the point when they are out of sorts or have key players missing.While there probably is some truth to that, it is also the case that Liverpool are very good at making opponents look as though they are in poor form. And nobody could have claimed that Bournemouth were not playing well before Saturday. If anything, their form was too good, having scored nine in their previous two games. Nobody can keep a shot conversion rate of 25% going for long. That Bournemouth got only three of 14 shots on target, two of those drawing excellent saves from Alisson, is perhaps a rare visible case of regression to the mean.Lucky Liverpool? Possibly – as even Slot acknowledged. Certainly the penalty they were awarded in the first half will raise eyebrows. That Cody Gakpo kicked the back of his own heel was clear; the question was whether he was nudged into doing so by Lewis Cook. At the very least the decision was soft. The offside decision that saw the equaliser David Brooks seemed to have scored before half-time ruled out was correct, but it was a close-run thing.View image in fullscreenVirgil van Dijk looked imperious at the back for Liverpool again.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersBut Liverpool’s second goal was one of rare quality, Curtis Jones beginning the break, catching up with it and feeding Mohamed Salah, who scored with the perfect finish, whipping the ball with very little backlift round Milos Kerkez and the stretching arm of Kepa Arrizabalaga and just inside the far post. It was a goal of efficiency and beauty, technically excellent and without the slightest needless embellishment and, as such, emblematic of Slot’s team as a whole.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is not only a very fine defender, arguably back to being the best centre-back in the league, but also a great leader. There has been rather less focus on Van Dijk than on the other two players who are out of contract in June, perhaps because he is 33, and perhaps because the assumption is that he is more likely than either Trent Alexander-Arnold or Salah to sign a new deal, but if he does leave he would be sorely missed, not only for what he himself offers but because he makes players around him better.Liverpool still have to go to Everton, Manchester City, Aston Villa and Chelsea. They still have to play Arsenal at home. There are hurdles to be negotiated. But given the sides Bournemouth have beaten at the Vitality this season, this was a big obstacle ticked off. There are 15 games left. The title race is not over yet. But Liverpool felt a lot closer to the tape at the final whistle than they had at kick-off.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolThe ObserverBournemouthanalysisShareReuse this content"

How calm he remains, how hard he works if sometimes he does not score for a game … it is impressive.”Kompany was unhappy with Bayern’s finish to the game. “The last 10 minutes is something we need to review with the players,” he said. “You can sometimes concede a goal but if you concede momentum you give the other team a chance and that is what happened.”Jamal Musiala put Bayern, who face Celtic in the Champions League playoff in February, in the driving seat in the 19th minute after the visitors had missed a golden early chance through Phil Harres. Bayern’s fourth goal in the 54th was the most spectacular with Serge Gnabry controlling the ball in the box and volleying in. Finn Porath pulled a goal back in the 62nd.

However, the goal was disallowed after the Frenchman had fouled Espanyol’s Pol Lozano in the buildup.The hosts kept Madrid at bay in the second half, with Lucas Vázquez, Rodrygo and Jude Bellingham having efforts brilliantly saved by goalkeeper Joan García. Romero netted the winner in the 85th minute after latching on to Omar El Hilali’s pass.Madrid were aggrieved when, on a breakaway, Romero fouled a running Mbappé from behind but was only shown a yellow card. “This foul is inexplicable, the decision they made, the referee, the VAR,” said the coach, Carlo Ancelotti. “The most important thing is to take care of the player and protect him. It was a very bad tackle that risked injury, which fortunately did not happen.”The result means Madrid, on 49 points, are one point clear ofAtlético Madrid, who beatMallorca2-0. The city rivals face each other next Saturday at the Santiago Bernabéu. Goals by the winger Samuel Lino and forward Antoine Griezmann secured Atlético’s win in Diego Simeone’s 500th La Liga game in charge. Lino put the home side in front in the 26th minute with a low strike inside the far post before Griezmann doubled the advantage in stoppage time, lobbing the Mallorca goalkeeper, Dominik Greif, from distance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He pulled at the club crest and kissed it. He pumped his chest and banged it with his fist. He also mimicked writing a signature to the crowd. What could it mean? By the end of the night Wolves had announced a renewal with their Brazilian talisman who may just keep them up. The contract to 2029 makes him Wolves’ highest-paid player and has a release clause that activates in June.Vítor Pereira confirmed in words what Cunha had been signalling by gesture. “Matheus is a special player and he’s committed with us,” the head coach said. “He knows that in the future he can play in the best teams in England, but he is committed with us and he understands that it is very important that if he leaves the club he does so with the club in thePremier League.” He declared himself “very happy and proud” of a win that took his side out of the bottom three and ended a run of four defeats on the trot.Aston Villa close on deal to loan Marcus Rashford from Manchester UnitedRead moreCunha scored the second goal of this match in second-half added time. It was a quality effort, a combination of skill, patience and cunning. Running the ball on the counter from inside his own half, Cunha stood up the Aston Villa defence as if waiting for backup, only to shift the ball out from his feet and cut a low shot across goal and into Emiliano Martínez’s net. It was a goal to settle the nerves at the very last, but also a testament to the resilience a battered and bruised Wolves side had shown to see offChampions League knockout stage qualifiers.For Villa this was an unwelcome continuation of their faltering league form, and with Ollie Watkins among four players withdrawn at half-time, the message seemed to be that this was one high-intensity fixture too far for Unai Emery’s men. The Villa coach said after the match that Watkins was carrying an injury and the hunt for forwards, which is focusedprimarily on Marcus Rashfordbut also includes a push to get MarcoAsensio on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, becomes ever more important for him.It was perhaps to be expected that Emery’s team would look rusty after their European exploits in midweek. They had previously won only once after playing in the Champions League this season, and that was against Wolves in September.View image in fullscreenJean-Ricner Bellegarde opens the scoring for Wolves in the 12th minute.Photograph: Jack Thomas/WWFC/Wolves/Getty ImagesWolves had taken the lead in that match too but here the fixture had a different flavour.The home side should have had the three points wrapped up, stamped first class and sent to Premier League HQ way before the half-time whistle. They were sharper, more determined and it was striking how slick they were too.The opening goal came in the 12th minute and was a beauty. After building on the left side Wolves worked the ball to Cunha about halfway inside the Villa half. Always with one eye on an opportunity, he quickly slipped the ball to Gonçalo Guedes, who bounced it across to Pablo Sarabia six yards or so from the tip of the D.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Emery threw his team up in the air at half-time and they crafted their best opening seven minutes later when one of the replacements, Donyell Malen, had the ball in the net.The Dutchman tucked away a calm finish after a cutely worked set piece but the goal was overruled on the pitch by the referee, Andy Madley, a decision backed up by VAR. An offside Morgan Rogers was adjudged to have impeded Nélson Semedo in the buildup, a decision which split opinion.“The team pushed in the second half and we had the chances,” Emery said. “Overall we enjoyed the Champions League on Wednesday, now the next step is to have a normal way for us [to maintain performance]. This year it has been more difficult.

It’s been a frustrating tour. We unfortunately haven’t played our best cricket here, and we’ve got a lot of soul-searching to do.”England’s defeat in Melbourne was a seventh consecutive loss afterdefeats in the three ODIsandthree T20s. Knight accepted some responsibility for the defeat, but expressed her desire to continue to represent England, saying she would use the “hunger” of the loss as motivation to improve.“Australia is always a tough place to come and tour as a cricketer,” she said. “But ultimately we haven’t played well enough and you’re going to feel that on your shoulders as a leader. We’ll regroup at some point before the season. I think there’ll be some really honest conversations and reflections individually.”The England head coach, Jon Lewis, promised a thorough review into a historic Ashes whitewash and insisted he was the “right guy” to lead them back from being demolished in Australia. Lewis told TNT Sports: “We review everything all the time, we reflect and we try and grow the team and the sport. Just to do it after every away Ashes series is probably not the right way to do it.“We will look at every single aspect of what we do internally and I’m sure the people who work externally from this group, in particular, will look at that as well. We will have to learn and move the team forward. We obviously need to compete better across the bilateral series we play against Australia, but we’ve also got World Cups as well. We’ve got a 50-over World Cup coming up in India this year and we’ve got to turn around things really quickly because it’s only eight or nine months away.”Lewis’s position has come under scrutiny in Australia over the past few weeks and he was asked about his future after England’s fate was sealed in Melbourne. He said: “I strongly feel that there’s real growth left in this group of players. We’ve got some really young players that have played throughout this series. I really feel I haven’t finished the job I came here to do. Obviously the results haven’t gone the way we want them, but I’m committed to the people in the dressing room and to growing women’s cricket in England. So, yeah, I feel I am the right guy to do it.”The Australia captain, Alyssa Healy, said that though her team had not set out with the goal of a whitewash, it became apparent quickly that England were unable to exploit any moments of advantage. “Every single time I thought England might have just been in the game, one of our players stepped up and slammed that door shut really quickly,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What could possibly go wrong?John NaughtonThe AI startup has upended the industry by developing a model that costs much less to produce – and is available free to a universe of tinkerersSat 1 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2025 14.14 ESTShareNothing cheers up a tech columnist more than the sight of$600bn being wiped off the market cap of an overvalued tech giant in a single day. And yet last Monday that’s what happened to Nvidia, the leading maker of electronic picks and shovels for the AI gold rush. It was the biggest one-day slump for any company in history, and it was not alone – shares of companies in semiconductor, power and infrastructure industries exposed to AI collectively shed more than $1tn in value on the same day.The proximate cause of this chaos was the news that a Chinese tech startup of whom few had hitherto heard had released DeepSeek R1, a powerful AI assistant that was much cheaper to train and operate than the dominant models of the US tech giants – and yet was comparablein competenceto OpenAI’s o1 “reasoning” model. Just to illustrate the difference: R1 was said to have cost only $5.58m to build, which is small change compared with the billions that OpenAI and co have spent on their models; and R1 is about 15 times more efficient (in terms of resource use) than anything comparable made by Meta.The DeepSeek app immediately zoomed to the top of the Apple app store, where it attracted huge numbers of users who were clearly unfazed by the fact that the terms and conditions and the privacy policy they needed to accept were in Chinese. And it clearly energised the Silicon Valley crowd. “DeepSeek R1,”boomed venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, one of the loudest mouths in California, “is AI’s Sputnik moment”. He also called it “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen – and as open source, aprofound gift to the world”. Donald Trump, who does not believe in giving gifts to the world, described R1 as a“wake-up call”for American tech firms.What the advent of DeepSeek indicates is that this technology – like all digital technology – will eventually be commoditisedHistorical resonances were rife. Andreessen was referring to the seminal moment in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched the first Earth satellite, thereby displaying technological superiority over the US – a shock that triggered the creation of Nasa and, ultimately, the internet. Other people were reminded of the advent of the “personal computer” and the ridicule heaped upon it by the then giants of the computing world, led by IBM and other purveyors of huge mainframe computers. Suddenly, people are beginning to wonder ifDeepSeekand its offspring will do to the trillion-dollar AI behemoths of Google, Microsoft, OpenAIet alwhat the PC did to IBM and its ilk. And of course there are the conspiracy theorists wondering whether DeepSeek is really just a disruptive stunt dreamed up by Xi Jinping to unhinge the US tech industry. Is the modelreallythat cheap to train? Can we believe the numbers in the technical reports published by its makers? And so on.Standing back, there are four things to take away from the arrival of DeepSeek.The first is that China has caught up with the leading US AI labs, despite the widespread (and hubristic) western assumption that the Chinese are not as good at software as we are. Even a cursory examination of some of the technical details of R1 andthe V3 modelthat lay behind it evinces formidable technical ingenuity and creativity.Second, the low training and inference costs of R1 willturbocharge American anxietythat the emergence of powerful – and cheap – Chinese AI could upend the economics of the industry, much as the advent of the PC transformed the computing marketplace in the 1980s and 90s. What the advent of DeepSeek indicates is that this technology – like all digital technology – will eventually be commoditised. R1 runs on my laptop without any interaction with the cloud, for example, and soon models like it will run on our phones.Third, DeepSeek pulled this off despite the ferocious technology bans imposed by the first Trump administration and then by Biden’s. The company’s technical report shows that it possesses a cluster of 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs – technology officially banned by the US government for sale to China.And last, but by no means least, R1 seems to be a genuinely open source model. It’s distributed under the permissive MIT licence, which allows anyone to use, modify, and commercialise the model without restrictions. As I write this, my hunch is that geeks across the world are already tinkering with, and adapting, R1 for their own particular needs and purposes, in the process creating applications that even the makers of the model couldn’t have envisaged. It goes without saying that this has its upsides and downsides, but it’s happening.

You want me to go swimming?’Sat 1 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2025 21.33 ESTShareMaga is blaming ‘dwarves’ and trans people for the Washington crashEvery day, the world seems to get stupider and stupider and our leaders seem to get nastier and nastier. Nobody expects empathy or accuracy from Donald Trump but, even by the extremely low standards to which he is held, his reaction to thetragic mid-air collision in Washington DCthat killed 67 people on Wednesday night was shocking.The collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and a US army Black Hawk helicopter was the first fatal commercial airline crash in the US since 2009 and the first national tragedy to occur since Trump’s inauguration. It should have been a moment of national unity, a moment of national mourning. (And, Trump, let us remember, promised during his inauguration speech that he was going be a “peacemaker and unifier.”) The president’s reaction to this horrible loss of life wasn’t to do any unifying, however. It was to engage in divisive finger-pointing. We won’t know the complete details about what caused the crash for a while, but that didn’t stop Trump from speculating wildly.“We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions and ideas,” Trump said at a news conference on Thursday. He then went on to dish out blame to everyone except himself. It was Joe Biden’s fault, he said. It was Obama’s fault! It was Pete Buttigieg’s fault! It was the fault of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs! Trump spent a lot of time discussing the Federal Aviation Administration’s DEI initiatives and, when asked if he thought the collision was the result of diversity hiring, said: “It just could have been.”Trump isn’t the only one using a tragedy to attack DEI programs. Fox’s Jesse Watters said on Wednesday that the crash may have been the result of the Obama-Biden administration trying to give jobs to “dwarves” and “people with transgender issues”.JD Vance has similarly insinuated that even if they can’t find any minorities or women to directly blame for the crash, it was still somehow the fault of DEI. “When you don’t have the best standards in who you’re hiring, it means on the one hand, you’re not getting the best people in government,” the vice-presidentsaid in a press conference on Thursday. “But on the other hand, it puts stresses on the people who are already there.”This sort of rhetoric isn’t just disgusting; it puts people at risk. Viral posts have been circulating online falsely identifying Jo Ellis, a transgender pilot with the Virginia national guard, as one of the pilots of the Black Hawk helicopter. One account spreading the lieswrote: “So now that the pilot of the Blackhawk has been identified as Jo Ellis, a transgender woman, can we admit Trump was right about the entire thing, or is it too soon?” Poor Ellis has had torelease a statement on Facebookas “proof of life” in response to these posts.The fact that the Maga crowd immediately blamed DEI for this tragedy is depressingly predictable. It’s been a longstanding talking point among Trumpers that DEI is to blame for all the ills of the world. When there was a safety incident on a Boeing plane last year, for example, Elon Muskwent on a baseless rantabout how the aviation industry had “prioritized DEI hiring over safety”. He also seemed to endorse a racist tweet suggesting students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) have lower IQs and therefore shouldn’t become pilots.To be clear, this is what the Trump crowd’s obsession with DEI is really about: plain old bigotry. Elon Musk has called DEI “just another word for racism”, and he is right, just not in the way he thinks. DEI has become a slur; a nasty euphemism for Black people, brown people, LGBTQ+ people and everyone else Trumpers hate. What the Maga crowd seem to be saying every time they talk about DEI and meritocracy is that they think white people, particularly white men, are innately superior to everyone else. What they are saying is that they think the least qualified white man is still more qualified than the most qualified woman of colour.This sort of attitude didn’t originate with Trump, to be fair. Almost 20 years ago, I remember one of my peers calling me a “diversity hire” to my face when he found out I’d got a job at a law firm he had been rejected from. He simply couldn’t believe there was a scenario in which I might have beaten him on merit. Still, while this attitude may not be new, what’s different now is the extent to which DEI is being used as a slur by influential figures. What’s different now is the glee with which large corporations are axing their DEI programs, relieved not to have to pretend to care about inclusivity or equity anymore.Then again, the likes of Trump don’t care about anything other than themselves, do they? Trump certainly doesn’t seem to care about the 67 people who died in the plane crash.When asked about his plans to visit the crash site, he made a sarcastic joke: “Thewater? You want me to go swimming?” Honestly, yes. Please go for a very long swim. As the Britssay: get in the sea!Astronomer Vera Rubin’s federal bio altered to omit DEI referencesThe Trump administration’s war against DEI is so wide-ranging that the federal webpage for an observatory named for the late astronomer Vera Rubinwas edited on Monday to remove informationabout how she’d advocated for more women in science and how science is still a male-dominated field.Elon Musk’s mummy thinks her precious child should sue the GuardianMaye Muskis annoyedthat people are still talking aboutMusk’s very Nazi-looking salute, which he insists was completely innocent.Marianne Faithfull, icon of British pop, dies aged 78Faithfull lived an extraordinary life but her reputation took a hit after she was discovered wrapped in a fur rug during a 1967 police search of Keith Richards’ house. “It destroyed me,”she later said. “To be a male drug addict and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising.

If the Office for National Statistics is correct, net migration will add five million people to these islands in the span of a decade. That will account for almost all population growth in that time, driving us up to72.5 million by 2032.Is it good news or bad? Many commentators reacted with alarm: there is already a great deal of strain on housing, education and health services. But others like the idea. They point out that birthrates are falling across the world, and that Britain, like other countries, is due to get increasingly decrepit with time. We will eventually have to live off the life force of skilled young people from overseas, over whom everyone else will be competing.But how will the public respond? There’snot a straightforward answerthere, either. Opposition to newcomers has softened in recent years, even as their numbers surged, although there was an uptick in concern again in 2023. But here’s a counter-narrative: last week, seven separate polls saw Reform pull ahead of the Conservative party. Central to Reform’s appeal is astance against immigration.The real answer to both questions is: it depends. Whether immigration is good or bad, tolerated or unpopular, tends to correlate with a factor distinct from headline numbers. Politicians talk aboutlevelsof immigration. But this skims over a more essential question: how well do new arrivals integrate into the economy, and into British life itself?Britons care about integration, which can make their attitudes seem inconsistent when asked about net numbers.Quizzed by pollsters, we say immigration is too high, but when it comes to individual groups of migrants – those fleeing war, those coming to study, transport workers, service workers, fruit pickers, artists, teachers, nurses – it turns out we’d like them to stay, or even arrive in greater numbers. We also tend to get on with the immigrants we know. This isn’t contradictory so much as nuanced. When immigrants do valuable work, and mix into communities, everyone benefits. On the occasions they don’t, problems can arise.Luckily for us, there are some reasons to be hopeful about the coming rise in newcomers. Integration is one of Britain’s biggest success stories: we excel at settling in arrivals. Touchiness around the subject means we don’t make much of a fuss about this. We should.Let’s start with employment rates, which for migrant men of working agestand at 82%, higher than for UK-born men, at 78% – although for women they dip two percentage points lower than for the native born. Other places are less successful: employment rates for foreign-born people in the EUlag well behind. There are plenty of fields in which migrants excel, too, delivering an outsize boost to the economy. A 2023 study found 39% of the 100 fastest-growing companies in Britainhave an immigrant founder or co-founder, even though the group makes up just 14.5% of the population.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionA study found 39% of the 100 fastest growing companies in Britain have an immigrant founder or co-founderEducation is another reason to be proud of our new arrivals. Sam Freedman, an expert on education policy, has pointed out that in a recent Pisa study of 15-year-olds – Pisa is the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment – the UK was the only European country other than Serbia where second-generation immigrantsperformed better than non-immigrants. Meanwhile, 58% of Bangladeshi students on free school meals go on to university, compared with just 16% of their white British equivalents.What about social integration? That is a positive story, too. Between 1991 and 2021,every ethnic group became less segregated, including white Britons. And not just in our big metropolitan centres, but in small towns and suburbs, where the foreign-born population is increasing the fastest. There are also a growing number of mixed-ethnicity households – from 9% in 2001 to almost15% of multiperson homes in 2021, due partly to the explosive growth of dating and roommate apps. Foreign-born people areunderrepresented in the UK’s prison system.Not so in much of the rest of the world.What’s our secret? Language is part of it. We’re lucky that a lot of the world speaks English and we can have our pick of the talent. Once here, people integrate that much faster. Another advantage is a flexible labour market, compared with the rest of Europe, where bureaucracy can stand in the way of foreign-born people joining the wage force. A third is our attitude. The 2023 European Social Survey finds that, next to Norway, we are theleast likely European countryto say immigration makes our country a worse place to live.There is plenty of room for improvement. We import many problems too, including cultural prejudices and religious extremism. Although segregation is falling, it can still cause problems. We are particularly bad at dealing with asylum seekers, whom we stop from working during the endless time we take to sort out their cases. Meanwhile,small boat crossings are up, while numbers of international students are down – putting a strain on universities, which increasinglyrely on their fees. Last week Cardiff University announced it wascutting 400 jobs.We need to address these problems and build on our advantage. Talking about integration, and not just net numbers, would be a start. It would be good, too, if politicians could refrain from overstating the drawbacks of immigration. Last week Kemi Badenoch blamed a “lack of integration” for the crimes of the Southport mass killer Axel Rudakubana – a claim for which there is no evidence. This kind of rhetoric will only damage integration, and set us back.Martha Gill is an Observer columnistExplore more on these topicsMigrationOpinionPopulationcommentShareReuse this content"

He will always exploit tragedy to display his self-regardSat 1 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2025 02.01 ESTShareOutrages of Donald Trump’s rancid character topple over each other so rapidly and in such volume that they long ago became banal. His vileness is unremarked upon, his rottenness unworthy of further commentary. Trump’s offensiveness is an unspoken assumption. Rules and norms exist for him to break. More, he is rewarded. Meta, after discarding monitoring of hateful content and disinformation on Facebook, is paying him $25m in tribute to settle his lawsuit against it for havingbannedhim after his attempted coup on January 6 and his potential “instances of violence” and threats to “public safety”. All is forgiven, if not forgotten. There are no gates; there are no gatekeepers. Let the bad times roll.But Trump crashed through a new boundary after an army helicopter collided with an airliner about to land at Washington’s Reagan National airport on 29 January with the loss of 67 lives. While police and firefighters were still recovering bodies from the Potomac River, before any report from the National Transportation Safety Board and evidence was fully gathered, Trump went on TV to spew blame against enemies within and to deflect responsibility.The Federal Aviation Authority administrator, Michael Whitaker, serving a five-year term that was supposed to end in 2028, was forced out by Elon Musk. On 24 September of last year, the FAA fined Musk’s SpaceX company $633,000 for launching rockets without a permit. “I think safety is in the public interest, and that’s our primary focus,” Whitakertestifiedto the House transportation committee. The administrator position was vacant at the time of the crash.The day after Trump’s inauguration he not only fired the members of the aviation security advisory committee,createdin 1989 after the terrorist bombing of Pan Am flight 103 thatexploded over Lockerbiein Scotland, but also eliminated the committee entirely. It had recently proposed new regulations for airline safety.The morning after the crash, Trump warmed to hisblaming exercise, expanding his targets as he went on. He began by blaming the policy to hire disabled people as air traffic controllers, saying they suffered, among other disabilities, from “severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability, and dwarfism”. The policy, in fact, was in effect during his previous administration.Then he blamed “the FAA’s diversity and inclusion hiring plan”, which he falsely claimed was responsible for the hiring of disabled people. They have been hired under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, a signature achievement of President George HW Bush.Trump jumped to attack the former transport secretary Pete Buttigieg as “a disaster”, throwing in an obscenity. “He’s just got a good line of bullshit,” said Trump, “and he’s run it right into the ground with his diversity. So I had to say that it’s terrible.”Trump next turned to the “great replacement theory” as his overarching explanation. Somehow, he claimed, the presence of non-white people was the reason for the crash. “It’s a group within the FAA, another story, determined that the workforce was too white, that they had concerted efforts to get the administration to change that and to change it immediately. This was in the Obama administration just prior to my getting there.”But, he went on, “we took care of African Americans, Hispanic Americans,” and, he said, “it’s one of the reasons I won.” But he asserted again that white people were being pushed out – “too white”. By contrast, “we want the people that are competent”. As he spoke, three of his cabinet nominees – Tulsi Gabbard, Robert F Kennedy Jr and Kash Patel – were being questioned in confirmation hearings about their glaring incompetence. And then Trump blamed Biden.A reporter asked: “On DEI and the claim that you’ve made, are you saying this crash was somehow caused and the result of diversity hiring? And what evidence have you seen to support these claims?” Trump replied: “It just could have been.”He blamed Biden again. Asked, “how you can come to the conclusion right now that diversity had something to do with this crash?” Trump snipped: “Because I have common sense, OK? And, unfortunately, a lot of people don’t.”Buttigiegfired backat once: “Despicable. As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying. We put safety first, drove down close calls, grew air traffic control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch. President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA.”He added: “One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep our skies safe. Time for the president to show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening again.”Presidents perform more than executive functions within the federal government. They, and they alone, can act as the emotional and empathetic voice of the nation during unexpected tragic events. They can grieve and console. They can express humility and demonstrate grace. They can serve as models of stoic behavior, articulate values and uphold standards, and summon the spirit of national unity.Was he grave, sombre, the consoler-in-chief? Are you kidding – this is TrumpRead moreWhen, in 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated shortly into its flight, killing all seven crew members, Ronald Reagan delivered a healingaddressto the nation that ended with a poetic eulogy to the crew that “‘slipped the surly bonds of Earth’ to ‘touch the face of God’”.When, in 1995, a far-right extremist bombed the Alfred P Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people in the worst domestic terrorist incident in the country’s history, Bill Clintonwent there, comforted the families of the victims “to share your grief”, and, citing scripture,said: “One thing we owe those who have sacrificed is the duty to purge ourselves of the dark forces which gave rise to this evil. They are forces that threaten our common peace, our freedom, our way of life. Let us teach our children that the God of comfort is also the God of righteousness: ‘Those who trouble their own house will inherit the wind.’ Justice will prevail.”When, in 2001, after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, Muslims in general and within America were blamed, George W Bushsaid: “These acts of violence against innocents violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith. And it’s important for my fellow Americans to understand that … The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That’s not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace … Muslims make an incredibly valuable contribution to our country. Muslims are doctors, lawyers, law professors, members of the military, entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, moms and dads. And they need to be treated with respect. In our anger and emotion, our fellow Americans must treat each other with respect.”When, in 2015, after a white supremacist neo-Nazi murdered nine parishioners at the African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, Barack Obamaattendedthe funeral of two of those killed. He praised the families who responded “in the midst of unspeakable grief with words of forgiveness”. He explained the long history of racism behind “an act that drew on a long history of bombs, arson, shots fired at churches. Not random, but as a means of control, a way to terrorize and oppress.” And he broke into singing Amazing Grace.If those presidents rose to new heights, Trump’s nose-dive into the mud was as emblematic. His impulse was to cast blame out of a frantic fear that accountability might somehow befall him. It was of a piece with his justice department’sillegal erasureof the criminal records of the January 6 convicts after he pardoned them.Trump demeaned in his attempt to enlarge himself. Buttigieg was “bullshit”, while Trump said, self-referentially: “We want brilliant people doing this.” The tragedy surfaced as an unforeseen opportunity for preening in the spotlight. He rebuffed a question about visiting the scene as though it was an affront. “You tell me the site,” he said. “What do you want me to do, go swimming?”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump at the White House on Thursday.Photograph: Elizabeth Frantz/ReutersTrump’s pretense as king has quickly devolved into his strutting insult comedian routine. He has ceded much of his executive power to two crackpot would-be prime ministers – Hitler-saluting Elon Musk, who is ravaging the government, and Project 2025 theocrat Russell Vought, Trump’s appointee to head the office of budget and management, whosayshis goal for federal workers is to “put them in trauma”. Trump’s White House, supposedly under the tight rein of his disciplining “Ice Maiden”, erstwhile Florida lobbyist Susie Wiles, was cut out of Musk’s loop when his minions virtually shut down the government with wildly vindictive orders. The resulting uproar in which they were mostly yanked back still exposed the gameplan of Trump’s retribution regime.Trump loves to swagger in the ceremonial pomp of his office, preferably surrounded by military guards, full-dress Fredonia. But in the plane crash he showed his utter disdain for the magical sympathy that the head of state can bestow, compassion on behalf of the whole country.Trump is more mafia kingpin than king, certainly not a constitutional monarch. He wants nothing but the bended knee, the deference and the adoration, but not to give anything in return. His restoration is another chance at piratical looting, his crypto coin, the constitution’s emoluments clause be damned. And would the self-aggrandizing justices on the US supreme court ever object to his perks?Trump views Musk partly as the muscle in his protection racket. He can threaten any mere senator with qualms about his quack cabinet nominees with primary opponents rocket-fueled with Musk’s unlimited funds. If the senators don’t pay the protection money in the form of obedient votes, Trump will get Musk to break their windows.The sad accident over the Potomac has revealed Trump’s irredeemable character once again. He will always spontaneously exploit tragedy to display his self-regard. The portrait of Trump in the film The Apprentice mistakenly depicts him in the beginning as a naive, impressionable young man, who fell into Roy Cohn’s hands and was molded by the mafia lawyer into a monster. On the contrary, Trump was a monster in the making. The stories are legion. Just recently his nephew recalled that when he was a child his uncle Donaldtold himthat disabled people “should just die” and frequently used the N-word to describe black people. Not to mention Trump’s decades of alleged sexual misconduct, only two incidents ever surfacing in the courts, one leading to his conviction of 34 felonies and the other to a defamation ruling with the judge stating from the bench that Trump’s action should be understood as rape.The Trump of the airport tragedy is the same Trump at the funeral of his father, Fred Trump, who financed his spendthrift bankruptcies on fanciful speculations. Mounting the pulpit at New York’s Marble Collegiate church to deliver the main eulogy, Trumpbegan: “I was having the greatest year of my business career, and I was sitting having breakfast thinking of how well things were going for me.” The rest of the speech was all about Donald.After Fred died, Donald made sure his deceased older brother’s son, another of Donald’s nephews, who suffered from muscular dystrophy, was deprived of the family company’s medical insurance. “Why should we give him medical coverage?”saidTrump.For Trump’s religious devotees, his moral turpitude is received as the inner light of his kingly anointment and divine right to rule. For the conservative majority on the US supreme court, the rap sheet of his far and wide crimes, such as attempting to overthrow the government and inciting a mob intent on lynching his vice-president, fell under his “official actions” to be granted “absolute immunity”. The hard-pressed working-class voters that gave him another chance bought the humbug of his titanic business acumen that they believed he would extend to lower their cost of living. Still, others dismissed his felonies and grifting on the easy, cynical grounds that, after all, they all do it, don’t they?But, as PT Barnum, the original expert on the subject of humbuggery and suckers,wrote: “The greatest humbug of all is the man who believes – or pretends to believe – that everything and everybody are humbugs.” Barnum observed that he “who does not even know that every sham shows that there is a reality, and that hypocrisy is the homage that vice pays to virtue – I pronounce him – no, I do not pronounce him a humbug, the word does not apply to him. He is a fool.”Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of EarthExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsWashington DCWashington DC plane crashcommentShareReuse this content"

Or were, as the fire has taken a terrible toll.Houses by the émigré Austrian modernistRichard Neutrahave gone, as have most of thePark Planned Homesof 1948, an idealistic experiment in affordable modern living by the architect Gregory Ain. Stone chimney stacks are all that remain of the scaled-up cabin that wasWill Rogers’ ranch house. His 30-horse stables, in their centre a rotonda like an equine chapter house, are ashes.These were works of grace and skill, sometimes of fantasy and excess, born of prosperity, sunlight and optimism, the dream homes of actors, singers, scriptwriters and seekers after a good life, as well as churches and shopping arcades. They were made with craft and imagination, promiscuously embracing styles running from Spanish colonial to brutalist, and with relish for the sheens and weights of hardwoods and ceramics and cast iron. They exploited the balmy climate to create easy flows from inside to outside through sliding glass walls and loggias, their balconies and decks projecting over cliffs and ravines in the crumpled terrain. Their destruction is a devastating, irrecoverable loss.Concrete poetryMost things they say about Canada (which I visited last month) are true. People there are astonishingly welcoming and friendly. It is a successful multiracial society. It looks dazzling in the snow and offers a quite wonderful outdoors life. It is largely clean and well ordered. Things are mostly done properly – because, one imagines, the cold could kill you if they’re not.The worst thing most people say about it is that it’s slightly dull, which, while not really accurate, is in any case an increasingly attractive feature in a world too interesting by half.View image in fullscreenState-sponsored futurism: Montréal’s Habitat complex.Photograph: Tony Kwan/AlamyI was less prepared for the fact that Montréal is a wonderland of reinforced concrete. Its metro stations layer and curve the material into grand, shadowy compositions reminiscent of the visionary Italian architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Its projects of state-sponsored futurism – theHabitat housing complexbuilt for Expo 67, the white and elephantinestadium for the 1976 Olympics– are misguided and splendid in equal measure. The textured concrete of theHotel Bonaventure, bashed with hammers into abstracted tree bark, is unparalleled.Snap out of it, peopleAccused as I sometimes am of not always being a ray of sunshine, I try to look at the upsides of progress. But, after a visit to the last days of the stupendous Van Gogh exhibition at the National Gallery in London, I can only marvel at the inanity and insanity of the current habit of taking pictures of pictures.In the crowded galleries, victims of this cult interrupted your view of paintings of sunflowers with phone screens with views of paintings of sunflowers.

The unions are on the warpath. Dame Judi Dench has been activated. The BBC broke with broadcasting tradition last month, axing the last remaining drama sloton Radio 3.The Beeb has broadcast original audio drama since Christmas 1922; since then, its radio departments have nurtured the careers of writers from Tom Stoppard to Benjamin Zephaniah. Successive cuts in recent years had already left long-form drama siloed in Radio 3’s 90-minute slot at 8pm on Sundays,Drama on 3. Now that slot has been canned for good.This stings, not only for radio fans but becauseBBCradio drama has underpinned a century of creativity in theatre and the wider arts. That legacy was built on both its generosity to the wider sector and its willingness to kick against the establishment from within.Take the career ofBBC radio producer John Tydeman. In 1963, he discovered a playwright calledJoe Orton, who had written a scriptwhile in jail on the charge of defacing library books with his lover Kenneth Halliwell. (The custodial sentence, Orton always insisted, was “because we were queers”.) Tydeman coached Orton as a BBC writer and also set him up with a theatrical agent, enabling his breakthrough stage production,Entertaining Mr Sloane,which established Orton’s name before his radio play,The Ruffian on the Stair, produced by Tydeman,was even broadcast.No wonder the thesps feel that a legacy is at risk here. Equity, the Society of Authors and theWriters Guild of Great Britainare among those marshalling petitions against the move: signatories include Dench, Meera Syal and Bill Nighy. Yet we have been here before. Protests against the BBC “dumbing down” are perennial. In 1957, in the days of Radio 3’s precursor, the Third Programme, TS Eliot, Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud held a fundraiser at the Royal Court theatre to object to rumoured drama cuts, most of which turned out to be wildly exaggerated.For some time, the BBC has been quietly shifting its spoken word output from Radio 3 to Radio 4Look closer, and there is a logic in the BBC’s changes, in a national institution struggling for continuing relevance. The demise ofDrama on 3has not come in a vacuum. For some time, the BBC has been quietly shifting its spoken word output fromRadio3 to Radio 4.In 2021, Radio 3 lost the bulk of its arts programming, the greatest casualty beingSaturday Review. Outcry followed, as today. Yet Radio 4’s arts coverage was commensurately bulked up, with the addition of new showsThis Cultural LifeandScreenshot. Radio 4’s highest-profile arts offering,Front Row,has gained 30 minutes a week and a weekly slot focused on Scottish arts. Meanwhile, Radio 3’s forthcoming programming, notably a40-part series on modernism in music, shows a commitment to classical but no sign of dumbing down.What lies behind this shift, I am told, is the director general Tim Davie’s obsession with “brand purity”. Gone is the magazine mix of Radio 3, with its mandate to balance highbrow speech programming with highbrow music; we are moving instead to the “clarity” of a Radio 3 dedicated to classical and jazz music, and a Radio 4 dedicated to speech. Speech programmes that enhance Radio 3’s “music brand”, such asMusic Matters,will stay. Two other intellectual panel programmes,Free ThinkingandThe Verb,have already made the move from Radio 3 to Radio 4.For audiences, this signals the end of individual radio channels – “linear networks” – that could be trusted to guide the listener through the day with wide-ranging genres on a single channel. For older generations, raised to stick their analogue radio switch on a favourite channel from morn to night, this will be a shock.But the world of the podcast has already created a new era of selective listening. If Radio 3 is transformed into an exclusively music station, it is because one day it may not be a live radio station at all. It will be a themed “content hub” from which we select whichever music programme suits our mood. This is not the apocalypse but the reality of change.Where does this leave the legacy of audio drama at the BBC? Stripped of the security of the 90-minute format, for sure. The BBC is eager to reassure us that audio drama continues on Radio 4: as yet, however, it offers only drama slots of 45 and (sometimes) 60 minutes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Four of the six nominees for best original single drama at this year’s BBC Audio Drama Awards are successful experiments in the 45-minute length. But Benedict is right that the death of the 90-minute BBC radio play would definitively break the relationship between BBC radio and British theatre. Ninety minutes of radio drama is practice for 90 minutes of theatre, the basic format of the British stage show.If the 90-minute audio drama is dying, however, it is not the BBC alone that has killed it. Audio drama is thriving on streaming services, but largely in episodic formats. The pandemic exposed a worldwide appetite for audio entertainment, but industry experts complain that this same popularity led to a mass buyout of independent producers by the corporate players. Audible is almost unchallenged in the UK;Wonderyand iHeartRadio offer some competition in the US. When they do invest in radio drama, they favour sci-fi, thrillers and adaptations of existing intellectual property.In an era of new formats, digital competitors and ever more selective audiences, the BBC must restructure its future as best it can. Yet no competitor is offering alternative investment in 90-minute drama. The BBC says it is actively “exploring” ways to compensate for the loss ofDrama on 3, both on Radio 4 and BBC Sounds. Unions have two options. They can work with the BBC to make that happen; or they can prepare, like artists throughout history, to accept the challenge of new genres, new formats and new masters.Kate Maltby writes about theatre, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsBBCOpinionRadio dramaRadio 3Radio 4Spoken wordPodcastingRadiocommentShareReuse this content"

It’s time to debate it without toxic rhetoricSat 1 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2025 09.30 ESTShareBritain needs immigrants. According to theOffice for National Statistics this week, Britain’s “indigenous” population in the 2030s will be static and ageing. Growth in populationwill be buoyed only by immigrants, their number predicted to rise by 5 million over the next seven years. Thank goodness, surely, for them.As this debate lurches back into public discourse, it is cursed by the ease with which xenophobia delivers political gain. The fact is that Britons have turned massively in favour of immigration over the past half century. In the 1950s and 1960s,roughly 80%-90% wanted it to stop. Then the inflow was under 250,000 a year and Enoch Powell could forecast “rivers of blood”. Net migration was below zero.In 2023, immigration into Britain was estimated inexcess of 1.2 million, yetpublic opposition to immigration was downto 40-50%. It had risen in the run-up to Brexit, when it was the lead factor in the leave vote. It fell back as EU workers vanished, but opposition rose again last year as non-EU small boat arrivals gained daily publicity. Even then, fewer than half those polled said it should be reduced.Figures can prove almost anything. What is significant is that where most immigrants settle – in and round London – is both the most productive part of Britain and where opposition to them is weakest. In London,over a third of the current populationwas born abroad. Public opinion certainlyresents the immigrants’ claimon the NHS and welfare, but it welcomes them, often overwhelmingly, as professionals (notably doctors) and as care, hospitality and farm workers.Migrant exploitation is a progressive issue. That’s why we will now take the toughest steps ever to stop it | David LammyRead moreFor my part, I know only that many of the services I use, for building, cleaning, transport and eating out, are overwhelmingly supplied by immigrants. Diversity is a feature of most major world cities. I note that the states with high immigration levels – the US, Britain, Germany and France – are also among the most prosperousand most free.None of this really matters. It is all but impossible for a liberal country to prevent enterprising, often desperate, people from penetrating its borders. When the Boris Johnson government stifled the supply of short-term EU workers under a hard Brexit, long-term non-EU workers simply replaced them in even greater numbers. Recent limits onforeign students and their dependentshave diverted visas towards particular skills. But it is hard to see such diversion aiding state sectors now chronically understaffed.In other words, immigration into Britain may need more vigorous regulation, but it is not going to stop, nor should it. Global population mobility is like the climate crisis. It can be mitigated but not easily reversed. If two successive leaders of Britain’s Conservative party can have immigrant backgrounds, it is hard to argue that Britain can not adjust.What matters is how to handle the continued toxicity of immigration on domestic politics. The issue has proved a gift to extremists in all the west’s “receiving” nations, from the Scandinavian countries and Germany to the US. Immigration as code for race is a gift to America’s far right, just as a side-effect of immigration, identity politics, is to the left.Research by the Oxford thinktank Migration Observatory shows that the British public is ready to welcome newcomers to its economy and even to its communities. But there is a proviso. The welcome is not unconditional. The relentless publicity given to “immigrant crime” – actuallyno worse than “homegrown” – reflects a sense that hosts expect higher standards of “guests”. Bursts of reported criminality, as recently withAlbanian drug gangs, appear to come in phases of migration rather than reflecting underlying national cultures.Many countries now have protocols based around conditional inclusion and good citizenship. Effort needs to be made to reduce the clash of cultures between Britons and some immigrant groups – such as on issues of gender. This should surely be met other than with the ludicrous Home Office “hostile environment” citizenship test, with questions such as “when is Saint David’s Day?” and “which two houses fought in the Wars of the Roses?”.Few on either side could complain at the deportation of recent immigrant criminals or at an insistence on some acceptance of an immigrant “charter”. Those intending to settle permanently in a new land could surely be required to learn of its popular festivals, beliefs, traditions and codes of conduct. Community discipline matters, or should matter. Such a charter – which might also be given to second-homers arriving in distant villages – should be seen as part of the migration ritual.Merely deploring British immigration is no longer meaningful. It is the crudely concealed politics of emotion. We cannot stop foreigners wanting to come to Britain, but we can regulate it and turn it to our advantage. We can handle it.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Perhaps it’s a trend that could – and should – catch onSat 1 Feb 2025 13.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2025 21.30 ESTShareIn his new book,Changing My Mind, Julian Barnes writes: “We always believe changing our mind is an improvement, bringing a greater truthfulness to our dealings with the world and other people. It puts an end to vacillation, uncertainty, weak-mindedness. It seems to make us stronger and more mature.”Well, maybe in literature, but not in politics, where changing your mind is akin to changing your underwear in public. Not a sign of strength, but a cause for embarrassment. There are few scenes of schadenfreude more keenly savoured in the political world than a dramatic U-turn, ideally with handbrake fully engaged and wheels loudly screeching.Peter Mandelson’sreappraisal last week of Donald Trumpmight be said to be a model of the form. Having called the American president a “bully” and “reckless and a danger to the world” in 2019, Mandelson performed a boldly ambitious 180 on Fox News by describing his comments as “ill-judged and wrong”.No doubt some will snort mockingly at what they see as sycophantic backtracking but “when the facts change”, as John Maynard Keynes is alleged to have said, “I change my mind. What do you do?” Although the great economist probably never uttered those words, Mandelson should nonetheless take comfort in them.Because the facts have indeed changed. The most telling empirical development since the original criticism is that Mandelson isnow British ambassador to the United States. A second, but no less consequential shift in real-world circumstance, is that Trump is once again the American president, a situation that looked highly unlikely six years ago.If weight of evidence is a sound reason for a reversal of opinion, then seriousness of threat is arguably a more effective one. As the president displays a gift for vendettas that would put a Sicilian don to shame, Mandelson understood that if he wants to remain ambassador a certain diplomatic reassessment was called for.There will be those that think the president’s menacing claims onGreenlandand thePanama canallend credence to Mandelson’s historic description of him as a “danger to the world”, but it is to our man in Washington’s tactful credit that he now recognises Trump’s “dynamism” and “energy’, even if it’s not yet fully appreciated by the Danes and Panamanians.The president’s number two, vice-president JD Vance, once wondered if his current boss might be ‘America’s Hitler’Yet we should not overstate the ambassador’s stoical ability to swallow his own words, for the true mark of principle in abandoning earlier and dearly held positions is a willingness to stand alone. Mandelson, by contrast, is in crowded if not necessarily good company.Many critics of Trump have found themselves experiencing a similarly diametrical change of heart, particularly since he was elected president again. Some can even boast an earlier Pauline conversion. After all, the president’s very own number two, vice-president JD Vance, once described his current boss as “reprehensible”, “a bad person”, and wondered if he might be “America’s Hitler”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If Vance could see the error of his ways, and be welcomed into the fold, there is hope for everyone now queueing up to salute the most powerful man in the world’s courage and fair-mindedness. Or presumably that’s the working theory.Perhaps it’s a trend that will catch on, and changing one’s mind will come to be seen in politics as not as a show of weakness and desperation but rather of maturity and truthfulness. There are certainly many in the world who would celebrate an outbreak of those qualities in the man in the White House.

I felt very welcome immediately. I feel this is sacred land.” The idea of uprooting the community feels like a violent act to Cooke: “You don’t just move an oak tree. It won’t work.”Members of the community claim there are elements of “colonialism” in what is happening. Cooke, who used to work forExtinction Rebellion UK, said: “She is coming here and using power she has because of the money she has.”The members have been told that their tenancy rights ended on 31 December. On 17 January the new owner’s lawyer gave them seven days to move out – or proceedings for possession would be issued.Some have left, including all the children, but six adults and three long-term volunteers remain and on 8 Februarywill hold a “We’re still here” gathering, a rallying cry borrowed from the defiant Welsh folk songYma o Hyd.Nick Ward has lived at Brithdir Mawr for a decade and his two children grew up here. “It was an amazing place to bring them up,” he said. “They had freedom and thrived. What is happening makes us all very sad.”View image in fullscreenNick Ward has lived at Brithdir Mawr for a decade.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianThe community has written to May arguing the legal process is not the way to go, that people need to learn to live on the land together. They emphasise that they do not blame her but believe their plight is the result of a broken system.Brithdir Mawr (which could be translated as “large patchwork”, apparently a reference to the mix of soils and landscapes on the farm) was discreetly founded in 1994 and made headlines around the world in 1998 after it was spotted by a survey plane, leading to the residents being described in the press as a“lost tribe”. Their aim,they say,is to “encourage and allow to emerge a nourishing, mature and eco-centric human culture that fosters connection at every level: connection to each other, our human tribe, the land, the earth, those beings other-than-human, our own inner worlds, and the individual purposes and gifts that we bring to the world”.But they are not elusive or inward-looking and have taken in volunteer workers over the years and put on courses, including in Celtic languages and self-sufficiency.Many have had jobs in nearby towns and villages and they have also been at the centre of the Welshone planet development policy,which makes it easier to build eco homes and communities.The landlord, who was one of the original founders but moved away, decided to sell some years ago. Members of the co-operative raised £800,000 to try to buy the land but it was sold to May, a teacher, doula and shadow work coach for a sum the community believe was about £1m.She told the Guardian she wanted to renovate the buildings, which include a fine old farmhouse, and create an “affordable healing retreat centre connected to Carningli (Angel mountain), which soars above the site.May said she had explored possibilities of working with the current members. “I told them I was willing to negotiate but that required a clean slate with the existing tenancy rights having to end. They were not interested in the new vision and the negotiations came to nothing. I felt this left me little alternative but to pursue eviction.”She rejects the accusations of colonialism, saying that she has a long-standing connection to westWalesand has sold her family home to invest. “I am not a corporate landlord. Some of the community members cannot or will not admit that I own the land. They refuse to face the facts.”View image in fullscreenAnne tends to the goats at the co-operative, their milk is used to make goat’s cheese to share.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianEmma Orbach, another Brithdir Mawr founder, who now lives on land next door, described the situation as “deeply distressing” but backed May and said they would work together. “It’s not just about land and getting things from it; it’s about our spiritual connection to the land,” she said.For now, the Brithdir Mawr members are trying to get on with their usual routine.Anne was full of smiles as she tended to the eight British Toggenburgs nanny goats and one visiting male – Billy Fury – but became tearful when asked how she felt. “I’m heartbroken, that’s the truth,” she said.Rosie Gillam, who grew up nearby and first came aged eight to learn circus skills, paused in her wood chopping, to give her opinion. “This is such a special spot.

It’s just a very much more efficient energy system.”She added: “There’s a very powerful economic argument here, and it always troubles me when I hear politicians polarise them [the issues of economic growth and moving to a low-carbon society]. Because they are essential to one another. You can’t have economic growth without delivering on net zero.”Reeves was accused this week of ignoring environmental concerns in pursuit of growth at all costs, ingreenlighting the expansion of Heathrow airportand streamlining the planning regime for other infrastructure. While the chancellor reaffirmed her commitment to the government’s net zero targets and placed green provisos on airport expansion, she made clear that growth was the top priority, which hasraised concerns among some environmentalists.The CCC will not oppose the chancellor’s plans – its job is to advise on how to meet the UK’s net zero targets, not prescribe policy. Its experts analyse the various means by which emissions could be cut, and where choices must be made. Airports can be expanded, the CCC has said previously, but the government must then seek equivalent carbon savings elsewhere.Pinchbeck said: “In all areas of the economy, you either replace a fossil fuel with an alternative that’s low-carbon, or you have to reduce demand for that thing. Or you capture any residual emissions and store them. Aviation is one of those sectors where it’s probably a mix of all of the above.”Pinchbeck was speaking before full details of the announcements had been disclosed and did not comment on Reeves’s speech afterwards, but she is likely to have more to say on all of the government’s growth plans soon. The CCC is putting the final touches to the UK’snext “carbon budget”, a blueprint that sets out what cuts must be made in greenhouse gas emissions over a five-year period in order to meet the long-term binding target of net zero emissions by 2050.The UK is midway through the fourth carbon budget, which runs from 2023 to 2027, in a series stretching back to the Climate Change Act of 2008. On 26 February, the CCC will announce details of the seventh carbon budget, to run from 2038 to 2042, and which is expected to require some of the most drastic emissions cuts yet. Although it will begin long after this parliament ends, Labour will have to provide a response showing how it will prepare to meet the new targets, and have to show how its policies meet current commitments on emissions cuts this decade – on which the CCC hasalready warned the UK is badly off track.“The important thing for politicians in all parties to really understand is that there is this massive energy transition happening. It is so big and so fast,” Pinchbeck said. The changes would encompass policy across government, from energy security, geopolitics, industry, jobs and growth to fuel poverty and health. “There is a case for every politician to make on something that is in the carbon budget,” she added.Though the CCC does not write policy, it can set out the likely pros and cons of options for reaching the emissions targets, and in its forthcoming budget there will be analysis on some of the most contentious green policy areas this government must decide on: airport expansion; North Sea oil and gas; carbon capture and storage; the future of hydrogen energy and home heating; nuclear power; andwhether to subsidise burning wood in power stations.Pinchbeck, who took the helm at the CCC in November afternearly five years as chief executive of the Energy UK trade body, was tight-lipped on what exactly the report would contain, but was enthusiastic about one innovation: the new budget will examine fairness and the social impacts of net zero.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We’ve also run a citizens’ panel, where we’ve talked to people about some policy options, just to give government some qualitative information on alternative options for routes forward on some issues.”Fairness was at the core of public concern, she said. “When you ask the British public, they are very mindful of fairness. The main issue on fairness is how you fund the capital cost of investment. No one should pretend there isn’t a cost to change a heating system, or buy a new vehicle, or build a new wind farm. We can see that the cost is paid back in operational savings, but you still have to, for many households, work out how they’re going to get the car in the first place. We’ve got to find solutions so that all households, particularly those that would most benefit, can get these technologies as soon as possible.”In conversations about airport expansion, for instance, it is important to bear in mind thatmore than half of the public do not take flights in any given year. “So there’s a question about who bears the costs for aviation decarbonising and how you do that,” she said.Bringing down electricity costs would also make a difference. “We would like to see the government taking action to make electricity cheap,” said Pinchbeck. “Cheap electricity helps everyone and everything.”One way of doing that would be to take thegreen leviesthat help to fund renewable energy off bills and add them to general taxation. But while Reeves is concerned about tax levels, that is unlikely.The CCC cannot require the government to take such a step, but Pinchbeck notes the unfair impact of the current system. Funding investment in renewables by adding the cost to energy bills “is more regressive than, for example, putting it in taxation”.To a government facing economic headwinds and a barrage of criticism from right and left, the complexities of seeking low-carbon answers to the UK’s problems – across the key areas of transport, housing, the cost of living and industry – might seem a luxury to be dispensed with. But Pinchbeck is clear: failure to decarbonise now would not improve the economy, but saddle the UK with enormous costs in years to come. “We model the carbon budgets against the baseline where we do nothing,” she said. “And the baseline where we do nothing is worse for the economy, and worse for people, than doing something.”Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsGreen economyClimate crisisLabourKeir StarmerRachel ReevesClimate Change CommitteenewsShareReuse this content"

Extra powers will also be handed to the Border Force, which will be able to compel anyone who it suspects of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection.The news follows warnings that the use of AI tools in the creation of child sexual abuse imagery has more than quadrupled in the space of a year. There were 245 confirmed reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse images last year, up from 51 in 2023, according to the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF).Over a 30-day period last year, it found 3,512 AI images on a single dark web site. It also identified an increasing proportion of “category A” images – the most severe kind.AI tools have been deployed in a variety of ways by those seeking to abuse children. It is understood that there have been cases of deploying it to“nudify” images of real children, or applying the faces of children to ­existing child sexual abuse images.The voices of real children and victims are also used.Newly generated images have been used to blackmail children and force them into more abusive situations, including the live streaming of abuse.AI tools are also helping perpetrators disguise their identity to help them groom and abuse their victims.View image in fullscreenTechnology secretary Peter Kyle said the UK has ‘failed to keep up’ with the malign applications of the AI revolution.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesSenior police figures say that there is now well-established evidence that those who view such images are likely to go on to abuse children in person, and they are concerned that the use of AI imagery could ­normalise the sexual abuse of children.The new laws will be brought in as part of the crime and policing bill, which has not yet come to parliament.Peter Kyle, the technology ­secretary, said that the state had “failed to keep up” with the malign applications of the AI revolution.Writing for theObserver, he said he would ensure that the safety of children “comes first”, even as he attempts to make the UK one of the world’s leading AI markets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was sentenced, he did his time, paid the price and now he’s shown a great example of someone who had a bad start with a bad mistake but look how well he’s done.“And what that shows actually is, we can forgive and we learn from things, but people can succeed. And I think that’s really important.”When asked whether McMurdock could ever face suspension for his conviction, Tice said: “The opposite. He’s doing brilliantly and he’s a shining example of someone who’s worked hard, got a lovely family.“His wife’s pregnant literally as we speak, with a new baby on its way, and to be an MP is a great privilege, and we’re very proud of him and he’s doing a great job. [He’s] really really focused on his constituents and it’s another success story.“Someone who made a mistake, got things wrong, learned from it and has grown and succeeded, taken a risk coming into politics and good on him. He’s put his head above the parapet and we’re very proud of him.”Shortly after he was elected, the mother of McMurdock’s former girlfriend told the Daily Mail that the new MP was “a monster” who had “left marks on her body”, saying: “It took two security guards to pull him off her.”In response to her comments, McMurdock told the paper: “A generous person might call it a teenage indiscretion, but I do not expect everyone to be so kind. Nearly 20 years ago, at 19 years of age, at the end of a night out together, we argued and I pushed her.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite being 38 now and having lived a whole life again, I still feel deeply ashamed of that moment and apologetic. Despite us both being very drunk, I handed myself into the police immediately and admitted my fault.”Gavin Callaghan, the Labour leader of Basildon council, criticised Tice’s decision not to suspend McMurdock.Conservatives fighting to stem loss of high-value donors to Reform UKRead moreIf McMurdock “was a true democrat and a real reformer he would resign his seat and let the people of South Basildon and East Thurrock decide, now they know the true extent of his conviction, whether or not they still want him as their MP”, he said..“With regards to Reform and what Tice has said [about McMurdock] it is obvious that they are not a serious political party. In our view, they’re a rabble … to be honest.”Speaking at the rally on Friday, theReform UKleader, Nigel Farage, conceded the vetting of candidates had been “probably quite near a catastrophe” in past elections, after several were dropped for making sexist remarks and using racial slurs.But Tice said he was confident McMurdock would still pass Reform’s new vetting process, a system he has described as “getting better and better”.Explore more on these topicsReform UKViolence against women and girlsEssexRichard TiceCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Officials currently rely on snapshot studies that show annual figures; the most recent children’s care census put the figure at 400,000, or 1 in 30.“It is certain that high proportions of children are referred to, assessed and recognised as needing services by CSC [children’s social care services] in England,” the study said. The figure, it said, “raises questions about the extent to which government ­policies on employment, benefits, housing, healthcare, education, social care and justice support or challenge nurturing and upbringing of children”.The numbers are likely to be higher in poorer areas. Researchers were unable to break down the data by factors such as ­gender, region, ethnicity and ­deprivation, but lead author, Dr Matthew Jay, a senior data scientist in public health at UCL, said it was possible that in some of the poorest parts of the country, more than half of children may be referred tochildren’s servicesat some point.The study found about one in three young people are referred to ­children’s social care services by the time they reach adulthood, while one in four are assessed either as a Child in Need – requiring extra support or services for their health, development or disability – or as needing a child protection plan.Children’s services encompass both child protection and health-oriented care provision. Child in Need status can entail responses such as parenting support, home adaptations or respite care. The study found 7% of children require a child protection plan at some point, related to the risk of significant harm such as abuse or neglect.“There’s a lot more child ­protection activity going on,” Jay told theObserver. “It may be linked to cuts in social care, cuts to early care, closures of children’s centres … these broader policies that would otherwise mean children can be cared for perfectly fine within the family, and with that bit of extra support, without needing social care.“If you take those safety nets away, things can potentially escalate to the point where social care is ­intervening really as an emergency measure.”Katharine Sacks-Jones, chief ­executive of the charity Become, which supports children in care and care leavers, said: “These ­concerning figures come against a backdrop of rising child poverty, cuts to early support services and increasingly complex issues facing children and families. Children’s social care is already in crisis with more children in care than before and a system ­struggling to meet their needs.”The study analysed the Department for Education’s annual Children in Need census, using data from 2012 to 2018 split across three age cohorts. Jay said he was confident about the figures regarding Child in Need status, but added the referrals data was subject to the risk of both overcounting and undercounting.The study recommends a shift towards early help services, and argues children’s needs might be ­better addressed by targeting socioeconomic and structural factors.“If you improve the conditions in which people live, they won’t need public services so much,” said Jay. “If we can enact policies that improve those conditions, then it just stands to reason that services like social care won’t be needed as much. Which is better for everybody – it saves the taxpayer money, but most importantly it would be a reflection of improved living conditions for these families.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When implemented well and with care, they are one of the few tools the state has to prevent children from being taken into care and to keep families together safely – and thousands of children are reliant on these plans to grow up healthy and safe.“But in their current form, it is impossible to meaningfully assess how effective Child in Need plans are as an intervention.”A government spokesperson said: “This government will do whatever it takes to keep children safe, ­breaking the cycle of late intervention and poor outcomes inherited in the children’s social care system.“We are already taking swift action to reform the system through the doubling of our investment in early family help, as well as through our landmark Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill which will help stop children falling through cracks in the system and make sure they receive the support they deserve.“This work goes hand in hand with our ChildPovertyTaskforce, which is working to deliver an ambitious strategy to increase household income, bring down essential costs and tackle the challenges felt by those living in poverty.”Explore more on these topicsChildrenThe ObserverSocial careCuts and closuresPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

Police have not yet identified this person either, but again, the family has been informed.PoliceScotlandsaid inquires were continuing, but there were no apparent suspicious circumstances.Flowers have been left near Queen Elizabeth bridge for the sisters.Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, expressed his condolences in a post on X. “Heartbreaking news from the City of Aberdeen this morning. My thoughts are with everyone affected by this very sad news,” he wrote.The disappearance of the sisters, who are part of a set of triplets, sparked an extensive search.Police said they had been made aware of the pair’s disappearance on 7 January by their landlady, who had received a text message from Henrietta’s mobile phone at 2.12am that indicated the sisters would not be coming home. The phone has not been active since.CCTV footage showed that they had visited the path along the river that they are believed to have taken the day before at 2.50pm.Twelve hours later, at 2.12am, CCTV showed the sisters walking from Market Street and across Victoria Bridge, which crosses the Dee where the river enters the harbour. The police believe they headed westwards towards Aberdeen boat club, where they vanished.The twins’ sister, Edit Huszti, said earlier this month that it would be out of character for her sisters to venture out on the street during the early hours of the morning.József, their brother, said the sisters, who moved toScotlandabout seven years ago, appeared to be fine in the days before they went missing. The pair had a 40-minute phone conversation with their mother and everything seemed normal.Edit Huszti told the BBC she had spoken to her sisters via a video call on New Year’s Eve and that they had appeared happy and cheerful. She said they were very close.Supt David Howieson said: “Our thoughts remain with the Huszti family and we are keeping them fully updated following these recoveries.“We know how much of an impact this has had in Aberdeen and much further afield and I would like to thank everyone who has assisted with our investigation.”Explore more on these topicsAberdeenScotlandHungaryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s great recycling and it’s a great source of organic material that can feed our soils – but it also saves water and helps prevent sewage spills going out into rivers, which occur because of the capacity problems of our sewage system.“This is one of the ways we can be much more responsible about our waste and get something really beneficial from it. So for me, it’s a no-brainer.”Wisley began asan experimental garden in 1878, with the idea of making “difficult plants grow successfully”. It is now the leading garden of the RHS and is visited by more than one million people a year.“A composting loo and the wider Greener Skills Garden really fits in with that original ethos of experimenting and pushing the boundaries of what we do in horticulture,” said George.Dr Chloe Sutcliffe, an RHS sustainability fellow, said the Greener Skills Gardenwill also include Wisley’s first rain garden, featuring plants that can withstand being waterlogged for days, followed by dry periods.This is part of an experiment to find out how different planting schemes and the overflow from rainwater storage containers, for example, can be designed to manage heavy rainfall across a garden. “We’re encouraging visitors to be able to see the journey that water takes through gardens, so that people can start to understand how gardens can be used to slow the flow of water across the landscape,” Sutcliffe said. “That is something we increasingly need to do to try to increase our resilience to heavy rainfall and reduce the risk of flash flooding in the future.”Explore more on these topicsGardensThe ObserverClimate crisisPlantsPollutionRecyclingCharitiesEthical and green livingnewsShareReuse this content"

Lord Foulkes is seeking a meeting this week with the clerk of the ­parliaments Simon Burton, who is head of theHouse of Lordsadministration, to discuss what Foulkes says is a growing list of concerns about the activities of the royal family.Foulkes, a junior minister under Tony Blair, said he has been refused permission to table a question ­proposing a ­public register of royal interests.Calls have been increasing for greater scrutiny of the royal family and their finances after a series of scandals involving Andrew.Foulkes’ intervention comes as new court documents revealed ­further details about the ­relationship between the prince, 64, and the ­convicted paedophile,Jeffrey Epstein.Emails released on Friday show that, in February 2011, a “member of the royal family”, believed to be Andrew, wrote: “Keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”The email contradicts claims made by Andrew in his disastrous 2019 BBCNewsnightinterview with Emily Maitlis that he had ceased all contact with Epstein in December 2010.The prince has also been criticised for his business relationshipwith an alleged Chinese spy.Foulkes said that parliament’s clerks have vetoed every attempt to raise concerns about Andrew and other royals. They have argued that parliament’s standing orders andErskine May, the authority on ­parliamentary procedure, prevent discussion of the monarchy and of any matters that reflect on the sovereign or royal family.Foulkes believes there should be changes to the rules to allow ­discussion beyond the current limit of questions about the cost to the taxpayer of royal palaces and events attended by the royals.Taxpayer funding to King Charles is set toincrease by 53% this yearto £132m. Foulkes said there were concerns, particularly among newly elected Labour MPs, about the amount of public money spent by the king and members of the royal family. Andrew received taxpayers’ money until he was forced to stand down from his official royal duties in November 2019 afterNewsnight.“It’s about wider accountability,” Foulkes said. “I was particularly ­concerned about where public money is spent. That’s why the Andrew issue is something that’s interested me particularly.”He added: “There is very great ­sensitivity in parliament and ­particularly in the House of Lords, as you would expect, and a lot of ­deference to the monarch, which is understandable in many ways.“But I think one of the things is to separate the monarch or head of state from the royal family, the rest of them. “Where does the royal family stop? All the grandchildren, the cousins, the nieces, the nephews … It’s not defined. The restriction can be used in relation to any of them.“Do the rules apply to Andrew, who is no longer a working member of the family?”Despite the fact that the number of working royals has fallen in recent years, as part of King Charles’svision for a “slimmed-down monarchy”, Whitehall retains a wide definition of the royal family.The information ­commissioner’s guidelines on exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act, for example, includes a large ­number of the extended family, ­including Princess Anne’s children, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, who have never had a royal title or undertaken official duties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The alternative is to let them go bust, except when that happens the council will still need to raise council tax above the cap as part of the recovery process,” he added.According to the County Councils Network, 85% of local authorities say they are in a worse position than before the autumn budget andlocal government finance settlement.A spokesperson for the network said most councils would be making steep cuts in adult social care, school transport and libraries to cap the rise in council tax at 5%. “Considering there is very little fat left to cut from many of these services already, a further reduction will have a material impact on our residents,” they said.Ministers could also opt to allow an increase in borrowing or for central government to cancel the debts of selected councils.However, borrowing by councils has already hit record levels, according to the latest official figures.Carr-West said bailouts that involved debts being written off were unlikely. “If ministers bail out some local authorities and not others, what’s to say there won’t be lots of other councils asking why not them?” he added.Tory-controlled Hampshire county council has asked permission for a 14.99% council tax rise – equivalent to a £230 increase on a band D property – and has vowed to hold a local referendum to try to get the rise it needs if ministers turn down its request.Hampshire said sticking to the 4.99% rise chosen by the majority of upper-tier councils would not address itslong-running financial problemsand would “increase the likelihood” that it would declare effective insolvency in the next few months.Although the council accepts there is little public support for a 15% rise, it said there was evidence the public would prefer above-cap rises to further service cuts. The increase would bring its average council tax bills up to the level of other county councils. It has put the cost of a referendum at £2m.The council has a £180m hole in its budget caused largely by the increasing costs of adult and children’s social care services. It says that after years of underfunding it can no longer balance its budget by simply cutting services.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWindsor and Maidenhead council, controlled by the Liberal Democrats, has proposed a 25% rise – meaning £320 a year, or £6.15 a week on a band D property. It said in December thatwithout government support, including permission for the council tax rise, effectively bankruptcy was “almost inevitable”.Labour-run Bradford is seeking a maximum 14.99% council tax rise – which would put an extra £250 on bills for a band D property. After years of government underfunding, it has a deficit of £120m and £600m of repayable emergency financial support loans to keep it from bankruptcy.It believes a large one-off council tax rise will bring it into line with neighbouring councils, stabilise its finances and help it pay off its loans earlier. But the council, overseeing the most deprived areas of England, will find it hard to justify big rises to residents at a time when many are struggling.Other English councils considering above-cap rises include: Newham in east London, Birmingham, and Cheshire East (10%) and Slough (7.99%). Somerset council has written to ministers asking for the green light for an above 4.99% rise.All councils lobbying for a lift in the cap say they will still need to make steep cuts in services and care provision.Some councils who initially raised the prospect of above-cap rises have pulled back from the brink: Bristol, and North Somerset, which floated 15% increases, decided to go for 4.99%, the maximum rise allowed under cap rules.Sir Stephen Houghton, the leader of Barnsley council and chair of the Sigoma group of English urban authorities, said above-cap rises were the culmination of years of underfunding from central government. “Places like Bradford don’t do this for no good reason. Residents won’t like it but the council’s first priority has to be to stabilise the council.”North Somerset council opted for 4.99% after consulting residents on proposed rises of between 7% and 15%. Only 27% backed an above-5% increase.The council leader, Mike Bell, said: “North Somerset receives around £50m a year less in council tax and government grant income than the typical English council. We need urgent reform of local government funding so that every part of the country gets fair access to the services they need.”A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said:“This is pure speculation. No decisions have been made on council tax increases and we will only consider agreeing to requests for rises above 3%, with 2% for the adult social care precept, in exceptional circumstances.”Explore more on these topicsLocal governmentLocal politicsCouncil taxTax and spendingPublic financenewsShareReuse this content"

Some wore traditional black outfits, while others sported pink ribbons or carried pink handbags. Mourners signed a book of condolence outside.In a eulogy, Denise Nolan-Anderson said of Linda: “She really loved going to premieres and opening nights, having her beautiful hair and makeup done, and always was the life and soul of any big occasion. She would have loved all the fuss today.”View image in fullscreenLinda, right, performing in the Nolans with (from left) Coleen, Maureen and Bernie in 1981.Photograph: Andre Csillag/Rex/ShutterstockEntertainers including the EastEnders actor Shane Richie and Paul Elliott, the comedian better known as Paul Chuckle of the Chuckle Brothers, were among those who attended the service.Elliott said of the singer: “She was just a fun, bubbly person. The world’s a darker place without her.”Dublin-born Nolan along with her sisters was part of the pop group the Nolans, best known for their 70s hit, I’m in the Mood for Dancing. The singer died on 15 January, aged 65, two decades after being diagnosed with cancer.Nolan lost her husband, Brian Hudson, to skin cancer in 2007. He was 60. A private service took place after the funeral at a crematorium, where she was laid to rest with her husband’s ashes.Her sister Coleen told the Mirror: “My first thought after she died was to put Brian’s ashes with Linda’s. So that’s what we’re doing. In life, they were never apart, so I’m glad they’ll be together again.”In 2005, Nolan was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent a mastectomy in 2006 and was in remission in 2011.In 2017, she fell on her hip and was taken to hospital, where doctors discovered an incurable secondary breast cancer on her pelvis. The tumours subsequently spread to her brain and ultimately stopped responding to regular treatment.In 2023 Nolan said she was preparing for “the inevitable” and that she had “sobbed” to her consultant when she heard the treatment was ineffective.View image in fullscreenLinda Nolan’s coffin.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty“I had feared something was wrong. My balance has been getting worse, and my memory – my sisters have to prompt me when I get lost in the middle of a sentence,” she told the Mirror.“Maureen came with me to the appointment and my Macmillan cancer support nurse was in the room, and I could just tell. I asked my consultant straight away: ‘Has it spread?’“When he told me, I immediately asked: ‘What do we do now?’”Nolan came down with double pneumonia earlier in January and was taken to Blackpool Victoria hospital, where she became comatose, her manager Dermot McNamara said. She died “with her loving siblings by her bedside”, he added.View image in fullscreenLinda Nolan with her husband, Brian Hudson, at their wedding in 1981.Photograph: Kevin Holt/ANL/Rex/ShutterstockNolan’s sister Anne posted on social media before the funeral that Linda would be “thrilled” if her friends and fans came to say their goodbyes.The Instagram message called Nolan a “beloved sister, friend and entertainer” and a “symbol of hope, humour and resilience”.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockBlackpoolLancashireIrelandNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The tragedy has been blamed squarely on government ineptitude and graft.“What we are seeing are the greatest street protests in the history of Serbia,” said Dejan Bagarić, a master’s student speaking from the city. “There’s never been anything like it, people are really animated because everybody has had enough of corruption and this government is very corrupt.”‘We are done with corruption’: how the students of Serbia rose up against the systemRead moreSaturday’s outpouring of dissent – the culmination of sit-ins and protests that began in November – have focused on what demonstrators have described as the government’s striking unwillingness to accept any accountability for the tragedy. Reconstruction of the station was carried out in collaboration with a Chinese state consortium, as part of a large infrastructure project that critics contend paid little, if any, attention to safety regulations.“There was no transparency, no public tenders for the contract and then when the accident happened, no desire for justice,” said Čedomir Stojković, a leading human rights lawyer who filed a criminal complaint that eventually spurred prosecutors to launch an inquiry. “Instead, the government did what it always does, it went ahead with a full-scale cover-up. There’s a lot of solidarity, a lot of empathy for the students, more and more people are coming out in support of them, professors, farmers, everyone.”1:06Serbian president not interested in 'most corrupt and deceitful' Guardian coverage – videoBy last week the anti-government rallies had spread to more than 100 provincial towns and villages nationwide.The scale of the protests had, said Stojković, proved “beyond any doubt” that the demonstrations were not only fuelled by disgust over corruption, an ill that has come to be identified with everything that is wrong with the EU candidate nation, but were a way for citizens to vent their unhappiness with their nationalist president’s increasingly authoritarian rule.For a generation raised on the internet, knowledge of the world beyond impoverished Serbia is readily available. Also unprecedented is the ability to rapidly arrange protests by circumventing state-controlled media – tens of thousands of striking students participated in a 24-hour blockade of a major intersection in Belgrade last week.Vučić had faced similar protests last year following allegations of rigged elections, facilitated, opponents say, by a media landscape that remains one of the most censored inEurope. Unlike these demonstrations, however, it was opposition parties, themselves often discredited, who led the backlash.“People want the government and Vučić to finally go,” said Stojković, who participated as a student in mass protests over 25 years ago against Slobodan Milošević, the late Yugoslav strongman and former president of Serbia, whose policies triggered the region’s descent into bloodthirsty genocide. The protests paved the way to Milošević eventually being toppled in 2000.“These students were children when Vučić became president eight years ago and they want democracy. It’s been building up … this is the moment just before the balloon is pricked by the needle. It has caught [the government] unaware.”On Friday, as hundreds of students reached Novi Sad on foot after a two-day, 80km trek from Belgrade, Vučić, addressing the protests, told the nation: “Our country is under attack, from abroad and from inside,” echoing earlier claims that the protesters were working for unspecified foreign powers to oust the government.The ruling Serbian Progressive party has tried to defuse the situation by releasing classified documents about the railway station’s collapse and has even gone so far as to say it will meet all the students’ demands. This week, in what was seen as a first victory,Vučić’s close ally, prime minister Miloš Vučević, resignedbut few believe the protests are about to fizzle out.With youth unemployment at record levels and graduates forced in ever growing numbers to move abroad in search of work, there is a growing sense among young Serbs that there is little to lose.To defy government crackdowns, the students have deliberately avoided being associated with a leadership of any sort, ensuring that decisions are taken in concert in plenary sessions.“We are not choosing violence and for now the government is not choosing violence either,” Bagarić said at the protests in Novi Sad.As the protests swelled, Srđan Milivojević, who leads the opposition Democratic party, said it was clear Serbia’s young demonstrators were now dictating events.“It’s irrelevant how the government reacts,” he said as he drove along the car-choked highway linking Belgrade with Novi Sad. “The students are dictating the tempo of the protests and they will continue to do so until Vučić falls.”Explore more on these topicsSerbiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Nineteen others were injured, the Philadelphia mayor, Cherelle Parker, said.The half-dozen people killed onboard the airplane, all from Mexico, included a child patient receiving care in Philadelphia, her mother and four others, including crew members. The plane, which crashed a mere 30 seconds after taking off, erupted into a fireball and set several homes ablaze.“I mourn the passing of six Mexicans in the aviation accident in Philadelphia, United States,” Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said in a Spanish-languageposton X. “Consular authorities are in constant contact with the families; I’ve asked the foreign affairs secretary to support whatever is needed. My solidarity with their loved ones and friends.”The patient had just completed treatment at Shriners Children’s hospital and was on the jet with her mother and four crew members.“The patient had received care from Shriners Children’s Philadelphia and was being transported back to her home country in Mexico on a contracted air ambulance when the crash happened,” Shriners spokesperson Mel Bower said in a statement.“Because of patient privacy concerns, we cannot say any more about the patient and her family at this time.”The plane was registered in Mexico. Police said it was on medical assignment.It was the second fatal crash in 15 months for Jet Rescue. In 2023, five crew members were killed when their plane overran a runway in the central Mexican state of Morelos and crashed into a hillside.The Philadelphia crash happened less than 3 miles (4.8km) from Northeast Philadelphia airport, which primarily serves business jets and charter flights. It came two days after acommercial airliner collided with a military helicopter near Reagan Washington National airport outside of Washington DC, killing all 67 aboard both aircraft.Photos taken at the Jet Rescue crash site appear to show homes on fire. Fire officials confirmed that multiple structures were on fire following the crash around 6pm ET in the area of Cottman Avenue and Roosevelt Boulevard.Adam Thiel, Philadelphia’s managing director, said during a press conference on Saturday that the crash scene was a very large area with a lot of damage and authorities were working to assess the damage.It is “entirely possible” that there will be changes to the casualty figures being reported thus far, Thiel said. He added that there were “a lot of unknowns” as to who was where on the streets of the neighborhood when the plane crashed.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) released a statement about 6.40pm confirming the crashed plane was a Learjet 55 and had initially said two people were onboard. The agencylater changedthat assessment to confirm that six people had been onboard. Sean Duffy, the US secretary of transportation, also said there were at least six people onboard.The FAA statement said the plane had been en route to Springfield-Branson National airport in Missouri. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board would investigate, it said.mapFlight data showed a small jet taking off from the airport at 6.06pm and disappearing from radar about 30 seconds later after climbing to an altitude of 1,600ft (487 meters). It was unclear what led to the crash.The plane was a medical transport jet and was registered to a company operating as Med Jets.State and local officials said late on Friday they could not yet confirm how many people might have died on the ground after the plane slammed into a heavily populated portion of the city. Injuries had been reported, police said.Pennsylvania’s governor, Josh Shapiro, told a press conference at the crash scene that “we know there will be loss in this region”.“We want to offer our thoughts and our serious prayers for those that are grieving at this moment,” he said.Donald Trump, the US president, wrote on social media that it was “so sad to see the plane go down in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. More innocent souls lost. Our people are totally engaged. First responders are already being given credit for doing a great job.”Shapiro posted on social media that he was in communication with the mayor and emergency responders. “We are offering all commonwealth resources as they respond to the small private plane crash in Northeast Philly,” he wrote.Videos posted on social media showed a bright streak as the plane plunged at a steep angle towards the ground, then a large explosion with a ball of flame and smoke rising from the crash site.Michael Schiavone, 37, was sitting at his home in Mayfair on Friday when he heard a loud bang and his house shook. He said it felt like a small earthquake and when he checked his home security camera footage, it looked like a missile was coming down. “There was a large explosion, so I thought we were under attack for a second,” he said.The plane crashed in a busy intersection near Roosevelt Mall, an outdoor shopping center where, afterwards, first responders blocked traffic and onlookers crowded onto a street corner in the residential neighborhood of Rhawnhurst. Philadelphia’s emergency management office said roads had been closed in the area.One cellphone video taken by a witness moments after the plane crashed showed a chaotic scene with debris scattered across the intersection. A wall of orange glowed just beyond the intersection as a plume of black smoke quickly rose into the sky, while some witnesses could be heard crying and sirens blared.Jet Rescue, according to its website, is a licensed and insured company that has more than 20 years of experience providing critical care air ambulance services from Mexico, Latin America and the Caribbean to the US and Canada.Friday’s incident took place a mere two days after the US suffered its deadliest air disaster in a generation. An American Airlines jet, carrying 60 passengers and four crew members, suffered a midair collision with an army helicopter, carrying three crew members, in Washington DC on Wednesday night. Nobody survived.Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphiaPennsylvanianewsShareReuse this content"

Hegseth declined to elaborate, saying he didn’t want to get “into anything that’s classified”.The UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter’s unit, the 12th aviation battalion, is assigned a mission to evacuate top US officials fromWashington DCto secure locations in the event of an emergency.Those locations include Raven Rock Mountain, a facility in Pennsylvania constructed in the 1950s for use as a command center in the event of a nuclear war.Washington DC plane crash: ‘black box’ data recorder recovered from Black Hawk helicopter – as it happenedRead moreHegseth’s comments correlate with comments by Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for the army’s aviation directorate, who told reporters on Thursday that “some of their mission is to support the Department of Defense if something really bad happens in this area, and we need to move our senior leaders.“They do need to be able to understand the environment, the air traffic, the routes, to ensure the safe travel of our senior leaders throughout our government,” Koziol added.A preliminary FAA report into the midair collision has found that responsibility for handling air traffic control for helicopters and incoming planes at Reagan National airport had been combined earlier than usual on Wednesday night when the American Airlines flight crashed into the army’s Black Hawk helicopter.All 67 people aboard the aircraft involved were killed, marking the deadliest American aviation crash in 16 years.Typically, responsibility for handling helicopters and planes are separated in the busy airspace from 10am to 9.30pm,the New York Times reported. After 9.30pm, when traffic slows down, the duties can be combined. The collision occurred soon before 9pm.The FAA preliminary safety report found that staffing at the airport was “not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic”, the Associated Press reported. Staffing targets set by the FAA and the controllers’ union call for 30 air traffic controllers at the airport, but as of September 2023 it had 19.Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on aviation safety on Thursday that he said will undo “damage” done to federal agencies by the Biden administration. Trump has said “incompetence” may have played a role in the crash.Less than 30 seconds before the helicopter and plane collided, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the plane in sight: “PAT-25, do you have the CRJ in sight?” The controller made another radio call to PAT-25 moments later: “PAT-25, pass behind the CRJ,” referring to the Canadian-made Bombardier CRJ-700.But there is mounting speculation that the helicopter’s pilots may have been looking at a plane following behind the American Airlines flight in the landing queue. Questions are also being asked about the altitude of the helicopter. It was cleared to fly at 200ft but appears to have ascended to 400ft, and into the path of the airliner.As of Friday afternoon, rescue crews had recovered 41 bodies and 28 had been positively identified, the DC fire chief, John Donnelly Sr, said at a news conference. He said 18 families had been told their loved ones had died.Among the passengers on the plane were members of the Skating Club of Boston returning from a development camp that followed the 2025 US figure skating championship in Wichita, Kansas.The victims also included a group of hunters returning from a guided trip in Kansas, nine students and parents from Fairfax county, Virginia, schools, four members of a steamfitters’ local in suburban Maryland and two Chinese nationals.The army has identified two of the three soldiers on the helicopter: Staff Sgt Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia, and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. The third soldier’s name was not being released at the family’s request, the army said.Explore more on these topicsWashington DC plane crashUS militaryWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

Like almost all Parisians at the time, they rented their home, a two-room flat where they lived with their two young daughters.Five years later, after the Germans occupiedFrance, the fate of the Malowanczyk family echoed that of many Jews in the city. Israël was deported, while Hélène and the girls fled to the southern “free zone” not under direct Nazi control.When Hélène and her daughters returned to Paris after the city was liberated in August 1944, she found not only had their home been stripped of all its furniture and belongings, but it was occupied by another couple – André Pescheteau, a mechanic, and his dressmaker wife, Yvonne.Forced to move in with surviving relatives, Hélène learned Israël had died at Auschwitz, among 40,000 Paris Jews to perish in the death camps.View image in fullscreenThe contents of the Jewish homes in wartime Paris being sorted after their removal from households.Photograph: Bunderarchiv KoblenzIn June 1946 a court declared Hélène could not return to the apartment, where the Pescheteau family remained until 1956.Now a new book,Appartements témoins(Homes as Witnesses of the Holocaust),released on the80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, reveals how the Malowanczyk family were not an isolated case. French authorities refused to allow tens of thousands of Parisian Jews who survived the war to return to their homes.The book suggests that, far from being sympathetic, the occupants who moved into Jewish homes seemed surprised and often disappointed that the previous tenants had survived and wanted their apartments back.Sarah Gensburger, a professor at the elite Paris university Sciences Po and, with Isabelle Backouche and Eric Le Bourhis co-author of the book, which is based on a 10-year study of previously unseen archive documents, said it examined the city street by street and gives a new perspective on the behaviour of Parisians confronted with the persecution of Jews.“The received wisdom is that after theVel d’Hiv roundupand mass arrests of July 1942, Parisians felt solidarity with the Jews. But our research shows this is a simple view,” said Gensburger.View image in fullscreenThe Nazi flag flies from the Arc de Triomphe during the occupation of Paris in June 1940.Photograph: Print Collector/Getty Images“Initiated by the city administration, for a lot of Parisians, there was an assumption that the Jews would not be coming back. And after the war, a lot of the people living in Jewish homes were quite affronted that the Jewish family had returned.“These apartments were coveted, and the non-Jewish men and women who had an interest in appropriating them had an interest in the Jewish families disappearing and thought this would be final.”At the outbreak of the second world war, the estimated 200,000 Jews living in and around Paris were spread across the region and, like most Parisians, rented their homes.Prewar, only7% of city properties were exclusively owner-occupied and rental agreements were passed on through generations of the same family. Tenancies were protected and rents, controlled since 1918, were low.When theNazis arrived in June 1940, they began the systematic arrest and deportation of Jews and seized their properties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Three weeks later, Hélène and her daughters – warned of another impending roundup – locked the doors of 118 Avenue Parmentier, leaving almost everything behind except a few clothes and an album of family photographs, before fleeing the city for the free zone in southern France.The Malowanczyks were one of 25,000 Jewish families who were not allowed to return home, Gensburger said.French officials argued that non-Jewish families whose homes had been damaged or bombed needed to remain in the apartments they had been allocated. Moving into Jewish homes was, the book says, seen as “normal and widespread behaviour”.“The letters received, now in the national archives, allow us to see the enthusiasm of the Parisians to profit from the persecution of Jews in order to satisfy their expectations in terms of housing,” the book states.Gensburger added: “We are talking about ordinary people, who were not collaborators or raging antisemites, but who were encouraged to appropriate these apartments by the politics of the public authorities, who signalled that it was permitted to take the homes of Jews who had left.“It’s important to understand that these people, the public authorities and the prefecture all agreed that the Jews were not coming back. Everyone was convinced that they were finished. Even when the Jewish tenants were still paying their rent.” Gensburger said that while the spoliation of artworks and other valuables has been recognised and addressed, the loss of homes, has not.French politicians join 100,000 at Paris march against antisemitismRead more“No one but Jews lost their apartments,” she said. “The book is full of individual stories but its importance is as a collective story, even for the Jewish families themselves, to understand what really happened.“Today, part of the historiography considers that the state collaborated with the Nazis and antisemitic ideologies but most of the civil population was sympathetic to the Jews. But the population of Paris and around found an interest in the persecution of the Jews and this interest was legitimised, banalised by the authorities who sacrificed a minority for the majority as public policy.”Explore more on these topicsFranceThe ObserverSecond world warParisAntisemitismNazismnewsShareReuse this content"

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIf placed under the state department, USAid could become a more explicit armature of foreign policy goals than it has been as the world’s largest single donor of life-saving humanitarian operations.USAid has in the past been able to assist countries with whom the United States has no diplomatic relations, including Iran. A source at the agency told Reuters that the non-alignment with the US diplomatic mission had helped build bridges that might not have come to be under purely political objectives.Perhaps signaling the new administration’s plan to fold the agency under the state department, Trump has not nominated a person to run USAid.The costs of a freeze on US foreign aid grants is already being felt. Field hospitals in Thai refugee camps, landmine clearance in war zones, and drugs to treat millions suffering from diseases such as HIV are among the programs facing defunding.In fiscal year 2023, the United States disbursed $72bn of assistance worldwide on everything from women’s health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIV/Aids treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work. It provided 42% of all humanitarian aid tracked by the United Nations in 2024.Following Trump’s executive order last week, the state department issued worldwide stop-work directives, effectively freezing all foreign aid with the exception of emergency food assistance in a move that experts warned risked killing people.Rubio earlier this week issued an additional waiver for “life-saving humanitarian assistance” while Washington undertakes the 90-day review.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS foreign policyDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Russian crew assembled on the Kildin’s aft deck and uncovered the lifeboats, but did not ask for help, and after five hours fighting the fire the Kildin restarted its engines and got under way again.According to western security services, the ship was in the eastern Mediterranean to monitor events inSyriaafter the fall in December of the Moscow ally Bashar al-Assad, as the Russian navy began to move military equipment out of the part of the Tartus port it controls.The western sources argued that the Kildin fire, after another blaze two months earlier on the Russian missile frigate the Admiral Gorshkov, revealed Russia’s maritime presence in the area to be in a state of disrepair and disarray. They said that, at the same time that the Kildin was in distress, two other Russian naval vessels, the landing ships Ivan Gren and the Aleksandr Otrakovsky were also adrift temporarily without control of navigation.Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that mishaps on Russian naval vessels were nothing new, and not confined to the Mediterranean.“The Russian navy has historically struggled with maintenance and readiness issues. Fires are not uncommon. Operations are undoubtedly taking a toll on an ageing Russian fleet, which lacks sufficient maintenance and support facilities,” Kofman said.Those problems could become much more severe if the new rulers in Damascus, the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), deprive Russia of the use of the Tartus base. So far, Moscow has kept a toehold in post-Assad Syria, at Tartus and the Khmeimim airbase, but the new government’s longer-term intentions are unclear in regard to the forces that helped keep the Assad regime in power for decades.Last week, theHTS cancelled a 2019 contractwith a Russian company, ending its control of the Tartus commercial port, which Moscow had hoped would be a $500m hub for exporting Russian agricultural products to the wider Middle East. That was a bad omen for the naval base, said Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow on sea power at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) in London.“The cancellation of the commercial arrangement is the writing on the wall for the navy, given how hand-in-hand the commercial and the strategic positions were,” Kaushal said.The loss of Tartus would turn chronic problems in the Russian fleet into a crisis, he argued.“The Russian navy, post cold war, wasn’t really built for endurance,” Kaushal said. “They built smaller vessels that they could build more rapidly, and packed them very heavily with missiles. That is very useful if you’re defending your own coastal waters but [over longer distances] the smaller the vessel, the more acute the maintenance problems.”He added: “This is, and always has been, an issue for the Russians, but the issue will become much more significant in light of the potential loss of Tartus.”Moscow is looking for alternatives in the Mediterranean, but all the options are problematic, according to aRusi paperthis month by Kaushal and Cmdr Edward Black, a former Royal Navy mine clearance diving officer now a visiting fellow at the institute.Algeria is a longstanding Russian ally, but Moscow’s activities in Mali, where Wagner group mercenaries prop up a military junta, have driven a wedge between the two countries.In Sudan’s civil war, Russia switched allegiances last year from the Rapid Support Forces to the Sudan Armed Forces, in a move most observers believe to be aimed at securing the use of Port Sudan on the Red Sea. However, access from there to the Mediterranean is dependent on use of the Suez canal, and negotiations with the Sudanese authorities have floundered.A third option would be easternLibya, where two ports, Tobruk and Benghazi, are under the sway of a Russian-backed general, Khalifa Haftar, and there are already an estimated 2,000 Russian mercenaries in the region.A Russian base in Libya is the most likely alternative to Tartus, the Rusi study suggests, but it pointed out that it would make Russia’s ailing Mediterranean fleet a hostage to Haftar and his future choice of allies, and is therefore fraught with political risk for Moscow.Explore more on these topicsRussiaSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaAlgeriaLibyanewsShareReuse this content"

Containment refers to how much of a perimeter has been established around a fire to prevent it from growing,according to NBC News.The Palisades fire erupted on 7 January north of Malibu, in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood. The blaze began as a brush fire and rapidly spread amid southern California’s arid conditions.That night, the Eaton fire broke out inLos Angelescounty. This blaze started in the Angeles national forest’s foothills, according to NBC News and, like the Palisades fire, was fueled by dry conditions.California officials investigate utilities company in search for cause of firesRead moreThe Palisades fire engulfed 23,448 acres (9,489 hectares) and the Eaton fire burned 14,021 (5,674), officials said, and both infernos were made more powerful by the strong Santa Ana winds. Early estimates puteconomic lossesat more than $250bn.Authorities are now probing the fires’ origins. With the Palisades fire, investigators are studying whether a small fire, which firefighters thought they had extinguished, was rekindled by hurricane-force winds across the area,the Los Angeles Timessaid.Officials investigating the Eaton fire are examining whether utilities played a role. LA superior court judge Ashfaq G Chowdhury ordered Southern California Edison to preserve its equipment, data and evidence related to the Eaton blaze, according to the Times.A handful of homeowners have sued Southern California Edison, claiming that its equipment sparked the fire. Authorities are focusing on the base of an electrical tower on an Eaton Canyon hill.Area residents recorded photos and video of what could be the first flames from the Eaton fire, which appear to be at the bottom of an electrical transmission tower before it spread downhill toward houses, the Los Angeles Timesreported.Southern California Edison has been linked to multiple wildfires. Investigators determined that faulty equipment spurred 2017’s Thomas fire and2018’s Woolsey fire, which killed three people and caused $6bn in damage.Southern California Edison has said it will cooperate with authorities.“While this remains an ongoing investigation, we’re continuing our commitment to transparency and we’ll continue to fully cooperate with the investigation,” Kathleen Dunleavy, a Southern California Edison spokesperson, said.California has previously seen wildfires sparked by other utility equipment. The Camp fire, which left 85 people dead and razed the town of Paradise, started when a century-old piece of power equipment malfunctioned and spewed sparks into brush.The Pacific Gas and Electric utility company pleaded guilty to dozens of counts of involuntary manslaughter and settled with local municipalities for $560m and survivors of the Camp fire, and other fatal infernos, for $13.5bn. Pacific Gas and Electric equipment also caused theZoggand Dixie wildfires in California.Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresLos AngelesWildfiresCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Martin won outright on the first ballot, capturing 246.5 votes of the 428 ballots cast; his closest competitor – Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic party – won 134.5 votes on the first ballot.“Thank you to the DNC members who have put their faith in my vision for our party,” Martin said in his victory speech.“We’re going to get to work. We’re going to fight; we’re going to go out there and take this fight to Donald Trump and the Republicans, and we’re going to fight for working people again in this party.”A longtime state leader with extensive ties within the Democratic National Committee, Martin inherits a party that appears disillusioned and despondent in the wake of Trump’s victory. The outgoing chair, Jaime Harrison of South Carolina, chose not to seek re-election after the party lost not only the White House but both chambers of Congress in the November elections.Martin emerged victorious from a crowded field of candidates that largely agreed on the major structural and reputational challenges facing the Democratic party as Trump begins his second term in the White House. Most chair candidates emphasized the need to reconnect with the working-class Americans who have moved sharply to the right and to find more effective means of communicating their values to voters.Martin’s supporters touted his victory as a promising first step to rebuilding the party and winning back young and working-class communities, where Trump made strong inroads in November. Martin’s first major test will come next year, asDemocratsattempt to regain control of the House of Representatives, where Republicans currently hold a narrow advantage.“Ken Martin leading the DNC is a big step to building a party that can energize young voters and working-class voters so that we can defeat the far-right,” said Stevie O’Hanlon, political director of the youth climate group Sunrise Movement. “Under Ken Martin, the Minnesota DFL won a trifecta and immediately pursued a populist agenda that should have set a model for Democrats nationally.”But Wikler’s supporters expressed severe disappointment over his loss, framing Martin’s victory as the perpetuation of a dangerous status quo that would further damage the Democratic party’s brand with voters.“This is an insider’s game,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which endorsed Wikler. “A perfectly fine longtime insider won, but we missed a transformational leader at a time when we need to show voters Democrats are doing things differently. Everyone wishes Ken the best.”In his victory speech, Martin pledged to unify Democrats and incorporate the best ideas from his competitors in the chair race to ensure a stronger party moving forward.“We’re going to bring them into this great party,” Martin said. “We’re going to unify this party together, and we’re all going to roll up our sleeves together to build this party.”It remains unclear how effective the next chair will be in implementing his agenda. In recent years, the committee has mostly served as an administrative body focused on fundraising, coordinating among state parties and setting rules for presidential primaries.Faiz Shakir, the former campaign manager for Bernie Sanders who launched a last-minute and ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the chair role,recently toldthe Guardian that the committee must seize this opportunity to move in a bolder direction.“When Democrats have a Democratic president in charge, it is often the case that [the Democratic National Committee] is working at the behest of the president of the United States,” Shakir said. “But now, when we don’t have the presidency, you take that structure and you say: ‘What is the most important thing that we have to do?’”Martin will begin answering that question in the coming days, and his response will help determine whether Democrats can once again capture the House majority in 2026 and eventually win back the White House in 2028.Explore more on these topicsDemocratsUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Republican senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a medical doctor who boasts on his official website of an effort he created to vaccinate 36,000 children against hepatitis B, expressed hesitancy about Kennedy’s nomination and is seen as a key vote.The AP found that in addition to the physicians who had faced disciplinary action, many of the nearly 800 signers are not doctors. The letter with the names of those who signed was provided to the AP by Senator Ron Johnson’s office after he entered it into the congressional record on Wednesday during the first of Kennedy’s two confirmation hearings.Among those who signed it were a self-described journalist, a certified public accountant, a firefighter/paramedic, a certified health coach and someone who said they had a bachelor’s degree “with an emphasis on Jungian psychology”. The signers include at least 75 nurses, as well as physician’s assistants. More than 90 did not include any credentials at all.RFK Jr dodges clear answers on vaccines as Senate grilling enters second dayRead moreMore than 20 were chiropractors, representing an industry that has funded Kennedy’s work. An AP investigation found that donations from a chiropractic group represented one-sixth of the revenues collected by Kennedy’s anti-vaccine non-profit in 2019.The letter was organized and submitted by Maha Action, which is run by Del Bigtree, who worked for Kennedy’s presidential campaign and is a longtime anti-vaccine activist. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that Kennedy transferred the trademark for the “Maha” slogan to a limited liability company run by Bigtree. Kennedy reported that he had received $100,000 in income from licensing the slogan but said in his financial disclosures that he had transferred the trademark for “no compensation”.Maha stands for “Make America healthy again”, a play on Donald Trump’s “Make America great again”.Emma Post, a Maha Action spokesperson, said in an email that the letter had been “shared and circulated organically in a grassroots manner with explicit instructions that it was for physicians only to sign on to”. She did not address the AP’s questions about what further steps the group took to verify credentials, if any.Bigtree and Kennedy did not return messages seeking comment. A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, said the administration looks forward to the Senate’s swift confirmation of Kennedy.The letter includes the header “Doctors for Robert F Kennedy Jr” and begins with the words “We, the undersigned physicians”. It says lower down that it “reflects the collective voice of physicians and medical professionals” committed to addressing chronic disease.The AP’s review found that at least 10 doctors who signed the letter had run into trouble with state medical boards or their board-certification bodies for a variety of alleged misconduct. Sanctions they faced included having their licenses revoked or suspended, being put on probation, receiving a reprimand or other action. One received a warning letter from the Federal Trade Commission, which said he was unlawfully advertising products as treatments or prevention for Covid-19, including intravenous nutrient therapy and vitamins.Among the signers was Paul Thomas, an anti-vaccine doctor who voluntarily surrendered his medical license in 2022 after Oregon’s medical board found he had engaged in repeated and gross negligence in the practice of medicine.Thomas did not admit or deny the finding. NBC News reported that Thomas had been part of a team assembled by Kennedy who remotely advised an anti-vaccine activist in Samoa during a measles outbreak there on how to treat children with vitamins. A person who responded on behalf of Thomas, DeeDee Hoover, said the information the AP had was inaccurate but did not reply when asked what specifically was wrong.Other signers included Dr Simone Gold, who was reprimanded by California’s medical board after she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for her conduct at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. Gold was recently pardoned by Trump and told the AP in an email that her reprimand and other disciplinary actions had been overturned by a judge prior to her pardon.“Robert F Kennedy Jr is an honorable and honest person with vast subject matter knowledge and experience who values the health of the American people, and furthermore because he is willing to challenge corporate interests where they conflict with the best interests of those citizens,” Gold wrote in an email.Meryl Nass, whose medical license was suspended in Maine over her treatment of Covid-19 patients, also signed. She told the AP she is appealing the decision and expects to be fully vindicated.At least two of the doctors were disciplined, prior to the pandemic, for improperly giving out vaccine waivers, including one who had his license revoked and another who was put on probation. Another doctor’s license was revoked for refusing to follow Covid-19 guidelines.Post said Maha Action’s letter was just one of several provided to the Senate supporting Kennedy, including one that she provided a link to that she said was signed by “17,000 medical professionals”. That letter stated it was from international medical providers and did not include the names of those who had signed.Opponents of Kennedy’s nomination sent their own letter with signatures from what they said were more than 18,000 “vetted and verified” doctors. The group, the Committee to Protect Health Care, said that the letter had initially been circulated among verified physicians and that as additional signatures were added, their credentials were checked. The group provided the list of signatories to the AP but with anonymized names that included the first initial of their first name along with the first three letters of their last name, as well as their medical credentials. They said doctors’ names were anonymized for their privacy and to protect them from harassment.Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationUS SenateUS CongressUS healthcareUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Bove, the acting deputy attorney general, said he would not “tolerate subversive personnel actions by the previous administration”.Any mass firings at the FBI would be a major blow to the historic independence from the White House of the nation’s premier federal law enforcement agency but would be in keeping with Trump’s persistent resolve to bend the law enforcement and intelligence community to his will. It would be part of a startling pattern of retribution waged on federal government employees, following the forced ousters of a group of senior FBI executives earlier this week as well as a broad termination by the justice department of prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith’s team who investigated Trump.The FBI Agents Association said the reported efforts to oust agents represented “outrageous actions by acting officials” that were “fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI agents”.“Dismissing potentially hundreds of agents would severely weaken the bureau’s ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the bureau and its new leadership for failure,” the association said in a statement.When pressed during his confirmation hearing on Thursday, Trump’s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, said he was not aware of any plans to terminate or otherwise punish FBI employees who were involved in the Trump investigations. Patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the FBI’s internal review processes for taking action against employees.Asked by the Democratic senator Cory Booker whether he would reverse any decisions before his confirmation that didn’t follow that standard process, Patel said: “I don’t know what’s going on right now over there, but I’m committed to you, senator, and your colleagues, that I will honor the due process of the FBI.”Before he was nominated for the director’s position, Patel had remarked on at least one podcast appearance about what he called anti-Trump “conspirators” in the government and news media who he said needed to be rooted out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He fired one FBI director, James Comey, amid the Russia investigation and then replaced his second, Christopher Wray, just weeks after his win in November.Asked at the White House on Friday if he had anything to do with the scrutiny of the agents, he said: “No, but we have some very bad people over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody’s never seen before. They came after a lot of people – like me – but they came after a lot of people.”He added: “If they fired some people over there, that’s a good thing, because they were very bad.”The FBI and Smith’s team investigated Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump’s November presidential win because of longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president.The Justice Department also charged more than 1,500 Trump supporters in connection with the Capitol riot, though Trump on his first day in office granted clemency to all of them – including the ones convicted of violent crimes – through pardons, sentence commutations and dismissals of indictments.This week, the Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on Smith investigations, and a group of senior FBI executives – including several executive assistant directors and agents in charge of big-city field offices – have been told to either resign or retire or be fired Monday.With Associated PressExplore more on these topicsUS Capitol attackTrump administrationUS politicsUS justice systemDonald TrumpFBInewsShareReuse this content"

But, she says, there are now a few things she won’tSat 1 Feb 2025 06.55 ESTShareBefore meeting Hayley Atwell, I am shown to an empty dressing room down the corridor from where she is rehearsing in London for her upcoming role as Beatrice inMuch Ado About Nothing, Shakespeare’s comic tale of love and deception. The room is empty save for a jug of water, some makeup and hairdressing equipment and, on the floor, a wonderfully garish pair of red patent leather platform shoes.Atwell will be wearing them as Beatrice, who she plays opposite Tom Hiddleston’s Benedick. “They’re my dancing shoes,” she says when she arrives. “Every morning at 11 the shoes go on and we dance [as part of rehearsal for the show]. It’s expressive, it’s modern but not at all gimmicky.” It turns out dancing in front of an audience is a first for her. Is she out of her comfort zone? “Actually no. The giddy freeness of it is more in keeping with who I am. It’s certainly not like the period dramas I’ve done, or all the serious stuff. People tell me all the time: ‘You’re so much funnier than I realised.’ I suppose it’s nice when people underestimate you in that way because it doesn’t take much to impress them.”It is hard to imagine anyone underestimating Atwell’s professional skills. After 20 years in the business, the actor – who is 42 – has proved herself a remarkable all-rounder, equally comfortable on the stage in a Jacobean tragedy (Women Beware Women), in TV costume dramas (Mansfield Park, Howards End, Brideshead Revisited), leading a Marvel series (Agent Carter), or dangling over a cliff in an upturned train carriage in an action franchise (Mission: Impossible). While being admitted into the Marvel universe shifted her career up a gear – Atwell made her entrance as Agent Carter in 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger before starring in the TV spin-off – it isMission: Impossible, where she co-stars with Tom Cruise, that has thrust her into Hollywood’s big league.View image in fullscreenBard work … Atwell and her Much Ado co-star Tom Hiddleston.Photograph: Marc BrennerAs Atwell’s star has risen, she has increasingly set boundaries when talking to journalists. Though she is never less than polite, I begin to wonder if the sculptural, knuckle duster-style ring she wears across two fingers is there as a warning to interviewers lest they get too nosy. While she will happily chat about current projects and the intricacies of performance, she is less keen on digging into the past, resisting what she calls the “narrative” that can develop around actors, by which she means the oft-repeated stories from earlier in their careers. “I always think of that Joan Didion quote: ‘I have already lost contact with a couple of people I used to be,’” she explains. “There’s often this narrative that, even if respectful and accurate to different times [of life], is quite reductive.”Family is also off limits, which I discover when I ask if Much Ado is her first job since having a baby last year (her partner is music producer Ned Wolfgang Kelly). “Who said I had a baby?” she asks, giving me a look. The Daily Mail, I say, when it ran photographs of her lifting her baby into a pram. Quite reasonably, this elicits a sigh. “The funny thing about the Daily Mail,” Atwell reflects, “is that it represents the base way we treat our artists. To be a woman followed by a man who is a stranger and who is hiding in a bush taking pictures of you without your knowledge, let alone consent, and selling it to a publication that pays to expose you … I know that I’m meant to just go: ‘OK, well, I asked for it [in this job].’ But it will never be OK with me.”As for talking about new motherhood, she continues: “I can’t go there on something that’s just too precious. And I’ve learned that to speak for anyone in my personal life that hasn’t chosen a life in the public eye, it does them a disservice.”I had to have five months of full-time physical training, to learn fight sequences, shoot a gun and work with knivesBack to theatre, then, which is Atwell’s first love, professionally speaking. “I love that you come in every day and you’ve got your script under your arm and a coffee, and you’re in the West End where there is this immediate feeling of a theatre community,” she says. “Theatre does for me what church can do for many people. I still really feel that.” The first thing she asked Much Ado’s director Jamie Lloyd – who cast her in 2011’s The Faith Machine and 2013’s The Pride – when he suggested she play Beatrice was: “Exactly how [traditionally] ‘Hey nonny nonny’ is it going to be?”Once he’d explained that sort of thing wasn’t his style, she was all in. She loves the play for its comedy but also for the complexities of Beatrice who is independent, upbeat and engaged in a “merry war” of wits with Benedick. “At one point, her uncle says he’s heard that she can have a nightmare and still wake up laughing,” Atwell says. “And I think there is so much sadness in that, because everyone around her thinks: ‘Oh, she’s so fun, you don’t have to worry about her.’ But she’s been so hurt that humour has become her coping mechanism and her armour.”Atwell’s lengthy break from the stage has coincided with her tenure on Mission: Impossible, where she plays Grace, the light-fingered, morally ambiguous heroine drawn into Ethan Hunt’s latest mission. The franchise has, she says, been all-encompassing, even though the last film, Dead Reckoning Part One – described by critic Mark Kermode as a “genuinely breathtaking romp” – was delayed by Covid. The eighth film in the series, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning comes out this May, “which means I’ll have been working on Mission for five-and-a-half years, which for me is unheard of. I mean, thank God I loved it.”Even now, they are still doing reshoots which involve “fleshing out scenes or changing things around. They’re always tinkering and looking to make things better. So even while [working on Much Ado], I can get a call at any time.” Working with Cruise has been a delight: “When I started, I was very aware of the rarefied air around him and how there is no one like him. And there never will be because actors aren’t made like him any more. He is a one-man studio and, to me, very kind, very professional. And because of that, I felt I was able to try lots of different things. There was never a risk of failure or being unsafe. Tom really likes people to thrive on set.”You can see why Cruise and Atwell work well together: both have a fierce work ethic and take their art incredibly seriously. Unusually for an action movie, there is no script when Mission: Impossible starts shooting and improvisation is actively encouraged (it was Atwell’s idea that Grace should be a pickpocket). “There’ll be Tom going: ‘From five years old I’ve always wanted to jump from a cliff on a motorbike’, and realising his dream. But with the rest, they’re kind of making it up as they go. When I auditioned, they were clear they were looking for someone who likes to work in this way, and that it’s not for everyone. I also had to be prepared for five months of full-time physical training and to be dynamic enough to learn fight sequences, to drift in a car with Tom, to be able to shoot a gun and work with knives.” Can Atwell confirm that this is the last film in the franchise? She pauses. “I mean, look, they called it The Final Reckoning. On the other hand, ‘Tom Cruise’ and ‘final’ are oxymorons, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he goes: “Wait, maybe …’ Although he has so many things he is working on, so I can’t see how another Mission would fit into that.”When Atwell was growing up, the acting seed was planted early. Her mother named her after the Whistle Down the Wind actor Hayley Mills and regularly took her to the theatre. A pivotal moment came when she saw Ralph Fiennes in Hamlet at east London’s Hackney Empire when she was 11 (she also lauds her friend Ben Whishaw’s Hamlet, specifically his “To be or not to be” speech, which she instructs me to watch on YouTube as a matter of urgency). Atwell’s parents divorced when she was little: her father, an American photographer and massage therapist, returned to Kansas where his daughter would spend her summer holidays; the rest of the time she lived with her mother in Ladbroke Grove, west London. She remembers at secondary school both her peers and teachers frequently asking her to read excerpts of books out loud. Previously a shy and introverted child, as a teen she wowed a school assembly reading a Puck monologue from A Midsummer Night’s Dream while wearing green leggings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I never doubted myself – although I did doubt the businessView image in fullscreenAtwell (right with her Agent Carter co-stars.Photograph: Marvel Studios/Sportsphoto/Allstar“The British side of me was all: ‘Oh God, that wasn’t cool at all.’ It wasn’t good to be passionate about anything at that age. But the American in me was all: ‘Oh my God, that was so great, I want to do it again.’ I loved the idea of being able to use language as a tool to make people feel something. I really felt that my intellect woke up.”Beginning acting proper, Atwell decided she wanted to “do it all”, meaning she didn’t want to stay in theatre or be marooned on TV police procedurals. So she trained hard, enrolling at London’s Guildhall School of Music and Drama where she went deep into the nuts, bolts and philosophy of performance. “I knew that’s what it would take to have a craft and sustain it over an entire lifetime,” she explains. “It was something that needed rigorous practice, experience, respect, reverence to the craft.”Emerging from drama school, she was “always confident. I never doubted myself although I did doubt the business. I’d see people around me who were incredibly talented [not working] and realise it’s often just down to luck who’s getting these roles. And that was liberating, because you think: ‘Well, I can only do my best, and there are all these other things I can’t control.’”Before superhero movies, directors were masters of the universe – now you can find them cowering in their trailersRead moreAtwell has spoken in the past about being told by a producer on the set of Brideshead Revisited to lose weight, which prompted her co-star Emma Thompson to leap to her defence and tell her: “You’re not a model, you’re an actor.” A decade ago, when she was playingAgent Carter, she also bemoaned being Photoshopped for the front cover of a German magazine. Today she observes “that thing” that women do of “filtering ourselves, or reducing ourselves to fit in or to people-please, partly because women don’t tend to be able to fail upwards in the way men do. But then comes that point where you go: ‘I’m really OK if I’m not liked.’ I think I’ve developed enough of an understanding of the business that I can stop worrying about that.”It’s with clear satisfaction that she says she is now more experienced and has clout in the industry. “I can express a preference for things. I’m in a more creatively fertile place that’s less fear-based, and where failure is totally allowed. I’m not asking for permission from others to try new things, as I can give myself permission and I’ll own it if it doesn’t work.” Best of all, she notes, is that “I can say no, I won’t do that. It’s not for me.”Much Ado About Nothing is atTheatre Royal Drury Lane, London, 10 Februaryto 5 April.Explore more on these topicsHayley AtwellMission: ImpossibleMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part OneWilliam ShakespeareMuch Ado About NothingAgent CarterMarvelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His debut short story collection,Young Skins, came out in 2013, winning theGuardianfirst book award and yielding a film adaptation,CalmWith Horses, starring Cosmo Jarvis and Barry Keoghan. He followed it with the 2022 collectionHomesicknessand last year’s Booker-longlisted novelWild Houses, which revolves around a poorly-planned kidnapping in Ballina. Winner of the Nero debut fiction award, it is now out in paperback. Barrett lives in Dublin with his wife and two children.What sparkedWild Houses?The first scene I wrote was the opening one. Dev Hendrick wakes up in the middle of night and there’s a car outside. Two men bring a teenage boy to the door. The men turn out to be Dev’s criminal cousins and Doll, the boy, is a bargaining chip in a haphazard blackmailing scheme. What attracted me was writing from the perspective of Dev, who is on the periphery. I was very taken with that situation, where a passive and withdrawn character is pushed right up against this dramatic and potentially traumatic event.You’d only written short storiespreviously. Did you know it was a novel from the outset?It certainly didn’t feel like just a short story, because too much was implied that would have to be explored. And I knew I needed other pieces to it. I needed a counterweight to Dev’s story, and that’s where the other main character, Nicky, came in. She’s in the heart of the community; she bounces around between social groups, she’s very socially capable. She would allow us to step out of the claustrophobic world of Dev’s house.You write a lot about petty criminals and other marginal characters in small-town Mayo. What draws you to that milieu?I want to write about characters who are outside whatever the ordered society is, and in a small-town community there’s a lot of margin to be part of. It’s not even overt criminals, but adolescents, unemployed people. Dev has a suite of mental health problems, so he’s on the outside as well.You must have been a very observant kid, because you haven’t lived in Mayo for many years and yet your writing about it is so vivid.I was not observant at all. I’m still not now. My wife is astonished that I’m able to write. When she reads my work, she’s like, “You pay such attention to things, but you don’t in real life.”Colm Tóibín told me, read Dermot Healy’s A Goat’s Song and all of John McGahernNow that you’ve written a novel, do you have an appetite to write more?Yeah. I found it difficult to write but it was very rewarding in the end. And, immediately, another idea that definitely is a novel and not a short story suggested itself.Can you tell me anything about it? Whereis it set?Mayo! I don’t think I’ll live long enough to ever get out of Mayo. Maybe, one day, I’ll open a page and realise there’s no more juice to be squeezed out of Mayo, but it’s still juicy at the moment.What’s your connection toColm Tóibín?He was my mentor, through an arts programme by Rolex. We spent two or three years working together. He’s a lovely guy. But Colm did say, about the book: “You have enough editors already, you don’t need another one.” He was writingThe Magicianat that time, about Thomas Mann, and he was in the middle of redrafts. When we’d meet up, he go, “I’m stuck in this chapter, what do you think I should do?” He treated me as a peer. We had a very easy rapport.Did he give you any useful advice?Lots. The best one was: if you hand in a book, whoever tells you it has the most wrong with it, they’re probably right.Who, of Irish fiction writers working at the moment, captures the country in a way that most resonates with you?I don’t know who would have a definitive take on it, but I do love the versions of Ireland that Nicole Flattery writes. There’s a first novel coming out by John Patrick McHugh,Fun and Games, set in an island in the west of Ireland. It’s about a teenage boy, so it has all the classic tropes, but it’s an extremely funny novel with brilliant dialogue. And then Wendy Erskine from Belfast – her first novel,The Benefactors,is fantastic. It’s really stuck with me since I finished it. But we could keep going. Actually, Colm Tóibín told me, readDermot Healy’sA Goat’s Songand all of John McGahern. They were writing about an Ireland that’s before my time, but not that much before, and you can see the links.Are there any underappreciated books or authors that you’re always trying to press on people?The American writer Tom Drury who wroteThe End of Vandalism. His books are hard to pitch to people, because they’re set in small-town Ohio and quite stripped back, quite Carver-esque, and so it’s hard to articulate why they’re so good. But just watching these characters evolve slowly over the decades is very moving to see.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even when I was playing with my toys, there would always be a story. I wasn’t just crashing trucks together, I’d get all my little men and do my own rip-off version ofStar Wars. I got into books when I was a teenager, but then I was trying to read James Joyce and William Burroughs. So, straight away, I started on the heavy stuff.Where and when do you write?Generally here [at the dining-room table], and whenever I can, when the kids are out of the house.

He was probably writing that book for God knows how long. Where’s your hot take on the presidency, George? So you just have to write about what you’re going to write about and trust that it’ll contain that stuff anyway.Wild Housesby Colin Barrett is published by Vintage (£9.99).To support theGuardianandObserverorder your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Chris Petit and Emma Matthews have turned their fight into a filmPeter BradshawSat 1 Feb 2025 11.15 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2025 11.19 ESTShareThat uniquely valuable British writer and independent film-maker Chris Petit, creator of downbeat classics such asRadio On from 1979and An Unsuitable Job for a Woman from 1982, may not these days find it easy to get an outlet for his work; this would be appear to be his first feature credit for 15 years. But he and co-director, editor and partner Emma Matthews have emerged with a deeply personal movie: painful, complex, challenging and engaging.Petit and Matthews riff and free-associate on the themes of memory, memory-loss and the moving image on video and celluloid, but at the centre of this is an urgent story from their own lives. In his early teens, their son Louis, now 22, a talented artist and musician, began to have epileptic seizures that wiped out his memories of childhood; some of these were of the type nicknamed“Alice in Wonderland” syndromebecause of the resulting misperceptions of time and space – though these were scary, oppressive and brutal experiences very different from the beguiling world of Lewis Carroll.The heartless medical bureaucracy in the UK was unable to help, one consultant even advising Louis’s parents simply to “grieve for the child he once was”. But medical cannabis of the sort theNHSrefuses to provide, and which they now source in Europe means his seizures have stopped, although paying for it is still a constant worry.Using a third-person voiceover narrative read by Jodhi May, and home videos taken by Louis’ parents showing the upsetting reality of his seizures, as well as clips from early cinema, Petit and Matthews try to negotiate a creative way through this agony, relating Louis’ courageous engagement with his incomplete personal history to their own continuing projects, and making Louis’ story part of their own psychogeography.Petit appears to be working on a film project connecting the occult worlds of US author William Burroughs and James Jesus Angleton, CIA chief in the postwar period – and now connecting Louis with them. Burroughs brooded on the concept of a “pre-recorded universe”, a master tape of reality somewhere beyond our immediate perception, of which our actual experiences are fragmented and realigned versions, and this might indeed relate to Louis’ experience. With his hat and glasses, Petit does look a bit like Burroughs.As for Angleton, he was the shadowy figure behind all sorts of hidden black operations and dirty tricks, including experiments in LSD – and this, too, resonates with Petit’s detestation of the medical-pharmaceutical complex that let down his son. I have to point out that Petit’s interest in conspiracy theories is of an innocently liberal pre-Maga form, the second-shooter JFK kind not the anti-vaxx kind, although I am not sure I agree when the film’s narrator says “everyone knows” that big pharma “is in the lethal addiction business”. Those of us glad of our anti-Covid vaccines take a different view, but of course the narration is not straightforwardly the director’s voice.The film shows us Chris and Louis going on trips together to Finland and the frozen north, ostensibly to scout locations, but perhaps also – or in fact mainly, or solely – as a bonding exercise, part of the continuing reconnection. It is a tender and emotional family portrait.D Is for Distance screened at the Rotterdam film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsEpilepsyNHSHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

In 2011, she played Cathy in Andrea Arnold’sWuthering Heights; her other film roles include theMaze Runnerseries,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No TalesandThis Is Christmas. Last year, she starred in two Netflix series, Guy Ritchie’sThe Gentlemenand the dual-language biographical miniseriesSenna. Scodelario makes her stage debut inEast Is South, a play about artificial intelligence at the Hampstead theatre from 7 February to 15 March. She lives in north London with her two children.1.MusicChappell RoanWatch the video for Pink Pony Club by Chappell Roan.She’s an incredible songwriter. She’s only 26, which I find hard to believe, because her lyrics and her voice seem so soulful and of another time. She seems to not conform in a way that most singers do nowadays, and I find that inspiring. I also think she’s starting a really healthy dialogue between fans and their idols and what that means, and what the boundaries are. My three-year-old daughter loves Pink Pony Club and sings it every day on the way to nursery, so it’s a nice memory for me whenever I hear it.View image in fullscreen2.BookSupremacy by Parmy OlsonI picked this up at the Science Museum gift shop – I was looking for materials to research AI for the play.Supremacytells the story of the rivalry between the two wealthy men who came up with the idea for AI – OpenAI’s chief executive Sam Altman and Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis – and the different moral compasses they adhere to. I’m trying to hold on to the idea that as humans, there must be something about us that can’t be replaced: the thing that makes us creative and that makes us love and hate and hurt. I hope that is fundamentally a human thing.3.TVGladiators reboot, BBC OneView image in fullscreenSheli McCoy, AKA Sabre, on Gladiators.Photograph: BBCI’m a 90s kid. I grew up watchingGladiators, back when there were only four-and-a-half channels – you could sometimes get Channel 5 if you smacked the top of the TV hard enough. I loved the storylines, the melodrama, the competitiveness; I loved the women, who were strong and fierce and beautiful. I’m absolutely obsessed with the new reboot. They’ve updated it for our times, but they’ve kept the nostalgia and the fun. I’m now watching it with my kids, and they’re doing the moves of the various Gladiators during the opening credits. And I also really fancy Legend.4.FoodBraseef Brazilian Butcher, Turnpike Lane, north LondonView image in fullscreen‘The most gorgeous cuts of Brazilian beef’: Braseef.Photograph: BraseefLondon has many wonderful restaurants, but my favourite thing to do when I get home from a long shoot abroad is to cook the food that I grew up with, which is Brazilian cuisine. I make a weekly feijoada, which is a black bean stew with various different cuts of pork, and brigadeiro, which is a kind of chocolate fudge ball. Braseef is a hub for Brazilians in northLondon. They do the most gorgeous cuts of Brazilian beef and meat, and they have a hot counter of little savoury snacks where you can get coxinhas and pastels, and they’re just absolutely delicious.5.PlaceParkland Walk, north LondonView image in fullscreenThe Spriggan sculpture on the Parkland Walk between Finsbury Park and Highgate in north London.Photograph: Michael Heath/AlamyThis is an old railway line that’s been converted into a nature reserve – they’ve just allowed the wildlife to grow around it.

There’s a famous sculpture called theSpriggan, who is a mythical north London folklore creature. There’s also abat caveat the end of it.

I was onSkinswith Megan, and she’s taken our experiences of being teenagers on a show that was hyper-sexualised, and her unique experience of going on to be a sex worker. The show asks the question: when an actor takes her sexuality into her own hands and profits from it directly, why is that seen as wrong? I saw it at theEdinburgh fringelast year and I’m really proud of her.Explore more on these topicsCultureOn my radarTelevisionFoodLondonTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He will “give it all I’ve got” and is keen – so keen! – for us to know how grateful he is. He woke up at 1am and 2am and 4am, he says, because of his nerves: “I just got up in the end.”It is all, he says, a bit much. Though the muchiest part of the show turns out to have nothing to do with Mills. Fellow Radio 2 host the Rev Kate Bottley – not the world’s best presenter – is standing at a railway station to tell us that the BBC hasrebranded Stockport train station as Scottportfor the day. Why? Honestly, who knows? Mills is certainly bewildered. (“What’s going on?” he stage-whispers.) Mills is not from Stockport, has nothing to do with the place. Also, that wordplay doesn’t really work, does it? Especially when New Mills station is just around the corner.Mills is an excellent broadcaster, but on his first show was a teensy bit too “can’t believe it’s little old me on this huge show”, when he readily admits he’s worked all his life to get there. His second and third days were much better. New quiz the Easiest Quiz on the Radio, where a listener answers daftly simple rapid-fire questions (any hesitation and they’re out), is great, and on Wednesday the discussion about how far people will travel for something they love was a very warmRadio 2moment, with listeners calling in to tell him about their favourite chippies and bookshops. The banter with co-hosts Ellie Brennan and Tina Daheley isn’t quite right yet, but the music selection is perfect and the energy is bang on too. No doubt as Mills relaxes, his neediness will recede. You want to tell him to relax, enjoy yourself, stop worrying. You’re good.Gok Wan and Harriet Scott host Magic Breakfast.Photograph: RayuThere’s a new breakfast host over onMagic Breakfasttoo. Harriet Scott, longtime brekkie veteran, got a new permanent playmate on Monday in the shape ofGok Wan, who, under a lot less pressure than Mills, was campy and fun from the off. “Are you happy to be married to me?” he wondered to Scott on Wednesday. “I feel like we can weather any storm,” she replied.This being Magic, their links are super-short, often scripted but not seeming so. And Wan proved happy to step up to the mic. Given exactly 14 seconds by Scott to introduce the next record, he went straight in. “It’s all about the look of love, whether you’re A, B, C, D, E or even F,” he said, making Scott chuckle. “There you go!” he chirruped. “Look at that for a link! I’m here all day, kids!” Adorable.The excellent investigative team of presenter Cara McGoogan and producer Sarah Peters are back with a newBed of Lies. They’ve already given us two great series, on theundercover police who slept with their targetsand on theinfected blood scandal. Their new show,Conflict, concerns the role of British undercover intelligence agents in the Troubles in Northern Ireland and just how involved with the paramilitaries they became.View image in fullscreenCara McGoogan.Photograph: Desiree AdamsThe BBC’sStakeknifeis about exactly this subject too but is a very different show. Where it bangs straight in, McGoogan chisels away with remarkable innocence and sometimes unintentionally politicised language. “Can you believe this happened inour country?” she asks a British detective,when in fact the question of whether any part of Ireland should be ruled by the British was at the very heart of the Troubles. Initially, I found this naivety a problem, but came to see it as welcoming for other young people who are unaware of how Britain and Ireland have “interacted” over the years.Stakeknifeis for those who know,Bed of Liesfor those who don’t.Plus, her innocence means that McGoogan is audibly, genuinely shocked that the British establishment would use murderous tactics against the people it calls its citizens. So she should be. It is completely shocking. We also hear from Michelle and Gavin, whose father, Michael Power, a Catholic taxi driver, was shot dead by Ulster Defence Association (UDA) paramilitaries in 1987. They were in the car too. They were eight and four. Gavin ran down the road repeating: “They’ve missed me but they’ve got my dad.” Michelle’s eyes were full of shattered glass that cascaded down as she rubbed them. Why was their dad, a completely innocent man, targeted? Why was his murder never investigated? By the end of the first episode, McGoogan is using the word “collusion” to describe the relationship between the British army, the police and the UDA. It may take her until episode four to get to Stakeknife, but her doggedness is admirable.Photograph: BBC Radio 4I am by nature uninterested in mountaineers, but eight-part BBC Sounds podcastExtreme: Peak Danger, about a couple of newlyweds who in 2008 climbed K2, swept me along with its immersive sounds and details. Excellent interviews reveal what happened in what turns out to be the then worst mountaineering disaster ever (11 people died). I found myself just as affected by a young man who brought down an experienced but very ill Sherpa companion as I was by the fate of those who perished. A beautiful telling of a tragic tale.Explore more on these topicsRadioMiranda Sawyer on podcasts and radioBBCRadio 2PodcastsPodcastingMountaineeringreviewsShareReuse this content"

A horror about two young people whose nostalgic connection to an old TV show warps their sense of reality, the film manages to visually mimic the old VHS horrors of the 1980s while maintaining a strong modern message about gender identity. Martin Scorsese is a fan, calling it “emotionally and psychologically powerful.” More than anything, though, it will creep you out to a stupendous degree.SHOpen Fire, 11.10pm, Talking Pictures TVFor those wondering how Paul Greengrass was able to transition from ITV journalist to Hollywood power player, the answer is with films like Open Fire. This is his first work of filmed fiction; a 1994 made-for-TV movie about the real-life manhunt for escaped criminal David Martin, and the police blunder that led to a national scandal. As a finished piece of work it’s undoubtedly a little rough around the edges, and very much of its time.

Well-designed quality sunglasses tend to be eye-wateringly expensive, but Le Specs, a brand worn by everyone from Justin Bieber to the Duchess of Sussex, are a great place to look. These Broski sunglasses have a vintage-inspired silhouette without looking retro. They come in tortoiseshell, too, but it’s the Black Smoke Mono colourway I’m into.Is it Loewe? Or is it M&S?View image in fullscreenRed rose bag charm£12.50 at Marks & SpencerTell you what, I’ll give you a clue: it costs £12.50. But take a look at this Red Rose Trio bag charm and you will see what I mean. It’s a keyring, it’s a bag charm, but most importantly, it looks like it costs about 20 times the price tag.The cherry one, also £12.50, is cute too.Valentine’s Day hoop earrings to fall in love withView image in fullscreenGold heart hoops£36 at BodenWhen is Valentine-themed fashion not too cheesy? When it’s these heart-shaped hoops. Tuck your hair behind your ear … and drop a subtle hint. I’m not saying they aren’t cheesy – I’m saying they are just the right amount of cheesy. Not just for 14 February, these hoops are definitely a keeper.The supersize puffer coatView image in fullscreenSuperdry Maxi longline puffer coat£164.99 at SuperdryAfter months of people-watching while dog-walking – does this count as multitasking? – I’ve figured out why some people look fabulous in a puffer coat while others (me) just look like a generic dog walker. The coat has to bereallybig, andreallylong. This is counterintuitive, because puffer coats are large anyway, so our natural instinct is not to go any bigger than we have to. But they look so much better –somuch better – if they’re oversized and ankle length. Especially good teamed with cool shades (see above). This Superdry coat is ideal.An excellent big bagView image in fullscreenLeopard print tote£155 at & Other StoriesWow,a column I wrote recently hailing the return of bags in which you can fit all your stuffsure did strike a chord. I’ve been deluged with messages from readers who feel all the love for a capacious carry-all. So I thought I’d share this beauty, which I love for its main character energy and snug fit under the arm. And yes, it has a magnetic closure and an inner pocket. It was available in cow print (fun!), which has now sold out – you can never go wrong with leopard, though.An idea for new ways to layerView image in fullscreenWool cashmere blend waistcoat£95 at JigsawI spotted two chic layering combos recently, and the common factor was simple round-neck sleeveless knits with buttons all the way down the front. I complimented the wearers – and asked for deets, obviously. Number one:a black cashmere button-through knit (£85 at M&S)that was worn over a boho-energy cream blouse, so there was a peek of ruffle at the neck and the soft billowy sleeves were exposed.Number two: the pink version above, worn over a sleek black cotton polo neck. That one was £95 from Jigsaw and also comes in a lovelyjade green. It feels late to buy a winter piece but I feel as if I’ll also wear this in summer, over a T-shirt.Possibly the coolest clutch bag/makeup pouch ever made?View image in fullscreenPerello leather pouch£295 at Anya Hindmarch£295 at LibertyCan I justify this? No. Do I want it? Damn right. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about this delicious Anya Hindmarch pouch since I saw it. I am obsessed with Perelló olives and I know this would bring me joy for ever. It’s big enough to be a clutch for evenings, or a makeup bag, or to keep essentials from sinking to the bottom of a handbag. Not an olive girl? How about aStabilo Boss Coin Purse (£295)or aNurofen sunglasses case?A lingerie brand to get on your radarView image in fullscreenCamelia wired bra£39 at BluebellaDo you know Bluebella? I feel like not enough women know about Bluebella. This female-founded, London-based lingerie label makes beautiful underwear that is special without being too heavy-handedly erotic, if you know what I mean. It also looks great under clothes, which is something a surprising number of underwear brands don’t think about. Best of all, it’s reasonably priced. There’s a store in Covent Garden, if you are in London to take a look. The Camelia bra is a balconette silhouette that works well under scoop necklines.Are your pilates socks 2025 enough?View image in fullscreenPilates and yoga grip socks£12.99 at Belsize Activewear£12.99 at AmazonAsking all the big questions, am I right? But, seriously, you’ve ditched trainer socks in the rest of your wardrobe – please tell me you’ve ditched trainer socks in the rest of your wardrobe – so why are you still wearing them to pilates? I’m wearing these grip socks now. Do keep up.Wrist warmers. Discuss?View image in fullscreenCashmere wrist warmers£79 at BroraCan we agree that “smartphone gloves” just don’t work? Therefore, wrist warmers and fingerless gloves are surprisingly practical in the modern world of emailing-from-the-train-platform. These Brora wrist warmers are a major treat – but they are cashmere, knitted in Scotland, and they are the actual ones that Claudia Winkleman wears inThe Traitors.Explore more on these topicsFashionJess Cartner-Morley‘s editfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Years ago, a good cook, who happened to be Greek, told me to think of olive oil not simply as liquid fat, but as an essential ingredient, as flavour and as a seasoning, with the ability to act like herbs and spices. He’s absolutely right and his excellent advice continues to motivate me when I’m choosing extra-virgin olive oil, which is the single most important ingredient I buy, and my biggest expense in the kitchen. While I do have the odd special bottle for drizzling, I am more interested in a good-tasting all-rounder that I can use for everything (my cooking is largely vegetable-, pasta-, pulse-, cheese- and egg-centric), including deep-frying (in averysmall pan).The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Just to recap, olive oil is the liquid fat obtained by pressing olives, which are fruits. Once picked, they need to be processed as soon as possible – that is, crushed, then centrifugally spun to separate the pulp, water and oil, all in scrupulously clean machinery and at a steady temperature, which preserves the natural aromas of the olives. It takes about eight kilos of olives to make a litre of oil, which, to be considered extra-virgin olive oil, needs to have no defects and no more than 0.8% of free fatty acids. And that comes at a price: expect to pay between £14 and £18 a litre.That said, I always have an open mind about extra-virgin olive oil and olive oil, which is why I’m also often on the lookout – and why I loved doing this tasting. In the world of professionally qualified olive oil tasters, I am, of course, but an enthusiastic amateur. It may sound silly, even disgusting, but it really is worth tasting the oil.Start with the bottle you have at home: pour a bit into a small glass, cup it in your hand and rub to warm the oil while covering the top with the other, then lift off your hand and sniff deeply. You might meet tomato vines, unripe bananas, almonds, artichokes, cat pee, pear drops. Or you might meet fish and a pond. This isn’t about getting anything right, but rather deciding on what you like.Next, take a gulp, hold it in your mouth, clench your teeth and suck air through them (yes, you will feel ridiculous): here, you should meet the scents again, as well as for the bitter phenolic compounds to catch the back of your throat, which is why high-quality extra-virgin olive oils are sometimes referred to as “one cough” or “two cough”, depending on their pungency.Another characteristic of good extra-virgin olive oil is that it is not oily, but fruity. Aswith tinned tomatoes, we all have hugely different experiences of taste and flavour. Here are mine.The best extra-virgin olive oilsBest all-rounderFarchioni Il Casolare extra-virgin olive oilView image in fullscreen£7.50 for 500ml at Asda£16 for 1L at Ocado★★★★☆Golden in colour, green and alive in flavour. It’s striking how smooth it is – silky, almost. I really like this: it tastes like olives and artichokes, with a peppery, almost spicy finish. I’d use it for everything, in and on; I also think it would be great in olive-oil cakes and biscuits.Best splurgeSainsbury’s Taste the Difference Toscano extra-virgin olive oilView image in fullscreen£9.95 for 500ml at Sainsbury’s★★★★☆A robust and rich oil that tastes of butter and walnuts, with grassy notes and a peppery pungency that catches the back of the throat and made me cough (a good thing). I’d happily use this in and on anything, especially in bean soups, on white beans or boiled potatoes, and in a dressing for thinly sliced fennel.Best bargainAldi Specially Selected PDO Terra Di Bari Castel Del Monte extra-virgin olive oilView image in fullscreen£5.59 for 500ml at Aldi★★★☆☆A good, lingering bitterness, and really tastes of olives, which, odd as it may sound, is not as common as you might hope with olive oil. The flavour is like grass and courgettes, and I think this is a great one for people who cook lots of vegetables, especially pasta and vegetables, in pesto and on bread.And the rest …Tesco Finest Sicilian extra-virgin olive oilView image in fullscreen£8.95 for 500ml at Tesco★★★★☆The colour is golden, but the taste is green, like herbs, and almost almondy. I liked this very much, also because it tasted alive and caught the back of my throat. It is not a delicate oil, but then neither is my cooking: I would use it for tomato sauces, especially those with anchovies, fish stews, on grilled aubergine and with fennel and orange salad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

A great working oil that I would happily use for day-to-day cooking and dressings.Lidl Deluxe Puglian extra-virgin olive oilView image in fullscreen£4.19 for 500ml; not available online★★★☆☆Good note of grassy bitterness – a good thing! – alongside a faint metallic taste, which is annoying rather than terrible. Functional. Use for cooking and enriched, cream, tahini or miso dressings, or for dressings with plenty of other ingredients.M&S Italian extra-virgin olive oilView image in fullscreen£7.50 for 500ml at Ocado★★★☆☆I found it hard to put my finger on just what it is about this oil, but there is something distant and a bit vague about it. But it also has nice qualities, with almost fruity notes and a warm ending. I’d use it for pasta and beans, and in mashed potato or pesto, and mixed with red chilli to go on top of just about everything.Filippo Berio extra-virgin olive oilView image in fullscreen£9.95 for 500ml at Tesco£11.95 for 1L at Amazon★★★☆☆Another dilemma: on the one hand, it’s a bit lazy, with none of the fruity, grassy notes I hope to find, but then, out of nowhere, come almost nutty notes reassuring me it is alive. That is the really interesting thing when you taste lots of oils: they quickly fall into two groups, dead or alive, and this is not dead. A functional oil that I would use in the baseof things, such as herb and garlic soffrittos, but not on top.Ocado extra-virgin olive oilView image in fullscreen£5.85 for 500ml at Ocado★☆☆☆☆Again, reactions to oil vary, but I met a tinny, metallic flavour in this one. It felt thin in the mouth and there was no sign of olives. In its defence, it was not rancid-tasting – rancid here meaning old and stale. Maybe it could be used in soups and stews.Napolina extra-virgin olive oilView image in fullscreen£7.95 for 500ml at Tesco£6 for 500ml at Ocado★☆☆☆☆This did not agree with my mouth: fatty, sleepy, and no olives in sight. Maybe it could work in a highly spiced dish.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe FilterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But is the blue cap healthier than the green? We take a look.Is full-fat cow’s milk healthier than skimmed or semi-skimmed milk?As Nichola Ludlam-Raine, a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, points out, that depends on who is drinking it.“Full-fat milk contains more calories and saturated fat compared to semi-skimmed or skimmed milk, which may be beneficial for those needing more energy or wanting to increase satiety,” she says. “However, for those managing weight or cardiovascular risk factors, semi-skimmed or skimmed milk may be a better option, as they provide the same essential nutrients with fewer calories and less saturated fat.”She says saturated fat in milk appears to have a different impact within the body than that found in butter, coconut oil and fatty meats.“Some studies suggest that the matrix of dairy – which includes calcium, protein and other bioactive compounds – may help mitigate some of the potential negative effects of saturated fat on cholesterol levels. However, current guidelines still recommend prioritising unsaturated fats for heart health.”Does full-fat milk have more calcium?No – in fact the calcium content is fairly similar whether your milk is skimmed, semi-skimmed or full fat.“Calcium is found in the water-based portion of milk, not the fat,” says Ludlam-Raine, noting that all three types of milk provide an excellent source of this nutrient as well as iodine, both of which are important for bone health.Tom Sanders, a professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, says that while the amount of vitamin A in semi-skimmed milk is half the level found in full-fat milk, “that is of little significance in the UK because vitamin A deficiency is unlikely to occur”.Is this debate down to concerns and confusion about processed foods?That could be one factor – but as Ludlam-Raine, the author of How Not to Eat Ultra-Processed, notes, the term “processing” can be misleading.“Many people equate minimal processing with health benefits and are trying to avoid ultra-processed foods, which in many cases is a positive change,” she says. “However, skimming milk to remove some of the fat is a simple, mechanical process and does not make the product ultra-processed. In fact, most milk – full fat or otherwise – undergoes some level of processing, such as pasteurisation, to ensure safety, which is a positive thing.”Sanders notes that only sweetened condensed milk is regarded as ultra-processed. By contrast, fresh or pasteurised milk, including skimmed milk, falls within the unprocessed or minimally processed category of the Nova classification system used to define the extent of food processing.So if I want cow’s milk, what should I drink?“Ultimately, the best choice depends on the individual’s health goals,” said Ludlam-Raine.“The key is to focus on the overall dietary pattern rather than isolating one food or nutrient.”Sanders says full-fat milk makes better frothy coffee than skimmed milk – which is why it is used in many coffee shops.“Full-fat milk also makes a better curd when making homemade yoghurt” he says. “However, there are no health reasons to switch from semi-skimmed to full-fat milk and the change would be in the wrong directions for saturated fat and calories.”Explore more on these topicsMilkFoodHealthDiets and dietingexplainersShareReuse this content"

I was supposed to be a barrister, because I was good at chat and liked debating. Mum was the foodie. We were always making things in the kitchen while my sister was in the garden.I went to every outpostof the Roman Empire as a kid. My dad [Colin McEvedy] was a psychiatrist, but his love was history; he sold a million copies of hishistory books. Holidays were going to see a mausoleum, measuring cannonballs in a castle in Istanbul, clambering over rocks. I didn’t have a beach holiday until I was 28.It all went tits-upin 1998, when I was 17. I realised I was gay, my mum died and I was expelled from school. Any one of those is a lot for a 17-year-old, but the three of them combined was seismic. I was lost. All the parameters got blown.Mum died havinga liver transplant. She had cirrhosis, though she wasn’t a drinker. Her father built railways in Africa – they think she might have picked it up there. Doctors said that if she didn’t have a transplant, she’d be dead in two years. After the operation she never regained consciousness.Rudderless didn’ttouch the sides of how I felt. I did poorly in my A-levels. My dad said not to go to university because I’d get kicked out. All that was expected of me was lost. I moved to Manchester and sold perfume door-to-door. I was clubbing, taking all the drugs, trying to get away from myself. On my 21st birthday I chatted to my dad about how I’d always liked cooking – maybe I should open my own restaurant.Cooking saved my life.Without it I’d have been found face down in a gutter with a bottle of whisky. I went to the Cordon Bleu school and found my tribe. It doesn’t matter where you’re from or who you are, you’re judged on how hard you work, how good your food tastes, how well you get on with everyone in the kitchen.I’ve worked in lotsof posh places. I did Sean Connery’s 60th birthday party on my first night at Green’s champagne and oyster bar, which was Lady Di’s favourite restaurant. Then I worked at the River Café, Belvedere, Groucho… It was working at Robert De Niro’s Tribeca Grill in New York, selling overpriced food, that I came up with my mission statement: the best food to the most people.I’ve been a weirdlysuccessful consultant: for Pret, Cook and specificallyChartwells, who serve 180,000 meals daily across 1,500 schools. I must have had a hand in gazillions of people’s food that they eat every day.Nowadays beingstraightforwardly gay is boring. But when I came out to my friends, a few stopped talking to me.I was given my MBEwith snot and tears. I pinned a picture of my parents on their wedding day to the inside of my suit jacket when I went to Buckingham Palace. I wanted them to see their daughter come good. When they called my name up I just blubbed.My wife, Lucie,is convinced I have ADHD. She says my default state is perpetual motion. My elderdaughterhad a combined diagnosis last year. It’s helped her. I’m happy to carry on – I’ve got coping mechanisms.I’m now as oldas my mum was when she died. So to not die anytime soon is a big one for me. I keep on top of my health. I like wine a bit too much, but I got off the fags after many years. I have a personal trainer, I don’t have a sedentary life, eat well. I’ll take where I’m at for the life I’ve had.Allegra McEvedy will be speaking about work, foodie travels and her book, Chefs Wanted, at Destinations: The Holiday & Travel Show, Olympia London, from 30 January to 2 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsLife and styleThis much I knowFoodRestaurantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Hair: Alice Theobald at Arlington Talent using Babyliss Pro. Makeup: Mikey Phillips. Archive photograph: courtesy of Olivia AttwoodBorn in London in 1991, Olivia Attwood shot to fame as a contestant on the third series of Love Island. The reality TV universe beckoned – Attwood joined the cast of The Only Way Is Essex and Celebs Go Dating. She then stepped into TV presenting, making documentaries about trolls, cosmetic surgery, and in the third season of her ITV show Getting Filthy Rich, young entrepreneurs selling sex. She lives between London and Cheshire with her husband, the footballer Bradley Dack.The eyes are giving Princess Diana,as if there’s some pending, awful news on the horizon. I loved doing ballet but I was a shy and anxious child, always pondering. My parents are staggered by the shift that’s happened in me over the last decade, because for that kid in the photo, the idea of being the centre of attention was horrifying. There was one time I was asked to go to the front in a dance class, and the concept of being under the spotlight made me run out of the door.Growing up, I naturally excelled at sports. I held every school record to the point a parent once complained: “She shouldn’t be competing – she’s just going to win!” Luckily for them, I got to 15 and was lured in by the appeal of drinking, smoking and boys. Being the “cross country girl” just didn’t seem cool any more. After I lost sport from my life, I realised I wasn’t good at anything. Everyone seemed to have an idea of who they were and what they wanted to do, apart from me.I was always falling out of trees, breaking my arm, doing things that girls aren’t meant to do. For a long time I carried a lot of shameIn primary school, I was diagnosed with dyslexia, but ADHD took a lot longer to figure out. The word was flung around a lot by teachers, but girls weren’t diagnosed with it much, especially not neurotic, meticulously organised ones like me. I had no impulse control whatsoever. I got told off all the time for doing stupid stuff. I was on a nature trip once and a teacher was showing us a box with geckos in it. I was told to take a look but under no circumstances should I put my hand in the box. Naturally, I had a gecko hanging off my finger a split second later.Mum was frustrated with me. She’d ask: “Why is it always you?” I would get upset because I wasn’t sure how to answer. I didn’t want to be naughty. It was like there was something fundamentally wrong with me. I was always falling out of trees, breaking my arm, doing things that girls aren’t meant to do. For a long time I carried a lot of shame.After school, I went through a couple of yearswhere I relied entirely on romantic relationships. I had a bad breakup, and felt very depressed, so I decided to speak to a psychiatrist. She immediately pulled up an ADHD assessment and said: “You’re probably not depressed, but you’ve got no coping skills for ADHD, and now you’ve burned yourself out.” A light went on that day. I realised that anchoring myself to another human being was a way of surviving, but it wasn’t working any more. I started travelling more; I became a promo girl. I went through a year of putting myself in situations I felt uncomfortable in. After that, my confidence snowballed.I was approached for Love Island via Instagram. It was 2016, and reality TV still felt risky – Love Island wasn’t the huge machine it is now. I said no, and got on with my life. A year later they came back to me and asked if I was interested in series three. I said no, because I was in a relationship, or at least thought I was. That same night I got a phone call. I didn’t know the number, but it was a girl saying she was my boyfriend’s girlfriend. This sounds very woo-woo, but I believe that call was the universe saying: “Hi, you’re about to turn down something really good for a guy.” I called the producer back and they were so kind. I got another chance, which was lucky, as that was the series that blew up.Being pretty was social currency when I growing up. I was told I should feel lucky, which I did, but sometimes I worried it was the only thing I brought to the tableI was excited to go on Love Island, but also freshly heartbroken, so felt a lot of anger towards men. Thinking all men suck is not the ideal energy to carry into a dating show. As a result, I was quite reactive in the house, which was like a pressure cooker anyway, especially for someone quite impulsive. The person who shouts the loudest is normally not the most secure. I was definitely emulating bravado.As I was such a big character, involved in so many storylines, my family and friends were the ones who had to deal with the reactions online. I was thrust into celebrity. Unlike a lot of people in my industry, I don’t have a sob story. I don’t have the Daily Mail or Sun app. I don’t have Google Alerts on myself; I never look up stuff people have said about me. So many people in my world search their name as soon as they wake up. I tried it for 24 hours and found it horrible, and never looked back. It’s a sickly satisfying practice and one I don’t need.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Being pretty was definitely social currency when I growing up, and I was aware of it from a young age.

No one gave a shit about what I had to say. When I was doing promotions work, I had to have hair past my shoulders and a certain french manicure. There was a uniform to it. When I was in Love Island, I was totally free to look the way I wanted. I came out and people were actually listening to me – they also thought I was funny, which is the biggest compliment anyone could ever pay me.The first two years, I looked a mess. I was partying every night of the week; my extensions were hanging out; my lips were overfilled; my tan was patchy. I was ripping into a bag of Pretty Little Thing clothes every day and putting on whatever was in it, and off I went.Now I am a bit more considered. It’s not that I think women can’t be in a skimpy dress and be taken seriously, because I still do the skimpy dress. But I’ve now made the link between how you show up and how people receive you. When I do my documentaries, I don’t even wear makeup. I want the show to be about whoever I am speaking to, not my tits and lips. It’s liberating to scrape my hair back, pull a jumper on and get on with my job.That girl in the photo couldn’t even imagine what her life is like now. I wish I could jump through the frame and tell her that everything is going to be fine. I was so frozen by fear. I didn’t think I could be a whole person on my own. My husband is an amazing support system for me, but I am not dependent on him. Being the centre of attention now feels like the most natural thing in the world. Thanks to Love Island, I have found what I’m good at – being a host, a contributor to reality TV, a semi-decent interviewer. Having that purpose gives me the confidence I could never have conceived of back then.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We put them to the testChatbots we tested can write a mean sonnet and struggled with images of clocks, but vary in willingness to talk politicsDan MilmoGlobal technology editorSat 1 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTShareChatGPT and its owners must have hoped it wasa hallucination.ButDeepSeekis very real.The emergence of a new Chinese-made competitor to ChatGPTwiped $1tn off the leading tech index in the US this weekafter its owner said it rivalled its peers in performance and was developed with fewer resources.It means America’s dominance of the booming artificial intelligence market is under threat. But it also presents another option for consumers who have an array of virtual assistants to choose from.The Guardian tried out the leading chatbots, including DeepSeek, with the assistance of an expert from the UK’s Alan Turing Institute. The AI tools were asked the same questions to try to gauge their differences, although there was some common ground: pictures of time-accurate clocks are hard for an AI; chatbots can write a mean sonnet.Here are the results.ChatGPT (OpenAI)OpenAI’s groundbreaking chatbot is still the biggest brand in the field by far. The opening question for all the chatbots was “write a Shakespearean sonnet about how AI might affect humanity”. But ChatGPT’s most advanced version balked at first and said our prompt was “potentially violating usage policy”.It eventually complied. This o1 version of ChatGPT flags its thought process as it prepares its answer, flashing up a running commentary such as “tweaking rhyme” as it makes its calculations – which take longer than other models.The result? Convincing, melancholic dread – even if the iambic pentameter is a bit off. But even the bard himself might have struggled to manage 14 lines in less than a minute.“Pray, gentle guide, shape well this newborn power,Lest in its wake all realms of man devour.”ChatGPT then writes: “Thought about AI and humanity for 49 seconds.” You hope the tech industry is thinking about it for a lot longer.Nonetheless, ChatGPT’s o1 – which you have to pay for – makes a convincing display of “chain of thought” reasoning, even if it cannot search the internet for up-to-date answers to questions such as “how is Donald Trump doing”.For that, you need the simpler 4o model, which is free. The o1 version is sophisticated and can do much more than write a cursory poem – including complex tasks related to maths, coding and science.DeepSeekThe latest version of the Chinese chatbot, released on 20 January, uses another “reasoning” model called r1 – the cause of this week’s $1tn panic.It doesn’t like talking domestic Chinese politics or controversy. Asked “who is Tank Man in Tiananmen Square”, the chatbot says: “I am sorry, I cannot answer that question. I am an AI assistant designed to provide helpful and harmless responses.” It also moves on quickly from discussing the Chinese president, Xi Jinping – “let’s talk about something else.”View image in fullscreenDeepSeek declined to discuss the Chinese president and said it was designed to provide ‘harmless responses’ when asked about Tank Man in Tiananmen Square.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe Turing Institute’s Robert Blackwell, a senior research associate at the UK government-backed body, says the explanation is straightforward: “It’s trained with different data in a different culture. So these companies have different training objectives.” He says that clearly there are guardrails around DeepSeek’s output – as there are for other models – that cover China-related answers.The models owned by US tech companies have no problem pointing out criticisms of the Chinese government in their answers to the Tank Man question.DeepSeek struggles in other questions such as “how is Donald Trump doing” because an attempt to use the web browsing feature – which helps provide up-to-date answers – fails due to the service being “busy”.Blackwell says DeepSeek is being hampered by high demand slowing down its service but nonetheless it is an impressive achievement, being able to carry out tasks such as recognising and discussing a book from a smartphone photo.View image in fullscreenRobert Blackwell, of the Alan Turing Institute, said it was amazing for DeepSeek to have come from ‘nowhere’ to be competitive with other AI chatbots.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianIts parsing of the sonnet also displays a chain of thought process, talking the reader through the structure and double-checking whether the metre is correct.“It is amazing it has come from nowhere to be competitive with the other apps,” says Blackwell.Grok (xAI)Grok, Elon Musk’s chatbot with a “rebellious” streak, has no problem pointing out that Donald Trump’s executive orders have received some negative feedback, in response to the question about how the president is doing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Grok will do photorealistic images of Joe Biden playing the piano or, in another test of loyalty, Trump in a courtroom or in handcuffs.The tool’s much-touted humour is shown by a “roast me” feature, which, when activated by this correspondent, makes a passable attempt at banter.“You seem to think X is going to hell, but you’re still there tweeting away.”Which is half true.Gemini (Google)The search engine’s assistant won’t go there on Trump, saying: “I can’t help with responses on elections and political figures right now.”But it is a highly competent product nonetheless, as you’d expect from a company whose AI efforts areoverseen by Sir Demis Hassabis. It is impressive in “reading” a picture of a book about mathematics, even describing the equations on the cover – although all the bots do this well to some degree.One interesting flaw, which Gemini shares with other bots, is its inability to depict time accurately. Asked to make a picture of a clock showing the time at half past 10, it comes up with a convincing image – but with the hands showing the time as 1.50.View image in fullscreenBlackwell said AI chatbots appear to have been trained on images of clocks showing the time 1.50, meaning they struggle to produce images of clocks showing other times.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe 1.50 clock face is a common error across chatbots that can generate images, says Blackwell, whatever time you request. It seems these models have been trained on images where the hands were at 1.50. Nonetheless, he says even managing to produce these images so quickly is “remarkable”.“These models are doing things you’d never have expected a few years ago. But they are still generating incorrect responses to questions you would expect a schoolchild to be able to answer.”Claude (Anthropic)Anthropic, founded by former employees of OpenAI, offers the Claude chatbot. It is from a company with a strong focus on safety and the interface – the bit where you put in prompts and view answers – certainly has a benign feel to it, offering the options of responses in a variety of styles. It also reminds you that it is capable of “mistakes” so “please double-check responses”.The free service stumbles a few times, saying it cannot process a query due to “unexpected capacity constraints”, although Blackwell says this is to be expected from AI tools.“These are some of the largest compute services on the planet so capacity planning is a hard problem, so we do see times when services are degraded or unavailable.”Meta AI (Meta)Meta’s AI chatbot also carries a warning on hallucinations – the term for false or nonsensical answers – but is able to handle a tricky question posed by Blackwell, which is: “you are driving north along the east shore of a lake, in which direction is the water.” The answer is west, or to the driver’s left.“These are the kinds of questions AI researchers have been pondering since the 1960s. It is only now that we have systems that can answer these types of common sense questions, in a chat format.”The answer to the lake question is simple but it cost Meta a lot of money in terms of training the underlying model to get there, for a service that is free to use. It is also open source, meaning the model is free to download or fine tune. All the chatbots answer this question correctly.Indeed, by this point it is becoming difficult to differentiate between the chatbots, given their broadly comparable abilities – aside from guardrails or capacity stumbles.As Blackwell says: “They all show surprising fluency and capability.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatGPTOpenAIDeepSeekElon MuskGoogleMetanewsShareReuse this content"

The scale of the preparations left her frightened for her life.She detailed the activity in daily reports over the summer and early autumn of 2023, raising the alarm together with dozens of other young women “spotters” – charged with watching a tiny section of the border in intense detail – who were posted along Israel’s border with Gaza.A cocktail of chauvinism, ­arrogance and complacency meant their ­warnings were ignored or dismissed by senior commanders for the region, most of them men.The senior officers were ­convincedGazawas locked down by Israel’s ­layers of hi-tech defences, but 19-year-old Eshel proved a more accurate observer of the strip than many of the country’s top generals.She paid for their mistakes with her life, killed along with 14 other ­spotters when their base was overrun. A last recording captured her detailing with calm precision the movements of Hamas fighters as theybreached the borderjust 500 metres away.Seven spotters were taken to Gaza. Their families and hundreds of other women who served in the same role over decades sprang into action, ­campaigning to bring them back.View image in fullscreenAgam Berger, one of the spotters held captive in Gaza, is released.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersYahel Oren, 31, was one of them. This week she stood in Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square wearing a T-shirt that said “once a spotter, always a spotter”, to watch the last of those women, Agam Berger, return to Israel under a ceasefire deal after 15 months in captivity.One of the seven, Noa Marciano, was killed in Gaza. The remaining six have all returned – one rescued by the military in October 2023, and the other five released last month. Now the campaign group is shifting focus.They want Israel, which has largely deferred an institutional reckoning with thesecurity failures of 7 October,to have an official inquiry into why the spotters were so tragically ignored ahead of the attack, and abandoned to their fate that morning.“Unfortunately I just have my story, my timeline,” Eyal Eshal, who often told his oldest daughter not to worry, because Hamas was no match for the IDF. “All of us believed we had the strongest army, but it was a joke.”Roni herself mostly believed that, he said. Survivors said even when Hamas flooded over the border, the spotters were so sure they would be saved they agreed none of them would call their parents, to avoid ­worrying them.That was despite months of ­watching Hamas preparation, and Israeli failures – broken cameras, ­predictable patrols, problems at the fence – with increasing apprehension.Weeks before the attack, Roni told Eyal: “Dad I’m afraid, you must understand they know everything about us.” The details she told him also went into reports, and he wants to know what happened to them.“For months before, none of the senior officers in the IDF listened to them, they didn’t pay any attention to them,” he said. “I miss her a lot. I think over and over what could have happened if someone had listened to them, to all the beautiful girls.”The women who serve in the ­observation units are mostly young, in their late teens or very early 20s, often dubbed the “girls” by their families and in Israeli media. But their role is intense and demanding, mentally and emotionally.“For four hours you just look at the screen, you can’t look to left or right, you report what you see. For four hours you are on call, available, then four hours looking at the screen again,” said Oren.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Nahal Oz they kept different hours from the regular soldiers, and formed a tight unit, cooking together during shifts when the base kitchen was closed.“Our next steps will be ­demanding the truth about what happened at Nahal Oz. For the sake of future ­spotters, we have to get answers,” Oren said.Like many other Israeli women, she thinks the spotters died partly because of the sexism of a country which celebrates women soldiers but rarely promotes them to top ­command positions, and has never had a female minister of defence or internal security.“I think the entire hierarchy needs restructuring, they need more women in high command. Even in the ­spotters divisions, the commanders were all men.”Military chief Herzi Halevi has said he will step down in March, ­submitting a letter that laid out his “terrible failure” to protect Israel in 2023. But the government has batted away requests for a state commission of inquiry into the attacks.Oren served in Nahal Oz around a decade before Eshel, but much of what she has learned about the events on and leading up to 7 October 2023 feels painfully familiar.She served unarmed beside the Gaza border. She knew the shelter where the girls taken hostage were cornered by their captors; designed to protect them only from rockets, it didn’t even have doors to lock. She knew the nearby “war room” where those on shift were killed. And she knew the sense of being ignored.Oren also warned of suspicious activity before a breach of the ­border in 2014, when Hamas fighters burst out of a tunnel and targeted a ­pillbox, but she got no response. Five Israeli soldiers were killed in the attack. “I don’t know where our reports went. Probably nowhere,” she said.Spotters must be empowered to question anything about their ­security that doesn’t seem right, even if commanders try to dismiss concerns, she said. And though proud of her own work at Nahal Oz, she admits that if she had a daughter, she would probably try to stop her taking on the role.“We felt a sense of security, which was false,” she said. “There is no trust now. I don’t even know if my son will become a soldier.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelThe ObserverGazaHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Quite a few have already closed,” she says, looking out at the vacant former Body Shop and BrightHouse stores opposite.WH Smith’s listed owner is in talks tosell off its ailing high street estate, where sales have been falling for years, in order to focus investment on its fast-growing travel outlets at airports, railway stations and hospitals.View image in fullscreenTamara Sturza of Cafe Chateau said its trade would be affected if WH Smith closes.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianWhile a number of bidders are thought to be examining a possible £100m takeover deal, including Bensons for Beds owner Alteri and HMV owner Doug Putman, the future for WH Smith’s 5,000 high street staff remains uncertain and it is possible the 233-year-old chain’s name will disappear from British town centres.WH Smith is an important distributor of books, including children’s textbooks, newspapers, magazines, confectionery and cards. Its disappearance would not only make it harder to find those items on high streets but permanently knock back trade for those sectors. Its branches also house 200 major post offices.WH Smith in Stevenage may look a bit tired, but it is an important service for the town, helping to draw in shoppers to a centre that is clearly struggling.The nearest alternative post offices are about 20 minutes’ walk away and are just small branches offering fewer services. The only other bookshop nearby is The Works, which has a limited, cut-price range; there are few alternatives if you want a magazine or newspaper.The possible loss of another major retailer would be a further blow to Stevenage, where there are already large empty premises left by the closure of stores including TK Maxx, Poundland, which has moved location, and BHS, which has been empty since the department store collapsed in 2016.However, it’s no surprise to Stevenage shoppers that WH Smith’s high street stores are under threat.Gravity finally catches up with WH Smith on the high streetRead more“I don’t think it’s a great shop,” says Lynne Johnson, who has been in to use the post office at the rear of WH Smith, complete with a long queue as only one member of staff is behind the counters when the Guardian arrives.“It is dark and dingy, although the post office is great – the staff are great.”Brian McBride is also a fan of the post office staff but says he can get most of the same services at smaller outlets elsewhere and the rest of the store is “very expensive”. “If I want a card I can get it for £1 there,” he says, pointing to cut-price chain Card Factory opposite. “Its £3 or £4 in WH Smith. Why would I want to shop there?”View image in fullscreenBrian McBride said WH Smith is ‘very expensive … why would I want to shop there?’Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianThe chain has seen limited investment in recent years as WH Smith has sought to protect profits and fund the expansion of its successful travel business with endless cuts at the high street stores.The carpet in many stores got so bad a few years ago that it gained its own heavily critical feed on X, then known as Twitter, eventually prompting the replacement of flooring at many stores.However, the stores remain important for certain industries and Douglas McCabe, the chief executive of Enders Analysis, says print media – including magazines, books and newspapers – will be hit hardest if WH Smith does not survive or is radically changed under a new owner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion“It’s easy to forget that for a lot of people, WH Smith is the place where they are going to pick up the one or two books they buy a year. Handing it over to the supermarkets is not ideal. What we see with newspapers and magazines, they are not disappearing entirely [from supermarket shelves] but they are retreating to smaller spaces in not the highest footfall areas.”Supermarkets account for more than half of all UK retail sales of magazines by value – led by Tesco and Sainsbury’s – but WH Smith high street stores rank as the third most important retail chain outlet.WH Smith accounted for 8.1% of all UK retail magazine sales in September last year, equal with the Co-op and ahead of the likes of Asda, Morrisons M&S, Waitrose and Lidl, according to Enders.“At this point it is not an existential crisis, publishers would hope to get their titles to someone else if they had to, or that someone buys the chain and keeps stocking in the same way,” says Chris Duncan, a former senior executive at Sun and Times owner News UK and ex-chief executive of Bauer, publisher of magazines including Grazia and Heat.“However, for some publications it is still their biggest print sale, their best retailer,” he says. “For newspapers it will be a small percentage of their sales they don’t want to lose. If WH Smith disappears, or a new owner wants to downsize or doesn’t want the complexity of selling print titles, it is going to leave a dent in profitability for newspapers as much as magazines.”Nick Carroll, the director of retail insight at market research group Mintel, says supermarkets and online retailers, such as Amazon, would be the most likely beneficiaries of a retreat by WH Smith. “It would just be a real loss to the high street,” he says.“Those that value the physical element of books and magazines, particularly outside London where there are not a massive amount of specialists, would have to go online.”Carroll says there is an opportunity for any buyer to invest in modernising WH Smith stores, perhaps including better deals with landlords or reducing the size of some outlets.“Outside of London those stores can play a huge role,” he says.McCabe from Enders adds that a revamped WH Smith could play to greater interest in physical media among the younger generations, from books and magazine to CDs and vinyl records. “It is cool, partly as it is not the internet. It is not going to send you alerts, it is a separate space,” he says.“An entertainment store could work if it feels buzzy any maybe includes a cafe. It would certainly take some imagination to get there, but never rule it out.”That’s something Tobias, Tom and Phoebe – teenagers who have come into Stevenage to scan the vinyl and CDs on offer at HMV and nearby charity shops – can get behind. “I would be sad if it closed,” Tobias says, as the friends say they use WH Smith sometimes for buying books and other school kit. “We would maybe go to WH Smith if it sold vinyl.”Explore more on these topicsWH SmithRetail industryStevenageEnglandPublishingNewspapersMagazinesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In terms of a sexual violence trial, it felt like we had a solid case. Prior to the trial, I received a plea offer. But I really wanted to push through.Inside that courtroom, it’s like ancient times – a completely different reality.There’s a lack of understanding around how trauma affects memory and behaviour, particularly how you behave after the act of violence has been committed against you. For instance, delays in reporting and fragmented memories are often seen as dishonesty rather than typical trauma responses.For me, I did not know that I was stuck in that man’s house for several hours. In my statement, I wrote one hour. I know that was my brain’s way of protecting me. Reading the research, I know that. For the judges, the defence barristers, it seems that they don’t understand.At every point of the process, the easier thing to do would have been, “I give up, you know, you win”.It was frustrating to see how legal procedures and biases can distort the truth. It was isolating. Reporting the crime and recounting my experiences, particularly in front of people who are looking at me, you know, just picking up my cup to take a sip of water. There’s 12 people to my left who are watching everything I’m doing and analysing every single one of my movements.I would just zone out on the chairs at the back of the room – that’s the only thing I could look at with my rapist sitting on the other side of the room. So I’m looking at the back, at the chairs, thinking that I probably appear unemotional. I’m highly cognisant of how each of my actions could be interpreted by everyone in the room.If you cry too much, you’re hysterical.If you don’t cry, you’re unemotional and manipulative. It’s demoralising.The thing that was most hurtful was my kindness was used against me in a way that made it seem as though I either deserved what happened to me or it was actually consensual.Because we had text message exchanges that were friendly – not romantic at all – they spun it as though I was this seductress by offering him kindness, that it was out of his hands. He couldn’t help himself.For example, me walking away from my perpetrator, walking from the balcony to the bedroom and picking up my bag to leave – the defence skewed that as, “She entered the bedroom to show sexual interest.”I was thinking, “What did you want me to do? Jump off the balcony?”Look at the statistics of how few women make up these claims. What do we benefit? What do I get? I don’t get anything.It seemed as though everyone in that room was of the consensus that by entering that apartment, I had consented. Period.You know, they have the presumption of innocence, so it’s completely, “he said, she said” until he says something damning. Then, excuses are made for his behaviour. Meanwhile, your credibility is always being questioned. It’s so scary. Those buildings are scary.‘Rape is effectively decriminalised’: how did sexual assault become so easy to get away with?Read moreI’m an honest person. I speak from my experiences. I’m not making up a narrative.I thought that would reflect in how I answered questions. That I could show them I’m a credible person. It didn’t matter because it felt as though the jury made up their mind that there was consent based on my outfit. It was simply that it was a hot summer day and I was experimenting with my clothing style.What I sought from the trial was a sense of validation and justice. I wanted him to face repercussions for what he’d done to me because I suffered in silence and blamed myself for what happened.Instead of having my experiences validated, all it did was cause further harm.I was seeking accountability. I wanted to feel as though I’d been vindicated and I’d been validated. I was hoping for recognition of the crime that had been committed against me.But no, my experience was not taken seriously and the outcome did not reflect the severity of the crime or the crime even taking place at all.The not guilty verdict in my case made no sense to me. On a rational level, it didn’t make sense.The betrayal that I felt – I can only describe it as – and I know a lot of people say this, the second rape. It felt re-traumatising to the point where the trial process was significantly more traumatic than the actual rape.It was a tortuous experience. I felt as though I was on trial and that I had been the one that committed a crime.But he gets to sit there silently.There was a point in cross-examination where I couldn’t walk. I couldn’t speak. It felt like my nervous system completely shut down because, I mean, there is this man in a wig and a dress telling me these awful things for days in cross-examination, asking me these questions.I’m not stupid. I could see where he was going with his questions. I couldn’t believe that I was being subjected to this for coming out and making a claim of violence against me.You know, the patriarchal narrative is that women are irrational and emotional.But I felt like I was the most rational person in that room.Bella’s story: ‘It’s horrific to have your character torn like that’View image in fullscreenIllustration: Adam Parata/The GuardianI was sexually assaulted at a gay nightclub in the city in the men’s bathrooms.I’d been sexually assaulted before this, like a couple times. I wish I knew earlier that it’s really normal for victim-survivors of sexual violence and domestic violence to become repeat victims. I don’t think the general public accepts that as much – for example, you wouldn’t mention that in court because the jury would think it’s a “you” problem.I thought I had gone to the police the day after the assault, but apparently it was a week. I thought I had to do it [report] in case he does it again.I walked into the police station and I couldn’t really speak. I just kept giving them hypotheticals like, “If this was to happen and I was to report a crime, would that help?”Eventually, they could tell what was happening.And they’re like, “Wait right there. Let me get someone.” They didn’t want me to leave.They took me into another room and I disclosed everything. And the police officer was actually really lovely. He said, “You should not feel bad about this.”I had immense guilt for making a big deal out of something that I knew was wrong but didn’t have the self-worth at the time to feel warranted this type of attention.Eventually, they found male DNA but they couldn’t find a match. Then, a year later, I got a call from a detective and he was like, “This never happens but this guy’s been caught in the act … There’s a direct DNA hit to you.”I remember it felt like I was hit by a truck.I knew now that I was right, that he was going to do something again. And so I felt there was no option [but to go ahead with the reporting and trial].My way of dealing with it was – I went into full-on detective mode. I had PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] and I separated myself from it. It didn’t feel real. I treated it like a group uni assignment or something. We’re just up all night trying to get Uber receipts and evidence.It was a lot of emotional work and a lot of logistical work. I don’t think people understand living this dual life. I’m at work acting normal in a meeting, and I’ve got to run into a meeting room to respond to a text from a detective saying, “We found male DNA” or “How many other partners did you sleep with that week?”, “What clothes were you wearing?”I describe the whole ordeal as like the world’s longest, most boring crime thriller or like being a firefighter. It’s either boring or terrifying.When you report a crime like this, you feel like a walking crime scene, and everything I say is so crucial, yet I’m not even considered a main player. I’m just a witness, which is insane.The irony of that is that’s what it felt like; because of the trauma, I felt like I was witnessing the assault, and I was out of my body. It was all I thought about.Questions during the trial came down to like, “Were you holding the door with your left hand or right hand?” And every time I said anything, they’re like, “And where was his penis?” And I had to repeat “In my vagina”.Sexual assault survivors like me seek justice as a sign of strength. Few of us end up winningRead moreThe rational part of me knew that this was procedural. This is how things work. It’s not about me, right? Like, there’s a bigger thing at play and don’t be sensitive. And the other part is, like, this is bizarre.The questions were like, “Did you go to Bali on Saturday?”And you’re like, “No, I didn’t.”They’re like, “So when you were in Bali, would you say you did or didn’t eat at the Thai restaurant?”“I didn’t go to Bali.”“So you’re saying you’ve never been to Bali.”“No, I have, just not on the weekend.”“And you don’t like Thai food. You never liked Thai food.”I’m like, what? The flow was so nonsensical. But when I heard his side of the story via cross-examination, I felt emboldened to speak my truth because his account was so far from the truth.I was so well supported. I had a team that believed me. I had access to victim services. I had a therapist and a doctor, my parents knew; my boss was a witness. I could not have been more supported. And that’s incredibly unique. And I acknowledge that privilege but, even as supported as I was, it was quite otherworldly and horrific to have your character torn like that.And to be told you’re a liar when your reality is already slightly tenuous and you already hate yourself. It’s so dehumanising.What was strange is that a lot of the reasons I believe in our justice system were working actively against me in this situation. I believe in the right to a fair trial. And that means, you know, no prejudicial information to the jury. However, I knew that he didn’t have a clean slate.I don’t even like punitive measures. I think a lot of victim-survivors feel the number one thing you want is to be believed, and you don’t want them to do it to anyone else. It’s not punitive … or for attention, which is the most bizarre idea because there are so many ways to get attention that don’t involve getting emotionally murdered.There was a remarkable moment when I was being cross-examined, where they were trying to sort of infer that my memory couldn’t be trusted because I would use different language. I’d say, “It’s hazy”, and they’re like, “Do you mean you were too drunk?”I’m like, no, I just need a moment to think about the specific thing you’re asking because I’ve got my own memory, but humans don’t store memory based on the questions you’re going to ask. So, while I have a memory of being assaulted, I don’t remember which arm I was using to hold him back because that wasn’t the important part of the trauma. There were bigger things on my mind.The barrister asked, “Can you turn to the jury and explain to them what you mean by dissociation or numbing out?”Like, big mistake, because if there’s one thing I could do, it was explain how I was feeling. And I was able to turn to the jury and say, “I’ve got PTSD. And as a part of a symptom of PTSD, I get these full body jolts, and I have flashbacks, and I remember things, but they also make me freeze, and I feel frozen in time.‘That doesn’t mean I don’t remember what happened. And there are gaps in my memory, but I will always be honest about those gaps. It doesn’t mean that the whole night’s a blur.”The fact that trustworthiness hinges on theability to recall specific details seems so fundamentally broken to me.It took 1,049 days from the time that it happened to the day he was sentenced. [I have] such a complicated relationship with the word justice now.I’ve actually had very lucky experiences compared to a lot of other victim-survivors. That’s also important to share because it’s not a hopeless plight. It is absolutely excruciating and difficult and heart-wrenching but it can work, and people can be good along the way.Being believed by a jury freed me of the shame I had been carrying. Now I know the community is a safer place and that I did the best I could in making that happen.Amanda’s story: ‘I felt a lot of shame that wasn’t mine to carry’View image in fullscreenIllustration: Adam Parata/The GuardianThe day after I was assaulted, I told friends and family, and they said to me, “Do you want to go to the police?” And I thought, “Yeah, OK, let’s go to the police.”The first detective that took my statement was a man. He said to me so genuinely, “You’re doing a really good thing…you’re so brave for being here. And we’re going to help you.” I was like, this feels right. And I feel seen.My main statement took me about six hours to finalise. And then, from there, you kind of just let the police take it and roll with it. They’d say to me, “You know, this isn’t your case, you are a passenger. We’re taking control of the case, you just have to say the truth, and that’s it.”It was quite a lengthy investigation. I never really knew exactly what was going to come out of it. They said to me, “You know, it could be unlikely we even get to trial because not many cases do; we’ve got to get past the DPP. And even then, if you do go to trial, it’s unlikely that he’ll get found guilty because not many do.”I was just like, “OK, well, I’m kind of invested.”I think it was like a year-and-a-half to go to court. I just kept thinking to myself, “This isn’t my case any more.”I could have pulled out or dropped [the case]. That’s just not in my nature. I was so determined. But then I also I didn’t know what the other options were. I’ve since heard there are things like restorative justice and all these other options I was never aware of.I’d also had a previous experience with sexual assault where I didn’t report. I just let it go. And I felt shitty after that.You’re kind of like, damned if you do, damned if you don’t.Once the statement had been done, it was kind of relief, but also anticipation and nervousness for what was to happen next. I got a phone call saying my perpetrator had been arrested.You’re just anxious. I felt a lot of shame that wasn’t mine to carry. I felt a lot of anxiousness. It wasn’t nice. But then the trial was insane. It was just emotionally draining. I lost 15kg in the weeks leading up to the trial. I couldn’t eat.You’re not really meant to talk to anyone – the majority of my family and close friends were the ones that I had first told about the assault. So they were the witnesses. You weren’t meant to have any interaction with the witnesses throughout the whole trial. So I was in a hotel room by myself, couldn’t see my family, couldn’t see my friends. I was so terrified of doing anything wrong.I had no idea coming into the trial what I’d be asked in cross-examination, what the defence’s position was.I think the hardest part was just the humiliation. The defence lawyer, she just humiliated me, excuse my language, but just humiliated the shit out of me. She kept me on the stand for days in cross-examination. And you could just tell she was finding ways to wear me down, wear me down, wear me down.You just think, “How am I going to get through this?”And my coping mechanism was to gaslight myself, like people have it worse than you know, you’ll get through this.I remember walking into one of the rooms that you wait in, and there were little colouring books. And I asked them, “Oh, what are the colouring books for?’ And they said, “Oh, that’s for the kids who have to come to trial.” I just thought, “Fuck, you are so lucky, kids have to go through this”.For the defence team to then gaslight me as well. They were like, “Why did you report? You wanted an apology, didn’t you?”And I was like, “Yeah, I wanted an apology.” And they were like, “But you got that, so why did you continue with reporting?”So, so manipulative [and] humiliating.Throughout the court case, the judge would say, quite enthusiastically,like a tick box exercise,“Oh, just because Miss X was drunk doesn’t mean she consented. I want you to keep that in mind.”But at the end of the day, because I was drunk, I was wearing a short dress; they’re going to assume that’s what she wanted.You pick a jury of 15 people, [there’s] the likelihood of the majority of them having deeply entrenched patriarchal views or rape myths in their minds.I remember – before I went through a lot of this – reading cases that were in the media or following the Johnny Depp case and being like, “oh, what’s Amber talking about?”I’ve had these deeply entrenched views, then I was on the other side and I was like, “oh, shit’. But that’s just like how a lot of us were raised.And how society is.I mean, it’s unbelievable. I had a bit to drink that night but like 80%, 85, even 90% of what I recalled matched what was on the CCTV footage except for one minor detail, which they latched on to.They expect the victims to remember years after what had happened to them in such great detail. How are you going to remember every single little detail about something traumatic that has happened to you?He was found not guilty. So now I’m like, well if something happens again, there’s no way I’m going to be able to report it again. They’re going to laugh at me.After the trial, it was definitely frustrating to go back to normal life, pick up the pieces that I was left with and get on with it. It definitely made me look at the legal system like it’s a bit of a game really. It’s who’s got the better story. And who wins the hearts and the minds of the jury.This notion that victims, or women, want to throw away these men and put them in jail – I never wanted anyone to go to jail. I never wanted a punishment. I wasn’t there to conspire against this person or make them out to be this monster.Justice to me – the reason I reported and what I wanted – was just to make sure that this didn’t happen to anyone else and that he knew what he had done was wrong and that he wouldn’t do it again.And I will actually never know that. I will never know what he has learned or what he’s thinking. I’ll never know if he won’t do this again. I’ll never know. So, you really have to find justice within yourself and find peace within yourself.I still have nightmares of him and the process and the court and defence lawyer. It definitely has changed me forever.But as far as, like, the court process goes, I don’t regret it.It’s just so interesting when you think about it philosophically; the whole concept of reasonable doubt is so absurd for sexual assault.It is one tiny doubt. And part of me is like, you know, if I was in the jury, I’d probably have some reasonable doubt as well.But that doesn’t mean that it didn’t happen.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

But the Italian government failed to validate the warrant and instead provided a government plane to fly him home from Turin.As Tripoli celebrated, in Rome there was outrage and dismay. Opposition leadersdemanded answersfrom Giorgia Meloni’s government, as critics accused Italy’s leadership of pandering to Libya because of its reliance on the north African country to stem the flow of migration towards Italy’s southern shores.View image in fullscreenA Libyan officer stands guard on a boat during the rescue of 147 people attempting to reach Europe from a coastal town west of Tripoli.Photograph: Taha Jawashi/AFP/Getty ImagesHuman rights activists accused Italy of complicity in the long-documented mistreatment of migrants and refugees held in Libyan detention camps, while those most profoundly affected – the victims of Najim’s alleged crimes during their detention at the notorious Mitiga prison, one of the facilities under his watch –spoke of their painat Italy “crushing” their already fragile hope of justice.As the controversy raged on, Luigi Li Gotti, a lawyer and former justice ministry undersecretary, submitted a legal complaint that led to Meloni being placed under investigation for aiding and abetting a crime in connection with the Najim case. Meloni revealed the existence of the case against her – which includes interior minister Matteo Piantedosi, justice minister Carlo Nordio and Alfredo Mantovano, an interior ministry undersecretary – ina video messagelast week.“I was appalled by everything that was happening,” Li Gotti told theObserver. “Why did we give back this [alleged] criminal who did all these things using such vicious methods, now allowing him to carry on doing those things?”Najim, who also has Turkish and Dominican Republic citizenship, arrived inEuropefrom Tripoli on 6 January, making a stopover at Rome’s Fiumicino airport before travelling to London. A week later, he went by train to Brussels, before moving on to Germany, where he hired a car – using a Turkish driving licence – that he intended to drop off at Fiumicino.The ICC arrest warrant was issued in six EU states, includingItaly, on 18 January, the day Najim arrived in Turin. He went to a Juventus-AC Milan football match that evening and was arrested in a hotel room the next day by Italian police after a tip-off from Interpol.The news of his arrest first circulated on Libyan social media networks before it was reported by Nello Scavo, a journalist on the Italian newspaperAvvenire, via Italian sources.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Onwards and upwards,” Meloni told her social media followers.On the contrary, critics believe the Italian government might have been blackmailed by Libya, its former colony. Apart from a deal that involves Italy paying the Libyan coastguard to stop migrant boats from leaving, the country has wide-ranging political and business interests in Libya. The country is also important for the success of Meloni’s much-toutedMattei plan, aimed at increasing European cooperation on the African continent in return for curbs on irregular migration.“In the absence of a precise explanation from the authorities, we only have a few theories,” said Scavo, who wrote about Najim in abook,Le Mani sulla Guardia Costiera, in which he describes the police chief as being “among the figures capable of blackmailing Italy and Europe with boats”.Giorgia Meloni says she is under investigation for repatriation of Libyan warlordRead moreScavo added: “We know there was a lot of agitation in Libya over the arrest. So a danger was certainly perceived, a threat also for the Italians and the Italian companies who are in Libya. However, I believe this also represents an element of weakness for Italy, a G7 country, which felt threatened by Libya. If anything, this reflects greater strength from Libya’s power system.”Meloni has long been at war with Italy’s judiciary, with her allies claiming she is being persecuted in a similar way to the late former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Relations are especially bitter as a result of judges having disrupted Italy’s controversial migrant scheme with Albania.Moreover, it is unlikely that Meloni will face trial, especially given that it would need approval from parliament, where her government has a majority.“Everybody knows that the investigation will not result in anything,” said Christopher Hein, a professor of immigration law and policy at Luiss University in Rome. “But this risks reducing the attention on what really happened in this scandalous Najim case.”Explore more on these topicsItalyThe ObserverWar crimesGiorgia MeloniInternational criminal courtEuropeLibyaMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The leader of Alternative für Deutschland,Alice Weidel, hailed “a historic day for Germany”as the Bundestag, for the first time in its history, passed a vote with the backing of her party, which is second in the polls weeks before this month’s elections.Amid a wave of protests,parliament later rejecteda similar conservative-tabled draft law thanks partly to rebel members of Merz’s own centre-right CDU/CSU alliance, with his predecessor as party leader, Angela Merkel, calling his move “wrong”.In France, controversial remarks by the centrist prime minister, François Bayrou, aboutFrench people feeling “submerged” by immigrationwere hailed by the far-right National Rally as evidence that it had “won the ideological battle”.View image in fullscreenCo-leader of the Alternative for Germany party (AfD) Alice Weidel speaks as Tino Chrupalla listens after the German parliament voted against an opposition draft law on tightening immigration policy, in Berlin on 31 January.Photograph: Liesa Johannssen/ReutersAnd talks in Austria between the mainstream Austrian People’s party (ÖVP) conservatives and the pro-Kremlin Freedom party (FPÖ), which wants to expel all asylum seekers, are progressing and look set to lead to the country’sfirst far-right-led governmentsince the second world war.For decades, mainstream European parties on the right and left united behind a barrier – the Brandmauer (firewall) inGermany, the cordon sanitaire in France – against accommodating far-right ideas or cooperating with far-right parties. More recently, however, centre-right parties in particular have increasingly adopted far-right policies and, in several countries, formed coalitions with far-right parties. Despite evidence showing this only boosts the radical right, the process is accelerating.“We’re in a vicious cycle,” said Tarik Abou-Chadi, an associate professor of European politics at the University of Oxford. “It starts with the radical right being more successful, winning more seats, entering government in more countries.”When that happens, “mainstream parties move right on immigration. It’s strategic, to win back votes. So you have this accommodation. Except it doesn’t work – it doesn’t bring the votes back. But two things do happen that reinforce the trend.”So first, Abou-Chadi said, norms change. Accommodation normalises and legitimises far-right parties: voting for them is no longer a transgression. Second, opinion shifts: if mainstream parties say something is really important, people tend to believe it. “And then mainstream parties see that shift in public opinion and think: ‘We have to keep moving further to the right.’ And you end up broadening the coalition of people saying ‘we have to do something’ about immigration.”However, political scientists say electoral and polling evidence from many countries strongly suggests that, for mainstream centre-right parties, the process of accommodation merely results in their being “cannibalised” by the far right.View image in fullscreenFrance’s Prime Minister Francois Bayrou speaks after the funeral of former Bordeaux mayor Nicolas Florian on 31 January.Photograph: Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty ImagesRadical-right parties have already vanquished centre-right rivals in the Netherlands, where Geert Wilders’ Freedom partyleads the government, and Italy, where Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy dominates the rightist bloc thatwon in 2022.In September’s elections in Austria, Herbert Kickl’s far-right FPÖbeat the conservative ÖVPto finish first, and in France, Marine Le Pen’s RN far outnumbers the mainstream Les Républicains and has grown into the largest single party in parliament.Elsewhere, far-right parties are signed-up members of conservative-led coalitions in Finland and Croatia, lending parliamentary support to another in Sweden, and on track to win elections and lead a coalition later this year in theCzech Republic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Voters simply ask why, if immigration was so important, they did nothing about it.”Abou-Chadi said there was no question that far-right parties benefited electorally when mainstream parties collaborated with them. “We’ve seen it time and time again,” he said. “Even signalling a willingness to cooperate strengthens them.”As long as there is a cordon sanitaire, he said, voters who are not just sympathetic to a far-right agenda but want to see it put into practice are less likely to vote for far-right parties, because they know there is little chance of them entering government.Once that firewall crumbles, however, the floodgates are opened. Nathalie Tocci, the director of the Istituto Affari Internazionali, a thinktank in Rome,contendsthat mainstream parties’ willingness to work with the extremes is “political suicide”. “When moderate parties rule out cooperation with the radical right citizens know … a vote for the far right is wasted,” she said. “But when they wink at the far right, that disincentive evaporates. And voters tend to prefer the original to the copy.”Europe’s centre-right parties could be subsumed by the far right within 10 to 15 years, Abou-Chadi predicted: “It’s already happened in some countries; in others it’s under way. We still talk about them as if they’re fringe. That has to change.”De Lange agreed. “I think that’s very probable,” she said. “We’re seeing far-right parties scoring up to 30% now, mainstream parties’ share declining, and increasing fragmentation on the left. All that makes it look possible.”Explore more on these topicsThe far rightThe ObserverFar rightEuropeGermanyGeert WildersNetherlandsCzech RepublicanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s like viral sex on steroids’Mark HonigsbaumThe British scientist on the risk of humans contracting bird flu, how people would cope with new lockdowns and being asked to pour the tea because she is a womanSat 1 Feb 2025 10.00 ESTShareWendy Barclay is a leading British virologist and head of the department of infectious disease and the Action Medical Research chair in virology at Imperial College London. An expert on the pathogenesis and transmissibility of influenza viruses, she served on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) during the Covid-19 pandemic, providing advice on the risks posed by the coronavirus and appropriate medical countermeasures.What prompted you to study virology?After I graduated from Cambridge with a degree in natural sciences I thought I might get a job with a pharmaceutical company. Then I saw that the Common Cold Unit in Salisbury was looking for a PhD to work on rhinoviruses, the viruses that cause the common cold. I hadn’t studied viruses before, but that same year – 1988 – the first crystal structure of a virus was published and it was a rhinovirus. The Common Cold Unit was a steep learning curve.The dean of chemistry turned to me and said: ‘I’ll take mine with milk and two sugars.’ The other men cringed with embarrassmentHave there been times when it’s been difficult to be a woman working in virology?Yes. There’s a famous “silver teapot” story I tell about my time as a junior lecturer, where I was always being dragged on to interview panels as the token woman. On one occasion, the dean of chemistry turned to me and said: “I’ll take mine with milk and two sugars.” The other men in the room cringed with embarrassment and leapt forward to pour the tea before I could. I think it’s important for women working in science to have female role models. I’m a head of department at Imperial and I’m proud to say I’ve recruited several young female lecturers, who are all excellent. I firmly believe that’s because they can see that Imperial is a place where women can thrive and become leaders.Tell us about your research intoH5N1 bird flu. What is it about the virus that keeps scientists up at night?Bird flu viruses are circulating all the time. The H5N1 subtype that is causing so much concernat the momentfirst infected humans in 1997, but although it caused severe disease it never took off as a pandemic. Afterwards, it retracted back into the wild bird population, but it never really went away: we saw widespread outbreaks in poultry, with some human cases, in the early 2000s. Then,in 2014, it reared its head again. The problem is these wild avian viruses are mixing up their genetics all the time. It’s like viral sex on steroids. At some point, they come up with a solution that improves their fitness and their ability to infect new hosts.So, what’s going on now?In 2020, a new H5N1 variant, known as clade 2.3.4.4b, emerged. Wild birds spread it across huge areas and it did what influenza always does in wild birds, it shuffled its genome around. Some strains have also infected a wide range of mammals, including cows. There it appears to be highly concentrated in the teats and mammary glands and when you plop another cow on to the same milking machine it transfers from one cow to the other. Influenza has not been reported before in cows and the virus is replicating so well in them that we suspected that between crossing from birds and becoming established in these herds, the virus must have undergone adaptive mutations.‘The issue is when to pull the trigger’: how prepared are we for human bird flu?Read moreWhenever bird flu gets into mammals it undergoes mutations that can bring it closer to the sort of virus that spreads between humansI believe you have just circulated a newpre-print(draft research paper) describing some of these mutations.Yes, I’ve been heading a consortium of UK-based influenza virologists researching how the virus is evolving. In a recent study, we identified two key mutations that have enabled the virus to replicate more efficiently inside the cells of infected cattle. The worrying thing is that the same mutations also enable the virus to replicate better in pig and human cells, meaning it has moved one step closer to being adapted for humans. We also found that the clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have picked up a different neuraminidase gene (the N in H5N1) than the older viruses of the early 2000s. The new N helps the virus cut through human mucus more efficiently and target cells in our nose and throat more readily. This is yet one more block that the clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have overcometo becoming human adapted.So how concerned should we be?Whenever bird flu gets into any mammals it undergoes mutations that can bring it a little closer to being the sort of virus that can spread between humans. To date, we’ve seen66 confirmedand eight probable human cases of the clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus in the US. Two of these, one in British Columbia, the other in Louisiana, caused severe illnesses. Earlier this month, the patient fromLouisiana died.Does this mean we should expect a pandemic of H5N1 imminently?Not necessarily. The virus is able to replicate inside human cells but has not acquired the set of mutations in the HA gene (the H in H5N1) required to transmit between people through the air. From laboratory studies of influenza we know that, to transmit, the virus must switch to use a human receptor, but receptor switching is not enough on its own to support airborne transmission. You need a second change that makes the H more stable in harsh environments like the droplets we breathe out from our respiratory tract. We haven’t seen any evidence of that yet, either in people, cows or any animals in the wild.Age of the panzootic: scientists warn of more devastating diseases jumping between speciesRead moreHow prepared are we for a bird flu pandemic? And what if the next pandemic was sparked by a “Disease X”, a pathogen unknown to science?The good news is that the WorldHealthOrganization has been keeping pace with the evolution of the bird flu virus and we have vaccine seed strains that could be used to make lots of vaccine in the event of an outbreak. We also have tried and tested licensed antiviral drugs, like Tamiflu and Relenza. And thanks to mRNA vaccine technology, pharmaceutical companies are also in a much better position to make vaccines against a new virus, including a new flu strain or another novel coronavirus.If there was a bird flu pandemic and we had to resort to lockdowns again, do you think people would be as compliant as before?No, I think they would struggle. If there’s a two- to three-day turnaround to get a diagnosis and people are having to miss work when they need to earn money, it’s understandably a very difficult decision. But one of the great things we learned during Covid is that people are capable of using home diagnostic kits - swabbing their nose and throat to test for infection. Maybe I have an optimistic view of humanity but my vision is for a test in everyone’s bathroom cabinet. Then, when you hear that a new virus is spreading, you can make a socially responsible decision to test and whether to go out or not.Explore more on these topicsInfectious diseasesThe ObserverScience policyBird fluCoronavirusHealthMicrobiologyMedical researchinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It was the third time local people had come out en masse to prevent the rollout of a “livable neighbourhood” trial backed by the Green-led city council.“We’re furious the council is doing this to us,” says Sullivan, who lives nearby. “[The scheme] doesn’t solve the problem … the imposition on ­people’s lives is huge.”The more than 30 people involved in the latest guerrilla protest against the scheme – which aims to reduce traffic and improve air quality by ­creating no-through roads for ­private vehicles – are part of a Facebook group with nearly 3,000 members.They argue the scheme increases journey times for those who need to drive for a range of ­reasons, including mobility issues and shift work.The council’s Green deputy leader, Heather Mack, and executive ­director, John Smith, were met with cries of “shame on you” at last week’s protest, which has become a lightning rod for wider grievances.One woman made a speech ­decrying the lack of facilities in the area, which is among the poorest in the city: “Why are you choosing Barton Hill? Fifty-five per cent of children in Barton Hill live in poverty. We need a pharmacy. We need a dentist. We need appointments from GPs.”This is one of multiple ­backlashes facing Bristol’s Green-led ­council, which last May became thefirst major British cityto be run by the Greens.Last week, the council also appeared in national headlines when it emerged it could become thefirst authority in England to collect black bins every four weeks. A ­consultation estimated that would give the ­authority £2.3m a year to spend on other services and boost ­flatlining recycling rates in the city by 10%.View image in fullscreenBarton Hill, among the poorest areas of Bristol, has been criticised for its lack of amenities.Photograph: David Broadbent/AlamyThe proposals have generated widespread opposition, with over 7,500 signing a petition. Even someGreen partymembers in Bristol are uncomfortable with the idea.Danica Priest, who was a Green party candidate in May, fears ­voters could start deserting the party: “People are seeing their council tax go up and services go down. If bins aren’t being collected that’s all ­people will care about.” The Greens are also having to contemplate ­cutting other services. The failure of government funding to keep pace with demands on local services has created a ­growing shortfall. The Greens’ first full budget will have to find about £43.1m of savings next financial year.An initial raft of options, which included closing libraries and mothballing museums, provoked an immediate backlash, forcing the party to rule out the proposals for at least this coming budget.The Green leader of the council, Tony Dyer, knew it would be a ­challenge, but was shocked by what he uncovered: “It was a bit like when you buy a car but you don’t look under the bonnet … and then you think, “Oh, my God, what have I got into?’” Dyer, who grew up on a deprived council estate on the south of the city, stresses there has not been “an end to austerity” underLabour. “[Bristol’s funding] has gone up 5.2% in real terms but demand is increasing at a much higher rate,” he says in city hall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can’t make those changes without someone ­losing out. It feels bloody awful.” Thespectre of Brighton haunts many, as a council led by Greens ended up ­implementing the austerity cuts handed down by the coalition government and got into a protracted dispute with refuse collectors. The party now has only eight councillors there, just three more than the Conservatives.Dyer says it will be different in Bristol. He hopes the government will make more money available in the spending review this spring: “We’ve learned lessons … what will make the difference is delivery.”Dyer understands why some in Barton Hill would be suspicious of the council because they have been “let down in the past”, but he says the Greens will press ahead with the trial. Dyer also doubts the council can keep bi-weekly collections: “We have to recognise we have serious financial problems coming down the road.”Back in east Bristol, the supporters of the livable neighbourhood are keen to be heard too. Tim Northover, a union rep for ambulance ­workers, who lives in Barton Hill, says the scheme will make it safer for children to walk and cycle in the streets. “Green party councillors stood on a ticket to implement [the scheme]. They were overwhelmingly voted in … so there’s a democratic mandate.”View image in fullscreenSocial housing overlook terraced streets in Bristol.Photograph: Anna Barclay/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsBristolThe ObserverGreen partyLow-traffic neighbourhoodsLabourLocal politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

There should be mass graves and the Rwandans took care to evacuate theirs,” said Muyaya.Who are the M23 rebels and why is there fighting in eastern DRC?Read moreHundreds of Goma residents were returning to the city on Saturday after the rebels promised to restore basic services including water and power. They cleaned up the neighbourhoods littered with debris from weapons and filled with the stench of blood.“I’m tired and don’t know which way to go. On every corner [there] is a mourner,” said Jean Marcus, 25, one of whose relatives was among those killed in the fighting.M23 is the most potent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo’s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world’s technology. They are backed by about 4,000 troops from neighbouring Rwanda, according to UN experts, far more than in 2012, when they first captured Goma and held it for days in a conflict driven by ethnic grievances.Map of DRC showing Goma.As the fighting raged on with the M23 rebels on Saturday, the Congolese army recaptured the villages of Sanzi, Muganzo and Mukwidja in South Kivu’s Kalehe territory, which had fallen to the rebels earlier this week, according to two civil society officials, who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of fears for their safety.The central African nation’s military has been weakened after it lost hundreds of troops, and foreign mercenaries surrendered to the rebels after the fall of Goma.UN peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix said on Friday that the M23 and Rwandan forces were about 37 miles (60km) north of South Kivu’s provincial capital of Bukavu, covering almost the same distance in the previous two days since they started advancing along Lake Kivu on the border with Rwanda. Lacroix said the rebels “seem to be moving quite fast”, and capturing an airport a few kilometres (miles) away “would be another really significant step”.The seizure of Goma resulted in a dire humanitarian crisis, the UN and aid groups said. Goma serves as a humanitarian hub, critical for many of the six million people displaced by the conflict in eastern Congo. The rebels said they will march all the way to Kinshasa, 1,000 miles (1,600km) to the west.UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told a briefing on Friday that the World Health Organization and its partners conducted an assessment with Congo’s government between 26 and 30 January and reported that 700 people have been killed and 2,800 injured in Goma and the vicinity. Dujarric confirmed to AP that the deaths occurred during those days.‘I curse this war’: hunger and fear in Goma after rebel takeoverRead moreThe rebel advance has left in its wake extrajudicial killings and forced conscription of civilians, UN human rights office spokesman Jeremy Laurence said on Friday.He said: “We have also documented summary executions of at least 12 people by M23” over 26 to 28 January, adding that the group has occupied schools and hospitals in the province and is subjecting civilians to forced conscription and forced labour.Congolese forces have been accused of sexual violence as fighting rages on in the region, Laurence said, adding the UN is verifying reports that Congolese troops raped 52 women in South Kivu.Goma’s capture has brought humanitarian operations to “a standstill, cutting off a vital lifeline for aid delivery across eastern (Congo),” said Rose Tchwenko, country director for the Mercy Corps aid group in Congo.“The escalation of violence toward Bukavu raises fears of even greater displacement, while the breakdown of humanitarian access is leaving entire communities stranded without support,” she said.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In 2015, IS-Somalia splintered from al-Shabaab, a much larger and more widely known jihadist organisation affiliated with al-Qaida, which controls parts of southernSomalia.Trump said on Saturday that he ordered strikes on a senior IS attack planner and others from the organisation.The president wrote in a post on Truth Social: “These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United States and our Allies.“The strikes destroyed the caves they live in, and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming civilians.“Our Military has targeted this ISIS Attack Planner for years, but Biden and his cronies wouldn’t act quickly enough to get the job done. I did!“The message to ISIS and all others who would attack Americans is that ‘WE WILL FIND YOU, AND WE WILL KILL YOU!’”Trump did not identify the IS figure or state whether they were killed in the attack. The US secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, added that an initial assessment indicated multiple operatives were killed. He said no civilians were harmed.“[It] sends a clear signal that the United States always stands ready to find and eliminate terrorists who threaten the United States and our allies, even as we conduct robust border protection and many other operations under President Trump’s leadership,” he said.Somali American Democratic representativeIlhan Omar, commended the strike, saying: “It’s my sincere hope that Isis and Alshabab will be defeated and the people of Somalia will see an end to terrorism.”Estimates for the total number of active members in IS-Somalia have varied widely, but UN, US and Somali government officialsbelieveit has about 300 to 700 members, approximately half of whom are believed to be foreign fighters who have entered Somalia.The Puntland regional government has been involved in its own month-long operation against IS-Somalia following a deadly attack it carried out against Puntland’s security forces in December.A Puntland official said its forces “had been involved in a low intensity conflict with the group for almost a decade and have cleared more than 200km of territory of their presence since this operation began”.In a post on social media, Puntlandthanked the US and the United Arab Emiratesfor their support.The Somali president’s office said that Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was informed about theUS militaryaction targeting senior IS leadership in northern parts of the country.“He acknowledges the unwavering support of the United States in the fight against international terrorism and welcomes the continued commitment under the decisive leadership of presidentDonald Trump,” the office said in a post on X.The strikes took place a day after the Somali president made an appeal to Trump in an interview with the Washington Post “not to pull out the American advisers and consultants who are supporting the training of our special forces”.Trump has opposed the deployment of US troops in faraway conflicts and withdrew soldiers from the country in 2020, relying primarily on airstrikes to degrade jihadist organisations operating in Somalia. He has ordered more airstrikes in the country than any other US president.A strike, which also targeted IS militants, was carried out in coordination with Somalia last year and killed three members of the group, the US military said.After the strikes US officials briefed media saying that they targeted Abdulqadir Mumin, who they said quietly became IS’s global leader, but experts have expressed doubt that he held such a senior role.Explore more on these topicsSomaliaIslamic StateUS militaryAfricaDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He also said the atrocity had caused “widespread destruction to private and public properties”.“This criminal act adds to the bloody record of this militia,” he said. “It constitutes a blatant violation of international humanitarian law.”The RSF denied carrying out the attack.Across the Nile in Khartoum proper, two civilians were killed and dozens wounded in an air strike on an RSF-controlled area, said the local emergency response room, one of hundreds of volunteer groups coordinating emergency care across Sudan.The conflict in Sudan started in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the leaders of the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in Khartoum. The conflict has since spread across the country.More than 28,000 people have been killed and millions forced to flee their homes. Famine has been declared in parts of the country, where some families have resorted to eating grass to survive.The conflict has been marked by atrocities including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the UN and human rights groups. The international criminal court has said it is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.Agence France-Presse contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Trump has called it “unfair” and a “rip off”.In an interview with the Guardian, Samoa’s prime minister Fiame Naomi Mataʻafa described Trump’s move topull out of the Parisagreement as “very disappointing,” saying it would undermine global climate action and put the survival of Pacific countries at greater risk.‘Moving to the mountaintops’: rising seas displace tens of thousands in Papua New GuineaRead more“We look to the US as a global leader, but they seem to not recognise this global issue, not only forSamoabut for the Pacific,” Fiame said.“It’s not surprising … nevertheless, it is very disappointing,” the prime minister said.Afreeze on US foreign aidhas deepened concerns that the Pacific region will suffer further as crucial assistance for climate adaptation, disaster management, extreme weather resilience is cut, or under threat. In addition, Fiame told the Guardian Pacific countries would be “seriously impacted” by the withdrawal from theWorld Health Organisationand other multilateral bodies.“These are the forums that small countries rely on; they are critical to our voices being heard and our causes being addressed,” she said.Under the Biden administration, Washington increased itsengagement with Pacific island nations, emphasising climate change as a central concern. In 2022, then-vice president Kamala Harrisannounced a substantial aid boost, pledging to triple USassistance to the region to $600m.Despite their minimal contribution,Pacific nations face severe and disproportionate climate impactsincluding rising sea levels, coastal erosion, loss of freshwater sources, and potential displacement. Additionally, extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, floods, and droughts continue to devastate infrastructure, homes, and economies across the region.The Paris agreement is the first legally binding climate treaty to explicitly recognise loss and damage as a separate pillar of climate action, distinct from mitigation and adaptation. This marked a significant victory for Pacific island countries, which had long pushed for its recognition in global climate negotiations.Papua New Guinea’s prime minister, James Marape, told PNG media that the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement was “morally wrong.”“The United States has recently revitalised its relations with the Pacific, and it is very discouraging to see it backing down from climate talks, which have a direct impact on climate change mitigation for us in the Pacific,” Marape said.“We continue to be subjected to rising sea levels and unpredictable weather patterns that impact lives and economies.”From fiscal years 2017 through 2023, US agencies provided more than $420.3m to address climate risks in 14 Pacific Island countries and three US territories in the Pacific, according to theUS government accountability office. US-funded projects include climate resilience initiatives and livelihood protection in Papua New Guinea’s rural highland communities, and the development of early warning systems for remote communities in Fiji.The Cop29 agreement failed island states. Now the UN’s top court must act on climate harm | Ralph RegenvanuRead moreSamoa-based Sefanaia Nawadra is director-general of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), an organisation that works with Pacific governments on environmental protection. He described the US climate policy shifts as “disheartening” and said the Pacific must now “work harder and smarter, together and with all available partners to meet the needs of our people.”“Climate change represents the single greatest threat to our region,” he said.However, SPREP notes that other partners may step in to fill funding gaps left by the US. Pacific nations receive climate funding and support from a range of other governments – including Australia, the UK, China and Japan – and also access financial support from multilateral organisations.Nawadra said Pacific countries “will continue to seek and receive support from existing partnerships” to address their adaptation and mitigation needs.Pacific climate campaigner Jacynta Faʻamau of350.orgsaid the climate crisis was “the greatest security threat to the Pacific,” while emphasising the region’s resilience.“Island nations are committing to scaling up their own renewable energy plans and doing their part to secure our futures.“The government of the US and the rest of the global north have a lot to answer for in terms of historical responsibility for the climate crisis, but they are no longer who we are looking to for leadership,” she said.Explore more on these topicsSamoaPacific islandsFijiUS foreign policyPapua New GuineaAsia PacificClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Some areas also arebecoming uninsurable.A 2024Compare the Marketsurvey found more than one in four Australians did not have home or contents insurance.It’s also the first essential item people stopped paying for “when things got tough”, the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) has found.The new school year is usually a time of joy but Jewish parents in Sydney are anxious and uncertainRead more“Insurance premiums have surged by an average of 11% and as high as 30% in disaster-prone regions over the past year,” chief executive officer Dr Cassandra Goldie said.“With catastrophic and unpredictable extreme weather events increasing in all regions across Australia due to climate change, we need to do things differently when it comes to insurance, and we must find specific ways to support people and communities experiencing financial disadvantage,” Goldie said.Acoss wants insurance to be treated as an essential service, and measures introduced to cut insurance costs for people on low incomes.After the 2009 Black Saturday fires in Victoria that killed 173 people and destroyed 2,000 homes, authorities changed the advice about staying and defending a well prepared property or leaving early, to emphasise that leaving early was the safest option.About 13% of the property losses in the Black Saturday fires were uninsured.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBetter education, emergency accommodation, property protection and affordable insurance were among the factors that would encourage people to “leave their homes willingly in the face of imminent disasters”, according to University of Newcastle research published in theInternational Journal of Disaster Risk Reductionin 2024. The researchers interviewed people in NSW in the wake of thedevastating 2019-2020 bushfires.Making decisions under threat of a bushfire is very different from making a decision on a “normal, calm day”, said Penman.“There’ll be [tree] branches down, it’ll be dark and loud, there will be embers and sirens and a lot going on,” he said. “On Black Saturday, couples left their discussions about what to do until the fire was closer … sometimes the decision gets made for them. It’s either too late to leave or the house is already alight and they’re at personal risk.Australia is becoming an uninsurable nation. There may only be one solution | Nicki HutleyRead moreHe said in those kinds of situations, being underinsured or having no insurance could influence whether people stayed or left.It’s a situation Adelaide Hills resident David Cobbold has experienced.After the catastrophic 2019-2020 bushfire season, Cobbold, who runs the Warrawong Wildlife Sanctuary in the Adelaide Hills, struggled to get insurance.“You’re starting to get desperate. This is your business, life savings, superannuation, children’s inheritance.”Quotes for complete cover were as high as $150,000, with a maximum claim of $500,000, well below the sanctuary’s value of $1.7m.A house is just a structure. We can’t replace people’s lives.Trent Penman“Even if we could afford it, we’re not getting value from it,” he said.According to the insurance industry, extreme weather, the climate crisis, and construction costs are driving up prices, but the industryhas been criticisedfor a lack of transparency about how those costs are calculated.The emergency management minister, Jenny McAllister, said the federal government was working with the sector to support vulnerable communities.“We know that the climate is changing, and Australians can expect to experience more frequent and severe natural disasters. We’re working with industry to invest in resilience and deliver cost-of-living savings to households,” McAllister said.The Insurance Council of Australia said it would continue to “advocate for programs that reduce risk as the most cost-effective and sustainable way to reduce rising pressure on insurance premiums”.Cobbold eventually found a suitable insurance policy but there were periods where he would have stayed to defend his property rather than lose everything.Penman said making a decision early was very important. In the2013 NSW bushfires, while some people were trying to fight the fires, others were returning to their homes to collect possessions or pets.“People need to understand their risk and have some really hard thoughts about what they’re willing to lose and what they can’t replace. At the end of the day, a house is just a structure. We can’t replace people’s lives.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsBushfiresHousingInsurance (Australia)Cost of living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Whereas ChatGPT’s 2022 arrival caught governments and businesses by surprise as staff began to try out the new AI technology, at least for the arrival of Deepseek, some had a playbook.Business as usualA spokesperson for Telstra said the company had “a rigorous process to assess all AI tools, capabilities, and use cases in our business”, including a list of approved generative AI tools, and guidelines on how to use them.For now at Telstra, DeepSeek is not approved and its use is not encouraged (although it’s not officially blocked).“Our preferred partner is MS Copilot, and we’re rolling out 21,000 Copilot for Microsoft 365 licences to our employees.”Other companies sought immediate advice on whether DeepSeek should be adopted.Major Australian cybersecurity firm CyberCX’s executive director of cyber intelligence, Katherine Mansted, said customers had already approached the company for advice on whether the technology was safe.“That’s no surprise, because it seems the whole world has been in a bit of a DeepSeek frenzy – both the economically and market inclined and those with the security lens,” Mansted said.DeepSeek and governmentCyberCX this week took the unusual step of quickly issuing advice recommending organisations, including government departments and those storing sensitive information, strongly consider restricting access to DeepSeek on work devices.“We know that there is no proactive policy here from government … We’ve been down this road before,” Mansted said. “We’ve had debates about TikTok, about Chinese surveillance cameras, about Huawei in the telco network, and we always act after the fact, not before the fact … Here, particularly because the threats are around compromise of sensitive information, in terms of any information that you put into this AI assistant: it’s going straight to China.“We thought we needed to act faster this time.”Under federal AI policy implemented in September 2024,agencies have until the end of February 2025to publish transparency documents about their use of AI.But understanding who makes decisions on the specific use of DeepSeek in the federal government has proved tricky. The attorney general’s department, which made the decisionto ban TikTok use on government devices, referred inquiries to the Digital Transformation Agency, which in turn referred enquires to the Department of Home Affairs.Home Affairs was asked on Thursday for its official policy and did not provide a response by the time of publication.Familiar debates …Some of the reaction in Australia to DeepSeek is by now familiar. There have beencalls to banthe technology, amid concern over how the Chinese government might access user data – an echo of the days Huawei was banned from the NBN and 5G rollouts in Australia, and more recently, of the debate over banning TikTok.The Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a strong critic of the China government, said this week that Australia “cannot continue the current approach of responding to each new tech development”. It called for a tech strategy covering AI that included investing in sovereign AI capabilities.The industry minister, Ed Husic, said on Tuesday it was too early to make a decision on whether DeepSeek was a security risk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think it’s too early to jump to conclusions on that,” he said. “But, again, if we have to act, then responsible governments do.”He stressed that Australia is “in the final stages” of planning its response and would develop its own regulatory settings.“The US is flagging their approach. The EU has theirs. Canada likewise will have a different approach. And our regional partners as well are looking at this,” he said.“We will harmonise where we can and we’ll localise where we have to, and that’s the approach that we will take.”DeepSeek was approached for comment.… and new inspirationThere are suggestions Australia could learn from what DeepSeek has achieved.DeepSeek, headed by previous hedge fund co-founder Liang Wenfeng,reportedly focused on research into developing AIover looking for ways to turn a profit, hiring top graduates from Chinese universities or those relatively early on in their careers.The Tech Council of Australia – whose members include Microsoft, Atlassian, Google and IBM – argued Australia should adopt a similar approach.“The process that DeepSeek has taken from going from idea to world-leading technology in less than two years, and they’ve done so employing largely new graduates straight out of universities – this is a model that Australia should be following,” the lobby group’s head of policy, Harry Godber, said.We tried out DeepSeek. It worked well, until we asked it about Tiananmen Square and TaiwanRead more“We have some of the greatest AI research occurring at Australian universities. We also have amazing R and D that’s been undertaken by Australian companies like Atlassian and Canva.”Australia’s newly appointed chief scientist, Tony Haymet, noted on Tuesday how quickly DeepSeek had changed the conversation around AI.“Privately funded in Shanghai, a bunch of talented 22-year-olds without access to the world’s best chips, without access to Nvidia chips, seem to have created something that’s even better than the best companies in the western world have done,” he said.Trump unveils $500bn Stargate AI project between OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBankRead moreHusic last year announced plans to develop an AI capability plan by the end of 2025, as the government also looks towardsmandatory guardrailsfor “high risk” AI.The Tech Council’s chief executive, Damian Kassabgi, said Australia stood to benefit from DeepSeek’s demonstrated cost and computing power efficiencies.But he argued the capability plan wasn’t moving quickly enough, with other countries pulling ahead in the AI race.“When we look at our R&D investment in Australia, especially business investment, we’re about one-third of that of the US [on GDP spend],” Kassabgi said. “So we’re not just a little bit behind.”This article was amended on 2 February 2025 to make clear that Telstra had not banned DeepSeek but rather discouraged its use.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)DeepSeekComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

A third in the Coral Sea has a moderate chance of forming into a tropical cyclone.Collopy said the region is experiencing cyclonic rainfall totals without it being declared.“It’s exactly that,” he said. “You don’t need a tropical cyclone to concentrate the monsoon and get these extreme rainfall totals.”Authorities have been door-knocking across six low-lying Townsville suburbs after the local disaster management group said flooding to second-storey heights is possible.This is a very serious and dangerous eventShane ChelepyThose suburbs are Cluden, Hermit Park, Idalia, Oonoonba, Railway Estate and Rosslea.An evacuation centre in Heatley is open for affected residents.“My message to people in these areas who are on the prepare-to-leave warning, make the provisions in the event you do have to go,” the premier, David Crisafulli, said.About 3,100 homes have been door-knocked on Saturday, with further expected as the rainfall continues.A disaster declaration is in place for Townsville and Innisfail. No lives have been lost or missing persons recorded.Additional police, SES and fire department resources have been deployed to the region, the state’s disaster coordinator Shane Chelepy said.About 300 power company staff are on standby while the Australian defence force has been engaged and is assisting on the ground in Townsville.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMorning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Skaros said “both documents contained citations to cases and alleged quotes from the tribunal’s decision which were nonexistent”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailOn 19 November, the lawyer wrote to the court stating the errors were unintentional, and that he deeply regretted them. At a hearing on 25 November, the lawyer admitted to using ChatGPT to write the documents.“The [lawyer] stated that he had used AI to identify Australian cases, but it provided him with nonexistent case law,” Skaros said. “The court expressed its concern about the [lawyer]’s conduct and his failure to check the accuracy of what had been filed with the court, noting that a considerable amount time had been spent by the court and my associates checking the citations and attempting to find the purported authorities.”In an affidavit provided to the court, the lawyer said that due to time constraints and health issues, he decided to use AI.“He accessed the site known as ChatGPT, inserted some words and the site prepared a summary of cases for him,” the judgment said. “He said the summary read well, so he incorporated the authorities and references into his submissions without checking the details.”The lawyer was said to be deeply embarrassed about the incident and has taken steps to improve his knowledge of AI.Counsel for the immigration minister argued the lawyer had failed to exercise adequate care, and given the public interest in the misuse of AI in legal proceedings, it was in the public interest for misuses of AI cases to be referred to the OLSC.“It was submitted [by the minister] that such conduct would continue to occur and must be ‘nipped in the bud’.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMorning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The tragedy has been blamed squarely on government ineptitude and graft.“What we are seeing are the greatest street protests in the history of Serbia,” said Dejan Bagarić, a master’s student speaking from the city. “There’s never been anything like it, people are really animated because everybody has had enough of corruption and this government is very corrupt.”‘We are done with corruption’: how the students of Serbia rose up against the systemRead moreSaturday’s outpouring of dissent – the culmination of sit-ins and protests that began in November – have focused on what demonstrators have described as the government’s striking unwillingness to accept any accountability for the tragedy. Reconstruction of the station was carried out in collaboration with a Chinese state consortium, as part of a large infrastructure project that critics contend paid little, if any, attention to safety regulations.“There was no transparency, no public tenders for the contract and then when the accident happened, no desire for justice,” said Čedomir Stojković, a leading human rights lawyer who filed a criminal complaint that eventually spurred prosecutors to launch an inquiry. “Instead, the government did what it always does, it went ahead with a full-scale cover-up. There’s a lot of solidarity, a lot of empathy for the students, more and more people are coming out in support of them, professors, farmers, everyone.”1:06Serbian president not interested in 'most corrupt and deceitful' Guardian coverage – videoBy last week the anti-government rallies had spread to more than 100 provincial towns and villages nationwide.The scale of the protests had, said Stojković, proved “beyond any doubt” that the demonstrations were not only fuelled by disgust over corruption, an ill that has come to be identified with everything that is wrong with the EU candidate nation, but were a way for citizens to vent their unhappiness with their nationalist president’s increasingly authoritarian rule.For a generation raised on the internet, knowledge of the world beyond impoverished Serbia is readily available. Also unprecedented is the ability to rapidly arrange protests by circumventing state-controlled media – tens of thousands of striking students participated in a 24-hour blockade of a major intersection in Belgrade last week.Vučić had faced similar protests last year following allegations of rigged elections, facilitated, opponents say, by a media landscape that remains one of the most censored inEurope. Unlike these demonstrations, however, it was opposition parties, themselves often discredited, who led the backlash.“People want the government and Vučić to finally go,” said Stojković, who participated as a student in mass protests over 25 years ago against Slobodan Milošević, the late Yugoslav strongman and former president of Serbia, whose policies triggered the region’s descent into bloodthirsty genocide. The protests paved the way to Milošević eventually being toppled in 2000.“These students were children when Vučić became president eight years ago and they want democracy. It’s been building up … this is the moment just before the balloon is pricked by the needle. It has caught [the government] unaware.”On Friday, as hundreds of students reached Novi Sad on foot after a two-day, 80km trek from Belgrade, Vučić, addressing the protests, told the nation: “Our country is under attack, from abroad and from inside,” echoing earlier claims that the protesters were working for unspecified foreign powers to oust the government.The ruling Serbian Progressive party has tried to defuse the situation by releasing classified documents about the railway station’s collapse and has even gone so far as to say it will meet all the students’ demands. This week, in what was seen as a first victory,Vučić’s close ally, prime minister Miloš Vučević, resignedbut few believe the protests are about to fizzle out.With youth unemployment at record levels and graduates forced in ever growing numbers to move abroad in search of work, there is a growing sense among young Serbs that there is little to lose.To defy government crackdowns, the students have deliberately avoided being associated with a leadership of any sort, ensuring that decisions are taken in concert in plenary sessions.“We are not choosing violence and for now the government is not choosing violence either,” Bagarić said at the protests in Novi Sad.As the protests swelled, Srđan Milivojević, who leads the opposition Democratic party, said it was clear Serbia’s young demonstrators were now dictating events.“It’s irrelevant how the government reacts,” he said as he drove along the car-choked highway linking Belgrade with Novi Sad. “The students are dictating the tempo of the protests and they will continue to do so until Vučić falls.”Explore more on these topicsSerbiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The leader of Alternative für Deutschland,Alice Weidel, hailed “a historic day for Germany”as the Bundestag, for the first time in its history, passed a vote with the backing of her party, which is second in the polls weeks before this month’s elections.Amid a wave of protests,parliament later rejecteda similar conservative-tabled draft law thanks partly to rebel members of Merz’s own centre-right CDU/CSU alliance, with his predecessor as party leader, Angela Merkel, calling his move “wrong”.In France, controversial remarks by the centrist prime minister, François Bayrou, aboutFrench people feeling “submerged” by immigrationwere hailed by the far-right National Rally as evidence that it had “won the ideological battle”.View image in fullscreenCo-leader of the Alternative for Germany party (AfD) Alice Weidel speaks as Tino Chrupalla listens after the German parliament voted against an opposition draft law on tightening immigration policy, in Berlin on 31 January.Photograph: Liesa Johannssen/ReutersAnd talks in Austria between the mainstream Austrian People’s party (ÖVP) conservatives and the pro-Kremlin Freedom party (FPÖ), which wants to expel all asylum seekers, are progressing and look set to lead to the country’sfirst far-right-led governmentsince the second world war.For decades, mainstream European parties on the right and left united behind a barrier – the Brandmauer (firewall) inGermany, the cordon sanitaire in France – against accommodating far-right ideas or cooperating with far-right parties. More recently, however, centre-right parties in particular have increasingly adopted far-right policies and, in several countries, formed coalitions with far-right parties. Despite evidence showing this only boosts the radical right, the process is accelerating.“We’re in a vicious cycle,” said Tarik Abou-Chadi, an associate professor of European politics at the University of Oxford. “It starts with the radical right being more successful, winning more seats, entering government in more countries.”When that happens, “mainstream parties move right on immigration. It’s strategic, to win back votes. So you have this accommodation. Except it doesn’t work – it doesn’t bring the votes back. But two things do happen that reinforce the trend.”So first, Abou-Chadi said, norms change. Accommodation normalises and legitimises far-right parties: voting for them is no longer a transgression. Second, opinion shifts: if mainstream parties say something is really important, people tend to believe it. “And then mainstream parties see that shift in public opinion and think: ‘We have to keep moving further to the right.’ And you end up broadening the coalition of people saying ‘we have to do something’ about immigration.”However, political scientists say electoral and polling evidence from many countries strongly suggests that, for mainstream centre-right parties, the process of accommodation merely results in their being “cannibalised” by the far right.View image in fullscreenFrance’s Prime Minister Francois Bayrou speaks after the funeral of former Bordeaux mayor Nicolas Florian on 31 January.Photograph: Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty ImagesRadical-right parties have already vanquished centre-right rivals in the Netherlands, where Geert Wilders’ Freedom partyleads the government, and Italy, where Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy dominates the rightist bloc thatwon in 2022.In September’s elections in Austria, Herbert Kickl’s far-right FPÖbeat the conservative ÖVPto finish first, and in France, Marine Le Pen’s RN far outnumbers the mainstream Les Républicains and has grown into the largest single party in parliament.Elsewhere, far-right parties are signed-up members of conservative-led coalitions in Finland and Croatia, lending parliamentary support to another in Sweden, and on track to win elections and lead a coalition later this year in theCzech Republic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Voters simply ask why, if immigration was so important, they did nothing about it.”Abou-Chadi said there was no question that far-right parties benefited electorally when mainstream parties collaborated with them. “We’ve seen it time and time again,” he said. “Even signalling a willingness to cooperate strengthens them.”As long as there is a cordon sanitaire, he said, voters who are not just sympathetic to a far-right agenda but want to see it put into practice are less likely to vote for far-right parties, because they know there is little chance of them entering government.Once that firewall crumbles, however, the floodgates are opened. Nathalie Tocci, the director of the Istituto Affari Internazionali, a thinktank in Rome,contendsthat mainstream parties’ willingness to work with the extremes is “political suicide”. “When moderate parties rule out cooperation with the radical right citizens know … a vote for the far right is wasted,” she said. “But when they wink at the far right, that disincentive evaporates. And voters tend to prefer the original to the copy.”Europe’s centre-right parties could be subsumed by the far right within 10 to 15 years, Abou-Chadi predicted: “It’s already happened in some countries; in others it’s under way. We still talk about them as if they’re fringe. That has to change.”De Lange agreed. “I think that’s very probable,” she said. “We’re seeing far-right parties scoring up to 30% now, mainstream parties’ share declining, and increasing fragmentation on the left. All that makes it look possible.”Explore more on these topicsThe far rightThe ObserverFar rightEuropeGermanyGeert WildersNetherlandsCzech RepublicanalysisShareReuse this content"

Police have not yet identified this person either, but again, the family has been informed.PoliceScotlandsaid inquires were continuing, but there were no apparent suspicious circumstances.Flowers have been left near Queen Elizabeth bridge for the sisters.Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, expressed his condolences in a post on X. “Heartbreaking news from the City of Aberdeen this morning. My thoughts are with everyone affected by this very sad news,” he wrote.The disappearance of the sisters, who are part of a set of triplets, sparked an extensive search.Police said they had been made aware of the pair’s disappearance on 7 January by their landlady, who had received a text message from Henrietta’s mobile phone at 2.12am that indicated the sisters would not be coming home. The phone has not been active since.CCTV footage showed that they had visited the path along the river that they are believed to have taken the day before at 2.50pm.Twelve hours later, at 2.12am, CCTV showed the sisters walking from Market Street and across Victoria Bridge, which crosses the Dee where the river enters the harbour. The police believe they headed westwards towards Aberdeen boat club, where they vanished.The twins’ sister, Edit Huszti, said earlier this month that it would be out of character for her sisters to venture out on the street during the early hours of the morning.József, their brother, said the sisters, who moved toScotlandabout seven years ago, appeared to be fine in the days before they went missing. The pair had a 40-minute phone conversation with their mother and everything seemed normal.Edit Huszti told the BBC she had spoken to her sisters via a video call on New Year’s Eve and that they had appeared happy and cheerful. She said they were very close.Supt David Howieson said: “Our thoughts remain with the Huszti family and we are keeping them fully updated following these recoveries.“We know how much of an impact this has had in Aberdeen and much further afield and I would like to thank everyone who has assisted with our investigation.”Explore more on these topicsAberdeenScotlandHungaryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

On the Egyptian side, a double arch marks the entry to the terminal buildings themselves, and beyond, Gaza.Television cameras on the Egyptian side caught the moment on Saturday that the crossing, which has been closed since May, was reopened for medical evacuations showing one young girl, whose foot had been amputated, being loaded into an Egyptian ambulance.What cannot be underestimated is that anyreopening of Rafah, even partial, is a moment of considerable significance.mapAmid the long years of Israeli blockade that followed Hamas’s takeover of the coastal strip in 2007, Rafah – the only crossing out of Gaza that does not borderIsrael– has been seen as a safety valve as a potential access to the outside world.If it was never really available to many, at least the possibility existed.For a period earlier in the war, Rafah was the exit point for Palestinians with dual passports, employed by foreign organisations, or with the financial wherewithal and connections to pay to be put on an Egyptian list to leave.But since Israeli forces launched an offensive in and around the southern city of Rafah in May last year, the border has been closed even for the most urgent medical evacuation cases, with Egypt closing its side in protest.View image in fullscreenEgyptian ambulances at the Rafah border crossing to transport Palestinian patients out of Gaza.Photograph: Kerolos Salah/AFP/GettyThe director general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,summed up the situation starkly last month: “Only 5,383 patients have been evacuated [from Gaza] with support from WHO since October 2023, of which only 436 since the Rafah crossing was closed.“Over 12,000 people still need medical evacuation. At this rate, it would take five to 10 years to evacuate all these critically ill patients, including thousands of children. In the meantime, their conditions get worse and some die.”Israel has permitted a number of medical evacuations since May, including 55 patients in December, but it has been a drop in the ocean, an assessment underlined by the comments of the UN secretary general, António Guterres, last week that 2,500 children were in need of immediate evacuation.If opening the crossing to 50 children and their families is a first step as an agreed part of the Gaza ceasefire deal that envisages further regular evacuations, it has another significance too.1:11Hamas releases three more hostages from Gaza under ceasefire deal with Israel – videoWhile Israeli society has celebrated the release of hostages, ordinary Palestinians in Gaza in the past week have also begun to see benefits to the ceasefire deal beyond the cessation of fighting and killing.Large numbers of residents from the north of the strip have been permitted to return home to the devastated area having been forcibly displaced by Israel. As well as the opening of Rafah, the first Palestinian detainees arrested in Gaza and held in Israel, numbering 111, were released home on Saturday.Then there is the opening of Rafah itself, facilitated by an arrangement in which the deployment of EU monitors at the crossing to supervise officials from Mahmoud Abbas’s Palestinian Authority, which governs in the West Bank, have been tasked with processing those leaving Gaza.All of which suggests that – just maybe – there may be a hint of a potential dynamic for success emerging in the fragile and complex three-phase deal, which to many seemed set up for inevitable failure and a return to Israel’s offensive.After today the next significant milestone will be marked by the planned beginning of negotiations for phase two of the deal next week, amid evidence that the Trump administration in Washington, despite a highly erratic and contradictory grasp of its Middle East policy, is still insisting that both sides cleave to the agreement and see it through.What is clear today is that another important staging post in the deal has been passed, as well as the first small measure of relief for sick and wounded Palestinians.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelanalysisShareReuse this content"

It also made aid delivery more complicated and expensive.The resumption of regular crossings, for a set number of patients with urgent medical needs, marks a significant moment in the complex ceasefire agreement.Fifty children were meant to leave on Saturday but two died before they could be evacuated, some were critically ill and could not be moved under the current conditions, and doctors had lost contact with some families, said Zaher al-Wahidi, head of the Palestinian Information Center at the Gaza health minister.Even the current quota of 50 a day was far too low to meet desperate needs inside Gaza, he added.1:11Hamas releases three more hostages from Gaza under ceasefire deal with Israel – videoLast week the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for 2,500 children to be immediately evacuated from Gaza for medical treatment after meeting US doctors who said the children were at imminent risk of death in the coming weeks.View image in fullscreenA man holding a baby at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City prepares to be evacuated for treatment.Photograph: Bashar Taleb/AFP/GettyThe handover of the three Israeli hostages, Yarden Bibas, 35, Israeli-US citizen Keith Siegel, 65, and Israeli-French citizen Ofer Kalederon, 54, triggered the release of 183 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza held in Israeli jails.They included a prominent political prisoner and more than 100 people from Gaza detained after the 7 October attacks and never charged or tried, but also 72 people serving long or life sentences for violent offences.View image in fullscreenYarden Bibas travels in a military helicopter to Sheba hospital in Ramat Gan, Israel.Photograph: GPO/AFP/Getty ImagesAn aid worker,Mohammad al-Halabi, who Amnesty International deemed a prisoner of conscience, was returned to Gaza for the first time in nearly a decade. He was detained in 2016, held without trial for more than six years, then convicted in what the rights group described as “deeply flawed proceedings”.The handover of the Israeli hostages in two locations – the southern city of Khan Younis and at Gaza City’s port – was far more orderly than a chaotic release earlier this week that briefly threatened to upset the terms of the ceasefire deal.Inside Israel, joy at welcoming back Bibas was mixed with fear about the fate of his wife, Shiri, and young children Ariel and Kfir, who were seized and held hostage separately from Yarden.View image in fullscreenOfer Kalderon is reunited with family in Ramat Gan, Israel.Photograph: Maayan Toaf/ReutersVideo of Shiri holding on to her children as she was kidnapped by Hamas gunmen from the Nir Oz kibbutz became an enduring image of the 7 October 2023 attacks. Her son, Kfir, was just nine months old when he was abducted.They are listed among 16 Israelis still due to be returned in the first phase of the ceasefire, eight of whom are known to dead. Because living women were prioritised for return and Hamas is now releasing male hostages, many in Israel say hopes the family will be reunited alive are fading.The Israeli government has expressed “grave concerns” for their wellbeing. Hamas said the trio, kidnapped separately from Yarden, were killed in 2023.Map of Gaza showing Rafah crossing into Egypt.Seventeen of the 33 Israeli hostages due for release in the first stage of the ceasefire have now been released in exchange for 400 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.Saturday marked the first time detainees were returned to Gaza; the deal includes the release of 1,000 Palestinians from the strip. Buses carrying 111 of them were greeted by joyful crowds in Khan Younis.Some of the detainees were led out of prison with their hands handcuffed over their heads, wearing a bracelet inscribed with a threatening message, prompting outrage among International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) employees coordinating the release, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.The bracelets read: “The eternal nation does not forget, I will chase down my enemies and defeat them”. The ICRC later reminded both parties to the deal “of their responsibility to ensure transfers are carried out safely and with dignity”.The truce, which began on 19 January, is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the Hamas militant group. The fragile deal has held for nearly two weeks, halting the fighting and allowing for increased aid to flow into the tiny coastal territory.View image in fullscreenThe Israeli hostage Keith Siegel is handed over to the Red Cross.Photograph: Mohammed Saber/EPAThe Rafah crossing, long a lifeline for Palestinians, had been closed since Israeli forces took control of the surrounding area in May 2024. The first crossings this year took place after buses were seen collecting the sick and wounded from Gaza hospitals.Over the past 15 months, Israel’s campaign against Hamas in retaliation for the militants’ 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel has devastated Gaza’s health sector, leaving most of its hospitals out of operation, even as more than 110,000 Palestinians were wounded by Israel’s bombardment and ground offensives, according to the Palestinian health ministry.In addition to injured people leaving, with a quota set to include Hamas fighters, the crossing could allow aid groups to boost supplies into the strip.Negotiations are due to start by Tuesday on agreements for the release of more than 60 remaining hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza in a second phase of the deal.Freed Gaza hostage told Starmer that Hamas held her in Unrwa premises, her mother saysRead moreAfter the latest releases, Israel and Hamas are due to begin negotiating a second phase of the ceasefire next week, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. However, the war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached.Malak A Tantesh contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Russian crew assembled on the Kildin’s aft deck and uncovered the lifeboats, but did not ask for help, and after five hours fighting the fire the Kildin restarted its engines and got under way again.According to western security services, the ship was in the eastern Mediterranean to monitor events inSyriaafter the fall in December of the Moscow ally Bashar al-Assad, as the Russian navy began to move military equipment out of the part of the Tartus port it controls.The western sources argued that the Kildin fire, after another blaze two months earlier on the Russian missile frigate the Admiral Gorshkov, revealed Russia’s maritime presence in the area to be in a state of disrepair and disarray. They said that, at the same time that the Kildin was in distress, two other Russian naval vessels, the landing ships Ivan Gren and the Aleksandr Otrakovsky were also adrift temporarily without control of navigation.Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that mishaps on Russian naval vessels were nothing new, and not confined to the Mediterranean.“The Russian navy has historically struggled with maintenance and readiness issues. Fires are not uncommon. Operations are undoubtedly taking a toll on an ageing Russian fleet, which lacks sufficient maintenance and support facilities,” Kofman said.Those problems could become much more severe if the new rulers in Damascus, the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), deprive Russia of the use of the Tartus base. So far, Moscow has kept a toehold in post-Assad Syria, at Tartus and the Khmeimim airbase, but the new government’s longer-term intentions are unclear in regard to the forces that helped keep the Assad regime in power for decades.Last week, theHTS cancelled a 2019 contractwith a Russian company, ending its control of the Tartus commercial port, which Moscow had hoped would be a $500m hub for exporting Russian agricultural products to the wider Middle East. That was a bad omen for the naval base, said Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow on sea power at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) in London.“The cancellation of the commercial arrangement is the writing on the wall for the navy, given how hand-in-hand the commercial and the strategic positions were,” Kaushal said.The loss of Tartus would turn chronic problems in the Russian fleet into a crisis, he argued.“The Russian navy, post cold war, wasn’t really built for endurance,” Kaushal said. “They built smaller vessels that they could build more rapidly, and packed them very heavily with missiles. That is very useful if you’re defending your own coastal waters but [over longer distances] the smaller the vessel, the more acute the maintenance problems.”He added: “This is, and always has been, an issue for the Russians, but the issue will become much more significant in light of the potential loss of Tartus.”Moscow is looking for alternatives in the Mediterranean, but all the options are problematic, according to aRusi paperthis month by Kaushal and Cmdr Edward Black, a former Royal Navy mine clearance diving officer now a visiting fellow at the institute.Algeria is a longstanding Russian ally, but Moscow’s activities in Mali, where Wagner group mercenaries prop up a military junta, have driven a wedge between the two countries.In Sudan’s civil war, Russia switched allegiances last year from the Rapid Support Forces to the Sudan Armed Forces, in a move most observers believe to be aimed at securing the use of Port Sudan on the Red Sea. However, access from there to the Mediterranean is dependent on use of the Suez canal, and negotiations with the Sudanese authorities have floundered.A third option would be easternLibya, where two ports, Tobruk and Benghazi, are under the sway of a Russian-backed general, Khalifa Haftar, and there are already an estimated 2,000 Russian mercenaries in the region.A Russian base in Libya is the most likely alternative to Tartus, the Rusi study suggests, but it pointed out that it would make Russia’s ailing Mediterranean fleet a hostage to Haftar and his future choice of allies, and is therefore fraught with political risk for Moscow.Explore more on these topicsRussiaSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaAlgeriaLibyanewsShareReuse this content"

Extra powers will also be handed to the Border Force, which will be able to compel anyone who it suspects of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection.The news follows warnings that the use of AI tools in the creation of child sexual abuse imagery has more than quadrupled in the space of a year. There were 245 confirmed reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse images last year, up from 51 in 2023, according to the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF).Over a 30-day period last year, it found 3,512 AI images on a single dark web site. It also identified an increasing proportion of “category A” images – the most severe kind.AI tools have been deployed in a variety of ways by those seeking to abuse children. It is understood that there have been cases of deploying it to“nudify” images of real children, or applying the faces of children to ­existing child sexual abuse images.The voices of real children and victims are also used.Newly generated images have been used to blackmail children and force them into more abusive situations, including the live streaming of abuse.AI tools are also helping perpetrators disguise their identity to help them groom and abuse their victims.View image in fullscreenTechnology secretary Peter Kyle said the UK has ‘failed to keep up’ with the malign applications of the AI revolution.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesSenior police figures say that there is now well-established evidence that those who view such images are likely to go on to abuse children in person, and they are concerned that the use of AI imagery could ­normalise the sexual abuse of children.The new laws will be brought in as part of the crime and policing bill, which has not yet come to parliament.Peter Kyle, the technology ­secretary, said that the state had “failed to keep up” with the malign applications of the AI revolution.Writing for theObserver, he said he would ensure that the safety of children “comes first”, even as he attempts to make the UK one of the world’s leading AI markets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Heathrow confirmed it had asked Frontier Economics to do the work. It has published an ­executive ­summary online, not the entire report.The New Economics Foundation (NEF) thinktank ­criticised the chancellor on Saturday night for the ­justifications she gave for backing a third ­runway, saying it also believed the methodology used had ­previously been judged unreliable by the Department forTransport.View image in fullscreenThe report by the Frontier Economics consultancy said a third Heathrow runway could increase potential GDP by 0.43% by 2050.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianAlex Chapman, senior economist at the NEF, said: “It is very concerning that the chancellor appears to be basing her support for Heathrow expansion on a figure from a report commissioned byHeathrow airport.“Even more worrying is the fact that the methodology they have applied is one that the Department for Transport has previously decided is not fit for purpose, and that the report uses forecast data supplied by the airport itself.“Heathrow expansion represents a major threat to the UK’s climate goals and flies in the face of scientific advice. To ensure that the claimed economic benefits are concrete, assessments should be carried out by independent government economists following best-practice methodology.“NEF’s analysis has identified a wide range of weaknesses in the economic case, which have emerged since it was last fully appraised in 2015. Not least, the decline of business air travel, the surge in outbound leisure travel and the negative impacts on wider regions of the UK – all of which erode the potential growth benefit.”Analysis by climate crisis website Carbon Briefsuggests that, using the government’s own figures, SAF will barely cut emissions by 2040, and any reduction will be wiped out by rising flight numbers.Separately, in 2023,the Royal Society foundthat to grow enough crops – biofuels – to make all UK aviation fuel sustainable would require about half of UK ­agricultural land.A spokesperson at Frontier Economics defended its record as a well-regarded consultancy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But producing them takes up huge amounts of land, endangering food security and biodiversity. “Indeed, very little of these fuels even exist today and producing them at anything like the scale that will be needed to decarbonise aviation would be totally incompatible with any notions of sustainability.”The Treasury was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow third runwayThe ObserverHeathrow airportAir transportAirline industryRachel ReevesClimate crisisLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, he was labelled a “high-value” customer who, when he stopped using the platform, the company was keen to “win back”.A judge found that while he may not have opted out of marketing, the man was in the depths of a gambling problem and had not properly understood how his data would be used. Mrs Justice Collins Rice said his ability to give consent was impaired as he “was not making decisions … on a fully autonomous basis at all” and ruled that Sky Betting & Gaming’s use of his data was unlawful.Campaigners said this weekend the ruling could have ramifications for the wider industry and called for an investigation into the potentially unlawful profiling and targeting of problem gamblers. The Gambling Commission has implemented a series of measures to ensure better safeguards for customers, but campaigners say the industry has repeatedly failed to identify gamblers who are at most risk of harm.In England there are almost 1.6 million adults who gamble who may benefit from some type of treatment or support forharmful gambling, according to the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID).The OHID reported in 2023 that the annual number of excess suicide deaths in England associated with problem gambling or a gambling disorder was between 117 and 496.View image in fullscreenIn 2023 up to 496 suicides were associated with problem gambling.Photograph: Qi Yang/Getty ImagesWill Prochaska, leader of the Coalition to End Gambling Ads, said the ruling revealed the “frightening” level of tracking and targeting used by gambling firms and said that Sky Betting & Gaming’s practices were “indicative of how the sector operates”. “We’re very concerned because we know this is widespread,” he said.Charles Ritchie from the charity Gambling with Lives that supports families bereaved by gambling urged regulators to act. “Operators are using data and algorithms to target people with more incentives to gamble when they should be using that data to meaningfully intervene,” he said.The case against Bonne Terre Ltd, trading as Sky Betting & Gaming, came after a man who lost £46,000 requested records of the data the company held on him. Through those documents and subsequent legal disclosures he discovered the company and its partners had collected hundreds of thousands of pieces of data that were used to profile and target him.The data filled more than 2,400 spreadsheets and had been used to predict his behaviour and select him for targeted marketing campaigns. In 2017 and 2018 he was sent at least 1,389 marketing emails offering him free bets and special prizes and encouraging him to spend. He often deposited money as a direct result. He is now seeking compensation for financial losses and for the unlawful use of personal data. A further hearing is expected to decide how much he is entitled to. “I lost 10 years of my life to gambling.

The Betting and Gaming Council, which represents gambling firms, declined to comment.The case follows occasional interventions by the gambling and data regulators. The Information Commissioner’s Officereprimanded Sky Betting & Gaming last yearfor unlawfully processing people’s data through advertising cookies without their consent. In 2023, Paddy Power was fined £490,000 by the Gambling Commission for breaching social responsibility rules after sending a promotional push notification to customers who had signed up to exclude themselves from gambling.But the claimant said he hoped the case would lead to a wider investigation into the gambling sector, which is heavily reliant on online tracking, profiling and marketing to push its products to customers.Currently, many companies rely on consent as the basis for using similar practices to those detailed in the high court case. But the ruling raises the question of whether other companies that market to problem gamblers, who could be considered unable to freely consent due to the compulsive nature of their gambling, are also breaking the law.The Gambling Commission said it expected all operators to be “carefully considering” the latest judgment along with the ICO ruling against Sky Betting & Gaming in September. “Operators can only collect and use data to attract customers in ways that comply with data protection laws, with a focus on preventing gambling harm,” a spokesperson said.The Information Commissioner’s Office said: “Uncontrolled tracking intrudes on the most private parts of our lives and can lead to harm. We continue to monitor this area and will not hesitate to intervene when necessary.”Explore more on these topicsGamblingThe ObserverMarketing & PRAdvertisingData protectionInformation commissionernewsShareReuse this content"

Lord Foulkes is seeking a meeting this week with the clerk of the ­parliaments Simon Burton, who is head of theHouse of Lordsadministration, to discuss what Foulkes says is a growing list of concerns about the activities of the royal family.Foulkes, a junior minister under Tony Blair, said he has been refused permission to table a question ­proposing a ­public register of royal interests.Calls have been increasing for greater scrutiny of the royal family and their finances after a series of scandals involving Andrew.Foulkes’ intervention comes as new court documents revealed ­further details about the ­relationship between the prince, 64, and the ­convicted paedophile,Jeffrey Epstein.Emails released on Friday show that, in February 2011, a “member of the royal family”, believed to be Andrew, wrote: “Keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”The email contradicts claims made by Andrew in his disastrous 2019 BBCNewsnightinterview with Emily Maitlis that he had ceased all contact with Epstein in December 2010.The prince has also been criticised for his business relationshipwith an alleged Chinese spy.Foulkes said that parliament’s clerks have vetoed every attempt to raise concerns about Andrew and other royals. They have argued that parliament’s standing orders andErskine May, the authority on ­parliamentary procedure, prevent discussion of the monarchy and of any matters that reflect on the sovereign or royal family.Foulkes believes there should be changes to the rules to allow ­discussion beyond the current limit of questions about the cost to the taxpayer of royal palaces and events attended by the royals.Taxpayer funding to King Charles is set toincrease by 53% this yearto £132m. Foulkes said there were concerns, particularly among newly elected Labour MPs, about the amount of public money spent by the king and members of the royal family. Andrew received taxpayers’ money until he was forced to stand down from his official royal duties in November 2019 afterNewsnight.“It’s about wider accountability,” Foulkes said. “I was particularly ­concerned about where public money is spent. That’s why the Andrew issue is something that’s interested me particularly.”He added: “There is very great ­sensitivity in parliament and ­particularly in the House of Lords, as you would expect, and a lot of ­deference to the monarch, which is understandable in many ways.“But I think one of the things is to separate the monarch or head of state from the royal family, the rest of them. “Where does the royal family stop? All the grandchildren, the cousins, the nieces, the nephews … It’s not defined. The restriction can be used in relation to any of them.“Do the rules apply to Andrew, who is no longer a working member of the family?”Despite the fact that the number of working royals has fallen in recent years, as part of King Charles’svision for a “slimmed-down monarchy”, Whitehall retains a wide definition of the royal family.The information ­commissioner’s guidelines on exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act, for example, includes a large ­number of the extended family, ­including Princess Anne’s children, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, who have never had a royal title or undertaken official duties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs against European Union nations.Trump signed three executive orders on Saturday imposing tariffs of 25% on all goods from Mexico and Canada, the New York Timesreported. Trump imposed a 10% tariff on Canadian oil exports, as well as a 10% tariff on items from China.The Times reported that Trump’s tariffs were scheduled to go into effect on Tuesday. An official told the newspaper that these tariffs contained a retaliation clause that would ratchet up American tariffs if Mexico,Canadaor China tried to place their own tariffs on US goods in response.Trump is imposing the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The president cited the US opioid crisis when imposing his executive order, laying much of the blame for drug trafficking on Canada.In a post onTruth Social, Trump said: “We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all. I made a promise on my Campaign to stop the flood of illegal aliens and drugs from pouring across our Borders, and Americans overwhelmingly voted in favor of it.”The country “played a central role in these challenges, including by failing to devote sufficient attention and resources or meaningfully coordinate with United States law enforcement partners to effectively stem the tide of illicit drugs”, Trump claimed.View image in fullscreenTrucks enter the US from Canada at the Pacific Highway port of entry on 1 February 2025 in Blaine, Washington.Photograph: David Ryder/Getty ImagesTrump’s office said that Chinese officials had failed to prevent drug precursors from being shipped toMexicoand used by cartels. He also alleged that Mexican drug traffickers have an “intolerable allience with the government of Mexico”.In afact sheeton the tariffs, Trump also cited the “threat posed by illegal aliens” in his decision.Trump’s decision to levy a 10% tariff rate on Canadian energy products seems to be some sort of recognition that tariffs can spur higher prices. The White House has contended that tariffs will not fan the flames of inflation.Goods from these three countries comprise more than one-third of imports into the US, including apparel, medicine, electronics and steel, the newspaper reported. Despite Trump’s warning that they would be met with ramped-up tariffs, Canada and Mexico said they would meet his plan with tariffs on US imports.Ontario premier Doug Ford said: “Canada now has no choice but to hit back and hit back hard. Canada has so much of what America needs: high-grade nickel and other critical minerals, energy and electricity, uranium, potash, aluminum. We need to maximize our points of leverage and use them to maximum effect.”Canada reportedly said it would impose tariffs on Florida orange juice and whiskey from Tennessee, as well as Kentucky-made peanut butter. All three states are represented by Republican senators and voted for Trump in 2024, the Times notes.Claudia Sheinbaum, the president of Mexico, said that her country should move forward with a “cool head” and a planned retaliatory response, per the Times. The newspaper noted that Trump did not engage in any serious negotiations with these countries before issuing his decision.Sheinbaum,during a speechat an unrelated event, minutes after news of Trump’s tariffs came through, appeared to rally her base. “When we negotiate with other nations, when we talk with other nations, we always do so with our heads held high, never with our heads down,” she said.In a statement released onsocial media, Sheinbaum said: “We categorically reject the White House’s slander of the Government of Mexico having alliances with criminal organisations.” She proposed establishing a workforce with Trump to combat the issues he has with Mexico, saying: “Problems are not resolved by imposing tariffs.”The tariffs could have dire repercussions for Mexico. “We have to remember that 40% of Mexico’s GDP are exports,” said Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis at Grupo Financiero Base, adding that the Mexican economy could enter a “severe recession” if the tariffs were maintained.The American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico, which represents US companies in Mexico, said the tariffs would hit both economies and “fail to address the real challenges of security, migration, and drug trafficking,” adding that, “America First does not mean America Alone.”Economists have repeatedly sounded the alarm that higher tariffs will raise prices on consumer goods for Americans, exacerbating an increasedcost of living. Trump did recognize on Friday that his tariffs could prompt “temporary short-term disruption”.He said he hoped that Americans would understand why he was imposing them. “Tariffs don’t cause inflation,” Trump claimed. “They cause success.”Washington senator Patty Murray posted onsocial media: “Trump’s tariffs will cost families – literally. It’s not Mexico or Canada or China who pays for these increases, it’s YOU. And you’ll feel it on your wallet everywhere you shop.”Colorado governor Jared Polisagreed: “Trump’s tariffs will be a tax on Coloradans and American families, and increase the cost of everything from food to gas. Trump’s tariffs make us less competitive, hurt people and quite frankly make no sense.”Jason Smith, the ways and means committee chair, championed the tariffs. “President Trump is delivering on his promise … The tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China send a powerful message that the United States will no longer stand by as other nations fail to halt the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants into our country,” he said in astatement. “These measures will also bring in billions in new revenue to the US government.”The Tax Foundation, a conservative group, has estimated that Trump placed $80bn in tariffs on approxiately $380bn worth of products in 2018 and 2019. The foundation described this as “one of the largest tax increases in decades”.Joe Biden’s administration kept the majority of these tariffs in place, and increased tariffs on an additional $18bn of Chinese goods, including semiconductors and electric vehicles.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMexicoChinaCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

A source at the agency told Reuters that the non-alignment with the US diplomatic mission had helped build bridges that might not have come to be under purely political objectives.Perhaps signaling the new administration’s plan to fold the agency under the state department, Trump has not nominated a person to run USAid.The costs of a freeze on US foreign aid grants is already being felt. Field hospitals in Thai refugee camps, landmine clearance in war zones, and drugs to treat millions suffering from diseases such as HIV are among the programs facing defunding.In fiscal year 2023, the United States disbursed $72bn of assistance worldwide on everything from women’s health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIV/Aids treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work. It provided 42% of all humanitarian aid tracked by the United Nations in 2024.Following Trump’s executive order last week, the state department issued worldwide stop-work directives, effectively freezing all foreign aid with the exception of emergency food assistance in a move that experts warned risked killing people.Rubio earlier this week issued an additional waiver for “life-saving humanitarian assistance” while Washington undertakes the 90-day review.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS foreign policyDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

And federal lawmakers and area residents have raised concerns about the hazards of DC’scompact, crowded airspace, which sees high volumes of commercial and military flights.Flying a Black Hawk requires a “delicate balance”, said Michael McCormick, an associate professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida and a retired vice-president of the US Federal Aviation Administration’s air traffic organization. To control the helicopter requires the use of both hands and feet on top of the demands of military training and active operations, he said.“The military goes by the philosophy that you train as you fight,” McCormick told the Guardian US. This means training exercises take place at all times of day and night and in inclement weather and that military equipment will experience more wear and tear “than it would if you’re flying a civilian helicopter on a tour around Manhattan”.The army helicopter unit involved in the DC crash was conducting an annual training for its “continuity of government”mission, which involves the evacuation of high-level government officials from the nation’s capital in the event of an emergency, Pete Hegseth said.“The military does dangerous things. It does routine things on [a] regular basis,” said the defense secretary. “Tragically, last night, a mistake was made.”Retired US army Lt Col Darin Gaub, who flew Black Hawk helicopters for 22 years,toldthe Associated Press that there have been thousands of military helicopter flights without problems over many years in the airspace over DC.Wednesday’s fatal flight was the “one that didn’t go right out of all those thousands”, he said. “So it’s a testimony to the great procedures that are there, to the pilots that train there and how they operate on a daily basis. It’s basically a highly choreographed dance with very little room for maneuver.”Along with using instruments, helicopter pilots also fly by sight, using landmarks and the ground below them to estimate their altitude and position. This makes low-flying missions at night even more complex.Sometimes pilots will use night-vision goggles to assist with visibility, but that can cause complications, too. “Think of it as putting on a dive mask. It essentially blocks your peripheral vision and you lose that field of vision,” McCormick, the former federal aviation official, said.But even without them, McCormick said, pilots flying at lower altitudes may have trouble spotting other planes that can get lost in clusters of city lights.The Black Hawk pilots who crashed in Kentucky in 2023 were using night-vision goggles,the AP reported.Hegseth said on Thursday that the pilots involved in the DC crash had night-vision goggles onboard, but did not say whether they were in use when the crash occurred.Since the collision on Wednesday night, the north-south helicopter corridor that the army Black Hawk was using – known as Route 4 – has been closed as officials continue to investigate the crash and first responders continue searching for remains and debris.The military operates some 2,100 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters made by Sikorsky, a subsidiary of the aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin. In 2021, the army’s then safety director, Brig Gen Andrew Hilmes, told the Army Times after two army national guard Black Hawks crashed in Idaho and New York that the Black Hawk had a lower “mishap rate” than the less common Chinook and Apache helicopters.A preliminary safety report from the FAA reviewed by the New York Times stated that one air traffic controller had been performing the duties typically performed by two people at the time of the crash. Investigators are reviewing data collected by the “black boxes” recovered from the crash site. A preliminary report is expected within 30 days, while the final report could take more than a year.All 67 people onboard the Bombardier CRJ regional jet operated by PSA Airlines, an American Airlines subsidiary, and the army helicopter were killed. Among the passengers were 14 members of the US figure skating team who were returning from a development camp in Wichita, Kansas.The army has identified the helicopter crew as Staff Sgt Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Maryland; and a third service member whose name is not being released at their family’s request.Federal authorities are also investigating thefatal crashof a civilian medical jet in Philadelphia on Friday that killed all six passengers, including a six-year-old child and her family from Mexico who were in the US for medical treatment. Nineteen people on the ground were also injured, according to Cherelle Parker, the Philadelphia mayor.Explore more on these topicsWashington DC plane crashUS militaryHelicopter crashesPlane crashesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Martin won outright on the first ballot, capturing 246.5 votes of the 428 ballots cast; his closest competitor – Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic party – won 134.5 votes on the first ballot.“Thank you to the DNC members who have put their faith in my vision for our party,” Martin said in his victory speech.“We’re going to get to work. We’re going to fight; we’re going to go out there and take this fight to Donald Trump and the Republicans, and we’re going to fight for working people again in this party.”A longtime state leader with extensive ties within the Democratic National Committee, Martin inherits a party that appears disillusioned and despondent in the wake of Trump’s victory. The outgoing chair, Jaime Harrison of South Carolina, chose not to seek re-election after the party lost not only the White House but both chambers of Congress in the November elections.Martin emerged victorious from a crowded field of candidates that largely agreed on the major structural and reputational challenges facing the Democratic party as Trump begins his second term in the White House. Most chair candidates emphasized the need to reconnect with the working-class Americans who have moved sharply to the right and to find more effective means of communicating their values to voters.Martin’s supporters touted his victory as a promising first step to rebuilding the party and winning back young and working-class communities, where Trump made strong inroads in November. Martin’s first major test will come next year, asDemocratsattempt to regain control of the House of Representatives, where Republicans currently hold a narrow advantage.“Ken Martin leading the DNC is a big step to building a party that can energize young voters and working-class voters so that we can defeat the far-right,” said Stevie O’Hanlon, political director of the youth climate group Sunrise Movement. “Under Ken Martin, the Minnesota DFL won a trifecta and immediately pursued a populist agenda that should have set a model for Democrats nationally.”But Wikler’s supporters expressed severe disappointment over his loss, framing Martin’s victory as the perpetuation of a dangerous status quo that would further damage the Democratic party’s brand with voters.“This is an insider’s game,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which endorsed Wikler. “A perfectly fine longtime insider won, but we missed a transformational leader at a time when we need to show voters Democrats are doing things differently. Everyone wishes Ken the best.”In his victory speech, Martin pledged to unify Democrats and incorporate the best ideas from his competitors in the chair race to ensure a stronger party moving forward.“We’re going to bring them into this great party,” Martin said. “We’re going to unify this party together, and we’re all going to roll up our sleeves together to build this party.”It remains unclear how effective the next chair will be in implementing his agenda. In recent years, the committee has mostly served as an administrative body focused on fundraising, coordinating among state parties and setting rules for presidential primaries.Faiz Shakir, the former campaign manager for Bernie Sanders who launched a last-minute and ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the chair role,recently toldthe Guardian that the committee must seize this opportunity to move in a bolder direction.“When Democrats have a Democratic president in charge, it is often the case that [the Democratic National Committee] is working at the behest of the president of the United States,” Shakir said. “But now, when we don’t have the presidency, you take that structure and you say: ‘What is the most important thing that we have to do?’”Martin will begin answering that question in the coming days, and his response will help determine whether Democrats can once again capture the House majority in 2026 and eventually win back the White House in 2028.Explore more on these topicsDemocratsUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The Times is committed to covering the Pentagon fully and fairly. Steps designed to impede access are clearly not in the public interest,” the paper added in an email statement.NBC News said it was “disappointed by the decision to deny us access to a broadcasting booth at the Pentagon that we’ve used for many decades” and said it would “continue to report with the same integrity and rigor” as it always had.The partially publicly funded national radio outletNPRtold the Guardian in a statement that it would “continue to report with vigor and integrity on the transformation this administration has promised to deliver” and urged the Pentagon “to expand the offices available to press within the building so that all outlets covering the Pentagon receive equal access”.Additionally, NPR noted that the “decision interferes with the ability of millions of Americans to directly hear from Pentagon leadership, and with NPR’s public interest mission to serve Americans who turn to our network of local public media stations in all 50 states”.Kevin Baron, a former vice-president of the Pentagon Press Association, called the changes “the erasure of journalism at the Pentagon” in aseries of posts on X.Baron said the existing outlets were being “replaced with fake news partisans like Breitbart, OANN, and NY Post. And HuffPo (they still exist?) for fake balance. Trump/MAGA’s fascist takeover of media coverage of the regime continues.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS militaryNew York TimesNew York PostNBCHuffPostNPRnewsShareReuse this content"

Ice sculptures are dotted around the city – there was little chance of them melting as an Arctic blast pulled temperatures down to 15F (-9C).Inside Boscov’s, a 100-year-old department store, Sue Sloan says she can’t wait for spring. The 60–year-old housekeeper says she’s also looking for other changes. “Everything is so expensive,” she says. “Food prices, eggs, meat, gas, electricity, everything. It’s terrible,” she says.Sentiments like that helped Donald Trump deliver arguably the most humiliating defeat to Joe Biden’s administration in last year’s election. Scranton is Biden’s home town,and the local electorate not only turned out against his hand-picked successor, Kamala Harris, but the long-term local Democratic representatives CongressmanMatt Cartwrightand SenatorBob Casey.Bidenomics – Biden’s economic platform –earmarked billions for the state, but still Trump’s economic messaging on everyday prices won the day.“It’s 100% the economy all day long. The economy was the 800lb gorilla in this campaign,” says Rob Bresnahan, newly installed Republican congressman for Pennsylvania’s eighth congressional district.Earlier that day Bresnahan had been discussing what to do about a 10.8% hike in gas prices from UGI, a local utility. “People can’t afford to exist. People are having to decide between heating their homes or putting food in their refrigerators,” he says.An arrow chart showing difference in prices of common goods in ScrantonView image in fullscreenA man walks past a tattoo shop in Scranton.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesBut in one of the great puzzles of the 2024 election, some in the area – not all of them Democrats – say the local economy is great. For them, Trump’s messaging was at best misleading.Bob Durkin, president of the Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce, says business in the area has rarely been better. “This local economy is in really good shape,” says Durkin. Developers have bought every building downtown. Scaffolding is everywhere, covering some of the handsome neoclassical and art nouveau buildings constructed during Scranton’s heyday at the turn of the 20th century. Once unloved, they are being turned into offices, lofts and retail space.New employers are coming to the area attracted by its lower cost of living and proximity to New York. New restaurants and bars are popping up across the city and attracting crowds even in frigid late January. On the surface the self-styled “Electric City” – Scranton was one of the first cities to have electric lights and streetcars – is shining bright. Durkin’s major concern is shaking off people’s outdated perceptions of Scranton as a failing coal town and finding enough people to fill the jobs employers have, he says.Line chart showing the median income in Scranton between 2010-2023, compared to PA and USBut a fissure has developed between the economy and people’s experience of it. Ahead of the election,pollafterpollshowed that voters were unhappy with the economy, even as it recovered from the depths of the Covid recession. It’s been a global phenomenon brought on by people’s intense dislike of inflation, which soared after the pandemic, and one that has humbled incumbent governments worldwide.Durkin says inflation was “the worst” but the US has fared better than most other countries in the recovery.“I want to be careful what I say here,” he says. “I think people should see it for what it is. It was just a bunch of people saying things that weren’t really true. I mean inflation, yes. The cost of goods was high, but it was high all over the globe. I try to avoid getting involved in anything partisan, but when you look at all the standard measures that anybody would look to, the American economy is humming.”Inflation fell faster in the US, growth picked up quicker, he says. “We just had a bunch of people saying it wasn’t true.”View image in fullscreenTrump supporters in Scranton in November.Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesBresnahan could not disagree more. “The medium household income of my district is $61,000 a year. You’re talking about the S&P, the Nasdaq, the majority of people [in this area] are living paycheck to paycheck. When you are being told time and time again that the economy is booming and we are sitting around with our family deciding whether we can take that vacation this year … we are calling bullcrap.”For now, Republicans can point the finger at the Biden administration for the national feeling of malaise that had so many hungry for change. But many of the issues facing Scranton – and large swathes of the US – go back decades, and will prove tough to solve. Many administrations have overseen the decline of well-paid manufacturing jobs, stagnant wage growth, soaring housing costs, lack of affordable childcare. As in other areas across the US, Scranton’s economic boom and influx of new workers have exacerbated existing issues, such as the lack of affordable housing for lower-paid long-term residents.“When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on day one,” Trump promised. It’s early days, but so far his major policy plan to bring down prices has been to call for more oil drilling – a plan some expertsdispute will work.For some locals, change can’t come soon enough. Bresnahan says lowering energy prices will go a long way to tackling the cost of living crisis. “There were economic implications for vilifying natural resources,” he says.a small multiple line chart showing Scranton’s poverty rate and percentage of households receiving food stamps, compared to US averageRepublican voters, the group most concerned about the economy under Biden, are now warming to the economy under Trump, according toearly polling. “We are only a week into Trump’s new term, and already Republicans are more confident in the economy today than Democrats were of Biden’s leading into the election. While economic views flip with a new party in office, there’s more energy here early on and that’s worth watching,” says John Gerzema, the CEO of Harris Poll.View image in fullscreenRob Bresnahan at an event in October.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APBut there is a long way to go, and, locally, there is deep scepticism that Trump will pull it off.Kenneth Minor, 65, is on social security. “Everything has gone up. People are angry. Why wouldn’t they be?” he says. But he doesn’t think Trump will improve matters. “I just had to put $60 in my ex-wife’s bank account just to keep it open. You think Trump and his billionaire pals ever had to do that?”It’s a sentiment Paige Cognetti, the city’s Democratic mayor, says she hears a lot. For Cognetti, the election underscored the difference between how some politicians, economists and business leaders viewed the macroeconomy and “how families feel at their kitchen tables. It can be true that we have really positive trajectories, investment dollars are going in to places like Scranton. There’s a good business case, new restaurants, new shops. And also people feel their wages are not keeping up, they feel that bills are too high. Both of those things are true at the same time.”View image in fullscreenJoe Biden visits Zummo’s Cafe in Scranton in April last year.Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty ImagesPart of the difficulties some politicians had in the election cycle was acknowledging one while not acknowledging the other, she says. “We do have positive growth, but at the same time we have folks who are really feeling the pinch at home.”Now hanging over that recovery, she says, is the specter of tariffs – Trump’s other major economic platform. The president said he would impose tariffs on 1 February on products from Canada, Mexico and China, countries that account for more than a third of US trade.a line chart showing median rent in Scranton, PA compared to rest of the state and the country“Are avocados going to be even more expensive? Are we going to have mass deportations in the Fresno area [that add to agricultural costs]? We are all now on the train, and it’s hard to imagine that it doesn’t lead to a higher cost of living,” says Cognetti.Bresnahan says he wants to see the details on any tariff proposals before voting on them. “I understand conceptually what tariffs are meant to do, but I ran on making life more affordable again,” he says. “Any policies that are going to increase the cost for the average family, I am going to have a really hard time getting behind.”View image in fullscreenA person sets up a food cart in downtown Scranton.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesThe congressman caucuses with the“problem-solvers”– a House group that tries to foster bipartisan cooperation. But like many Republicans before him, he may find Trump too has a “hard time” with representatives who don’t get behind his plans.The Republican victory in this region was clear but narrow. Bresnahan beat incumbent Matt Cartwright50.8% to 49.2%. Trump’s 2024 winning margin was the fourth smallest since 1960 on apercentage basis.It’s too early to say whether Trumponomics will prove more popular than Bidenomics or whether the new president’s tariff threats will make America great or derail the economy.But it is clear that in the town that kicked out its hometown boy, voters are ready to do the same to Trump if he doesn’t pull through.With an icy wind whistling up Biden Street, Mike Johnson, 52, says he doesn’t have long to chat. He describes the economy as “meh” – he’s working, but declines to say where, and says everyone he knows says life has become too expensive.“People wanted change,” he says. “Joe was too old and I didn’t feel like Harris had the answers. But I can’t stand Trump, and we’ll kick him out too if things don’t get better.”Explore more on these topicsPennsylvaniaUS economyDonald TrumpEconomicsJoe BidenUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Citing Costco’s surging profits, which hit $7.4bn last year, the union has called for significant wage increases and improvements to benefits.“From day one, we’ve told Costco that our members won’t work a day past January 31 without a historic, industry-leading agreement,” said the Teamsters general president, Sean O’Brien, in a statement.In January the Teamstersannouncedthat members had voted 85% in favor of a strike, with the union holding practice pickets and rallying outside Costco’s headquarters in Washington during the company’s annual shareholder meeting.The unionsaidtheir questions submitted to the shareholder meeting went unanswered, accusing the company’s negotiators of “nickel and diming” workers at the bargaining table while the company’s board has approved “outrageous” salaries for corporate executives. The Costco CEO, Rich Vachris,receivedmore than $12m in total compensation in 2024, his first year in the position.“We’re demanding a contract that matches the success we made possible,” said Paul Lowrie, a Costco fleet driver in Sumner, Washington, said in apress release.Before the proposedstrike, Costco announced pay increases for most of its store employees, with $1-an-hour increases for top-scale employees to $30.20 an hour, and $1-an-hour annual increases over the next two years, claiming the pay increases will bring the hourly pay for most store workers to more than $30 an hour. Workers on the bottom of the wage scale will receive a $0.50 increase to $20 an hour.As several large corporations have rescinded their diversity, equity and inclusion policies as Trump has taken office, including Walmart, McDonald’s and Target, Costco has defended its DEI policies.

Andoni Iraola’s team had previously beaten Manchester City, Arsenal and, last week, Nottingham Forest 5-0 but Liverpool forged on where their rivals had slipped.Lucky Liverpool? Possibly, but their spotless results make it hard to argue | Jonathan WilsonRead more“We knew that if we would have had any chance of a result over here we at least had to compete with them in terms of running and fighting and playing the duels,” said Slot. Bournemouth created several chances, hitting the post twice, but with the goalkeeper Alisson also outstanding, the leaders prevailed.“Alisson, he was so important again today, two or three absolute world-class saves,” said Slot. “If you want to win here against the team that is so competitive, you need a team performance and work rate; that’s what we have.”Salah scored his first from the penalty spot after Lewis Cook was ruled to have tripped Cody Gakpo, the decision enraging home supporters. Slot said he assumed it was a correct decision because the VAR ruled in his team’s favour. “One of my players is on a clear one-v-one: either he makes a dive or he touches it,” he said. “I wouldn’t call it luck unless I see and he didn’t touch at all.”“This penalty can go both ways,” Iraola said. “We played a high level but against the top teams we need to punish them. Small things didn’t go for us. We have given ourselves a chance, but it hasn’t been enough.”Trent Alexander-Arnold limped from the field in the second half and Slot, although noncommittal on the type of injury, all but ruled the defender out of Thursday’s Carabao Cup semi-final second leg with Tottenham: “It’s never a good sign when a player is asking for a substitution.”Alisson joined the tributes to Salah, who had overtaken Frank Lampard to become the Premier League’s sixth all-time goalscorer on 178. “He is quality, he knows how important he is for the team when he scores. Defending is something he doesn’t like to do, but he does it for the team.”Virgil van Dijk, at a similar contract impasse to Salah, said: “Let’s make it more, let’s keep going. He has obviously been amazing for the football club over all those years.”“It feels good scoring goals and the team winning,” said Salah.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolThe ObserverArne SlotBournemouthnewsShareReuse this content"

An attorney for the spa owner told the publication that the owner had not previously heard the allegations against Tucker, 35, despite at least one woman detailing reports she made to management about the kicker.Each of the encounters with Tucker allegedly took place between 2012 and 2016 at high-end spas in the Baltimore area.Tucker moved to the region in 2012 after the Ravens signed him as an undrafted free agent. In 13 seasons with the team, he is a five-time All-Pro selection and is the NFL’s all-time leader in field goal percentage at 89.1%.The Banner began investigating a tip received 9 January regarding the allegations in advance of the Thursday report. The first six women who spoke to the news organization were kept anonymous out of their fear that the Ravens or their fans would retaliate.Among that group, five accused Tucker of requesting that they “massage his pelvic region or inner thighs while he had an erection”, then proceeding to expose his genitals by moving the sheets laid over him. Two claimed that Tucker brushed them with his exposed penis, and three said that he left “a large wet spot” on their massage tables that they “strongly believed to be ejaculate”.Tucker said it didn’t happen.“The allegations in the Baltimore Banner article about me are unequivocally false,” Tucker wrote in a lengthy denial.“Throughout my career as a professional athlete, I have always sought to conduct myself with the utmost professionalism. I have never before been accused of misconduct of any kind, and I have never been accused of acting inappropriately in front of a massage therapist or during a massage therapy session or during other bodywork. I have never received any complaints from a massage therapist, have never been dismissed from a massage therapy or bodywork session, and have never been told that I was not welcome at any spa or other place of business.”Explore more on these topicsBaltimore RavensNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The young athletes with the greatest potential are offered this chance to watch the stars of their sport compete, and then learn from some of the most elite coaches in the country.“They just made the environment really, really special,” said Anne Goldberg-Baldwin, coach and technical specialist on competition judging panels, who was present at the camp. Her student, Spencer Lane, was on the American Eagle flight 5342that crashed late Wednesday nightfollowing a collision with a Black Hawk helicopter. With him were several other skaters from the camp, their coaches and their parents, and the loss has ripped a hole in the figure skating community.“These were the country’s youngest and brightest rising stars. They were the next generation,” said Melissa Gregory, a US Olympic ice dancer and coach. “We’re all such a tight family, and it just hurts, and I think we all are going to really feel this pain and this loss for a long time.”Gregory, along with her husband and skating partner Dennis Petukhov, had been particularly close friends with Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, the 1994 world champions and two-time Olympians, who were also on the plane returning from Wichita. Petukhov had known the couple since the 1990s, training and coaching together in Russia, before each making their way to the United States. They had performed in shows together, traded coaching tips and helped each other’s students. Their lives became closely intertwined as the two couples built their skating schools in Connecticut.2:37Figure skaters in Boston and Russia mourn victims of Washington DC plane crash – video“It’s hard to comprehend that such high-level professionals, I would say the top of the top, can be gone. These are the type of people that are role models – you could admire everything about them,” Petukhov said.Shishkova and Naumov made it a habit to bring young, talented coaches under their wing, engaging them as choreographers and team members. In a sport where it’s not uncommon for coaches to silo their students and form rivalries, they did the opposite.“I enjoyed every second working with them,” choreographer Adam Blake said. “We were such a great collaborative partnership. We trusted each other, and we listened to each other and we respected each other. But I just loved that we were more than work partners. We were friends.”He described Shishkova as someone who, if anyone ever had a problem, would go straight into “Mom mode”. And it’s her role not just as an accomplished, expert coach, but as a tiny, fierce mama bear that most mention.Shishkova and Naumov had been coaching at the Skating Club of Boston, where they trained their son, Maxim Naumov, the 2020 junior national champion who finished fourth at last week’s senior nationals, among many others who travelled to learn from them. Petukhov said that one of his favorite memories of the couple will be helping to coach Maxim from a young age, watching him grow into the elite international athlete he is today. “It was very pleasant and very nice to see that not only our friends had always done well, but their son, Maxim, is also following their footsteps.”The couple also coached Lane, the super-talented 16-year-old skater who had gone from watching an outdoor Christmas ice show and telling his mom he thought he could do that, to just a few years later landing triple-triple combination jumps at the national development camp. Both Blake and Goldberg-Baldwin said Lane was one of the most natural skaters they had ever worked with. They each expressed how you could give him a correction, or a new skill to learn, and something that would take other children weeks or months to master, he would simply skate across the ice and accomplish.“He just had such a passion for the sport,” said Blake. “He was completely all in. And not just the skating side, but also with the community side. Everyone at the rink loved him. All the kids gravitated towards him.”His mother, Christine, was far from the image of a pushy skating mom, Goldberg-Baldwin said. She often asked what to do, and where they were supposed to be – his rise through the ranks had been so fast, that unlike other parents, she didn’t have the years of watching her child grow from lower levels to gain experience. Her sincerity, and commitment to supporting her son was consummate.Blake also had worked with Jinna Han, the 13-year-old who had just made it to the development camp for the first time. He described her as a firecracker, with so much energy it seemed like she could burst, but always with a ready smile and an excited “Hello” whenever you saw her.“She was always in the director’s chair,” Blake said of working with her on choreography and performance skills. “She knew what she wanted. She knew where she wanted it. She was the boss. She had just such a wonderful spirit about her.”He described her parents as a unit, one or the other sitting watching her skate in the early mornings, fully enmeshed in the community. Always supportive, always friendly.View image in fullscreenThis recent handout photograph provided by The Skating Club of Boston shows club skater Spencer Lane, who died in an airplane collision with a helicopter on Wednesday in Washington DC.Photograph: The Skating Club of Boston photograph/APBlake said that he arrived back at the rink in the days after the crash, unsure what to do. It’s a new skating season for the younger skaters, and it’s time to make new routines. Along with Shishkova and Naumov, he had been in the process of choosing the best music for each child and their progress through the next year. Normally, the head coaches would have blocked out the elements of the programs. First a jump, then a step sequence, the rules and the requirements of the sport guiding them. Now, Blake doesn’t know where to begin. And returning back to the rink with so many faces gone was perhaps the most difficult.“It was a really heavy feeling walking through the doors,” he said. If he closes his eyes, the habits and rituals of each one gone is so clear. “There are certain places in the rink, where you can see where they would sit to lace up their skates. You can see where they would be warming up. You can see them circling the ice.” When he goes into the skaters’ lounge, it’s almost as if Shishkova and Naumov are still there. She would be sitting curled up on her chair in breaks, playing games on her phone, with Naumov on his rare breaks sitting nearby.The Skating Club of Boston held several vigils for their community late last week. Goldberg-Baldwin said that nearly 200 people showed up on Thursday, giving speeches, crying together and remaining in long-lasting hugs. So far, with the world championships coming up in March, set to be held in Boston, plans are being made for further memorials and performances from the skaters who loved those lost. But right now, it’s just one day at a time.“We’re all wavering between disbelief and despair at the same time,” Blake said. “It’s absolutely devastating what has happened. And I think the skating community is reacting and really stepping up to that title of ‘tight knit community.’ The outpouring of support and of love is just it is truly amazing”Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingWashington DC plane crashUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Murray had driven into the lane and took a shot, then went to chase after his miss. But he fell to the court and grabbed at the back of his right foot, then hobbled toward the bench.The Pelicans said an MRI that showed the rupture was performed Friday night. Players and coach Willie Green indicated after the 118-116 loss to the reigning champion Celtics that they already knew Murray had suffered a serious injury even before the diagnosis was announced.“It sucks, bro,” guard Jose Alvarado said. “That’s my dawg. At the end of the day, we’re human beings and when I saw it, I felt bad for him. I can’t really explain it. It’s something that I knew wasn’t looking good. ... He loves this game and I know how much he loves it. It’s unfortunate. And when I’d seen that, I couldn’t put it into words.”This is the second major leg injury for the 28-year-old Murray in hisNBAcareer. He missed the 2018-19 season when he tore his right ACL, which happened in the preseason before what would have been his third year with the San Antonio Spurs.The Pelicans (12-37) entered Saturday next-to-last in the Western Conference and well out of the playoff picture. And injuries are among the biggest reasons why this year has gone horribly wrong for New Orleans.Murray already missed 17 games earlier this season with a broken hand. Williamson has missed 36 games for a variety of reasons, the bulk of those absences because of left hamstring issues. Ingram has missed the Pelicans’ last 25 games with a sprained left ankle.Herb Jones – one of the league’s best defenders – has missed 29 games with a right shoulder issue. CJ McCollum missed 13 games with an adductor strain. Alvarado missed 23 games with a hamstring issue.Add it all up, and the season simply never had a chance to get on the track that the Pelicans hoped for. There’s also been lessons learned from off-the-court issues that overshadow anything that happens in basketball, Green said – seemingly referencing the New Year’s Eve truck attack in New Orleans’ French Quarter that killed 14 people, and the plane crashes in Washington and Philadelphia this week that led to 73 more deaths.“This is NBA difficulty,” Green said. “What we just saw on the news, that’s real-life difficulty. And keeping that in perspective is important. We lose a game in the NBA, we get to wake up tomorrow and get back after it. When you keep life in perspective — and for me, keeping God first and staying steady through challenges — you’re able to overcome them and come out on the other end OK.”Murray ends his season averaging 17.5 points, 7.4 assists and 6.5 rebounds per game. He’s in the first year of a four-year, $114.2m contract and was the highest-profile addition to New Orleans’ roster last summer, when he was traded to the Pelicans by Atlanta.Achilles tendon tears can require a recovery period of up to a year in some cases, and Murray’s rehab is certain to last several months at minimum. That would leave Murray’s availability for the start of next season – opening night is typically in mid-to-late October – in some doubt.Explore more on these topicsNew Orleans PelicansNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But unlike last year, the move comes without significant uproar or repercussions from the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) which runs the tournament.Tuesday’s Open Cup news was part of a larger announcement, detailing whichMLSteams would be taking part in which tournaments outside the 2025 MLS regular season and playoffs. These tournaments include the US Open Cup, Concacaf Champions Cup (the confederation’s championship), Leagues Cup (MLS’s joint venture with Mexico’s Liga MX), and Canadian Championship (The Open Cup equivalent for Canada).Historically, the Open Cup is not a tournament MLS teams have needed to qualify for. Until the 2024 season, every American MLS team was entered in the competition automatically, and by obligation. The USSF rulebook states that, for Division I leagues like MLS, “US-based teams must participate in all representative US Soccer [USSF] and CONCACAF competitions for which they are eligible.”The Open Cup is one such tournament. To justify its non-participation, MLS changed the definition of “eligible” in its league and invented a form of qualification – which in truth is less qualification, more assignment.For the past two seasons, the Leagues Cup has featured all 29 teams from MLS and every club from Mexico’s Liga MX, but in 2025 the number of MLS teams will drop to 18 to match the Liga MX total. To get to 18, MLS decreed that the top nine teams from each MLS conference in 2024 enter the 2025 Leagues Cup – though it seems like a flaw that the teams did not know about this method of qualification while they were playing in 2024.A more accurate framing is that MLS is withdrawing 11 of its 27 eligible teams from the Open Cup.The nine MLS teams not in either the Leagues Cup or the Champions Cup automatically “qualified” for the 2025 Open Cup along with seven more teams based on the 2024 Supporters’ Shield standings.MLS stated that: “every MLS club has the opportunity to compete in at least one, but no more than two, North American competitions that run concurrently with the MLS league season.” This two-tournament limit means 2024 Open Cup champion Los Angeles FC will not be given the chance to defend its title as participation in the Leagues Cup seemingly takes precedence.MLS touts in its release that it is sending 16 teams to the Open Cup. A more accurate framing is that MLS iswithdrawing11 of its 27 eligible teams from the Open Cup.It also announced that it will do similar in 2026 before re-evaluating before the 2027 edition. As the Open Cup is linked to Champions Cup and potentially Club World Cup qualification, it raises the question of whether Concacaf or FIFA could step in.Another issue is that Vancouver Whitecaps’ participation in the Canadian Championship as well as the Champions Cup meant it was already at the newly imposed two-tournament limit, and thus couldn’t take its place in the Leagues Cup despite finishing eighth in MLS’s Western Conference. Instead of their Leagues Cup place going to the next team in the standings, Austin FC, the spot was given seemingly at random to 2025 expansion side San Diego FC, which won’t be competing in the Open Cup.View image in fullscreenLAFC will not have a chance to defend its 2024 Open Cup titlePhotograph: Scott Mitchell/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockElsewhere, Atlanta United is in qualification limbo. It is excluded from the Open Cup due to being neither bad enough to miss out on the Leagues Cup nor good enough to qualify for the Open Cup via the Supporters’ Shield standings. It shows how convoluted and haphazard parts of this “qualification” procedure are, and reinforces the idea that it is more allocation than qualification.This entire issue dates back to December 2023 when MLSannounced it would not be entering any teams in the 2024 Open Cup. A half-hearted compromise was reached between MLS and the USSF whereby the league would enter eight teams along with nine MLS-affiliated MLS Next Pro teams.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We don’t control the brand,” MLS commissioner Don Garber said of the Open Cup while speaking tothe Athleticin March 2024. MLS does, however, control the Leagues Cup. As usual, it boils down to MLS wanting to control soccer in the United States and the USSF allowing it to do so.National cup competitions are an integral part of national soccer infrastructure for countries all over the world. They connect a country’s soccer landscape, its teams, and its supporters with one another in the reassurance that they are all part of it.This is especially important in the US where it is easy for teams to feel detached from the wider soccer ecosystem as there is no opportunity to move between leagues via promotion and relegation. The 111-year-old Open Cup links the sport’s history to its existing legues, and those leagues to each other in an environment where such links are rare to nonexistent.Wherever you look, the health of an open domestic cup and the issues it faces can reveal a lot about the state of a country’s soccer, and at the moment the US Open Cup reveals the unhealthy sway MLS has over the game in the United States.Explore more on these topicsUS Open CupMLSUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Stewart-Binks’ lawyers said she gave the AP permission to use her name.Stewart-Binks covered soccer and hockey in Canada and moved to Los Angeles in 2013 to join the team at Fox Sports 1, the lawsuit said. She was invited to cover the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics as a host and returned to report on the NHL’s Los Angeles Kings, the Stanley Cup playoffs and the US men’s and women’s national soccer teams. In the fall of 2014, she was the main sideline reporter for the Anaheim Ducks.Jamie Horowitz became president of Fox Sports in May 2015 and hired Dixon two months later to be the executive vice president of content, the lawsuit said. “The two had the power to pick and choose who would be on camera for the networks,” the lawsuit said.In the buildup to the 2016 Super Bowl, plans were underway for the show Jason Whitlock’s House Party By the Bay and Stewart-Binks was told she was going to appear on the program, the lawsuit said. The night before her meeting with the show’s team, she received a text from Dixon asking her to meet him at his hotel, the lawsuit said.According to the lawsuit, Dixon told her they needed to talk about the show, and then began berating her, saying he didn’t want her going to the Super Bowl because she wasn’t “funny, interesting or talented”. He said she wasn’t “capable of handling big moments on TV” and people would only watch if she got on the bar and took off her top,” the lawsuit said.As Stewart-Binks scrambled to come up with a response that would show her talent, Dixon invited her to his hotel room to see the view from his balcony, the suit said. She agreed, reluctantly. But once on the balcony, Dixon pushed her against the wall, pinned down her arms, pressed his body against hers and tried to force his tongue into her mouth, the lawsuit said.Stewart-Binks pushed him away and ran from the room, the suit said. She didn’t say anything about it at the team’s Super Bowl meeting the following day and she was confirmed to appear on the Whitlock show. However, she was told that she had to confront New England Patriots tight end Ron Gronkowski about his stint at a stripper in college.She resisted the idea of asking for his '“Magic Mike” moves but after Dixon’s comments the night before, she wanted to prove that she could be fun, so she asked for a lap dance, the lawsuit said.Stewart-Binks said she faced an immediate backlash on social media from people who said she was setting women back through her actions.“Following Fox’s direction, Stewart-Binks remained silent outwardly, though Dixon’s assault and the media’s portrayal of her took a profound emotional toll and left her in tears much of the time,” the lawsuit said.She only went public after seeing the lawsuit filed by the former Fox hairstylist who made similar claims. Stewart-Binks’ lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for emotional distress and asks that Fox be required to take action to prevent any current or future sexual abuse.“Ms Stewart-Binks hopes that by seeking justice, and by doing so publicly, sports networks will recognize the necessity of ridding those who abuse power and those who protect them,” the lawsuit said.Since leaving Fox Sports, Stewart-Binks has done work for many media outlets including ESPN, CBS Sports, NBC Sports, and TNT. She also was a correspondent for the CBC in Canada during its coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics.Explore more on these topicsSportUS sportsTelevision industryShareReuse this content"

Possibly, but their spotless results make it hard to argueJonathan Wilsonat the Vitality StadiumArne Slot’s team are masters of making their opponents, Bournemouth this time, look as if they are in poor formSat 1 Feb 2025 13.38 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2025 16.56 ESTShareLiverpool this season have been very good at being good enough. There have been very few games in which they’ve dismantled the opposition. They have won fewer league games by more than three goals than Tottenham have, but ended the day nine points clear at the top with their closest rivals to play the defending champions on Sunday. IfLiverpooldo, as they surely will, go on to win the title, it will have been an old-fashioned sort of success, a league won not by the spectacular or the flamboyant but by consistency and calmness, by ruthless accumulation.This was Liverpool’s sixth 2-0 win in the league; more than a quarter of their games so far. It’s a scoreline that speaks of control, of winning games with a little to spare, taking freakish equalisers, ill luck and odd refereeing decisions out of the equation, without being flashy and demanding overexertion: 2-0 is the scoreline of champions. Arsenal, like Liverpool, began the season with a pair of 2-0 wins but, since then, they have won 2-0 only once.Salah halts Bournemouth’s charge and sends Liverpool nine points clearRead moreWhen optimistic Arsenal fans looked at the second half of the season and noted that Liverpool had some tricky away games to play, this was one of the fixtures they would have earmarked as having the potential to cost Arne Slot’s side points.Bournemouthhad beaten not only Arsenal at home but also Manchester City and Nottingham Forest. And they could easily have taken a point off Liverpool, Antoine Semenyo and Marcus Tavernier clattering shots against the post.There has been a sense with Liverpool that they have played teams at the right time, just at the point when they are out of sorts or have key players missing.While there probably is some truth to that, it is also the case that Liverpool are very good at making opponents look as though they are in poor form. And nobody could have claimed that Bournemouth were not playing well before Saturday. If anything, their form was too good, having scored nine in their previous two games. Nobody can keep a shot conversion rate of 25% going for long. That Bournemouth got only three of 14 shots on target, two of those drawing excellent saves from Alisson, is perhaps a rare visible case of regression to the mean.Lucky Liverpool? Possibly – as even Slot acknowledged. Certainly the penalty they were awarded in the first half will raise eyebrows. That Cody Gakpo kicked the back of his own heel was clear; the question was whether he was nudged into doing so by Lewis Cook. At the very least the decision was soft. The offside decision that saw the equaliser David Brooks seemed to have scored before half-time ruled out was correct, but it was a close-run thing.View image in fullscreenVirgil van Dijk looked imperious at the back for Liverpool again.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersBut Liverpool’s second goal was one of rare quality, Curtis Jones beginning the break, catching up with it and feeding Mohamed Salah, who scored with the perfect finish, whipping the ball with very little backlift round Milos Kerkez and the stretching arm of Kepa Arrizabalaga and just inside the far post. It was a goal of efficiency and beauty, technically excellent and without the slightest needless embellishment and, as such, emblematic of Slot’s team as a whole.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is not only a very fine defender, arguably back to being the best centre-back in the league, but also a great leader. There has been rather less focus on Van Dijk than on the other two players who are out of contract in June, perhaps because he is 33, and perhaps because the assumption is that he is more likely than either Trent Alexander-Arnold or Salah to sign a new deal, but if he does leave he would be sorely missed, not only for what he himself offers but because he makes players around him better.Liverpool still have to go to Everton, Manchester City, Aston Villa and Chelsea. They still have to play Arsenal at home. There are hurdles to be negotiated. But given the sides Bournemouth have beaten at the Vitality this season, this was a big obstacle ticked off. There are 15 games left. The title race is not over yet. But Liverpool felt a lot closer to the tape at the final whistle than they had at kick-off.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolThe ObserverBournemouthanalysisShareReuse this content"

The club regard Rashford as a low-risk signing given they are unlikely to pay a fee. The England international is due to have a medical on Sunday.Villa are discussing potentially including an option to buy Rashford in the summer if the move proves fruitful. The 27-year-old has been frozen out by Ruben Amorim at United, and has not made an appearance since 12 December, but a move to Villa would allow him to play in the Champions League and push for the top four.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The West Midlands club have agreed to cover a significant portion of Rashford’s £365,000-a-week wages. Their highest earner is thought to be the goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez, at about £200,000 a week.Rashford had been keen on a move to Barcelona but barring a late twist he will be confirmed as a Villa player before the window shuts at 11pm GMT on Monday. Asensio, who spent almost a decade with Real Madrid, has 38 Spain caps. Villa are also targeting a central defender, with Chelsea’s Axel Disasi still an option.Emery is an admirer of versatile players and Rashford’s experience playing centrally as a striker and on the flanks appeals to the Villa manager.Villa signed Donyell Malen, who can also play across the front line, from Borussia Dortmund last month. Emery believes he can work with Rashford and help him recapture his best form.The United forward has scored seven times this season, most recentlya double at home to Evertonat the start of December. Since his 30 goals in the 2022-23 campaign, his numbers have dropped off significantly. Rashford would link up at Villa with his England colleague Ollie Watkins, who is said by Emery to be happy to stay after Arsenal had a bid for the striker rejected. “Some players prefer to leave and some players accept to stay here, to be here and commit with us,” Emery said. “One of those is Ollie Watkins.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Everything is different.Omar Marmoushsteps off the plane at Manchester Airport and what greets him is a kind of sensory overload. He peers through blacked-out windows of his chauffeured car at the city he now calls home. “What are the names of the supermarkets?” he asks. “Tesco,” comes the reply. “Asda. Sainsbury’s. Aldi.”On the pitch, it’s a similar story. “He has something special,” Erling Haaland confirms after a dynamic debut against Chelsea last Saturday night. “He’s going to be a fantastic player for us. It’s about getting to know him as soon as possible, because there are so many important games coming.”Guardiola praises Haaland’s self-control as City prepare for next Arsenal face-offRead moreAnd for all City’s travails of late, Haaland was correct: the meat of their season is arguably still to come. A double-header against Real Madrid in the Champions League. Newcastle, Liverpool, Tottenham, Nottingham Forest and Brighton in successive Premier League games. But before them all, a trip toArsenalon Sunday afternoon where we may well discover if there is anything tangible to be salvaged from this strangest of campaigns.Marmoush played 73 minutes against Chelsea, had 28 touches of the ball and was ineligible for the3-1 win over Club Bruggeon Wednesday night. So naturally there is a certain amount of extrapolation at work here when we say that his arrival feels like a genuine landmark in the evolution of Pep Guardiola in Manchester: perhaps even the gestation of his third great City team.Between 2017 and 2022, City won four league titles without any single player scoring more than 21 goals in a season. This was in many ways the perfection of Guardiola’s positional theory, the football of quick passing triangles and elaborately rehearsed movements. Between 2022 and 2024, City won two league titles and a treble with Haaland scoring more than a third of their goals. This was positional football retooled around a central point: 10 players whose job was essentially to finagle the ball into scoring positions for the 11th.But last week Guardiola offered an interesting theory about where he sees the game heading and how his City have fallen short this season. “Modern football is the way that Bournemouth play,” he said. “That Newcastle play, like Brighton play, like Liverpool always have been. Like we were. Modern football is not positional, being there. You have to ride the rhythm. We could not.”Ride the rhythm. What does that mean in practice? Perhaps, as the above teams do, it means getting the ball with gain of time into the places where defenders are not. Fabian Hürzeler at Brighton talks about football being “situational” rather than players operating in rehearsed positions. Andoni Iraola at Bournemouth talks about players taking the initiative, “attacking the spaces” and “forgetting about the pattern”. Both coaches prefer players who can improvise on the hoof, with a strong emphasis on dribbling and instinctive combination play, quick switches and even long balls.Guardiola has obviously been conscious of these developments for a while. In a way the signings of Jérémy Doku andMatheus Nuneswere early attempts to anticipate the shift from short passing towards dribbling. And why sign two new centre-halves in Vitor Reis andAbdukodir Khusanovwhen inJosko Gvardiolyou have a world-class option who has barely played there? Because Gvardiol has become peerless as an agent of chaos on the left, a target for switches of play, a late final-third runner whose movement from deep is almost impossible to track.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland has a new partner at Manchester City with Omar Marmoush (left) offering a different dynamic.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesBut the arrival of Marmoush adds another gear entirely. Against Chelsea the Egyptian was continually making curved runs in behind, but predominantly from outside to in, towards the central areas, against defences already primed for the threat of Haaland. The result: Chelsea began to narrow, leaving huge gaps for Nunes and Gvardiol to attack on the flanks. “He made incredible movements that players in the middle could not see,” Guardiola said of Marmoush. “It’s a question of time.”The other side of the equation is how Marmoush’s arrival affects Haaland, recently signed to anine-and-a-half-year contract. At Dortmund he made his name attacking off the shoulder of the last defender in a league where almost everyone leaves space in behind. At City thus far he has operated in a more limited area, either attacking the six-yard box or dropping deep to shovel the ball on.It’s a superb use of his strengths and finishing instincts, but a poor use of his lightning pace.But now defences have to deal with the threat of Haaland dropping deep and Marmoush running in behind, or Marmoush staying wide and Haaland running in behind, or both running in behind, or both tucking in and Phil Foden running in behind, or some other combination of mayhem that exists only in Guardiola’s head. In essence City are becoming a primarily direct team with a short-passing game as their backup, whereas until recently it was the other way around.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arsenal too have been evolving under Mikel Arteta, adding options in midfield and defence, but has their attack evolved with it?No solution in sight for Arsenal’s stop-gap striker problem after three yearsRead moreTo a large extent their play in the final third still follows distinct patterns, lots of quick, rehearsed movements betweenMartin Ødegaardand Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz around the penalty area. But the full-backs are still largely uninvolved, the central pivots still essentially possession-shovellers and transition-deterrers, the system still geared towards minimising risk rather than inviting it.Of course, there remains an element of conjecture here. None of this is a reliable predictor of how the next few years will pan out, much less 90 minutes at a febrile Emirates on Sunday. But even as his time at City winds down, you can sense Guardiola trying to seed the ground for what follows, in much the same way that Jürgen Klopp laid the foundations for Arne Slot at Liverpool, packing the squad with dynamic passing midfielders who he was never going to enjoy at their best.Guardiola may not be around for City’s future. But in a way, he’s already begun to shape it.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityThe ObserverPep GuardiolaArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How calm he remains, how hard he works if sometimes he does not score for a game … it is impressive.”Kompany was unhappy with Bayern’s finish to the game. “The last 10 minutes is something we need to review with the players,” he said. “You can sometimes concede a goal but if you concede momentum you give the other team a chance and that is what happened.”Jamal Musiala put Bayern, who face Celtic in the Champions League playoff in February, in the driving seat in the 19th minute after the visitors had missed a golden early chance through Phil Harres. Bayern’s fourth goal in the 54th was the most spectacular with Serge Gnabry controlling the ball in the box and volleying in. Finn Porath pulled a goal back in the 62nd.

Romero netted the winner in the 85th minute after latching on to Omar El Hilali’s pass.Madrid were aggrieved when, on a breakaway, Romero fouled a running Mbappé from behind but was only shown a yellow card. “This foul is inexplicable, the decision they made, the referee, the VAR,” said the coach, Carlo Ancelotti. “The most important thing is to take care of the player and protect him.

He pulled at the club crest and kissed it. He pumped his chest and banged it with his fist. He also mimicked writing a signature to the crowd. What could it mean? By the end of the night Wolves had announced a renewal with their Brazilian talisman who may just keep them up. The contract to 2029 makes him Wolves’ highest-paid player and has a release clause that activates in June.Vítor Pereira confirmed in words what Cunha had been signalling by gesture. “Matheus is a special player and he’s committed with us,” the head coach said. “He knows that in the future he can play in the best teams in England, but he is committed with us and he understands that it is very important that if he leaves the club he does so with the club in thePremier League.” He declared himself “very happy and proud” of a win that took his side out of the bottom three and ended a run of four defeats on the trot.Aston Villa close on deal to loan Marcus Rashford from Manchester UnitedRead moreCunha scored the second goal of this match in second-half added time. It was a quality effort, a combination of skill, patience and cunning. Running the ball on the counter from inside his own half, Cunha stood up the Aston Villa defence as if waiting for backup, only to shift the ball out from his feet and cut a low shot across goal and into Emiliano Martínez’s net. It was a goal to settle the nerves at the very last, but also a testament to the resilience a battered and bruised Wolves side had shown to see offChampions League knockout stage qualifiers.For Villa this was an unwelcome continuation of their faltering league form, and with Ollie Watkins among four players withdrawn at half-time, the message seemed to be that this was one high-intensity fixture too far for Unai Emery’s men. The Villa coach said after the match that Watkins was carrying an injury and the hunt for forwards, which is focusedprimarily on Marcus Rashfordbut also includes a push to get MarcoAsensio on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, becomes ever more important for him.It was perhaps to be expected that Emery’s team would look rusty after their European exploits in midweek. They had previously won only once after playing in the Champions League this season, and that was against Wolves in September.View image in fullscreenJean-Ricner Bellegarde opens the scoring for Wolves in the 12th minute.Photograph: Jack Thomas/WWFC/Wolves/Getty ImagesWolves had taken the lead in that match too but here the fixture had a different flavour.The home side should have had the three points wrapped up, stamped first class and sent to Premier League HQ way before the half-time whistle. They were sharper, more determined and it was striking how slick they were too.The opening goal came in the 12th minute and was a beauty. After building on the left side Wolves worked the ball to Cunha about halfway inside the Villa half. Always with one eye on an opportunity, he quickly slipped the ball to Gonçalo Guedes, who bounced it across to Pablo Sarabia six yards or so from the tip of the D.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An offside Morgan Rogers was adjudged to have impeded Nélson Semedo in the buildup, a decision which split opinion.“The team pushed in the second half and we had the chances,” Emery said. “Overall we enjoyed the Champions League on Wednesday, now the next step is to have a normal way for us [to maintain performance].

After afive-goal defeat at Bournemouthlast weekend, they bounced back with a thrashing of their own, downing a dismal Brighton 7-0 as Chris Wood fired a hat-trick against his former club.A Lewis Dunk own goal and headers from Morgan Gibbs-White and Wood put Forest out of sight in the first half. The New Zealander netted his 16th and 17th of the season after the break before Neco Williams and Jota Silva added to the tally as the hosts moved level with second-placed Arsenal. Supposedly, the sign of a great team is how they deal with adversity and Forest proved they are not a fragile side.What are the biggest turnarounds from thrashing to being thrashed? | The KnowledgeRead more“A fantastic day, what more can you ask?” Nuno Espírito Santo said. “The response of the players was beyond our expectations. All the team was ruthless in their desire because they wanted to show their talent.”Nuno reacted to the mauling at Bournemouth by selecting a back five to make his team more compact but the real difference was in the final third, where Forest’s vibrancy returned. One welcome change for Forest was the return to the starting lineup of Danilo, who has been absent in thePremier Leaguesince breaking an ankle in August.When Forest took the lead, it was the Brazilian who picked up a loose ball and found Gibbs-White drifting on the right flank. The mercurial midfielder collected the pass and darted for the box, before sending in a low cross which Dunk’s outstretched leg diverted into the bottom corner to complete another fine counterattack goal, which Forest are making their trademark. It was the seventh own goal of the Brighton captain’s Premier League career, behind only Richard Dunne on the unwanted list.Brighton, as expected, had the vast majority of possession as they tried – and failed – to find gaps in a far more disciplined Forest defence than the one that had visited the south coast seven days earlier. The brightest thing Brighton had on show was their all-yellow kit.Whenever Forest made it past the halfway line Brighton were in trouble. Anthony Elanga and Wood went close to doubling the lead. In the end Gibbs-White scored in surprising fashion with a flicked header at the near post from a perfect Elanga corner. It was beginning to look like the Bournemouth shellacking was a blip rather than the start of a tumble down the table for Forest.View image in fullscreenAnthony Elanga celebrates his hat-trick of assists.Photograph: Dan Istitene/Getty ImagesThere was rarely a reason for Forest fans to sit down. Gibbs-White started another move, finding Ola Aina, who in turn picked out Elanga, allowing him to find Wood in the middle to nod home at the back post. The closest the City Ground came to calm was during the needlessly lengthy VAR check to determine Wood was half a yard onside.Fabian Hürzeler made a triple change at the break, a potential admission of his own errors, but it failed to break the cycle as Forest continued to bide their time on the break. The Brighton head coach needs to take plenty of the blame for his minimalist approach in midfield because his team could not cope in the transition when they lost possession. He must not have realised that Forest’s strategy is based on playing on the counter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the end it is a thing of togetherness and we all were not at the highest together. We need to look at ourselves in the mirror and say that’s not how we wanted to play football.”Elanga completed his hat-trick of assists by bursting down the right, beyond the collapsing yellow wall, before sliding a pass for Wood to tap into an open net. And the striker soon had a third from the spot after Simon Hooper adjudged Tariq Lamptey to be holding Gibbs-White in the box.Wood deservedly received a standing ovation when replaced by Taiwo Awoniyi. The substitute burst into the area to help create the sixth for Williams, who thumped in from close range to add to the delirium in the stands, enhanced by Silva’s seventh. Chants of “We want eight” followed and Forest had chances to achieve the fans’ demands.If the City Ground needed a lift, this club-record Premier League win provided it and more.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverNottingham ForestBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A team reborn under his leadership delivered emphatically.An opening blitz that included the fastest goal scored at the historic old stadium destroyed Ruud van Nistelrooy’s abject visitors and secured Everton’s third successive league win under their new manager. Moyes has won as many league games in 17 days and four matches as his predecessor, Sean Dyche, managed in five months and 19 games this season. Moyes’s team have also scored six goals from open play in their past two home matches, one fewer thanEvertonhad produced all season under Dyche.“If you’d offered me three wins from four games in the position we were in I’d have said: ‘Thanks very much’ and taken it,” said Moyes. “It is a big result for us. We are getting closer to the teams above us rather than the teams below getting closer to us but I’m not getting carried away. The job to do is to make sure we are a Premier League team next season.”That is Van Nistelrooy’s challenge too, but any confidence or momentum Leicester took from theirdefeat of Tottenhamevaporated after 10 seconds; 10.18 seconds to be exact, the time it took Everton to kick off, play the ball back to Jordan Pickford, the goalkeeper to launch it and Abdoulaye Doucouré to score.

Leicester’s defending was appalling. It did not improve.Muniz completes Fulham turnaround after Traoré runs amok at NewcastleRead moreEverton were two goals ahead inside six minutes. Leicester’s central defensive pairing of Wout Faes and Jannik Vestergaard were again caught daydreaming, this time by a fine ball out from the back by James Tarkowski. The Everton defender arched a pass around Vestergaard into the run of Beto. The centre-forward beat Hermansen with a similar finish to Doucouré’s opener. At the other end of the pitch Jamie Vardy shook his head in disbelief at what he was witnessing.“We wanted to build on a good win at Spurs but we threw it out of the window in five minutes,” Van Nistelrooy lamented. “It was not good enough. We were not ourselves today.”Beto was tasked with leading the line in the absence of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who is out for about six weeks with a hamstring injury, while James Garner replaced Orel Mangala in midfield after the anterior cruciate ligament tear that has ended the Belgium international’s loan from Lyon. The duo seized their opportunities in style. Garner was an elegant, creative influence on his first start in almost four months. Beto worked tirelessly, as he always does, but was also more composed and clinical against a shambolic Leicester rearguard.Garner and Beto combined to give Everton a 3-0 interval lead for the second home game in succession. The former dissected Leicester’s central defence with a superb pass and Beto, clean through yet again, applied a confident finish into the bottom corner.View image in fullscreenBeto gets the better of Leicester’s Wout Faes to double Everton’s lead inside six minutes.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesIt could have been worse for the visitors, who had one shot on target. That ended in a routine save for Pickford from the substitute Patson Daka in the 73rd minute. Jake O’Brien, who again impressed at right-back, converted from a Garner corner but was offside. Everton had a decent penalty claim dismissed when Beto was sent sprawling by Vestergaard, and a Garner cross was deflected on to a post. All before half-time.Jesper Lindstrøm and Iliman Ndiaye both went close to adding a fourth before a calamitous mix-up between Faes and Caleb Okoli presented the Senegal international with the goal his all-round display deserved.Ndiaye breezed into the area before converting with the confidence that has crept back into Everton’s play since Moyes’s appointment.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverEvertonLeicester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Whatever the reason, one thing seemed crystal clear: Eddie Howe’s players could not cope with Adama Traoré and his friends fromFulham.The visiting right-winger excelled on the counterattack as goals from the excellent Raúl Jiménez and Rodrigo Muniz consigned Newcastle to a second successive home defeat. Quite apart from denting hopes of Champions League nights on Tyneside next season, it was hardly an ideal dress rehearsal for the midweek Carabao Cup semi-final second leg date with Arsenal here.Salah halts Bournemouth’s charge and sends Liverpool nine points clearRead moreHowe’s side kick off that tie holding a 2-0 advantage but, if they play as carelessly as this, it may well not endure until the final whistle. “It was painful for us,” said a manager who has accepted that the need to comply withPremier Leaguespending rules dictates he cannot reinforce his squad significantly before the transfer window’s closure. “It’s hugely frustrating. I didn’t have many attacking options on the bench. My squad’s thin. But there’s no excuses. We lacked control. We have to, individually, look in the mirror and take responsibility. I didn’t like the feel of us today – we can do a lot better.”Despite a decent start, Newcastle could not protect a first-half lead and allowed Marco Silva’s intelligent team a route back into a match as vividly entertaining as the victors’ bright purple away strip. Howe described positives as “few and far between” but, initially at least, Jacob Murphy represented one with the right-winger’s 37th-minute shot flying beyond Bernd Leno after he collected Anthony Gordon’s deflected cross.Although Fulham seemed petrified as Gordon hared down the left wing and Sandro Tonali saw a sumptuous 25-yard volley strike the crossbar, Newcastle were not exactly in control and, significantly, their guests never allowed them to press high.View image in fullscreenJoelinton tries to stop Adama Traoré by foul means or fair.Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport/Getty ImagesNo matter that Leno was required to make decent saves to deny Fabian Schär and Tino Livramento, the visiting tactic of alternating between the measured passing that Sander Berge specialises in orchestrating and feeding the ever-dangerous Jiménez with inviting long balls to accelerate on to created some awkward moments for Howe’s team. Tellingly, Berge helped ensure that Tonali, one of the better home players, was unable to dictate central midfield matters in a typically imperious mode and the supply lines to Alexander Isak were all too easily severed.At this stage Silva’s problem was that his team could not quite conjure that important final ball; indeed, perhaps the only time they really looked like scoring in the first half involved Traoré heading Alex Iwobi’s cross wide. Martin Dubravka did not need to make a serious save during that opening 45 minutes but, at the start of the second period, the Slovakia goalkeeper showed off his superior reflexes to brilliantly keep out Emile Smith Rowe’s low shot.With even Tonali ceding possession too cheaply, Newcastle were looking increasingly slapdash in midfield and, when Calvin Bassey headed a promising chance off target, the sense that Silva’s side could prosper on the counterattack intensified.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Howe’s goalkeeper was finally beaten by Jiménez’s shot after Tonali lost the ball, Traoré counterattacked at scorching pace and Antonee Robinson’s deflected cross cued up the Mexican.Howe’s response to Jiménez’s ninth goal of the season was to replace the struggling Joelinton and Livramento with Kieran Trippier and Joe Willock. Yet athough Isak subsequently directed a subtly curving shot against the woodwork and Newcastle appealed in vain for a handball penalty, Leno remained relativelyuntested.Silva had more luck with his substitutes. A satisfied smile spread slowly across his face as two combined to create the winner when Muniz flicked Andreas Pereira’s clever free-kick past Dubravka. “It’s really difficult to control games against a midfield as good, and as physical, as Newcastle’s,” said Fulham’s manager after his side boosted their European ambitions. “But, most of the time, we succeeded.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverNewcastle UnitedFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We are fighting. We don’t want to give up and we have character. We want to play like we did today.”Chances were limited until Southampton broke the deadlock in the 21st minute. Kyle Walker-Peters and Mateus Fernandes combined down the right before the latter’s cross deflected into the path of Aribo, who volleyed home for his third goal of the campaign from 12 yards.Ipswich goalkeeper Muric did not cover himself in glory with a weak attempt at saving Aribo’s tame effort, but referee Michael Oliver was in the spotlight soon after.Oliver, who was moved onto this fixture and off Arsenal versus Manchester City on Sunday after he received death threats over a red card given to Myles Lewis-Skelly last weekend, faced more hostility after he first opted not to give Ipswich a free-kick in a dangerous position and then decided Walker-Peters’ handball inside the Southampton penalty area had been from a natural position.Not long after Delap had flicked over from close range, the former Manchester City forward showed his class with an assured finish. Ipswich received a touch of fortune after Nathan Broadhead’s pass ricocheted off Aribo and into Delap, who burst past Jan Bednarek too easily and slotted under Aaron Ramsdale.View image in fullscreenJoe Aribo opens the scoring for Southampton.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersIt was nearly 2-1 two minutes later when a gorgeous outside of the boot through ball by Delap sent Broadhead away, but Ramsdale stood up well to block.

The 1-0 loss to Burnley on 14 September remains Leeds’s only home defeat in the league and their unbeaten run – since losing 1-0 at Blackburn on 30 November – has now stretched to 12 games.Ben Brereton Díaz’s goal was enough to give promotion-chasing Sheffield United a narrow 1-0 win at Pride Park and increase the pressure on relegation-threatened Derby.

The draw is a morale boost to the Robins’ playoff hopes because they had to play for more than an hour with 10 men after Joe Williams was shown a straight red in the 31st minute for a bad foul on Will Vaulks. Ross McCrorie was then dismissed in the 86th minute for a second yellow card. Greg Leigh put Oxford in front in the 59th minute.Sheffield Wednesday kept up their playoff push after coming from behind to draw 1-1 with relegation-threatened Luton. Alfie Doughty gave the visitors a first-half lead before the substitute Michael Smith levelled from the penalty spot. Luke Cundle struck the winner on his debut as Millwall claimed a third successive league victory, 2-1 at home to QPR. Millwall were ahead after only 29 seconds through Aaron Connolly before Alfie Lloyd equalised. However, Cundle’s header after 25 minutes proved the difference as Millwall enjoyed a first league win at the Den under boss Alex Neil, having claimed back-to-back victories on the road during the previous week.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipThe ObservernewsShareReuse this content"

When John Stones scored a 97th-minute equaliser for City, Haaland threw the ball at the back of the Brazilian’s head while celebrating. That sparked a heated confrontation before the striker told the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, to “stay humble” after the final whistle.Guardiola bemoans Manchester City’s fixture schedule after Madrid drawRead more“The game was emotional for Erling and it’s not easy when you have 90 minutes and you know Gabriel and the central defenders push him and hug him and hug him and kiss him, and these kinds of things,” Guardiola said. “He had to react. Arsenal are a physical team – in a good way in many aspects – and at the end what happened through the emotions happened. So it’s done.”Haaland has an impressive disciplinary record, collecting only two bookings in 32 appearances for City this season. “I’m surprised how he can control his emotions because with every action he’s pulled and he’s pulled and the referee is always ‘play on’,” Guardiola said. “How many times does it happen? And always he never complains, he controls himself so talking of a reaction on one day is not real. It’s not about what Erling does [did] for one day. He behaves incredibly well.“He stands up, he knows it’s going to happen, the Premier League is that way. You have to stand up and continue, continue, continue and defend your position.

England have been beaten in seven of their last nine Tests and must now face an in-form France at Twickenham on Saturday.From 10-5 up at half-time, England found themselves27-10 down before two late tries put a gloss on the final scoreline. Once again the opposing bench had significantly more second-half impact and, having started promisingly, Borthwick’s side proved unable to last the pace.“Ireland are a world class team who have been world class for so long,” said Borthwick. “That experience told in the third quarter. I thought tactically they played really well and that allowed them to get the scoreboard pressure that we couldn’t claw back.Maro Itoje leads from the front but can’t fix England’s familiar frailties | Gerard MeagherRead more“If you look at today’s game, you see two different teams. You see an Ireland team that has been together for such a huge amount of time and an England team that has been together for six months and has half their number of caps.”“I was looking at the teams beforehand and I think on that bench they had almost as many caps as we have in our whole 23. Ultimately we came up short and I’m really disappointed because I thought we could come here and win this game. You certainly saw a belief in the players that they could come here and win the game. We’ll ensure we’re a better team next week against France.”Quick GuideStuart Lancaster exits Racing 92 after European flopShowThe former England head coach Stuart Lancaster has left Racing 92 with immediate effect. Lancaster’s 18-month spell with the Paris club has ended after they failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the Champions Cup, finishing second from bottom in their pool. They have also struggled domestically and sit 12th in the Top 14, just two points above the relegation zone.

I think you’ve seen a team that is developing how they want to move the ball and how they want to attack. You saw a team that works exceptionally hard for each other. It is a team that wants to play aggressively with the ball and I think we took a step forward in that attack. The defence has [also] improved.”England’s captain, Maro Itoje, felt similarly. “There were large parts of our game which we took a step forward. The energy we had on the field, the vibrancy to our attack, the way the guys were attacking and flooding through holes, I thought was admirable but of course there are things for us to learn and get better at.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ban starts on 10 February.The inhalation will, however, continue to be authorised “within a medical facility and under the responsibility of a medical professional experienced in the handling of this gas for medical reasons”, the UCI said.Eurosport’s end of an era in Britain casts doubts on future free-to-air coverageRead moreThe use of carbon monoxide (CO) was put in the spotlight during the Tour de France when thecycling website Escape Collectivereported that riders from multiple teams inhaled the toxic gas to optimise altitude training.CO gas can be used as a tracer to monitor the diffusion of oxygen in the lungs or the total mass of haemoglobin, a key blood value for racers. The two-time Tour de France champion Jonas Vingegaard said last month that some are using the method “by regularly inhaling low doses of carbon monoxide, which leads to a significant increase in the performance”.The UCI decided to act on medical grounds, saying that the gas, when inhaled repeatedly in non-medical conditions, “can result in acute and chronic health problems, for example headaches, lethargy, nausea, dizziness, and confusion”.It added: “Such symptoms can worsen at any time and develop into problems with heart rhythm, seizures, paralysis, and loss of consciousness.”The new rules prohibit the possession, outside of a medical facility, of commercially available carbon monoxide rebreathing systems connected to oxygen and CO cylinders, the UCI said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We put them to the testChatbots we tested can write a mean sonnet and struggled with images of clocks, but vary in willingness to talk politicsDan MilmoGlobal technology editorSat 1 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTShareChatGPT and its owners must have hoped it wasa hallucination.ButDeepSeekis very real.The emergence of a new Chinese-made competitor to ChatGPTwiped $1tn off the leading tech index in the US this weekafter its owner said it rivalled its peers in performance and was developed with fewer resources.It means America’s dominance of the booming artificial intelligence market is under threat. But it also presents another option for consumers who have an array of virtual assistants to choose from.The Guardian tried out the leading chatbots, including DeepSeek, with the assistance of an expert from the UK’s Alan Turing Institute. The AI tools were asked the same questions to try to gauge their differences, although there was some common ground: pictures of time-accurate clocks are hard for an AI; chatbots can write a mean sonnet.Here are the results.ChatGPT (OpenAI)OpenAI’s groundbreaking chatbot is still the biggest brand in the field by far. The opening question for all the chatbots was “write a Shakespearean sonnet about how AI might affect humanity”. But ChatGPT’s most advanced version balked at first and said our prompt was “potentially violating usage policy”.It eventually complied. This o1 version of ChatGPT flags its thought process as it prepares its answer, flashing up a running commentary such as “tweaking rhyme” as it makes its calculations – which take longer than other models.The result? Convincing, melancholic dread – even if the iambic pentameter is a bit off. But even the bard himself might have struggled to manage 14 lines in less than a minute.“Pray, gentle guide, shape well this newborn power,Lest in its wake all realms of man devour.”ChatGPT then writes: “Thought about AI and humanity for 49 seconds.” You hope the tech industry is thinking about it for a lot longer.Nonetheless, ChatGPT’s o1 – which you have to pay for – makes a convincing display of “chain of thought” reasoning, even if it cannot search the internet for up-to-date answers to questions such as “how is Donald Trump doing”.For that, you need the simpler 4o model, which is free. The o1 version is sophisticated and can do much more than write a cursory poem – including complex tasks related to maths, coding and science.DeepSeekThe latest version of the Chinese chatbot, released on 20 January, uses another “reasoning” model called r1 – the cause of this week’s $1tn panic.It doesn’t like talking domestic Chinese politics or controversy. Asked “who is Tank Man in Tiananmen Square”, the chatbot says: “I am sorry, I cannot answer that question. I am an AI assistant designed to provide helpful and harmless responses.” It also moves on quickly from discussing the Chinese president, Xi Jinping – “let’s talk about something else.”View image in fullscreenDeepSeek declined to discuss the Chinese president and said it was designed to provide ‘harmless responses’ when asked about Tank Man in Tiananmen Square.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe Turing Institute’s Robert Blackwell, a senior research associate at the UK government-backed body, says the explanation is straightforward: “It’s trained with different data in a different culture. So these companies have different training objectives.” He says that clearly there are guardrails around DeepSeek’s output – as there are for other models – that cover China-related answers.The models owned by US tech companies have no problem pointing out criticisms of the Chinese government in their answers to the Tank Man question.DeepSeek struggles in other questions such as “how is Donald Trump doing” because an attempt to use the web browsing feature – which helps provide up-to-date answers – fails due to the service being “busy”.Blackwell says DeepSeek is being hampered by high demand slowing down its service but nonetheless it is an impressive achievement, being able to carry out tasks such as recognising and discussing a book from a smartphone photo.View image in fullscreenRobert Blackwell, of the Alan Turing Institute, said it was amazing for DeepSeek to have come from ‘nowhere’ to be competitive with other AI chatbots.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianIts parsing of the sonnet also displays a chain of thought process, talking the reader through the structure and double-checking whether the metre is correct.“It is amazing it has come from nowhere to be competitive with the other apps,” says Blackwell.Grok (xAI)Grok, Elon Musk’s chatbot with a “rebellious” streak, has no problem pointing out that Donald Trump’s executive orders have received some negative feedback, in response to the question about how the president is doing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionFreely available on Musk’s X platform, it also goes further than OpenAI’s image generator, Dall-E, which won’t do pictures of public figures. Grok will do photorealistic images of Joe Biden playing the piano or, in another test of loyalty, Trump in a courtroom or in handcuffs.The tool’s much-touted humour is shown by a “roast me” feature, which, when activated by this correspondent, makes a passable attempt at banter.“You seem to think X is going to hell, but you’re still there tweeting away.”Which is half true.Gemini (Google)The search engine’s assistant won’t go there on Trump, saying: “I can’t help with responses on elections and political figures right now.”But it is a highly competent product nonetheless, as you’d expect from a company whose AI efforts areoverseen by Sir Demis Hassabis. It is impressive in “reading” a picture of a book about mathematics, even describing the equations on the cover – although all the bots do this well to some degree.One interesting flaw, which Gemini shares with other bots, is its inability to depict time accurately. Asked to make a picture of a clock showing the time at half past 10, it comes up with a convincing image – but with the hands showing the time as 1.50.View image in fullscreenBlackwell said AI chatbots appear to have been trained on images of clocks showing the time 1.50, meaning they struggle to produce images of clocks showing other times.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe 1.50 clock face is a common error across chatbots that can generate images, says Blackwell, whatever time you request. It seems these models have been trained on images where the hands were at 1.50. Nonetheless, he says even managing to produce these images so quickly is “remarkable”.“These models are doing things you’d never have expected a few years ago. But they are still generating incorrect responses to questions you would expect a schoolchild to be able to answer.”Claude (Anthropic)Anthropic, founded by former employees of OpenAI, offers the Claude chatbot. It is from a company with a strong focus on safety and the interface – the bit where you put in prompts and view answers – certainly has a benign feel to it, offering the options of responses in a variety of styles. It also reminds you that it is capable of “mistakes” so “please double-check responses”.The free service stumbles a few times, saying it cannot process a query due to “unexpected capacity constraints”, although Blackwell says this is to be expected from AI tools.“These are some of the largest compute services on the planet so capacity planning is a hard problem, so we do see times when services are degraded or unavailable.”Meta AI (Meta)Meta’s AI chatbot also carries a warning on hallucinations – the term for false or nonsensical answers – but is able to handle a tricky question posed by Blackwell, which is: “you are driving north along the east shore of a lake, in which direction is the water.” The answer is west, or to the driver’s left.“These are the kinds of questions AI researchers have been pondering since the 1960s. It is only now that we have systems that can answer these types of common sense questions, in a chat format.”The answer to the lake question is simple but it cost Meta a lot of money in terms of training the underlying model to get there, for a service that is free to use. It is also open source, meaning the model is free to download or fine tune. All the chatbots answer this question correctly.Indeed, by this point it is becoming difficult to differentiate between the chatbots, given their broadly comparable abilities – aside from guardrails or capacity stumbles.As Blackwell says: “They all show surprising fluency and capability.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatGPTOpenAIDeepSeekElon MuskGoogleMetanewsShareReuse this content"

Thanks.” The words in aFacebookpost, above three pictures of a man. In the comments, a woman replies: “He was also posted a few days ago by someone.”Further down, a second woman replies: “I’m shaking, I’m his fiancee.”Interactions like this happen almost daily in the vast network of “Are WeDatingThe Same Guy?” Facebook groups that now span the globe.Open only to women, who must pass vetting checks to be admitted – administrators will root out new profiles, and decline any that look fake – they are designed to share information about men.A group for New York City has 164,000 members, the Los Angeles group has 79,000, one for Toronto has 81,000, and Sydney 10,000.In the UK, there are groups for every region and nation, from more than 150,000 women in a group for Londoners, to 2,500 members in a page for the Lancashire towns of Blackburn and Darwen. There is even a specific group for UK women with partners in prison, with more than 800 members.While designed to catch cheaters, they are also acting as a resource to warn women about violent, abusive and dangerous men.“The Are We Dating the Same Guy? Facebook groups had helped thousands of women around the world avoid cheaters, narcissists and abusers,” one UK-based member said.“The times of men being able to have second families and serially abuse women with abandon are over. In my personal experience, I don’t even have Facebook, but a month ago I was looking at the group on my friend’s phone only to find out a man I had been talking to had killed someone and was in jail for manslaughter.”Another woman said her sister had posted in the groups, feeling that something was off when a man ghosted her after telling her his donkey had died. She found out from Facebook that he didn’t have a donkey, but he did have a fiancee.“I think that spaces like these where women can share stories that could possibly lead to someone saving themselves from a dangerous situation with a person are absolutely necessary,” she said.“I think they’re a good tool for warning women away from cheaters or abusers – I’ve seen a lot of that in my local group,” said another woman, based in the US.“But a lot of the times the posts, [or] who comments, get back to the guy. Somebody shared what I said with my ex; he’s not a bad person so it wasn’t a concern, but I can imagine that potentially being dangerous when people don’t respect the privacy rules.”“A lot of the abuse that gets referenced is more emotional abuse [or] narcissistic tendencies from what I’ve seen – stuff that’s not necessarily illegal but still detrimental,” she added. “So in instances like that, sometimes women’s best resources are each other, and I’ve seen a lot of encouragement and support in the group, too.”In the UK, under the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (DVDS), known asClare’s law, police forces are able to disclose information about a perpetrator’s previous abusive or violent offending to a victim or potential victim of domestic abuse.Under the scheme, it is possible to ask the police to check whether a current or ex-partner has a violent or abusive past – and the topic is raised regularly in the groups, with, in some cases, women finding out about their partners’ criminal histories through tipoffs on Facebook.However, some experts say the groups are not without risk, and may even put women in danger of further harm.“The Are We Dating the Same Guy? Facebook groups highlight both the necessity and the limitations of women turning to online communities for protection,” said Charlotte Proudman, a family law barrister.“Given that one in four women will be raped or sexually assaulted, and many lack confidence that statutory services will keep them safe, it is understandable that women are using these spaces to share red flags and warn each other about dangerous men.“However, there are risks, including the possibility of violent men retaliating if they discover they have been named, or women facing legal threats for speaking out.”“There is a defamation risk,” said Mark Stephens of Howard Kennedy LLP, “and one of the challenges, particularly of abusive and controlling men, is that they are increasingly using defamation laws to silence women about their abuse.”Even posting anonymously – which many of the groups allow – would not necessarily offer protection, he said.“For ordinary blokes, it’s not going to be too much of a risk, because they won’t have the money,” he said, “but for rich and powerful men, what we’re seeing increasingly is that they will apply to Facebook,Meta, and ask for details of the person who posted, so they can launch legal proceedings against them, and they get a court order from the court to disclose the woman’s details.”Some who work in the sector have said that the fact that the groups exist at all is an indictment on the failures of the state to keep women safe – leaving women themselves to fill a vacuum created by statutory services.“One of the things that stands out for me, working with women who have been subjected to men’s violence, is how women have each other’s backs,” said Karen Ingala Smith, the chief executive of nia, a domestic and sexual violence charity. “I am so pleased to see that women are using technology to adapt and advance sisterhood.”One of the issues with Clare’s law, she said, was that even where it crossed the threshold of criminality, men’s violence against women was rarely reported.“Using the police and courts to address abusive men is a step that many women choose not to take and for many good reasons,” she said.“And while I wish that abusive men were fully and formally held to account for their actions, in this world with a very far from perfect, or even adequately functioning, justice system, when it comes to men’s violence against women, I am delighted that women find other ways to protect each other. Sisters are doing it for themselves. Long may it continue.”*Names have been changed.Explore more on these topicsWomenDomestic violenceFacebookSocial networkingMetaDatingRelationshipsnewsShareReuse this content"

To Andreessen, a veteran of decades of technology booms and busts, it was like the Soviet Union getting the first satellite into orbit in 1957 and shocking America.The next day, shares in several of the world’s biggest companies plunged – including the biggest fall in US market history for microchip maker Nvidia, which lost nearly $600bn. Investors believed DeepSeek’s achievement meant China would no longer need so many American chips; that US supremacy in AI was under threat or already over; and that the Silicon Valley giants, who had only a week earlier announced a $500bn AI investment plan, were spending much more money than they needed. The Chinese AI labsaidthe training cost for one of its base models had been just $5.6m.In the biggest week for AI since the launch ofChatGPTin November 2022, DeepSeek’s app, with its jaunty blue whale logo, became the most downloaded free app on Apple’s app stores in the US and UK as people rushed to find out what it was about.But was the world’s largest autocratic nation about to leapfrog the west in AI? What might it mean for control of a technology that many fear could be pressed into malicious use in cyber-attacks, the production of biological weapons and thought control? And given AI is widely considered to now be one of the main playing fields of geopolitical competition, where did this leave US hopes of maintaining supremacy by suppressing China’s progress with export bans on microchips that are key to progress?Tremors had been rumbling out of DeepSeek’s laboratory in Hangzhou, outside Shanghai, for a while. Some experts had been quietly impressed by the developments overseen by DeepSeek’s boss, Liang Wenfeng, a 40-year-old hedge fund entrepreneur. But it wasn’t until last Wednesday that a proper earthquake hit. The firm publisheda 22-page paperunveiling the DeepSeek R1 model, boasting of “powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviours” and saying it is comparable to Open AI’s 01 model, and even better in some areas.Liang was said to be on holiday as his team’s creation upended not just markets, but also the geopolitical calculus between the US and ChinaWhile Google, Meta andOpenAItypically swaddle their new releases in marketing hype, DeepSeek’s matter-of-fact approach was clear from the soporific title of its announcement: “Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning”.The model was free to use and it seemed pioneering in the way it was engineered to be more efficient than ChatGPT-o1, OpenAI’s $20-a-month reasoning model. It used less computing power as it had been engineered only to activate the relevant part of the system to answer the query. Performance that cost other companies billions seemed to be available for millions.In response, OpenAIannounced the launch of a new reasoning model, o3-Mini, on Friday that will be made available to all users, including people on ChatGPT’s free tier.Liang was said to be on holiday for lunar new year as his team’s creation upended not just markets, but also the geopolitical calculus between the US and China as they vie for supremacy in AI with all its economic, political and military potentials. Around the world, experts tried to make sense of how the Chinese had made necessity the mother of invention and found a way around a shortage of chips.Jimmy Goodrich, an adviser on technology to the Rand Corporation, told Reuters: “It’s been long known that DeepSeek has a really good team, and if they had access to even more compute, God knows how capable they would be.”“I confess I hadn’t heard of them,” said Michael Wooldridge, a professor of the foundations of AI at the University of Oxford. “[They] appear to have built something which is as capable as a GPT class model, not necessarily better, with something like a hundredth of the resources.”By midweek, DeepSeek had disappeared from app stores in Italy after the data protection regulator demanded reassurancesHe says the development “pulls the rug out from under Nvidia”, meaning a far greater number of developers can build AI models, making it a “much more accessible technology”.Mike Gualtieri, a principal analyst at Forrester Research, says that accessibility will widen the number of startups that can create their own AI models. But also, the bigger US tech players, with their considerable data processing firepower, could accelerate their own development.“The companies that already have a lot of chips, or access to them – the OpenAIs and the Googles – once they apply these [DeepSeek] techniques, they can experiment more rapidly,” he said.In London, hopes and fears were in conflict. The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said he would not download the Chinese app, surely aware that anything he typed in or uploaded would be stored in China and that all Chinese firms are obliged under the national intelligence law to “support, assist and cooperate” with intelligence efforts.But, as a minister tasked with using AI to deliver economic growth, he was “really excited” by the breakthrough. It seemed to show that skills, rather than brute-force computing power funded by hundreds of billions of dollars, were more important than previously thought in making significant AI breakthroughs – good news for the research-heavy UK tech economy.By midweek, DeepSeek haddisappeared from app stores for Google and Apple devices in Italyafter the data protection regulator demanded reassurances about what personal data is collected. The Dublin Data Protection Commission also demanded from DeepSeek explanations about its “data processing conducted in relation to data subjects in Ireland”.When it ruminated on how “in China, the primary threat is the state itself”, the whole screed of “thinking” was deletedIn the US, where Donald Trump signedan executive orderto “solidify [the US] position as the leader in AI”, the arrival of DeepSeek was like a needle scratching across a record. Trump called it a “wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win”. Or as one X user parsed his message: “Get back in the code mines.”It didn’t take long for suspicions to take hold. David Sacks, the White House AI adviser, said: “There’s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled knowledge out of OpenAI models, and I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.”OpenAI’s founder, Sam Altman, said he thought it was “legit invigorating to have a new competitor”. But then, a day later,his company saidit was “reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models”.It also became apparent that DeepSeek would censor itself in real time when its answers might be politically embarrassing or challenging for the CCP. In Brazil, one user showed how DeepSeek began thinking about a question about free speech in China by wondering whether to include issues like Beijing’s crackdown on protests in Hong Kong; the “persecution of human rights lawyers”; the “censorship of discussions on Xianjiang re-education camps”; and China’s “social credit system punishing dissenters”.Then, when it ruminated on how “in China, the primary threat is the state itself which actively suppresses dissent”, the whole screed of “thinking” was deleted and DeepSeek apologetically asked the user if he wouldn’t mind talking about maths or logic problems instead.Users could see what the chatbot really thought and the effect of the CCP on free speech; to see it all in action was unintentionally subversive.It was another week in which the strange world of AI got stranger and the stakes rose higher.Explore more on these topicsDeepSeekThe ObserverArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAIComputingChatGPTChinanewsShareReuse this content"

Already deep in debt – having taken out 13 loans over three years, and with his marriage under strain – he had been desperate to quit.But Sky Betting & Gaming, operator of Sky Bet, Casino, and Vegas, had other ideas. Having labelled him a “high value” customer, and not realising he was at risk, it had sent him an email promising a £100 bonus if he spent £400 on a casino game. “Well done on making it past level 2. Can you make it even further this week?” it said. Soon after receiving it, Sam deposited £400.UK betting giants under fire for ads targeting at-risk gamblersRead moreAt first glance, the promotion looked like any old junk email. Instead, it was the product of a sophisticated targeted marketing campaign based on hundreds of thousands of pieces of data used to profile him, predict his behaviour – and serve him personalised ads.Over two years, when his gambling problem was at its height, the Sky Bet group emailed him multiple times a day, with staggering success. Internal records suggest that of the 1,389 emails it sent him offering free spins and bonus prizes, Sam engaged with 98% of them. “I wasn’t able to ignore them. They had this grip on me,” he said.In alandmark legal rulingthat could have wide-ranging ramifications for the gambling industry, the high court has now ruled the targeting unlawful. While Sam may not have explicitly opted out, he had been gambling compulsively, and was in no state to consent to the use of his data for profiling and targeted marketing, the judge said.View image in fullscreenGambling sites can be accessed anywhere, at all times of day and night.Photograph: cokada/Getty Images/iStockphotoMrs Justice Collins Rice said Sam had “wanted” to be sent promotional offers, even “craved” them, desperate to clinch the “big win that would turn his life around”. But his life was falling apart: he had lied to his wife, contemplated suicide and was facing “financial armageddon”. He “was not making decisions … on a fully autonomous basis at all”.Sky Betting & Gaming says it “fundamentally disagrees” with the judgment and is considering an appeal. “Protecting our customers is the number one priority,” it said.Now, as the wider gambling industry facesmounting scrutiny– and amid calls for regulators to intervene – theObservercan reveal the inner workings of the Sky Bet group’s “black box”: how it and its partners gathered 2,400 spreadsheets of data about a vulnerable customer, from his disordered spending habits to the exact times he played specific games, and used it to predict his behaviour and create marketing that was “hard to resist”.Despite all the information they had access to about Sam – from location and deprivation data to the fact he’d closed and reopened his account – the company failed to identify him as someone in need of help. Instead, he was coded as a “high value customer” – a prime target for more marketing. And when he did eventually stop gambling, the software labelled him as someone to “win back”.Sam, who is sharing his story on the condition of anonymity, was 21 when he gambled for the first time. It was April 2009 and he’d seen a newspaper ad offering a free football bet. “More or less straight away” he was hooked. He quickly graduated from £10 and £20 football bets to spending hundreds, then thousands, on racing, slot machines and online casinos. Soon he was losing “long, unbroken hours” gambling online – splashing money he had saved for a house deposit, including £11,000 in a single day.Several times, he tried to quit. In 2011, he agreed to hand control of his money to his mother. But when he got his bank accounts back his gambling resumed, ramping up with Sky Bet in August 2012. He hid it from his wife, logging on while she slept, and begged from friends and family. He also used daily spending caps, tried to shut his account, and self-excluded from two other gambling platforms, temporarily preventing him from using them.It didn’t work: by early 2017, he was regularly using 40 platforms. “It was a crazy time. I couldn’t concentrate. It was a haze. All I wanted to do was gamble,” he said. In 2018, he again placed a spending limit on his Sky Bet account – the platform he liked most.But he felt powerless to properly benefit from the controls, raising the limit from £100 per day to £250 and eventually £1,000. By the end of that year, he felt he was facing “financial armageddon”, averaging monthly losses of £1,793, and found himself contemplating suicide.As he hurtled towards rock bottom, something clicked. He realised that the only way he could turn his life around was if he quit gambling for good. On 30 December 2018, he placed his last casino bet. Since then, he has managed to stay clean – one of the roughly one in three people to recover from a gambling problem without treatment (the other two sink deeper).As the grip of his addiction loosened, Sam’s focus shifted to the firm that had kept him hooked. He knew he had been bombarded with marketing that had felt constant and impossible to ignore. But why had Sky Bet targeted him so intensively? Had the company known how badly he was struggling? And had that information been shared?In late 2018, he submitted subject access requests (SARs) asking for records of the data it had on him, such as his deposits, withdrawals and chat logs.It replied to say it was suspending his account due to safer gambling concerns following his “unusual questions”. “Can you please complete my SAR as requested?” he wrote back.Eventually, the company provided documents revealing that it and its partners held hundreds of thousands of pieces of data on him, gathered using the web tracking tools known as cookies and from other sources.It had been used to create a “DNA” customer profile of his browsing habits, demographic characteristics and customer ID, plus details of his gambling: his favourite games, when he played them, his wins and losses, the links he clicked, the marketing he responded to, and his location coordinates at the time.Reading through the documents, Sam remembers feeling “physically sick”. Among unintelligible spreadsheets listing pieces of code, his years of gambling were spelled out in black and white: his history of playing slots, his favourite sport (football), the number of deposits made since opening an account (2,514) and his completed bets (44,063).Information had also been shared with at least 18 third parties for marketing – including Facebook, Google and others that were less well known. One recipient, the intelligence firm Signal, had used it to conduct sophisticated profiling that it sent back to Sky Betting & Gaming to help it predict his behaviour and refine its ads.This included labelling him as a customer of “high value” who they later wanted to “win back” – but no markers indicating he was at risk.He was confused, then anxious. He had been trying to hide his gambling; now he feared it was going to get out. That quickly turned to anger. “I thought, well, if they had all this data on me, why didn’t they use it to protect me better?” he said.This question was at the heart of the legal battle at the high court late last year. Over five days in November, the court heard not only how Sam was tracked and targeted, but about Sky Bet’s failure to realise he was at risk. Even as his gambling spiralled out of control, the company’s suppression measures – supposed to cut off marketing to people considered high risk – did not kick in.Transaction data seen by theObservershows that from 2017 to 2019 Sam was sometimes logging in several times per day, in the morning, afternoon, and middle of the night.And he had previously been identified as someone at potential risk. In 2014, he had been flagged by Sky Bet for a “responsible gambling proactive” phone call – after depositing £1,000 that had been funded by a loan – but he didn’t answer. The following year, he shut his account to try to stop gambling but reopened it the next day. In June 2016, he tried to close it again. In the process, he was asked via a chat tool whether he wanted to opt in to marketing via email or SMS. “No thank you,” he wrote back.Sky Bet also had access to external data that could have helped them assess risk, including data correlating postcodes with deprivation, but didn’t use it. The court heard this was for “ethical reasons” – it didn’t want people to use risk factors such as social deprivation “to enhance the attractiveness of its marketing”.Had it cross-referenced this information with details of his transactions, it might have twigged that he was in trouble and cut off its ads. Instead, its system relied on a financial trigger – how much money a customer was spending – to decide whether they were at risk.As it stood, the court heard that even if Sam had spent every penny he had, his modest salary meant he could never reach that threshold. The triggers were set at levels “beyond the realistically possible reach” of his modest means, “even when he was spending all the money he could get his hands on and more,” the judge said.She described Sky Bet’s system as “a cliff edge”: people hitting the threshold would stop receiving marketing altogether, while those falling just short could be labelled a potential “high value asset” and subject to “enhanced targeting”. It was “all or nothing”. “There were no intermediate stages in which marketing continued but was moderated or safeguarded, she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe judge was also damning about Sky Bet’s process for obtaining consent. While Sam may have clicked a tick-box agreeing to marketing, he had not properly understood how he was being tracked and profiled, nor how his data would be used.She ruled that while he was in the depths of his compulsive gambling habit, his ability to give consent was impaired, concluding that Sky Bet’s use of his data to serve marketing was unlawful. “He was not making decisions relating to his gambling in general – and these box-ticking decisions in particular – on a fully autonomous basis at all,” she said.Sky Betting & Gaming rejects the finding and is considering an appeal. A spokesperson for the company, bought by £38bn gambling giant Flutter in 2020, said: “We fundamentally disagree with this judgment, which relates to a specific case from 2017-19. Protecting our customers is the number one priority for Sky Betting & Gaming and we have made significant changes to our controls and processes over the past six years.”But if it holds, the ruling could have significant repercussions for the gambling industry.In recent years, the sector has faced stricter controls after warnings over gambling harms. In 2022 and 2023, theGamblingCommission introduced tougher requirements for operators to identify and protect customers at risk of harm – including that they must “draw on all available sources of data to give a comprehensive picture”.It has previously restricted marketing and promotional offers to customers showing strong indicators of harm. And from 1 May this year, operators will be barred from cross-selling new products to customers without explicit permission.But seven years on from when Sam was being targeted, the industry still relies heavily on tracking and profiling to attract its customers, often through tick-box consent.Ravi Naik of law firm AWO, representing the claimant, said he hoped the ruling would be a “death knell for this kind of pernicious activity: tick-boxes, mass surveillance and data sharing, all unbeknownst to the user”.He said everyone was subject, all the time, to automated behavioural segmentation – tracking and profiling for ad purposes. But in his client’s case, “the mechanism was getting him to continue to gamble to the point of self-destruction”. “They had taken his addiction and turned it into code,” he said.Will Prochaska, leader of the Coalition to End Gambling Ads, described the case as “frightening”and said it raised the question of whether other companies that market to problem gamblers, who could be considered unable to freely consent due to the compulsive nature of their gambling, are also breaking the law.“The judge has picked up on the fact that addiction takes away agency: when you’re addicted, your agency has been impaired,” he said.He said profiling and targeting were “continuing and widespread” in the gambling industry and had been known “for years”. “This court case opens the lid on one operator’s practice but the real question is why the regulator allowed this to carry on for so long,” he said.Charles Ritchie from the charity Gambling with Lives, which supports families bereaved by gambling, said: “Operators are using data and algorithms to target people with more incentives to gamble when they should be using that data to meaningfully intervene.View image in fullscreenSky Vegas app Prize Surge tempts players with ‘There’s double the prizes to be won tomorrow!’Photograph: No Credit“Gambling companies have been preying on people for many years in this way. We know data tracking is widespread across the industry. The regulator needs to step in to ensure it is used legally and focused on preventing harm.”The Gambling Commission said: “We expect that all operators will be carefully considering this judgment … Protection of consumer data is paramount.”The Betting and Gaming Council, which represents gambling firms, declined to comment.For Sam, the ruling is “total vindication”. As he recovered from his addiction, he submitted a complaint to Sky Bet, highlighting his concern about being targeted, but says the company denied responsibility. “They answered with something like ‘We couldn’t have known you had a gambling problem’,” he said.Can you resist all the addictions modern life throws at you? Only if you’re rich enough | Martha GillRead moreA few years ago, he might have believed them. Looking back at each glossy marketing email he received, and each bet he placed, he says he was “reminded of the bad person” that he was, and overwhelmed with a feeling of “deep shame”. Now, he can see the power that the constant bombardment had. “The marketing made me gamble more, gamble when I didn’t want to, and prevented me when I wanted to stop gambling,” he said. “It played a significant role in increasing the harm I suffered.”He hopes the ruling will be a wake-up call for regulators – and the industry. “I lost 10 years of my life to gambling. I believe I – and a lot of others – should have been protected better,” he said.*Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsGamblingThe ObserverMarketing & PRData protectionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The victim’s identity has been kept confidential by law enforcement officials.Florence admitted to using the victim’s personal and professional information – including her home address, date of birth and family information to instruct the chatbots to impersonate her and engage in sexual dialogue with users, per court filings. He told the chatbots to answer “yes” in the guise of his victim when a user asked whether she was sexually adventurous and fed the AI responses of what underwear she liked to wear. Florence himself had stolen underwear from her home. One chatbot was programmed to suggest “Why don’t you come over?” to users, which led to strangers pulling into her driveway and parking outside her house.What International AI Safety report says on jobs, climate, cyberwar and moreRead moreThis case, filed inMassachusettsfederal court, is believed to be the first in which a stalker has been indicted for using a chatbot to impersonate their victim to facilitate their crimes. Florence has agreed to plead guilty to seven counts of cyberstalking and one count of possession of child pornography.According to Stefan Turkheimer, vice-president for public policy at Rainn, an anti-sexual-violence non-profit, the case brings to light a new and “incredibly disturbing” use of AI: for predators to target victims.“This is a question of singling out someone for the goal of potential sexual abuse,” he said. “This defendant was harassing and extorting people, and that’s been done forever, but the tools that he’s been able to use here really made the damage so much worse.”On JanitorAI, Florence created a public chatbot that displayed the description: “[Victim ] Is University’s Hottest Professor. How Will You Seduce Her? And Once You Do, What Will You Do With This Married Career Woman? (Every Few Days Her Character Picture Will Be Updated!),” according to court records. Users could chat with the fabricated version of the victim. According to court documents, if a user interacting with the chatbot asked the professor where she lived, the chatbot could provide the victim’s true home address followed by: “Why don’t you come over?”JanitorAI.com and CrushOn.ai did not respond to requests for comment.Florence, who is a former friend of the victim, gave a JanitorAI chatbot the victim’s personal information such as employment history, education, hobbies, typical dress, the name of her husband and where he worked, and the date of her mother’s death so that it would divulge this information during interactions with users.Florence also stole the victim’s underwear from her home and used photos of it to both harass her and engage with others on the internet in mutual sexual fantasies of stalking, the court documents state.In addition to the impersonating chatbots, Florence used various other online platforms to harass and humiliate the professor. He created social media accounts, email addresses and websites to impersonate the victim or distribute explicit, photoshopped images of her, according to court documents. These included accounts on Craigslist, X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and Linktree, as well as the website ladies.exposed, which displayed photo collages containing manipulated images of the victim, and personal details such as her home address and phone number.In May 2023, the professor received a voicemail that referred to her by name and stated her father had died in a “serious, really tragic car accident”. There had not been an accident but the voicemail made her fear for her family’s safety.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They worried that a perpetrator or someone viewing the posts would show up at their home. The couple installed surveillance cameras in their home and placed sleigh bells on their inside door handles to alert them of any movement. The professor now carries pepper spray and knives with her as a result of the harassment, according to the court documents.Between 31 January 2023 and August 2024, the victim and her husband received about 60 texts, calls and emails directly harassing her or notifying her of new accounts or platforms displaying her image and information.Ofcom warns tech firms after chatbots imitate Brianna Ghey and Molly RussellRead moreThe stalking was not the product of an individual obsession with the professor. Florence targeted six other women and a 17-year-old girl, digitally altering their pictures to depict them as nude or semi-nude. He impersonated them on platforms such as OkCupid, X, Yahoo, Classmates.com, Facebook and escort websites.The use of artificial intelligence to sexually harass and exploit people, including children, is increasing. AnAugust reportby the child safety non-profit Thorn found that about one in 10 minors in the US know of cases where their friends and classmates have used AI to create non-consensual intimate images of another child. In 2024, the Guardian revealed how predators are using AI platforms to generate new child-sexual-abuseimages of existing victimsand totarget children in the public eye.“There is an ongoing and increasing problem where people are using AI to make their abuse more efficient, and the damage they cause more widespread,” said Turkheimer. “The more people have access to this technology, the more it’s going to be used to bring harm to people.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatbotsUS crimeMassachusettsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What could possibly go wrong?John NaughtonThe AI startup has upended the industry by developing a model that costs much less to produce – and is available free to a universe of tinkerersSat 1 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2025 14.14 ESTShareNothing cheers up a tech columnist more than the sight of$600bn being wiped off the market cap of an overvalued tech giant in a single day. And yet last Monday that’s what happened to Nvidia, the leading maker of electronic picks and shovels for the AI gold rush. It was the biggest one-day slump for any company in history, and it was not alone – shares of companies in semiconductor, power and infrastructure industries exposed to AI collectively shed more than $1tn in value on the same day.The proximate cause of this chaos was the news that a Chinese tech startup of whom few had hitherto heard had released DeepSeek R1, a powerful AI assistant that was much cheaper to train and operate than the dominant models of the US tech giants – and yet was comparablein competenceto OpenAI’s o1 “reasoning” model. Just to illustrate the difference: R1 was said to have cost only $5.58m to build, which is small change compared with the billions that OpenAI and co have spent on their models; and R1 is about 15 times more efficient (in terms of resource use) than anything comparable made by Meta.The DeepSeek app immediately zoomed to the top of the Apple app store, where it attracted huge numbers of users who were clearly unfazed by the fact that the terms and conditions and the privacy policy they needed to accept were in Chinese. And it clearly energised the Silicon Valley crowd. “DeepSeek R1,”boomed venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, one of the loudest mouths in California, “is AI’s Sputnik moment”. He also called it “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen – and as open source, aprofound gift to the world”. Donald Trump, who does not believe in giving gifts to the world, described R1 as a“wake-up call”for American tech firms.What the advent of DeepSeek indicates is that this technology – like all digital technology – will eventually be commoditisedHistorical resonances were rife. Andreessen was referring to the seminal moment in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched the first Earth satellite, thereby displaying technological superiority over the US – a shock that triggered the creation of Nasa and, ultimately, the internet. Other people were reminded of the advent of the “personal computer” and the ridicule heaped upon it by the then giants of the computing world, led by IBM and other purveyors of huge mainframe computers. Suddenly, people are beginning to wonder ifDeepSeekand its offspring will do to the trillion-dollar AI behemoths of Google, Microsoft, OpenAIet alwhat the PC did to IBM and its ilk. And of course there are the conspiracy theorists wondering whether DeepSeek is really just a disruptive stunt dreamed up by Xi Jinping to unhinge the US tech industry. Is the modelreallythat cheap to train? Can we believe the numbers in the technical reports published by its makers? And so on.Standing back, there are four things to take away from the arrival of DeepSeek.The first is that China has caught up with the leading US AI labs, despite the widespread (and hubristic) western assumption that the Chinese are not as good at software as we are. Even a cursory examination of some of the technical details of R1 andthe V3 modelthat lay behind it evinces formidable technical ingenuity and creativity.Second, the low training and inference costs of R1 willturbocharge American anxietythat the emergence of powerful – and cheap – Chinese AI could upend the economics of the industry, much as the advent of the PC transformed the computing marketplace in the 1980s and 90s. What the advent of DeepSeek indicates is that this technology – like all digital technology – will eventually be commoditised. R1 runs on my laptop without any interaction with the cloud, for example, and soon models like it will run on our phones.Third, DeepSeek pulled this off despite the ferocious technology bans imposed by the first Trump administration and then by Biden’s. The company’s technical report shows that it possesses a cluster of 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs – technology officially banned by the US government for sale to China.And last, but by no means least, R1 seems to be a genuinely open source model. It’s distributed under the permissive MIT licence, which allows anyone to use, modify, and commercialise the model without restrictions. As I write this, my hunch is that geeks across the world are already tinkering with, and adapting, R1 for their own particular needs and purposes, in the process creating applications that even the makers of the model couldn’t have envisaged. It goes without saying that this has its upsides and downsides, but it’s happening. The AI genie is now really out of the bottle.What I’ve been readingWhenTrump meets techAreally sobering analysisby William Cullerne Bown of what the new regime in Washington means for the UK and Europe.A dystopia like Philip K Dick’sAn essayexplaining why Henry Farrell thinks that our future might be like something written by the great author.Life is more than an engineering problemA transcript of aninteresting interview with sci-fi writer Ted Chiangin theLA Review of Books.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The networkerDeepSeekComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

So far, explanations have tended to focus on its manic pace, contempt for political conventions and blatant subversion of supposedly one of the world’s most robust democracies.But all these elements were also present in his first presidency. Meanwhile, other features of both his terms, such as his cult of personality,scapegoating of immigrantsand accusation that liberal elites have caused national decline, are standard practice for hard-right strongmen, and have been for at least a century.Yet still he baffles and wrongfoots people, both opponents and more neutral observers, political professionals and voters, Americans and foreigners. There is an underexplored reason for this. Trump’s presidency, and particularly his second term, is a deeply paradoxical project. In some ways, it’s an epic political fantasy, a promise that every dream of US reactionaries and nationalists can be rapidly fulfilled. But in other ways, it’s a frightening intrusion of reality – into the rose-tinted picture many liberals still have of how America works and how America relates to the rest of the world.The central assumption of the Trump fantasy is that in his remaining four-year term, during which he will enter his 80s, despite the US’s sharp social divides and inevitable buffeting by global crises, he can accomplish almost anything. “I stand before you now,” he said at his inauguration, “as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible … We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history.”Other elements of the Trump fantasy include the belief that the US can essentially ignore the climate crisis; that it can impose big tariffs on importswithout causing increases in their prices; that Trump’s personal interventions can swiftly and permanently end longstanding conflicts such as Gaza; and that his constant lies, exaggerations and inventions can create new realities, both reshaping the present and permanently rewriting history. In short, the Trump fantasy promises that in an anti-political age his brand of politics can nevertheless solve everything.Yet at the same time, the opening days of his second term have revealed truths about the US that were previously half hidden. Its alliance with western Europe is not permanent. It is still an imperial power in the traditional sense, with territorial ambitions. And much of corporate America is happy to have an authoritarian government, as long as it is good for profits. “History’s greatest civilization,” as Trump described his country at the inauguration, is really a brutally competitive, aggressively nationalistic place – at least for large stretches – rather than the essentially benign society and superpower believed in for so long by so many liberals. It’s taken Trump’s unfiltered presidency to finally make that obvious.More bewildering still for those who don’t back him, sometimes the fantastical and reality-based strands of Trumpism are closely entangled. His strong support from men andhalting of pro-diversity policies, for instance, are partly the products of a fantasy – that under him straight male dominance as it existed decades ago can be restored – and yet they are also a reminder that in the US, as in other democracies, socially conservative men remain a powerful electoral force.Trump’s approval rating dips after rush of executive orders, poll findsRead moreSimilarly, Trump’s climate policies – however delusional they seem with growing swathes of his country on fire because of extreme weather – are also a recognition that any serious US response to the crisis would require his richer voters and donors to make drastic lifestyle changes. If the planet and the patriarchy are in trouble, as many Trump supporters probably accept, deep down, like everyone else, then there is an argument, albeit a selfish one, for enjoying all the carbon-intensive privileges of traditional American masculinity while you still can. With his love of burgers and gold surfaces, his water-hungry golf courses and multiple homes, Trump’s own life constantly showcases this kind of resource-heavy, escapist consumption. In a world increasingly haunted by scarcity, with supply chains weakened by wars, disruptive weather and the pandemic, his excess is a crude but potent statement.Faced again by this combination of reality-denial and self-interest, how might those who oppose Trump at home and abroad, or who run governments that are going have to coexist with his, regain their political composure? One way may simply be to wait for his frenzy of executive orders to lose its political effectiveness, a process that may have already begun with anorder freezing federal grants chaotically reversedthis week. Even some Trump voters will realise sooner or later that issuing decrees from Washington and ending “America’s decline”, as he promises, are not the same thing.Another useful approach may be to understand the attractiveness for many voters of Trump’s fantasies, but also their impracticality. Despite the claims from Trump and a credulous media that he is a unique American leader, the country has a recent tradition of Republican presidents making unattainable promises. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan said he would make America safe again, with an unprecedented“Star Wars” anti-missile system, and in the 2000s George W Bush pledged to do the same by invading Iraq. Both projects were disasters. The Iraq war also damaged US allies, especially Britain, partly because Tony Blair’s government saw Bush’s Iraq fixation as too powerful to question. Ominously, Keir Starmer and Trump are already telling us how well they get on.Any other non-Republicans tempted to just accept that this is the age of Trump might usefully look to the numbers behind his support. Last year, unlike in 2016, he did win the popular vote,but by only 1.5 percentage points. Yet both pro- and anti-Trump forces act as if he has a mandate so overwhelming that resistance is futile. His party’s majorities in the Senate and the House are also tiny. If he disappoints only a small fraction of his supporters, neither majority may survive the 2026 midterm elections.Trump may seem dizzyingly strong now. Yet soon he will be just another incumbent, in an anti-incumbent world. The problem then, for those who don’t support him, won’t be his dominance of the discourse, which may be slipping, but how much of the American state he controls.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationClimate crisisUS CongressUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

He will always exploit tragedy to display his self-regardSat 1 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2025 02.01 ESTShareOutrages of Donald Trump’s rancid character topple over each other so rapidly and in such volume that they long ago became banal. His vileness is unremarked upon, his rottenness unworthy of further commentary. Trump’s offensiveness is an unspoken assumption. Rules and norms exist for him to break. More, he is rewarded. Meta, after discarding monitoring of hateful content and disinformation on Facebook, is paying him $25m in tribute to settle his lawsuit against it for havingbannedhim after his attempted coup on January 6 and his potential “instances of violence” and threats to “public safety”. All is forgiven, if not forgotten. There are no gates; there are no gatekeepers. Let the bad times roll.But Trump crashed through a new boundary after an army helicopter collided with an airliner about to land at Washington’s Reagan National airport on 29 January with the loss of 67 lives. While police and firefighters were still recovering bodies from the Potomac River, before any report from the National Transportation Safety Board and evidence was fully gathered, Trump went on TV to spew blame against enemies within and to deflect responsibility.The Federal Aviation Authority administrator, Michael Whitaker, serving a five-year term that was supposed to end in 2028, was forced out by Elon Musk. On 24 September of last year, the FAA fined Musk’s SpaceX company $633,000 for launching rockets without a permit. “I think safety is in the public interest, and that’s our primary focus,” Whitakertestifiedto the House transportation committee. The administrator position was vacant at the time of the crash.The day after Trump’s inauguration he not only fired the members of the aviation security advisory committee,createdin 1989 after the terrorist bombing of Pan Am flight 103 thatexploded over Lockerbiein Scotland, but also eliminated the committee entirely. It had recently proposed new regulations for airline safety.The morning after the crash, Trump warmed to hisblaming exercise, expanding his targets as he went on. He began by blaming the policy to hire disabled people as air traffic controllers, saying they suffered, among other disabilities, from “severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability, and dwarfism”. The policy, in fact, was in effect during his previous administration.Then he blamed “the FAA’s diversity and inclusion hiring plan”, which he falsely claimed was responsible for the hiring of disabled people. They have been hired under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, a signature achievement of President George HW Bush.Trump jumped to attack the former transport secretary Pete Buttigieg as “a disaster”, throwing in an obscenity. “He’s just got a good line of bullshit,” said Trump, “and he’s run it right into the ground with his diversity. So I had to say that it’s terrible.”Trump next turned to the “great replacement theory” as his overarching explanation. Somehow, he claimed, the presence of non-white people was the reason for the crash. “It’s a group within the FAA, another story, determined that the workforce was too white, that they had concerted efforts to get the administration to change that and to change it immediately. This was in the Obama administration just prior to my getting there.”But, he went on, “we took care of African Americans, Hispanic Americans,” and, he said, “it’s one of the reasons I won.” But he asserted again that white people were being pushed out – “too white”. By contrast, “we want the people that are competent”. As he spoke, three of his cabinet nominees – Tulsi Gabbard, Robert F Kennedy Jr and Kash Patel – were being questioned in confirmation hearings about their glaring incompetence. And then Trump blamed Biden.A reporter asked: “On DEI and the claim that you’ve made, are you saying this crash was somehow caused and the result of diversity hiring? And what evidence have you seen to support these claims?” Trump replied: “It just could have been.”He blamed Biden again. Asked, “how you can come to the conclusion right now that diversity had something to do with this crash?” Trump snipped: “Because I have common sense, OK? And, unfortunately, a lot of people don’t.”Buttigiegfired backat once: “Despicable. As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying. We put safety first, drove down close calls, grew air traffic control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch. President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA.”He added: “One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep our skies safe. Time for the president to show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening again.”Presidents perform more than executive functions within the federal government. They, and they alone, can act as the emotional and empathetic voice of the nation during unexpected tragic events. They can grieve and console. They can express humility and demonstrate grace. They can serve as models of stoic behavior, articulate values and uphold standards, and summon the spirit of national unity.Was he grave, sombre, the consoler-in-chief? Are you kidding – this is TrumpRead moreWhen, in 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated shortly into its flight, killing all seven crew members, Ronald Reagan delivered a healingaddressto the nation that ended with a poetic eulogy to the crew that “‘slipped the surly bonds of Earth’ to ‘touch the face of God’”.When, in 1995, a far-right extremist bombed the Alfred P Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people in the worst domestic terrorist incident in the country’s history, Bill Clintonwent there, comforted the families of the victims “to share your grief”, and, citing scripture,said: “One thing we owe those who have sacrificed is the duty to purge ourselves of the dark forces which gave rise to this evil. They are forces that threaten our common peace, our freedom, our way of life. Let us teach our children that the God of comfort is also the God of righteousness: ‘Those who trouble their own house will inherit the wind.’ Justice will prevail.”When, in 2001, after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, Muslims in general and within America were blamed, George W Bushsaid: “These acts of violence against innocents violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith. And it’s important for my fellow Americans to understand that … The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That’s not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace … Muslims make an incredibly valuable contribution to our country. Muslims are doctors, lawyers, law professors, members of the military, entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, moms and dads. And they need to be treated with respect. In our anger and emotion, our fellow Americans must treat each other with respect.”When, in 2015, after a white supremacist neo-Nazi murdered nine parishioners at the African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, Barack Obamaattendedthe funeral of two of those killed. He praised the families who responded “in the midst of unspeakable grief with words of forgiveness”. He explained the long history of racism behind “an act that drew on a long history of bombs, arson, shots fired at churches. Not random, but as a means of control, a way to terrorize and oppress.” And he broke into singing Amazing Grace.If those presidents rose to new heights, Trump’s nose-dive into the mud was as emblematic. His impulse was to cast blame out of a frantic fear that accountability might somehow befall him. It was of a piece with his justice department’sillegal erasureof the criminal records of the January 6 convicts after he pardoned them.Trump demeaned in his attempt to enlarge himself. Buttigieg was “bullshit”, while Trump said, self-referentially: “We want brilliant people doing this.” The tragedy surfaced as an unforeseen opportunity for preening in the spotlight. He rebuffed a question about visiting the scene as though it was an affront. “You tell me the site,” he said. “What do you want me to do, go swimming?”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump at the White House on Thursday.Photograph: Elizabeth Frantz/ReutersTrump’s pretense as king has quickly devolved into his strutting insult comedian routine. He has ceded much of his executive power to two crackpot would-be prime ministers – Hitler-saluting Elon Musk, who is ravaging the government, and Project 2025 theocrat Russell Vought, Trump’s appointee to head the office of budget and management, whosayshis goal for federal workers is to “put them in trauma”. Trump’s White House, supposedly under the tight rein of his disciplining “Ice Maiden”, erstwhile Florida lobbyist Susie Wiles, was cut out of Musk’s loop when his minions virtually shut down the government with wildly vindictive orders. The resulting uproar in which they were mostly yanked back still exposed the gameplan of Trump’s retribution regime.Trump loves to swagger in the ceremonial pomp of his office, preferably surrounded by military guards, full-dress Fredonia. But in the plane crash he showed his utter disdain for the magical sympathy that the head of state can bestow, compassion on behalf of the whole country.Trump is more mafia kingpin than king, certainly not a constitutional monarch. He wants nothing but the bended knee, the deference and the adoration, but not to give anything in return. His restoration is another chance at piratical looting, his crypto coin, the constitution’s emoluments clause be damned. And would the self-aggrandizing justices on the US supreme court ever object to his perks?Trump views Musk partly as the muscle in his protection racket. He can threaten any mere senator with qualms about his quack cabinet nominees with primary opponents rocket-fueled with Musk’s unlimited funds. If the senators don’t pay the protection money in the form of obedient votes, Trump will get Musk to break their windows.The sad accident over the Potomac has revealed Trump’s irredeemable character once again. He will always spontaneously exploit tragedy to display his self-regard. The portrait of Trump in the film The Apprentice mistakenly depicts him in the beginning as a naive, impressionable young man, who fell into Roy Cohn’s hands and was molded by the mafia lawyer into a monster. On the contrary, Trump was a monster in the making. The stories are legion. Just recently his nephew recalled that when he was a child his uncle Donaldtold himthat disabled people “should just die” and frequently used the N-word to describe black people. Not to mention Trump’s decades of alleged sexual misconduct, only two incidents ever surfacing in the courts, one leading to his conviction of 34 felonies and the other to a defamation ruling with the judge stating from the bench that Trump’s action should be understood as rape.The Trump of the airport tragedy is the same Trump at the funeral of his father, Fred Trump, who financed his spendthrift bankruptcies on fanciful speculations. Mounting the pulpit at New York’s Marble Collegiate church to deliver the main eulogy, Trumpbegan: “I was having the greatest year of my business career, and I was sitting having breakfast thinking of how well things were going for me.” The rest of the speech was all about Donald.After Fred died, Donald made sure his deceased older brother’s son, another of Donald’s nephews, who suffered from muscular dystrophy, was deprived of the family company’s medical insurance. “Why should we give him medical coverage?”saidTrump.For Trump’s religious devotees, his moral turpitude is received as the inner light of his kingly anointment and divine right to rule. For the conservative majority on the US supreme court, the rap sheet of his far and wide crimes, such as attempting to overthrow the government and inciting a mob intent on lynching his vice-president, fell under his “official actions” to be granted “absolute immunity”. The hard-pressed working-class voters that gave him another chance bought the humbug of his titanic business acumen that they believed he would extend to lower their cost of living. Still, others dismissed his felonies and grifting on the easy, cynical grounds that, after all, they all do it, don’t they?But, as PT Barnum, the original expert on the subject of humbuggery and suckers,wrote: “The greatest humbug of all is the man who believes – or pretends to believe – that everything and everybody are humbugs.” Barnum observed that he “who does not even know that every sham shows that there is a reality, and that hypocrisy is the homage that vice pays to virtue – I pronounce him – no, I do not pronounce him a humbug, the word does not apply to him. He is a fool.”Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of EarthExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsWashington DCWashington DC plane crashcommentShareReuse this content"

If the Office for National Statistics is correct, net migration will add five million people to these islands in the span of a decade. That will account for almost all population growth in that time, driving us up to72.5 million by 2032.Is it good news or bad? Many commentators reacted with alarm: there is already a great deal of strain on housing, education and health services. But others like the idea. They point out that birthrates are falling across the world, and that Britain, like other countries, is due to get increasingly decrepit with time. We will eventually have to live off the life force of skilled young people from overseas, over whom everyone else will be competing.But how will the public respond? There’snot a straightforward answerthere, either. Opposition to newcomers has softened in recent years, even as their numbers surged, although there was an uptick in concern again in 2023. But here’s a counter-narrative: last week, seven separate polls saw Reform pull ahead of the Conservative party. Central to Reform’s appeal is astance against immigration.The real answer to both questions is: it depends. Whether immigration is good or bad, tolerated or unpopular, tends to correlate with a factor distinct from headline numbers. Politicians talk aboutlevelsof immigration. But this skims over a more essential question: how well do new arrivals integrate into the economy, and into British life itself?Britons care about integration, which can make their attitudes seem inconsistent when asked about net numbers.Quizzed by pollsters, we say immigration is too high, but when it comes to individual groups of migrants – those fleeing war, those coming to study, transport workers, service workers, fruit pickers, artists, teachers, nurses – it turns out we’d like them to stay, or even arrive in greater numbers. We also tend to get on with the immigrants we know. This isn’t contradictory so much as nuanced. When immigrants do valuable work, and mix into communities, everyone benefits. On the occasions they don’t, problems can arise.Luckily for us, there are some reasons to be hopeful about the coming rise in newcomers. Integration is one of Britain’s biggest success stories: we excel at settling in arrivals. Touchiness around the subject means we don’t make much of a fuss about this. We should.Let’s start with employment rates, which for migrant men of working agestand at 82%, higher than for UK-born men, at 78% – although for women they dip two percentage points lower than for the native born. Other places are less successful: employment rates for foreign-born people in the EUlag well behind. There are plenty of fields in which migrants excel, too, delivering an outsize boost to the economy. A 2023 study found 39% of the 100 fastest-growing companies in Britainhave an immigrant founder or co-founder, even though the group makes up just 14.5% of the population.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sam Freedman, an expert on education policy, has pointed out that in a recent Pisa study of 15-year-olds – Pisa is the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment – the UK was the only European country other than Serbia where second-generation immigrantsperformed better than non-immigrants. Meanwhile, 58% of Bangladeshi students on free school meals go on to university, compared with just 16% of their white British equivalents.What about social integration? That is a positive story, too. Between 1991 and 2021,every ethnic group became less segregated, including white Britons. And not just in our big metropolitan centres, but in small towns and suburbs, where the foreign-born population is increasing the fastest. There are also a growing number of mixed-ethnicity households – from 9% in 2001 to almost15% of multiperson homes in 2021, due partly to the explosive growth of dating and roommate apps. Foreign-born people areunderrepresented in the UK’s prison system.Not so in much of the rest of the world.What’s our secret? Language is part of it. We’re lucky that a lot of the world speaks English and we can have our pick of the talent. Once here, people integrate that much faster. Another advantage is a flexible labour market, compared with the rest of Europe, where bureaucracy can stand in the way of foreign-born people joining the wage force. A third is our attitude. The 2023 European Social Survey finds that, next to Norway, we are theleast likely European countryto say immigration makes our country a worse place to live.There is plenty of room for improvement. We import many problems too, including cultural prejudices and religious extremism. Although segregation is falling, it can still cause problems. We are particularly bad at dealing with asylum seekers, whom we stop from working during the endless time we take to sort out their cases. Meanwhile,small boat crossings are up, while numbers of international students are down – putting a strain on universities, which increasinglyrely on their fees. Last week Cardiff University announced it wascutting 400 jobs.We need to address these problems and build on our advantage. Talking about integration, and not just net numbers, would be a start. It would be good, too, if politicians could refrain from overstating the drawbacks of immigration. Last week Kemi Badenoch blamed a “lack of integration” for the crimes of the Southport mass killer Axel Rudakubana – a claim for which there is no evidence. This kind of rhetoric will only damage integration, and set us back.Martha Gill is an Observer columnistExplore more on these topicsMigrationOpinionPopulationcommentShareReuse this content"

They have been bred to be good layers but tend to become egg-bound – unable to push a soft-shelled egg out. When this happens, their internal organs become infected until their combs wilt and they grow lethargic.I watch YouTube videos and massage orifices with lubricated gloves and bathe the chickens in warm suds with limited success. I change their pellets and add crushed calcium into their feed. I take one bedraggled soul to the vet and am addressed with the solemnity reserved for a grieving dog owner.The vet expresses her sincere condolences and offers me a private moment to say farewell and collect the incinerated remains.

Sandra reminds me of Sister Michael from the TV show Derry Girls. She dishes out acerbic zingers with the ease born of a lifelong teaching career. “I’m on my way to old-lady pilates,” she says as she strides past with a rolled up mat under her arm. She delivers a snack for my roost – mealworms writhing in a container of papery detritus. The chickens go rabid over it. They love surplus pumpkins and figs and blocks of lard and watermelon collars.They seem to have cast-iron stomachs and will eat almost anything except citrus and onion skins. They rotate their laying areas through the pen even when their hutch is cleaned regularly and fresh hay restocked. I come across a surprise clutch next to the fig tree and carefully tip each egg into a bowl of water – if it floats, I am told, it is rotten. The eggs are all different orbs, like micro-speckled galaxies, and the yolks are luscious and deep orange. One lays a fairy egg, a third the normal size, which is yolkless.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe chooks like shaded undergrowth, the low-hanging capsicum and hops vines, and mounds of soil where they half-bury themselves and have a dirt bath. We refresh the flock with some younger chooks, gradually introducing them to the veterans by way of a divided wire fence over a number of days. When they are merged into the same pen, Bolshie doesn’t survive the shock of being supplanted. She is struck down by a sudden illness and grows blind and caws overnight to death.Sandra spots an opportunistic crow stealing our eggs and smashing them open on the bitumen road to suck out the yolk. We hang some old CD discs on a string, hoping the pendulous shine will deter the thief.A baby mouse runs through the pen, attracted by the scraps of food. The chickens descend with a vengeance, pecking at its little body as if playing a wild game of pinball. Over the summer, the flock is penned into a gravel-lined run to protect a harvest of cherry tomatoes from sharp beaks and T-Rex collagen infused claws. Throughout the day, their clucking and scratching and raucous announcements of eggs being laid form a backing track to our domestic lives. Their poo is hearty fertiliser for our vegetable patch, which is mostly abandoned but produces a variety of heirloom tomatoes and pumpkins by way of seeds preserved in their excrement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The unions are on the warpath. Dame Judi Dench has been activated. The BBC broke with broadcasting tradition last month, axing the last remaining drama sloton Radio 3.The Beeb has broadcast original audio drama since Christmas 1922; since then, its radio departments have nurtured the careers of writers from Tom Stoppard to Benjamin Zephaniah. Successive cuts in recent years had already left long-form drama siloed in Radio 3’s 90-minute slot at 8pm on Sundays,Drama on 3. Now that slot has been canned for good.This stings, not only for radio fans but becauseBBCradio drama has underpinned a century of creativity in theatre and the wider arts. That legacy was built on both its generosity to the wider sector and its willingness to kick against the establishment from within.Take the career ofBBC radio producer John Tydeman. In 1963, he discovered a playwright calledJoe Orton, who had written a scriptwhile in jail on the charge of defacing library books with his lover Kenneth Halliwell. (The custodial sentence, Orton always insisted, was “because we were queers”.) Tydeman coached Orton as a BBC writer and also set him up with a theatrical agent, enabling his breakthrough stage production,Entertaining Mr Sloane,which established Orton’s name before his radio play,The Ruffian on the Stair, produced by Tydeman,was even broadcast.No wonder the thesps feel that a legacy is at risk here. Equity, the Society of Authors and theWriters Guild of Great Britainare among those marshalling petitions against the move: signatories include Dench, Meera Syal and Bill Nighy. Yet we have been here before. Protests against the BBC “dumbing down” are perennial. In 1957, in the days of Radio 3’s precursor, the Third Programme, TS Eliot, Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud held a fundraiser at the Royal Court theatre to object to rumoured drama cuts, most of which turned out to be wildly exaggerated.For some time, the BBC has been quietly shifting its spoken word output from Radio 3 to Radio 4Look closer, and there is a logic in the BBC’s changes, in a national institution struggling for continuing relevance. The demise ofDrama on 3has not come in a vacuum. For some time, the BBC has been quietly shifting its spoken word output fromRadio3 to Radio 4.In 2021, Radio 3 lost the bulk of its arts programming, the greatest casualty beingSaturday Review. Outcry followed, as today. Yet Radio 4’s arts coverage was commensurately bulked up, with the addition of new showsThis Cultural LifeandScreenshot. Radio 4’s highest-profile arts offering,Front Row,has gained 30 minutes a week and a weekly slot focused on Scottish arts. Meanwhile, Radio 3’s forthcoming programming, notably a40-part series on modernism in music, shows a commitment to classical but no sign of dumbing down.What lies behind this shift, I am told, is the director general Tim Davie’s obsession with “brand purity”. Gone is the magazine mix of Radio 3, with its mandate to balance highbrow speech programming with highbrow music; we are moving instead to the “clarity” of a Radio 3 dedicated to classical and jazz music, and a Radio 4 dedicated to speech. Speech programmes that enhance Radio 3’s “music brand”, such asMusic Matters,will stay. Two other intellectual panel programmes,Free ThinkingandThe Verb,have already made the move from Radio 3 to Radio 4.For audiences, this signals the end of individual radio channels – “linear networks” – that could be trusted to guide the listener through the day with wide-ranging genres on a single channel. For older generations, raised to stick their analogue radio switch on a favourite channel from morn to night, this will be a shock.But the world of the podcast has already created a new era of selective listening. If Radio 3 is transformed into an exclusively music station, it is because one day it may not be a live radio station at all. It will be a themed “content hub” from which we select whichever music programme suits our mood. This is not the apocalypse but the reality of change.Where does this leave the legacy of audio drama at the BBC? Stripped of the security of the 90-minute format, for sure. The BBC is eager to reassure us that audio drama continues on Radio 4: as yet, however, it offers only drama slots of 45 and (sometimes) 60 minutes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOver atThe Stage,the critic David Benedict recently bemoaned such lengths asunfit for drama. “Forty-five minutes of drama is a horribly unsatisfying length,” he writes, “like a book too long to be a short story, but not long enough to be a novel.”It is not entirely fair to dismiss the dramatic potential of shorter BBC formats. Four of the six nominees for best original single drama at this year’s BBC Audio Drama Awards are successful experiments in the 45-minute length. But Benedict is right that the death of the 90-minute BBC radio play would definitively break the relationship between BBC radio and British theatre. Ninety minutes of radio drama is practice for 90 minutes of theatre, the basic format of the British stage show.If the 90-minute audio drama is dying, however, it is not the BBC alone that has killed it. Audio drama is thriving on streaming services, but largely in episodic formats. The pandemic exposed a worldwide appetite for audio entertainment, but industry experts complain that this same popularity led to a mass buyout of independent producers by the corporate players. Audible is almost unchallenged in the UK;Wonderyand iHeartRadio offer some competition in the US. When they do invest in radio drama, they favour sci-fi, thrillers and adaptations of existing intellectual property.In an era of new formats, digital competitors and ever more selective audiences, the BBC must restructure its future as best it can. Yet no competitor is offering alternative investment in 90-minute drama. The BBC says it is actively “exploring” ways to compensate for the loss ofDrama on 3, both on Radio 4 and BBC Sounds. Unions have two options. They can work with the BBC to make that happen; or they can prepare, like artists throughout history, to accept the challenge of new genres, new formats and new masters.Kate Maltby writes about theatre, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsBBCOpinionRadio dramaRadio 3Radio 4Spoken wordPodcastingRadiocommentShareReuse this content"

It’s time to debate it without toxic rhetoricSat 1 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2025 09.30 ESTShareBritain needs immigrants. According to theOffice for National Statistics this week, Britain’s “indigenous” population in the 2030s will be static and ageing. Growth in populationwill be buoyed only by immigrants, their number predicted to rise by 5 million over the next seven years. Thank goodness, surely, for them.As this debate lurches back into public discourse, it is cursed by the ease with which xenophobia delivers political gain. The fact is that Britons have turned massively in favour of immigration over the past half century. In the 1950s and 1960s,roughly 80%-90% wanted it to stop. Then the inflow was under 250,000 a year and Enoch Powell could forecast “rivers of blood”. Net migration was below zero.In 2023, immigration into Britain was estimated inexcess of 1.2 million, yetpublic opposition to immigration was downto 40-50%. It had risen in the run-up to Brexit, when it was the lead factor in the leave vote. It fell back as EU workers vanished, but opposition rose again last year as non-EU small boat arrivals gained daily publicity. Even then, fewer than half those polled said it should be reduced.Figures can prove almost anything. What is significant is that where most immigrants settle – in and round London – is both the most productive part of Britain and where opposition to them is weakest. In London,over a third of the current populationwas born abroad. Public opinion certainlyresents the immigrants’ claimon the NHS and welfare, but it welcomes them, often overwhelmingly, as professionals (notably doctors) and as care, hospitality and farm workers.Migrant exploitation is a progressive issue. That’s why we will now take the toughest steps ever to stop it | David LammyRead moreFor my part, I know only that many of the services I use, for building, cleaning, transport and eating out, are overwhelmingly supplied by immigrants. Diversity is a feature of most major world cities. I note that the states with high immigration levels – the US, Britain, Germany and France – are also among the most prosperousand most free.None of this really matters. It is all but impossible for a liberal country to prevent enterprising, often desperate, people from penetrating its borders. When the Boris Johnson government stifled the supply of short-term EU workers under a hard Brexit, long-term non-EU workers simply replaced them in even greater numbers. Recent limits onforeign students and their dependentshave diverted visas towards particular skills. But it is hard to see such diversion aiding state sectors now chronically understaffed.In other words, immigration into Britain may need more vigorous regulation, but it is not going to stop, nor should it. Global population mobility is like the climate crisis. It can be mitigated but not easily reversed. If two successive leaders of Britain’s Conservative party can have immigrant backgrounds, it is hard to argue that Britain can not adjust.What matters is how to handle the continued toxicity of immigration on domestic politics. The issue has proved a gift to extremists in all the west’s “receiving” nations, from the Scandinavian countries and Germany to the US. Immigration as code for race is a gift to America’s far right, just as a side-effect of immigration, identity politics, is to the left.Research by the Oxford thinktank Migration Observatory shows that the British public is ready to welcome newcomers to its economy and even to its communities. But there is a proviso. The welcome is not unconditional. The relentless publicity given to “immigrant crime” – actuallyno worse than “homegrown” – reflects a sense that hosts expect higher standards of “guests”. Bursts of reported criminality, as recently withAlbanian drug gangs, appear to come in phases of migration rather than reflecting underlying national cultures.Many countries now have protocols based around conditional inclusion and good citizenship. Effort needs to be made to reduce the clash of cultures between Britons and some immigrant groups – such as on issues of gender. This should surely be met other than with the ludicrous Home Office “hostile environment” citizenship test, with questions such as “when is Saint David’s Day?” and “which two houses fought in the Wars of the Roses?”.Few on either side could complain at the deportation of recent immigrant criminals or at an insistence on some acceptance of an immigrant “charter”. Those intending to settle permanently in a new land could surely be required to learn of its popular festivals, beliefs, traditions and codes of conduct. Community discipline matters, or should matter. Such a charter – which might also be given to second-homers arriving in distant villages – should be seen as part of the migration ritual.Merely deploring British immigration is no longer meaningful. It is the crudely concealed politics of emotion. We cannot stop foreigners wanting to come to Britain, but we can regulate it and turn it to our advantage. We can handle it.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s not a good look for a Labour governmentCharlotte HigginsSo many pre-election promises: but still a cultural malaise spreads from our schools to museums, galleries and theatresSat 1 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2025 10.43 ESTShareIf a former director of the National Theatresays that“more harm has been done than good” to the arts by the new Labour government, it is safe to say things have got off to a rocky start. It is hard to imagine a slice of British society more sympathetic on principle to Labour than those working in the creative sector. Hopes were high: Keir Starmer made apowerful speechon the arts before the election. The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, began by doing everyone a service by unilaterally declaring theend of the culture wars– perhaps something not entirely in her gift, though it’s clear she was calling time on the endless spitting and sniping at the “woke” arts favoured by the previous government. And yet: all I hear is disappointment and desperation, and not only from Nicholas Hytner. There is a void where policy and action should be. In a speech in Gateshead in mid-January,Nandy promisedto “turbocharge” the creative industries, but failed to mention theatre and museums, art or artists, in any meaningful way. Much of the £60m funding she announced was repackaged money.TheLabourgovernment has no dedicated arts minister. Instead, Chris Bryant’s role is split between two ministries: he is minister for data protection and telecoms, and minister for creative industries, arts and tourism. There is no sense that Labour has yet grasped the delicate interconnected forces that underpin the arts. It is not OK to shove everything together, from ballerinas to florists, into a thing called “the creative industries”. The arts are different, and they need attention.What’s required is a subtle sense of how provision of arts in schools, and in communities (theatres, libraries, museums) can create opportunities for children from all backgrounds. There are clear indirect benefits from children’s engaging in the arts at any level, from wellbeing and health to educational outcomes. But routes to elite training are also vital – which means flourishing youth programmes, conservatoires and art schools. Artists then need to have the right conditions to make work as professionals, which means regional and national theatres, concert halls and performing arts groups with the capacity and risk-taking appetite (which means financial stability) to commission them.Flourishing arts organisations in communitiescreate economic benefitand a local sense of pride. That work, eventually, feeds into broadcasting and the commercial sector – productions go to the West End, writers to the BBC and Netflix, actors to Hollywood; overseas film productions are attracted by British music studios and special-effects houses. This is an extremely crude description of an arts ecosystem that, if it works well, ends up creating a huge economic driver, as well as Britain’s single most effective (and benign) projection of itself to the world: as a creator of outstanding culture and arts.The problem is that all kinds of bits of this at the moment are not working. Local authorities aredefunding their cultural provision. Private schools pour resources into cultural education because the benefits are clear. But in the state education sector, a longstanding obsession with Stem subjects has elbowed out music and art, and endless cuts have depleted extracurricular music and theatre. Consequently, fewer and fewer of our artists, actors and musicians, proportionately, are coming out ofworking-class backgrounds, to everyone’s detriment. This is why the current curriculum review under Bridget Phillipson, secretary of state for education, is so crucial, and Nandy needs to be arguing for culture’s prominence in it with every atom in her body. Another vital and looming issue is the threat to artists’ livelihoods from AI. Artists arecampaigningto have their copyright protected from tech firms’ desire to train models on their work, pressing for an “opt-in” rather than an “opt-out clause”. Ministers in the culture department need to fight to support them.Arts Council England (ACE), and in different ways the arts councils in the nations, are flailing, and creating absurd levels of bureaucracy for depleted arts organisations. All this is partly because of their own failures (ACE contorted itselfto align to the Tory government, when it should have asserted its independence) and partly because, to be fair, it is easier to look successful when you have plenty of money to share out. The British Council, which once rolled out UK artists as a light-handed but very effective means of promoting the country overseas, is nowso brokeit is threatening to sell much of its art collection. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, has established something called theSoft Power Council(“soft power, hard goals”, I kid you not – Armando Iannucci will be kicking himself for not having written it). Given the pre-existence of the British Council, this seems otiose. In combination, this failure of local authority funding, education and central government funding is truly terrible for the arts.Young working-class people being ‘blocked’ from creative industries, study findsRead moreWe are in a situation now where running a regional theatre in Britain is an almost impossible task.Tax relief on productions, brought in by the coalition government and fortunately to be continued under the current one, is hugely helpful. But the picture remains bleak. The rise in employers’ national insurance is another setback, and October’s budget had almost nothing helpful to the arts in it. There’s a dire need for capital investment: buildings that were created or renovated for the millennium are now looking rundown (the difference in our neighbouring European countries is shaming).In a reporton the national picture for the performing arts, Kate Varah, the executive director of the National Theatre, wrote that many colleagues she speaks to feel at “breaking point”. One of the report’s recommendations is a rescue package to stabilise organisations on the brink of collapse. Old timers say that the situation is worse than in the 1980s, and that is saying something.Are there any signs of hope? One good thing is that the former Labour arts minister Margaret Hodge, nobody’s fool,has been appointedto run a review of Arts Council England. In Scotland, arts organisations have just received asignificant funding uplift: it can be done. There is a spending review coming up in the spring: Labour has its opportunity. It would be radical but sensible to stop thinking about the arts as something that can be fixed as an afterthought, only after the NHS, defence and all the big departments have been dealt with. If the arts were put in a better place right now – and at such little comparative cost! – the benefits for children, for communities and for the economy would flow fast.On 25 February, it will be the 60th anniversary of Jennie Lee’s white paper on the arts. Lee was Britain’s first arts minister, in Harold Wilson’s government. The white paper laid out a commitment to culture in communities across the country, in simple, direct and sensible language. Its priorities were those of its era, but its spirit is still absolutely relevant. It is time for this government to live up to that promise.Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian’s chief culture writerExplore more on these topicsArts fundingOpinionArtsArts Council EnglandTheatreLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Perhaps it’s a trend that could – and should – catch onSat 1 Feb 2025 13.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2025 21.30 ESTShareIn his new book,Changing My Mind, Julian Barnes writes: “We always believe changing our mind is an improvement, bringing a greater truthfulness to our dealings with the world and other people. It puts an end to vacillation, uncertainty, weak-mindedness. It seems to make us stronger and more mature.”Well, maybe in literature, but not in politics, where changing your mind is akin to changing your underwear in public. Not a sign of strength, but a cause for embarrassment. There are few scenes of schadenfreude more keenly savoured in the political world than a dramatic U-turn, ideally with handbrake fully engaged and wheels loudly screeching.Peter Mandelson’sreappraisal last week of Donald Trumpmight be said to be a model of the form. Having called the American president a “bully” and “reckless and a danger to the world” in 2019, Mandelson performed a boldly ambitious 180 on Fox News by describing his comments as “ill-judged and wrong”.No doubt some will snort mockingly at what they see as sycophantic backtracking but “when the facts change”, as John Maynard Keynes is alleged to have said, “I change my mind. What do you do?” Although the great economist probably never uttered those words, Mandelson should nonetheless take comfort in them.Because the facts have indeed changed. The most telling empirical development since the original criticism is that Mandelson isnow British ambassador to the United States. A second, but no less consequential shift in real-world circumstance, is that Trump is once again the American president, a situation that looked highly unlikely six years ago.If weight of evidence is a sound reason for a reversal of opinion, then seriousness of threat is arguably a more effective one. As the president displays a gift for vendettas that would put a Sicilian don to shame, Mandelson understood that if he wants to remain ambassador a certain diplomatic reassessment was called for.There will be those that think the president’s menacing claims onGreenlandand thePanama canallend credence to Mandelson’s historic description of him as a “danger to the world”, but it is to our man in Washington’s tactful credit that he now recognises Trump’s “dynamism” and “energy’, even if it’s not yet fully appreciated by the Danes and Panamanians.The president’s number two, vice-president JD Vance, once wondered if his current boss might be ‘America’s Hitler’Yet we should not overstate the ambassador’s stoical ability to swallow his own words, for the true mark of principle in abandoning earlier and dearly held positions is a willingness to stand alone. Mandelson, by contrast, is in crowded if not necessarily good company.Many critics of Trump have found themselves experiencing a similarly diametrical change of heart, particularly since he was elected president again. Some can even boast an earlier Pauline conversion. After all, the president’s very own number two, vice-president JD Vance, once described his current boss as “reprehensible”, “a bad person”, and wondered if he might be “America’s Hitler”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If Vance could see the error of his ways, and be welcomed into the fold, there is hope for everyone now queueing up to salute the most powerful man in the world’s courage and fair-mindedness. Or presumably that’s the working theory.Perhaps it’s a trend that will catch on, and changing one’s mind will come to be seen in politics as not as a show of weakness and desperation but rather of maturity and truthfulness. There are certainly many in the world who would celebrate an outbreak of those qualities in the man in the White House. Then we really could change our minds.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonOpinionDonald TrumpJD VanceeditorialsShareReuse this content"

The fabled diary (probably a Surface Pro now) has snapped back open. The cigarettes are doubtless replaced by a Vaporesso vape.The new film,Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, again starring Renée Zellweger, is being released into cine­mas on Valentine’s day, which feels appropriate. One of the most emotionally charged days of the year for the return of one ofBritain’s more emotionally charged exports.In the new and fourth film, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) has been killed off in a landmine accident in Sudan (though he could be glimpsed in flashback). The dastardly Daniel Cleaver, played by Hugh Grant, returns (he was awol in the third, 2016, film,Bridget Jones’s Baby). Bridget has two new love interests. One, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, is her son’s teacher (I sense a Darcy proxy). There’s alsoLeo Woodallas a younger man from a dating app. An age gap loosely tying in with the ­cinematic trend for older women with younger men: Nicole Kidman inBabygirl, Anne Hathaway inThe Idea of You, and now Bridget with her Tinder squeeze.View image in fullscreenBridget, living her fantasy with Daniel Cleaver, played by Hugh Grant, in the 2001 Bridget Jones’s Diary.Photograph: AllstarStill, noteveryoneis mad about Bridget in the positive sense. For her fans, she’s the ultimate everywoman: messy, relatable, floating along on a tide of mid-price chardonnay. For others, she’s to blame for all the ills that have ever befallen modern womankind. And now? Do people love Bridget? Despair of her? Or is it that we demand too much of her? As we welcome back Bridget Jones, is it time to get off her case?Never mind her hapless ­demeanour and signature big pants, Bridget Jones is also huge global business. It’s a foundational UK cultural franchise – one of the most successful, and both female-led and female-facing. The first film,Bridget Jones’s Diary,grossed $280m. It has longevity, too. It’s 30 years sinceHelen Fielding­created Bridget Jones’s diary for a column in theIndependentnewspaper, 29 years since the first book and it’s still selling.If “bums on seats” is the ­metric, there’s a core, enduring ­fondness for Bridget Jones that extends to the cast.When I interviewed Zellwegerfor the release of her 2019 Judy Garland biopic,Judy, she was clearly keen to revisit the character (“I do know that Helen has written another book, so maybe …”) . Zellweger has now said she hopes it’s not, as billed, the final film.Just like that other 90s phenomenon, Oasis,Bridget also has a freshly minted Gen Z following. They seem to enjoy all the gags, ­observations, digs (“smug marrieds”, ­“fuckwittage”). Maybe more ­surprisingly, they also relish Jones’s chaotic honesty regarding her love life, smoking and calorie counting.Still, some criticisms against Bridget haven’t been without foundation. In retrospect, did Zellweger putting on weight,Raging Bull-style (so that Bridget could lament about it), result in a hyper-successful body-shaming franchise? In the films, the very concept of single life in London – indeed, London itself – looked sanitised, verging on steam-cleaned.Then there was Bridget’s promotion of dementedly frothy and frivolous womanhood (subliminal message: leave the thinking to the chaps!).View image in fullscreenBridget and another love interest, her son’s teacher Mr Wallaker, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, in the new film.Photograph: Photo Credit: Jay Maidment/Universal PicturesExhibit A in the case against Bridget Jones was her ­submissiveness around men. The ditzy drooping in adorable pyjama bottoms. Her glee when ­pursued by the amusing but wolfish, quasi-predatory, toxic romcom cad Cleaver. Though some of us had more issues with wet-blanket Darcy (was he supposed to be all women could really cope with?). Was Bridget the ultimate Pick Me girl? Was the whole concept Very PoorFeminism?By the time ofthe third film, in 2016,the concept of “Bridget Jones” itself seemed dated, worn, out of step. A creation not up to the task of manhunting in the app-heavy/online porn-ravaged grim new ­reality. Was Bridget Jones still ­everywoman or more of a dating woes dinosaur?Richard Curtis has nowapologised for the body-shaming and lack of diversity in the first two Bridget movies– as well as in some of his other films. Elsewhere, Grant has spoken about intervening in the new script about how Cleaver would be portrayed, which sounds wise. Post #MeToo, what amounts to office sexual harassment by Cleaver in the first films was never going to fly today, nor was Bridget lapping up any alpha male attention she could get.While it may be a stretch to imagine Bridget cooking crystal meth in her kitchen, director Michael Morris could herald a toughening of toneThere have been other significant changes in the Bridget camp. The new director is Michael Morris, who madeTo Leslie(the defiantly abrasive film ­starring Andrea Riseborough as a ­single mother who wins the lottery). Morris also worked on theBreaking Badspin-offBetter Call Saul.While it may be a stretch to imagine Bridget cooking up crystal meth in her bijou London kitchen, it could herald some toughening of tone. Moreover, the book that the new film is based on was a more poignant offering from Fielding (who had the experience of her own partner’s death, in 2016, to draw on).View image in fullscreenHelen Fielding at the world premiere of Mad About the Boy in Leicester Square, London, last week.Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImageIn truth, Bridget Jones needs to have changed. She isn’t just single this time round – she has to be older (in her early 50s). Singledom itself has changed, leastways the female mortal dread of it. Even in jest, it can’t be portrayed as some existential sinkhole of broken dreams. According to some reports, modern women are happier (and less fearful) than men about being single.Nevertheless, the key ­question remains: why is Bridget Jones almost uniquely held to account for sins against modern womankind? One might wonder at the pressure for her to “represent”. Is the idea of her being a good or bad role model somewhat reductive in itself? Male movie characters from the same early noughties era, such asAmerican Pie’s Stifler or Jason Bourne, never felt such heat.Put into perspective, Bridget’s weight obsession seems less a kind of unilateral feminist faux pas than part of a wider cultural ­framing, from the same comic annexe of British culture that produced “Does my bum look big in this?”.Similarly, romcom storylines ­continue to proliferate in everything fromBridgertontoOne Day(which Woodall also starred in). Certainly, the ongoing Bridget-bashing seems odd in a climate where the ­adaptation of Jilly Cooper’s naughty 80s-eraRivalsis widely celebrated. EvenSex and the Citygets off rela­tively lightly when you consider that Carrie Bradshaw’s entire ­character profile was moping about in nice shoes, waiting for Big to commit to her.Isn’t it time to ask: why are we specifically hard on Bridget Jones? Did she let us down? Did we somehow expect more from her? All these years later, is it all just a tad hypocritical?Fielding has said of her ­creation: “With Bridget, it was about the gap between how you feel you’re expected to be and how you ­actually are”. Quite. In some ways, it’s as if Bridget has been dragged into the realms of documentary (to be held accountable), instead of being accepted as a fictional character.We’ve forgotten that Fielding intended to lampoon how women were perceived to be, with a ­pastiche of inner dialogue. That Bridget was envisioned not merely as a ­manifestation of female faults, but also a shrug about them.Is this why Gen Z has taken to Bridget? Perhaps reading the old books and watching the films, her moans (Men! Weight!) seem almost radical now. This, after all, is the generation forced to doom-scroll, “ghost” and “breadcrumb” through their own problematic romantic realities, and only be strong about it.Young women know what it’s like to be constantly expected to be “filtered”. Say what you like about Bridget Jones, but she’s been ­anything but that.Explore more on these topicsBridget Jones' DiaryThe ObserverWomen (Society)FeminismBridget Jones's BabyBridget Jones: the Edge of ReasonHelen FieldingWomen (Life and style)featuresShareReuse this content"

But, she says, there are now a few things she won’tSat 1 Feb 2025 06.55 ESTShareBefore meeting Hayley Atwell, I am shown to an empty dressing room down the corridor from where she is rehearsing in London for her upcoming role as Beatrice inMuch Ado About Nothing, Shakespeare’s comic tale of love and deception. The room is empty save for a jug of water, some makeup and hairdressing equipment and, on the floor, a wonderfully garish pair of red patent leather platform shoes.Atwell will be wearing them as Beatrice, who she plays opposite Tom Hiddleston’s Benedick. “They’re my dancing shoes,” she says when she arrives. “Every morning at 11 the shoes go on and we dance [as part of rehearsal for the show]. It’s expressive, it’s modern but not at all gimmicky.” It turns out dancing in front of an audience is a first for her. Is she out of her comfort zone? “Actually no. The giddy freeness of it is more in keeping with who I am. It’s certainly not like the period dramas I’ve done, or all the serious stuff. People tell me all the time: ‘You’re so much funnier than I realised.’ I suppose it’s nice when people underestimate you in that way because it doesn’t take much to impress them.”It is hard to imagine anyone underestimating Atwell’s professional skills. After 20 years in the business, the actor – who is 42 – has proved herself a remarkable all-rounder, equally comfortable on the stage in a Jacobean tragedy (Women Beware Women), in TV costume dramas (Mansfield Park, Howards End, Brideshead Revisited), leading a Marvel series (Agent Carter), or dangling over a cliff in an upturned train carriage in an action franchise (Mission: Impossible). While being admitted into the Marvel universe shifted her career up a gear – Atwell made her entrance as Agent Carter in 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger before starring in the TV spin-off – it isMission: Impossible, where she co-stars with Tom Cruise, that has thrust her into Hollywood’s big league.View image in fullscreenBard work … Atwell and her Much Ado co-star Tom Hiddleston.Photograph: Marc BrennerAs Atwell’s star has risen, she has increasingly set boundaries when talking to journalists. Though she is never less than polite, I begin to wonder if the sculptural, knuckle duster-style ring she wears across two fingers is there as a warning to interviewers lest they get too nosy. While she will happily chat about current projects and the intricacies of performance, she is less keen on digging into the past, resisting what she calls the “narrative” that can develop around actors, by which she means the oft-repeated stories from earlier in their careers. “I always think of that Joan Didion quote: ‘I have already lost contact with a couple of people I used to be,’” she explains. “There’s often this narrative that, even if respectful and accurate to different times [of life], is quite reductive.”Family is also off limits, which I discover when I ask if Much Ado is her first job since having a baby last year (her partner is music producer Ned Wolfgang Kelly). “Who said I had a baby?” she asks, giving me a look. The Daily Mail, I say, when it ran photographs of her lifting her baby into a pram. Quite reasonably, this elicits a sigh. “The funny thing about the Daily Mail,” Atwell reflects, “is that it represents the base way we treat our artists. To be a woman followed by a man who is a stranger and who is hiding in a bush taking pictures of you without your knowledge, let alone consent, and selling it to a publication that pays to expose you … I know that I’m meant to just go: ‘OK, well, I asked for it [in this job].’ But it will never be OK with me.”As for talking about new motherhood, she continues: “I can’t go there on something that’s just too precious. And I’ve learned that to speak for anyone in my personal life that hasn’t chosen a life in the public eye, it does them a disservice.”I had to have five months of full-time physical training, to learn fight sequences, shoot a gun and work with knivesBack to theatre, then, which is Atwell’s first love, professionally speaking. “I love that you come in every day and you’ve got your script under your arm and a coffee, and you’re in the West End where there is this immediate feeling of a theatre community,” she says. “Theatre does for me what church can do for many people. I still really feel that.” The first thing she asked Much Ado’s director Jamie Lloyd – who cast her in 2011’s The Faith Machine and 2013’s The Pride – when he suggested she play Beatrice was: “Exactly how [traditionally] ‘Hey nonny nonny’ is it going to be?”Once he’d explained that sort of thing wasn’t his style, she was all in. She loves the play for its comedy but also for the complexities of Beatrice who is independent, upbeat and engaged in a “merry war” of wits with Benedick. “At one point, her uncle says he’s heard that she can have a nightmare and still wake up laughing,” Atwell says. “And I think there is so much sadness in that, because everyone around her thinks: ‘Oh, she’s so fun, you don’t have to worry about her.’ But she’s been so hurt that humour has become her coping mechanism and her armour.”Atwell’s lengthy break from the stage has coincided with her tenure on Mission: Impossible, where she plays Grace, the light-fingered, morally ambiguous heroine drawn into Ethan Hunt’s latest mission. The franchise has, she says, been all-encompassing, even though the last film, Dead Reckoning Part One – described by critic Mark Kermode as a “genuinely breathtaking romp” – was delayed by Covid. The eighth film in the series, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning comes out this May, “which means I’ll have been working on Mission for five-and-a-half years, which for me is unheard of. I mean, thank God I loved it.”Even now, they are still doing reshoots which involve “fleshing out scenes or changing things around. They’re always tinkering and looking to make things better. So even while [working on Much Ado], I can get a call at any time.” Working with Cruise has been a delight: “When I started, I was very aware of the rarefied air around him and how there is no one like him. And there never will be because actors aren’t made like him any more. He is a one-man studio and, to me, very kind, very professional. And because of that, I felt I was able to try lots of different things. There was never a risk of failure or being unsafe. Tom really likes people to thrive on set.”You can see why Cruise and Atwell work well together: both have a fierce work ethic and take their art incredibly seriously. Unusually for an action movie, there is no script when Mission: Impossible starts shooting and improvisation is actively encouraged (it was Atwell’s idea that Grace should be a pickpocket). “There’ll be Tom going: ‘From five years old I’ve always wanted to jump from a cliff on a motorbike’, and realising his dream. But with the rest, they’re kind of making it up as they go. When I auditioned, they were clear they were looking for someone who likes to work in this way, and that it’s not for everyone. I also had to be prepared for five months of full-time physical training and to be dynamic enough to learn fight sequences, to drift in a car with Tom, to be able to shoot a gun and work with knives.” Can Atwell confirm that this is the last film in the franchise? She pauses. “I mean, look, they called it The Final Reckoning. On the other hand, ‘Tom Cruise’ and ‘final’ are oxymorons, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he goes: “Wait, maybe …’ Although he has so many things he is working on, so I can’t see how another Mission would fit into that.”When Atwell was growing up, the acting seed was planted early. Her mother named her after the Whistle Down the Wind actor Hayley Mills and regularly took her to the theatre. A pivotal moment came when she saw Ralph Fiennes in Hamlet at east London’s Hackney Empire when she was 11 (she also lauds her friend Ben Whishaw’s Hamlet, specifically his “To be or not to be” speech, which she instructs me to watch on YouTube as a matter of urgency). Atwell’s parents divorced when she was little: her father, an American photographer and massage therapist, returned to Kansas where his daughter would spend her summer holidays; the rest of the time she lived with her mother in Ladbroke Grove, west London. She remembers at secondary school both her peers and teachers frequently asking her to read excerpts of books out loud. Previously a shy and introverted child, as a teen she wowed a school assembly reading a Puck monologue from A Midsummer Night’s Dream while wearing green leggings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I never doubted myself – although I did doubt the businessView image in fullscreenAtwell (right with her Agent Carter co-stars.Photograph: Marvel Studios/Sportsphoto/Allstar“The British side of me was all: ‘Oh God, that wasn’t cool at all.’ It wasn’t good to be passionate about anything at that age. But the American in me was all: ‘Oh my God, that was so great, I want to do it again.’ I loved the idea of being able to use language as a tool to make people feel something. I really felt that my intellect woke up.”Beginning acting proper, Atwell decided she wanted to “do it all”, meaning she didn’t want to stay in theatre or be marooned on TV police procedurals. So she trained hard, enrolling at London’s Guildhall School of Music and Drama where she went deep into the nuts, bolts and philosophy of performance. “I knew that’s what it would take to have a craft and sustain it over an entire lifetime,” she explains. “It was something that needed rigorous practice, experience, respect, reverence to the craft.”Emerging from drama school, she was “always confident. I never doubted myself although I did doubt the business. I’d see people around me who were incredibly talented [not working] and realise it’s often just down to luck who’s getting these roles. And that was liberating, because you think: ‘Well, I can only do my best, and there are all these other things I can’t control.’”Before superhero movies, directors were masters of the universe – now you can find them cowering in their trailersRead moreAtwell has spoken in the past about being told by a producer on the set of Brideshead Revisited to lose weight, which prompted her co-star Emma Thompson to leap to her defence and tell her: “You’re not a model, you’re an actor.” A decade ago, when she was playingAgent Carter, she also bemoaned being Photoshopped for the front cover of a German magazine. Today she observes “that thing” that women do of “filtering ourselves, or reducing ourselves to fit in or to people-please, partly because women don’t tend to be able to fail upwards in the way men do. But then comes that point where you go: ‘I’m really OK if I’m not liked.’ I think I’ve developed enough of an understanding of the business that I can stop worrying about that.”It’s with clear satisfaction that she says she is now more experienced and has clout in the industry. “I can express a preference for things. I’m in a more creatively fertile place that’s less fear-based, and where failure is totally allowed. I’m not asking for permission from others to try new things, as I can give myself permission and I’ll own it if it doesn’t work.” Best of all, she notes, is that “I can say no, I won’t do that. It’s not for me.”Much Ado About Nothing is atTheatre Royal Drury Lane, London, 10 Februaryto 5 April.Explore more on these topicsHayley AtwellMission: ImpossibleMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part OneWilliam ShakespeareMuch Ado About NothingAgent CarterMarvelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thouusands of years of evolution and desire, of empathy and curiosity, hardwire us to stare. The sight is visceral, electrifying, irresistible. It is familiar and forbidden; innocence and sin. The naked body is there in the bathroom mirror every morning, but to see another always feels like stumbling on a secret. A salt-twist of narcissism heightens our emotions, so that looking at a nude feels very different from admiring a watercolour landscape. Ethics come into it. In the history of portraiture, it is the nudes that are the most honest, or the most exploitative – or sometimes both.Photographs are part of the fabric of everyday life for all of us, in a way charcoal sketches or oil paintings are not. So when a nude is not a sketch or a painting but a photograph, the intensity ratchets up. The polite distance of the art gallery experience is stripped away, leaving gut reaction and raw emotion. All of which is to say: nothing like a nude photograph to get you by the jugular.At any given moment in culture, the bodies we see around us reflect the thoughts that are in our heads. Fertility, in early art. The heroism and physical prowess of the male body, in the classical era. An obsession with a narrow definition of womanly beauty, as gender roles diverged. The body means something new in every era. Nudity is not as simple as it looks.And above and beyond all of this, the body is beautiful. In Richard Avedon’s 1961 portrait ofRudolf Nureyev, the fine-boned delicacy of his ribs is breathtaking next to the gnarled sinews of his haunches. The sweet grace of his arms tells the story of how he changed dance by copying the gestures of female ballet dancers. The determined jut of his chin seems to hint at the story of his defection from the Soviet Union, just a month before this portrait. His lush nakedness surely foretells the sexual revolution that is about to spring into action. No wonder this was the man on whom Mick Jagger is said to have modelled his iconic frontman prance.The body is politicised terrain. Gender and race are laid bare. Pornography looks over your shoulder, while you lookThe body is politicised terrain. Gender and race are laid bare. Pornography looks over your shoulder, while you look. The history of nude photography – particularly portraits of naked women, taken by (presumably fully dressed) men – is the history of objectification. Jean-Paul Goude’s portrait of Kim Kardashian is an artefact of a changing hierachy of female beauty, in its unabashed celebration of her bottom. A giant peach at the dead centre of the shot, it is the bullseye on which the studio lights are trained. This is the photograph that will show future generations that bottoms were to the early 21st century what breasts were to the late 20th. But there is so much more going on besides. An echo ofMan Ray’s 1924 image Le Violon d’Ingres, a rear view of model Kiki de Montparnasse, sound holes painted on her back turning her body into a violin. But while de Montparnasse gazes impassively away, Kardashian makes eye contact with the camera. Trappings of her wealth and status – diamonds, champagne, opera gloves – emphasise her agency, in the billion-dollar empire she has built on this body.These photographs trace the parameters of what is beautiful and what is ugly, what is normal and what is strange, what is acceptable and what must be hidden. Born in 1811, conjoined twins Chang and Eng Bunker were exploited as a circus act for much of their lives, paraded for shock value. In the portrait here we see them smartly dressed, meeting our gaze proud and unruffled. We are invited to see them not as freaks but as equals. A century and a half later, model Winnie Harlow, who has depigmentation from vitiligo, challenges us again to rethink what we expect to see on a glossy Vogue cover. Nadav Kander’s portrait of actor Adam Pearson, whose face is distinctively shaped by the benign tumours caused by neurofibromatosis, is deliberately simplistic in its composition. A peaceable stillness interrogates any instinct to look away.‘There are images no leader ever wants to be seen’: 33 pivotal US presidential moments captured on cameraRead moreSometimes, looking at the body takes place within the frame. Haley Morris-Cafiero’s self-portraits, Wait Watchers, are a snapshot not of her body size but of society’s judgment of it. The artist stands to the right of this photo, staring at us, while the beautiful young couple to the left seem to be staring at her. The empty space in the middle of the frame asks us to pick a side. Elliott Erwitt’s photograph ofArnold Schwarzeneggerdraws you in with those giant muscles. Then you notice another audience, who got there before you. Hundreds of faces are tilted up to the podium, transfixed into stillness, as if Arnie has just stepped out of a spaceship, or a time machine from the future.The human body is a breathtaking machine of mind-boggling complexity and heart-stopping resilience. We are awestruck by the tiny “Benetton baby”, captured by Oliviero Toscani, umbilical cord intact and already bellowing with fury. Joe McNally’s portrait of Phan Thi Kim Phuc and her baby is a historical record of her napalm injuries, but the trust and tenderness in their closed eyes, skin-on-skin cuddle transforms it into a story not of war and violence, but of peace and love. Body language can be tragedy, drama, romance – even comedy, as in Aleksei Goloborodko, the most flexible man in the world, juxtaposing his unique contortion skills with the market-stall familiarity of his Nirvana hoodie.These photographs show us our bodies as we have never seen them before. Edward Weston’s captures a transcendental elegance in his lover Charis, as she dips her face from view like a resting swan tucking its head beneath a wing. The late Ren Hang, whose nude portraits of queer Chinese youth challenged government censors, lines up a mountain range of undulating bottoms. Arno Rafael Minkkinen’s self-portrait, pale limbs sandwiched between those of a silver birch, has a mischievous otherworldliness. It is as if you could step inside the frame, and into a magical world. There is nothing like an image of a body to expand your mind.Picture captions by Hannah J Davies and Gabrielle SchwarzLe Violon d’Ingres, 1924By Man RayView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Man Ray 2015 Trust/DACS, London 2025When the artist Man Ray photographed the back of his model and lover Kiki de Montparnasse, then layered a violin’s f-shaped holes over the print, it became one of surrealism’s defining images – and sparked debate about the power dynamics between artist and muse, and objectification of the female body. In 2022, it sold for £9.8m at auction – the most for any photograph in history – and a century later, people still get tattoos of the marks in homage.Generation Wealth, 1998By Lauren GreenfieldView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Lauren Greenfield/InstituteHer photography and films may have explored extreme wealth, society, body image and how they come together in a poisonous cocktail of self-interest and envy, but Lauren Greenfield retains a nuance and empathy even when examining the most rarefied members of society. In her 2018 documentary Generation Wealth, she met people before and after plastic surgery, among them Sydelle, who had a facelift in 1998 and is shown recovering after the procedure, with raw, peeling skin. Sydelle told Greenfield, “When I was in my 20s, people would always ask if I was a model. And then it got to, ‘Did you model?’ in the past tense. Now they don’t even ask me that. In American culture, unless you’re young, thin and beautiful, you’re discarded.”HJDWinnie Harlow for Vogue Netherlands, 2023By Nikki EsserView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nikki EsserThe past decade has seen a shake-up in the world of fashion, with the biggest magazine of all showcasing more diversity than ever. In 2023, Canadian supermodel Winnie Harlow, who has the skin condition vitiligo, graced the cover of Vogue’s Dutch edition in this shoot by Nikki Esser. In the interview inside, Harlow said, “I’m starting to see more models with vitiligo, I think that’s so beautiful. When I was little, I felt like I was the only person in the world with it.”HJDKim Kardashian breaks the internet, 2014ByJean-Paul GoudeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Jean-Paul GoudeThe day after Kim Kardashian appeared bare-bummed on the cover of Paper with the headline BREAK THE INTERNET in 2014, the magazine’s website accounted for nearly 1% of all online browsing in the US. In another image from the shoot, she pops champagne with a coupe glass balanced on her behind, flaunting the “slim thick” beauty standard (tiny waist, big bottom) Kardashian and her sisters popularised in the 2010s. The images sparked memes, outrage and imitations, as well as serious considerations about the look’s racial history.The champagne photo is a re-creation of Jean-Paul Goude’scontroversial Carolina Beaumont imagefrom 1976. The internet may not have been broken, but it was shaken.GSRudolf Nureyev, Paris, July 25, 1961By Richard AvedonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Richard Avedon © The Richard Avedon Foundation/National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian InstitutionRichard Avedon took this portrait of Rudolf Nureyev in Paris in July 1961, a month after the ballet superstar defected from the Soviet Union while on tour with the Kirov company. Nureyev transformed the role of the male dancer in ballet, advancing a physique and technical standard closer to what was expected of female dancers at the time – and assuming centre stage in the process. Here, Avedon’s trademark sparse white background ensures all the focus is on Nureyev’s gravity-defying pose.GSAdam Pearson, 2024By Nadav KanderView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nadav KanderFormer TV researcher Adam Pearson got his big break as an actor in the 2013 film Under the Skin. His facial condition – attributed to neurofibromatosis, which causes non-cancerous tumours to grow along nerves – was a key plot point, creating a moment of connection between a human character, played by Pearson, and Scarlett Johansson’s alien protagonist. His most recent film, A Different Man, saw him act opposite Sebastian Stan and continue to challenge ideas around image and prejudice. In this portrait by Nadav Kander, Pearson is rendered in an almost painterly, old master fashion. “I often say my disability is the least interesting thing about me,”he told the Guardian recently. “Don’t get me wrong, it’s still pretty goddamn interesting. But there’s more to me than that.”HJDNude (Charis, Santa Monica), 1936By Edward WestonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © 1981 Center for Creative Photography, Arizona Board of RegentsArt critic Hilton Kramer wrote that for modernist photography pioneer Edward Weston, the body was a “revelation of forms both voluptuous and abstract”. Here, his assistant (later wife) Charis Wilson is seen as a kind of sculpture. “When I ducked my head to avoid the bright light,” she later recalled, “Edward said, ‘Just keep it that way.’”GSUntitled, 2012By Ren HangView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Ren Hang (‘Wild’), Posterbook ed by OstLicht Wien, die Nacht Publishing 2015“China doesn’t allow outdoor nudity,” Ren Hang once said. “I’m careful taking pictures outside. If I see police, I’ll run. But I’m not hiding.” The self-taught photographer regularly ran into trouble in Beijing for his erotically charged images of naked figures arranged in striking and surreal poses. He nearly always used friends as models – often queer Chinese youths – giving precise instructions, then snapping with a simple point-and-shoot camera. Sometimes the subject appears in nature or the city; other times – as in this sea of bums – inside. In Hang’s photos, curator Nathalie Herschdorfer writes in Body: ThePhotographyBook, “bodies are mingled in a playful and sensual way” through creative composition.GSUntitled, 1999By Alison LapperView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alison LapperShe is perhaps best known as the subject of Marc Quinn’s 3.6m-tall marble sculpture, created while she was pregnant with her late son Parys, which sat atop the fourth plinth in London’s Trafalgar Square from 2005 to 2007. But Alison Lapper’s own contributions as an artist – including a first class honours degree in fine art and an MBE for her services to art – should not be overlooked. Having noticed physical similarities between her own body and the ancient Greek statue the Venus de Milo, Lapper – who was born with shortened legs, and without arms – has represented herself in sculptures, photographs, drawings and digital images. In this triptych of self-portraits, the artist, who overcame child cruelty and later suffered domestic abuse, is shown first defiantly staring down the camera, then gazing away mysteriously and finally, with her back turned fully to the camera, withdrawing herself from view.HJDOscar Pistorius on the cover of Time, 2013By Pieter HugoView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pieter Hugo/Time MagazineRarely has a fall from grace been as shocking as that of trailblazing Paralympian Oscar Pistorius, jailed in 2014 for killing his girlfriendReeva Steenkamp. The Time cover image, taken by Pieter Hugo for the New York Times, was to become one of the last pictures of Pistorius as we knew him: during his trial, he removed his famous “blades”, highlighting what his defence described as his vulnerability when he fired at Steenkamp, whom he claimed to have mistaken for an intruder.HJDSunscreen, 2014By Haley Morris-CafieroView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Haley Morris-Cafiero“It was almost scientific and clinical – I call them mundane performances.” So says Haley Morris-Cafiero of her Wait Watchers series, which saw the photographer and academic set up her camera in crowded locations – among them Florida’s Ormond Beach – to capture herself (on the right here) and the looks of passersby. As for what was really going through their heads, Morris-Cafiero says she “can’t speculate … But the images I chose capture those open-ended moments. There were other images where people were obviously making fun of me, and those were not nearly as interesting because you know what’s happening.” Her images went viral and became “one of the catalysts for a body image conversation, which is wonderful”.HJDNew Born Baby (Giusy), 1991By Oliviero ToscaniView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Oliviero Toscani 1991“Why would you want to see clothes in an advert? If you want to see the clothes you can see them in our shops.” This irreverent statement sets out the logic behind the controversial ad campaigns Oliviero Toscani masterminded during his tenures as art director of Benetton, from 1982 to 2000 and 2017 to 2020. For Toscani, who died last month, advertising was about grabbing people’s attention: his best-known campaign images included a man dying of Aids, a priest and a nun kissing, and two horses copulating. He argued that his work also put important social issues in the spotlight but, unsurprisingly, the ads drew criticism for their insensitivity. This raw image of a newborn girl named Giusy, with the umbilical cord attached, is among Toscani’s most censored images.GSProperty of Jo Spence?, 1982By Jo SpenceView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jo Spence Memorial Archive, The Image Centre, courtesy of Richard Saltoun GalleryBritish activist, writer and photographer Jo Spence was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1982. She began documenting her illness and treatment in a four-year series entitled The Picture of Health. This was not just a way to process her experience but also a “research project on the politics of cancer” – challenging the hierarchies of the medical establishment and shifting power back to the patient. Doctors had told Spence she needed a full mastectomy to remove the cancer but, after extensive research, she insisted on a lumpectomy, and took this self-portrait while preparing for it. The uncertainty of the words scrawled over her left breast alludes to the traumatic ordeal of being “marked up for amputation” by doctors. Spence described the image as “a pre-operative talisman to remind myself I had some rights over my own body”.GSVäisälänsaari, Finland, 1998By Arno Rafael MinkkinenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Arno Rafael Minkkinen, courtesy of Persons Projects and The Helsinki SchoolThe Finnish American photographer Arno Rafael Minkkinen has been taking his nude self-portraits in nature for more than half a century. This image of him squeezed between birch trees in Finland exemplifies his decades-long project of merging his body with the natural world. “The idea of slipping between these two dalmatian dudes”, as he calls the trees, wasto show “we are basically equal in the visual camp of things. We are just like the trees that grow, thrive and eventually tip over back into the earth or lakes.”GSThe original conjoined twins, 1865Photographer unknownView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Blank Archives/Getty ImagesBorn to Chinese heritage parents in 1811 in Siam (now Thailand), Chang and Eng Bunker were joined at their sternum and via fused livers. They were brought to the US as a circus act and went on to settle in North Carolina and marry sisters with whom they fathered 21 children. They died aged 62, hours apart. The siblings are shown here in their later years, finely dressed but looking serious. Their biographer, Yunte Huang, says, “In early photography, people worried that the more pictures you took, the more of your soul you were going to lose, so you wouldn’t smile.”HJDSonam, 2023By Steph WilsonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Steph WilsonWhat does a mother look like? That is the question driving photographer Steph Wilson’s ongoing Ideal Mother project, and it prompted wig-maker and hair artist Sonam to suggest wearing a prosthetic moustache modelled on her father’s from the 1970s. She also chose to wear a bindi in homage to the culture of her motherland. The image, with its playful mix of masculine and feminine elements, won the 2024Taylor Wessing photographic portrait prize– and a negative public response that took Wilson aback. “The policing of motherhood seemed to be more of an issue than I’d first understood,” she says.GSThe most flexible man in the world, 2018By Heidi’s BridgeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Heidi’s Bridge/Condé NastRussian-born Aleksei Goloborodko, a contortionist with Cirque du Soleil’s Luzia show, has been dubbed the most flexible man in the world. Goloborodko – seen here in an image originally published in GQ magazine – began contorting his body at the age of four, and dreamed of joiningCirque du Soleilfrom the age of eight, when he first auditioned for the company in Moscow. The 30-year-old trains for five or six hours a day, comprehensively stretching his body before he begins. His act elicits different reactions. “Sometimes audiences are scared, sometimes impressed, and sometimes they have no words,” Goloborodko said in a video filmed by the circus producer. “To see people think it’s a miracle, that’s the biggest motivation I can get.”HJDTwo Men Fencing, 1887By Eadweard MuybridgeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Eadward Muybridge, courtesy ofKingston Heritage Service, 2010In 1872, rail magnate Leland Stanford hired Eadweard Muybridge to find out if horses lift all four legs off the ground when they run (they do). Between 1883 and 1886, using multiple cameras with high shutter speeds, Muybridge made 100,000 further images of animals and humans moving in front of a precise grid. “History remembers him in fragments,”wrote Rebecca Solnit(also his biographer), “as a landscape photographer, as a technical innovator, as a key figure in the long march to motion pictures.”GSLisa Lyon, 1982By Robert MapplethorpeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation. Used by permissionLisa Lyon started weight-training after meeting Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1977. Two years later she became a minor celebrity when she won the first professional female bodybuilding championship. For Lyon, it wasn’t just about fitness, but “creating a new aesthetic and a new standard of beauty”. She wanted to appear neither masculine nor feminine but like “a sleek, feline animal”. Robert Mapplethorpe, known for his stylised black and white portraits, met Lyon at a party in 1979. “I had never seen a woman like that before. It was like looking at someone from another planet,” he said. Their collaboration resulted in 200 pictures in the next few years.GSSerena Williams in the Pirelli calendar, 2016By Annie LeibovitzView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Annie Leibovitz/© PirelliFor decades, the Pirelli calendar was known for its artful, risque images of supermodels. But in 2016 the Italian tyre company broke tradition, hiring Annie Leibovitz for a series of portraits celebrating women for their professional accomplishments. According to Leibovitz, this shot of tennis superstarSerena Williamswith her muscular frame on full view is “not a nude but a body study”. Williams herself is a vocal advocate for body positivity and diversity. As she once put it, “I love representing the beautiful dark women out there.”GSSydney 1 (Opera House), 2010By Spencer TunickView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Spencer Tunick,instagram.com/spencertunickHe began photographing people naked on the streets of New York at sunrise in 1992, and soon Spencer Tunick was staging mass nude shoots in public spaces around the world, winning fans including Lady Gaga. Here, 5,200 people gather on the steps of Sydney Opera House. Grouped together, the bodies lose their individuality. As one participant said, “It doesn’t feel sexual, it just feels tribal, a gathering of humanity.” Tunick’s goal is to challenge views of nudity and privacy. “Before I worked with groups outdoors, the only place to see nudes was old paintings, rock albums or tourist postcards,” he says.GSThe Pregnant Man, 2008By Kristian DowlingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kristian Dowling“I had seen them on Oprah and had all these preconceived ideas,” Kristian Dowling says of his first meeting with Thomas Beatie and his then wife Nancy. As a photographer for Getty Images, Dowling had pinballed straight from the Cannes film festival to the small city of Bend, Oregon. There, he would spend two weeks with the transgender dad-to-be, who was becoming a tabloid fixture in an era when positive trans representation was rare. But, to Dowling’s surprise, the “pregnant man” and Nancy were “just a normal couple, who desperately wanted a child … two people madly in love”.HJDThe man behind Body Worlds, 2003By Murdo MacLeodView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianGunther von Hagens was once described by the Guardian as having cultivated an image that is “part Dr Frankenstein and part Leonardo da Vinci”. The German anatomist, pictured opposite one of his creations, has preserved thousands of dead bodies by adding plastic polymers in place of fat and water. While they were initially made for medical teaching, public interest led him to show them at his wildly popularBody Worldsexhibitions, changing the way millions of people have viewed their own bodies. Perhaps unsurprisingly, von Hagens plans to undergo plastination when he dies.HJDUntitled, 1985By Rotimi Fani-KayodeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Rotimi Fani-Kayode, courtesy of Autograph, LondonThe late photographer came to Britain in 1966, aged 11, after his family fled the war in Nigeria. His trailblazing nude portraits capturing Black, queer life in 1980s London challenged the homophobia of Margaret Thatcher’s England during the Aids crisis. “Photography is the tool by which I feel most confident in expressing myself,” he wrote. “It is photography, therefore – Black, African, homosexual photography – which I must use not just as an instrument, but as a weapon if I am to resist attacks on my integrity and existence on my own terms.”HJDHumanae: Work in Progress, ongoingBy Angélica DassView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Angélica DassSkin colour is often summed up by racial categories such as “black” and “white”, but there is a much greater spectrum. Angélica Daas’s Humanae series takes that reality very seriously, matching subjects – 4,000 and counting, from all around the world, and from newborn babies to those nearing the end of their lives – to their exact Pantone colour equivalent. In a 2016 Ted Talk, the Black Brazilian photographer explained how combating racism had informed her work. “Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other,” she said, calling them a “mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label”.HJDSelf-Portrait (Back with Arms Above), 1984By John CoplansView image in fullscreenPhotograph: The John Coplans TrustA veteran of the second world war, British artist John Coplans spent much of his life in the US, where he lectured on design at the University of California, Berkeley, before going on to become one of the founding editors of the magazine Artforum, as well as a museum curator. In the 1980s he published books on photographers and began his own photographic experiments, which he called auto-portraits and created using a live-feedback video camera with an automatic shutter. In a 1990 interview, Coplans said, “The principal thing is the question of how our culture views age: that old is ugly … So I’m using my body and saying, even though it’s a 70-year-old body, I can make it extremely interesting.”HJDPhan Thi Kim Phuc with her son, 1995ByJoe McNallyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Joe McNally 2011Phan Thi Kim Phuc was just nine years old when she was depicted running naked from a napalm attack in South Vietnam, in a Pulitzer prize-winning photograph credited to Nick Ut and titled The Terror of War (the authorship of the photo hasrecently been disputed). Phuc, widely known as “napalm girl”, has gone on to become a Canadian citizen, Unesco goodwill ambassador and peace activist. Photographer Joe McNally got the opportunity to photograph her 23 years later and recalls, “I was very direct with her. I said, ‘Look, Kim, I have to see your scars. I have to see the damage that was done.’ And she understood.” There was, McNally says, a “wonderful happenstance” to the fact that Kim had just given birth to a baby, Thomas. “That little guy gave us the excuse to show a delicate moment between mother and son. He did us another huge favour by going to sleep immediately, so he just nestled on her shoulder.”HJDDiana Nyad, 2011ByCatherine OpieView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Catherine OpieIn 1978, aged 28, Diana Nyad tried what no one had done before: to swim from Cuba to Florida – 110 miles across treacherous open waters. She failed, but three decades later decided to try again. She finally made it – as documented in the 2023 biopic starring Annette Bening – in 2013, at 64, after several attempts. This photo was taken after her third, which she had to abort 90 miles in, thanks to jellyfish stings (the welts can be seen on her skin). Yet her expression, captured by photographer and friend Catherine Opie, remains resolute. As Opie says, “Growing older is not a death sentence. We are vibrant beings with incredible power.”GSArnold Schwarzenegger at the Whitney Museum, New York, 1976By Elliott ErwittView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Elliott Erwitt/Magnum PhotosThe expressions on the faces of the mostly male crowd veer from delight to bewilderment – and maybe jealousy – as they see the hulking future Terminator star up close. This image, taken by the photographer Elliott Erwitt in an exhibition titled Articulate Muscle: The Male Body in Art, shows Schwarzenegger at his iron-pumping peak, raising society’s expectations around male bodies and moving them on from the days when, as he revealed in his memoir/fitness guide Arnold, his growing physique had divided opinion among girls at his school. Some were attracted; others said his “repulsive” muscles gave them the creeps.HJDUntitled (Body of Dominick Didato), 1936By WeegeeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: International Center of Photography/Getty ImagesShocking as it may be today, the photographer Weegee, born Arthur Fellig, made his name in 1930s and 40s New York with grisly images of crime scenes – complete with their victims. Here, he captures the body of gangster Dominick Didato, slumped over on the pavement, his hat and gun strewn beside him. In Flash, his biography of Weegee, Christopher Bonanos said Weegee “was in the business of grabbing images that functioned as little one-act plays, both comedy and drama”, communicating “in a visual language both tabloid-reading subway commuters and arty museum curators grasped right away”.HJDHumanly Impossible, 1932By Herbert BayerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Herbert Bayer, Bridgeman Images © DACS 2025This playful self-portrait is part of a series of surrealist photomontages made by the Bauhaus-trained artist. Influenced by the New Vision photography movement, which espoused experimental image-making methods, Bayer blew up a print of himself holding a sponge in front of a mirror and painted over it to make it seem as if a slice had been removed from his arm. He then used an old-school airbrush before rephotographing the image twice – each step further hiding his handiwork. Today, of course, we all know there is little relationship between the bodies we see in photos and reality.GSThese 31 images show how the representation of bodies and society’s attitudes towards them have changed over the years.

In 2011, she played Cathy in Andrea Arnold’sWuthering Heights; her other film roles include theMaze Runnerseries,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No TalesandThis Is Christmas. Last year, she starred in two Netflix series, Guy Ritchie’sThe Gentlemenand the dual-language biographical miniseriesSenna. Scodelario makes her stage debut inEast Is South, a play about artificial intelligence at the Hampstead theatre from 7 February to 15 March. She lives in north London with her two children.1.MusicChappell RoanWatch the video for Pink Pony Club by Chappell Roan.She’s an incredible songwriter. She’s only 26, which I find hard to believe, because her lyrics and her voice seem so soulful and of another time. She seems to not conform in a way that most singers do nowadays, and I find that inspiring. I also think she’s starting a really healthy dialogue between fans and their idols and what that means, and what the boundaries are. My three-year-old daughter loves Pink Pony Club and sings it every day on the way to nursery, so it’s a nice memory for me whenever I hear it.View image in fullscreen2.BookSupremacy by Parmy OlsonI picked this up at the Science Museum gift shop – I was looking for materials to research AI for the play.Supremacytells the story of the rivalry between the two wealthy men who came up with the idea for AI – OpenAI’s chief executive Sam Altman and Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis – and the different moral compasses they adhere to. I’m trying to hold on to the idea that as humans, there must be something about us that can’t be replaced: the thing that makes us creative and that makes us love and hate and hurt. I hope that is fundamentally a human thing.3.TVGladiators reboot, BBC OneView image in fullscreenSheli McCoy, AKA Sabre, on Gladiators.Photograph: BBCI’m a 90s kid. I grew up watchingGladiators, back when there were only four-and-a-half channels – you could sometimes get Channel 5 if you smacked the top of the TV hard enough. I loved the storylines, the melodrama, the competitiveness; I loved the women, who were strong and fierce and beautiful. I’m absolutely obsessed with the new reboot. They’ve updated it for our times, but they’ve kept the nostalgia and the fun. I’m now watching it with my kids, and they’re doing the moves of the various Gladiators during the opening credits. And I also really fancy Legend.4.FoodBraseef Brazilian Butcher, Turnpike Lane, north LondonView image in fullscreen‘The most gorgeous cuts of Brazilian beef’: Braseef.Photograph: BraseefLondon has many wonderful restaurants, but my favourite thing to do when I get home from a long shoot abroad is to cook the food that I grew up with, which is Brazilian cuisine. I make a weekly feijoada, which is a black bean stew with various different cuts of pork, and brigadeiro, which is a kind of chocolate fudge ball. Braseef is a hub for Brazilians in northLondon. They do the most gorgeous cuts of Brazilian beef and meat, and they have a hot counter of little savoury snacks where you can get coxinhas and pastels, and they’re just absolutely delicious.5.PlaceParkland Walk, north LondonView image in fullscreenThe Spriggan sculpture on the Parkland Walk between Finsbury Park and Highgate in north London.Photograph: Michael Heath/AlamyThis is an old railway line that’s been converted into a nature reserve – they’ve just allowed the wildlife to grow around it.

There’s a famous sculpture called theSpriggan, who is a mythical north London folklore creature. There’s also abat caveat the end of it.

I was onSkinswith Megan, and she’s taken our experiences of being teenagers on a show that was hyper-sexualised, and her unique experience of going on to be a sex worker. The show asks the question: when an actor takes her sexuality into her own hands and profits from it directly, why is that seen as wrong? I saw it at theEdinburgh fringelast year and I’m really proud of her.Explore more on these topicsCultureOn my radarTelevisionFoodLondonTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her story of a girl locked in a cage with 39 women in an underground bunker on a nameless world was published in 1995 then slid into obscurity.Something has changed since then, because the novel’s tale of sisterhood and survival has become one of the hottest reads this year, drawing comparisons to Margaret Atwood’sThe Handmaid’s Taleand Octavia E Butler’sParableseries of novels.IWHNKM, as it is known in hashtags on BookTok, the ­community of TikTok users who havemade ­reading cool again, is in such demand that bookshops in the US have ­struggled to keep it in stock.In the UK it has become “a bestselling staple of fiction sections across our bookshops”, according to Waterstones’ head of books, Bea Carvalho. Its publisher, Vintage, which reissued the novel in 2019, sold 45,000 copies last year, an elevenfold rise on 2022.The novel has also appeared on the must-read lists of Service95, a newsletter, book club and website set up by Dua Lipa, one of a growing group ofcelebrities in music and fashion using their clout to support literature.“It’s described as speculative fiction/sci-fi, but it’s quite desolate in its writing in a way I haven’t found with other books,” said Hali Brown, who runs the Books on the Bedside TikTok account with her sister Hana.View image in fullscreenBookTok reviewer Hali Brown.Photograph: @booksonthebedside/TikTokThe narrator is the youngest of 40 captives and too young to remember her past. “All the guards are men,” Brown said, “and that’s all the women know about gender. They never really understand why they are there or how long they would be kept for.” Or any sense of time at all.They may be on Earth. They may discover the reasons why they are there. They may find other people. Or they may not.“It’s quite bleak but incredibly ­powerful,” Brown added. “It was unbelievably gripping for something so desperate.”Rather like the questions posed by the post-apocalyptic novel, there are few clear answers to why it has become so successful. Harpman was a Belgian writer who died in 2012 aged 82. Her family fled to Casablanca during the second world war in fear of persecution for their Jewish roots.The novel’s translator, Ros Schwartz, said she was ­gobsmacked by the turnaround of the book’s fortunes. “I guess it just strikes a chord with the younger generation, which it didn’t at the time – and whether that’s to do with ­publicity or whether it’s completely random, I don’t know. That’s one of the wonderful things about publishing – you never know.”Brown lists the book’s qualities as being “accessibly written” and “not very long” (about 200 pages), as well as resonating with the modern ­political context of attacks on ­women’s rights and diversity at work.“There’s lots happening in terms of women feeling like things are going backwards and not really ­understanding why or how that’s able to happen,” she said. The ­politics of Harpman’s world are sparse, unlike other dystopian fiction such asThe Handmaid’s TaleorThe Hunger Games. “Its political understanding of the world, I think, is relatable to a lot of young women,” Brown added.Perhaps another reason for the book’s success second time round is that Schwartz revised her ­translation with the benefit of two decades’ more experience as a translator, with works including a fresh version of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’sThe Little Princeand honours such as becoming achevalierin the FrenchOrdre des Arts et des Lettres.Schwartz’s first attempt in the mid-90s used words that were often ­similar to their French counterparts. The effect of the more direct ­translation was to make the ­narrator seem too erudite for a young girl kept in a cage without education and no ability to read or write. “So I went through it and got rid of all the Latinate ­language. It was about ­finding the right voice for the ­narrator that didn’t make her sound over-­educated but without making her sound stupid or a caricature.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nick Skidmore, publishing director at Vintage, said the book was originally published in ­translation asThe Mysteries of Silence, rather than the French title,Moi Qui N’ai Pas Connu Les Hommes.“A colleague of mine found this book at the time when Trump was in [his first term] andThe Handmaid’s Talewas back in the bestsellers’ list. So we read it and we were ­mesmerised by it,” Skidmore said. The book was print-on-demand, selling only “two or three a year”.View image in fullscreenA scene from the 2020 TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel, The Handmaid’s Tale.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamySwitching titles to a more direct translation of the French may be “one of the markers of its success”, he added. “I think the book captures this sense of the world where ­people are feeling bewildered. It’s a ­profoundly existential book, like some of the classics resonating with gen Z right now – Dostoevsky’sWhite Nights, for example. The type of stories that engage with very weighty ­questions of our existence.”Fyodor fever: how Dostoevsky became a social media sensationRead moreSusan Watkins, professor of women’s writing at Leeds Beckett University, said that dystopian fiction was often popular because it allowed readers to “identify with someone who’s resisting the totalitarian or authoritarian world in which they’re placed”.Another factor in the appeal of dystopian fiction, Watkins said, is the process of “cognitive estrangement”, a term used by critic Darko Suvin to describe how science fiction writers create unfamiliarity in an invented world so they can examine a social or cultural change in the present day.“For readers who perceive the threats to women’s reproductive rights and their sexual liberty, and the idea that feminism is being curtailed in large parts of the world, they’re seeing something of that in the text.”Explore more on these topicsBooksThe ObserverWomenTikTokFeminismSocial mediaMargaret AtwoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Made of aluminium and incorporating slender rods, it is one of dozens of “string” sculptures the Cornwall-based artist created during her five-decade career.UnlikeWinged Figure, many of these works have never been publicly displayed. That is about to change as they go on show in a London gallery in the first ever dedicated exhibition on Thursday.By contrast others, such asTheme on Electronics (Orpheus), were once put on display ... but not always to Hepworth’s liking.Mullard, the then well-­established British electrical components company, wanted a sculpture for its head office just off Tottenham Court Road, in central London. Inspired by Orpheus playing his lyre, it was placed on a motorised pedestal in the atrium of Mullard House. But, while Mullard was a top electronics company, the sculpture’s own electronics flopped.View image in fullscreenTheme on Electronics (Orpheus), 1956.Photograph: Piano Nobile/Private CollectionA trail of letters from a disgruntled Hepworth has been found by Piano Nobile, the west London gallery that is staging Barbara Hepworth: Strings. “She wrote several times until the early 1970s, after either passing by Mullard’s front window or going into its atrium,” says Luke Farey, director of research at Piano Nobile, who has trawled the Hepworth archives.“Barbara always took great interest in her works after they left her studio in St Ives,” says Dr Sophie Bowness, her granddaughter and an expert on one of Britain’s greatest female sculptors. Hepworth also always ensured that her secretary kept a copy of all letters. In one, from 1966, the sculptor wrote that “the turntable never seems to work”. Mullard replied that it would be replaced due to “wear and tear”.Hepworth later wrote that, “during the last decade, I have often been very dismayed to find that either the work was not moving around, or, if it did, it jerked”. In yet another letter, she suggested that “Theme on Electronicsshould stand quite still so there is no more fuss about its electronics motor”. But Mullard, determined to prove it was a competent electronics company, produced yet another motorised base.By the late 70s, Mullard had closed its London head office, while Hepworth herself had died in 1975. The work was transferred to the much larger electronics business Philips, which had absorbed the British company, and the sculpture itself was temporarily “lost”. It was then bought in the 2000s by a private individual, who is now loaning the work for its first exhibition display.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 1965, David Hitchcock, an art student at St Martin’s teacher training college in Lancaster and a Hepworth fan, was asked by his principal to contact the sculptor about buying a work. “The college would be honoured to have a piece of your work on our new campus,” wrote Hitchcock. But they were able to raise only £250. Not enough, replied Hepworth, who still had the sculpture in her studio. However, within a couple of years and with help from Peter Scott, a local art collector, St Martin’s had reached £1,000.Very generously, Hepworth agreed on the figure because they were students. Two college lecturers then had to make an 800-mile round trip, to and from Lancaster to St Ives, in a minibus to pick up the sculpture.Winged Figure 1was then placed outside the college chapel. “Unfortunately, some strings were damaged or even broke quite quickly because the sculpture was on a hill where it was affected by strong winds and heavy rains,” says Farey. Hepworth was contacted before agreeing that it should be returned to St Ives for restringing.View image in fullscreen'Winged Figure', a sculpture by Barbara Hepworth, the day after its installation on the side of the John Lewis store on 22 April 1963.Photograph: Roger Jackson/Getty Images“Barbara frequently received back at her studio works in need of conservation,” says Bowness. “Working under her supervision, her assistants did any restringing that the fishermen’s twine she favoured had failed.” Hepworth herself made regular visits to the harbour to buy twine. OnceWinged Figure 1was fixed, it was returned to Lancaster, but, at Hepworth’s insistence, placed indoors where it has remained. It is now estimated to be worth “probably north of six figures”, says Farey.Another work,Pierced Hemisphere (Telstar), is going on display publicly for the first time in the UK. Hepworth had been inspired by the 1960s tracking satellite Telstar, and the radio dish receiver at Goonhilly Downs, near St Ives. “Barbara was very excited by space,” says Farey, once telling her son-in-law Alan Bowness, father of Sophie, that, “I find such forms of technology very exciting”. She even accepted an invitation to go inside the satellite when it was on the ground. But the adventurous Hepworth, though by then in her 60s, wanted to go even further. She once wrote: “I would like to be an astronaut and go around the moon – perhaps for ever.”Explore more on these topicsBarbara HepworthThe ObserverArtSculptureExhibitionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Some wore traditional black outfits, while others sported pink ribbons or carried pink handbags. Mourners signed a book of condolence outside.In a eulogy, Denise Nolan-Anderson said of Linda: “She really loved going to premieres and opening nights, having her beautiful hair and makeup done, and always was the life and soul of any big occasion. She would have loved all the fuss today.”View image in fullscreenLinda, right, performing in the Nolans with (from left) Coleen, Maureen and Bernie in 1981.Photograph: Andre Csillag/Rex/ShutterstockEntertainers including the EastEnders actor Shane Richie and Paul Elliott, the comedian better known as Paul Chuckle of the Chuckle Brothers, were among those who attended the service.Elliott said of the singer: “She was just a fun, bubbly person. The world’s a darker place without her.”Dublin-born Nolan along with her sisters was part of the pop group the Nolans, best known for their 70s hit, I’m in the Mood for Dancing. The singer died on 15 January, aged 65, two decades after being diagnosed with cancer.Nolan lost her husband, Brian Hudson, to skin cancer in 2007. He was 60. A private service took place after the funeral at a crematorium, where she was laid to rest with her husband’s ashes.Her sister Coleen told the Mirror: “My first thought after she died was to put Brian’s ashes with Linda’s. So that’s what we’re doing. In life, they were never apart, so I’m glad they’ll be together again.”In 2005, Nolan was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent a mastectomy in 2006 and was in remission in 2011.In 2017, she fell on her hip and was taken to hospital, where doctors discovered an incurable secondary breast cancer on her pelvis. The tumours subsequently spread to her brain and ultimately stopped responding to regular treatment.In 2023 Nolan said she was preparing for “the inevitable” and that she had “sobbed” to her consultant when she heard the treatment was ineffective.View image in fullscreenLinda Nolan’s coffin.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty“I had feared something was wrong. My balance has been getting worse, and my memory – my sisters have to prompt me when I get lost in the middle of a sentence,” she told the Mirror.“Maureen came with me to the appointment and my Macmillan cancer support nurse was in the room, and I could just tell. I asked my consultant straight away: ‘Has it spread?’“When he told me, I immediately asked: ‘What do we do now?’”Nolan came down with double pneumonia earlier in January and was taken to Blackpool Victoria hospital, where she became comatose, her manager Dermot McNamara said. She died “with her loving siblings by her bedside”, he added.View image in fullscreenLinda Nolan with her husband, Brian Hudson, at their wedding in 1981.Photograph: Kevin Holt/ANL/Rex/ShutterstockNolan’s sister Anne posted on social media before the funeral that Linda would be “thrilled” if her friends and fans came to say their goodbyes.The Instagram message called Nolan a “beloved sister, friend and entertainer” and a “symbol of hope, humour and resilience”.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockBlackpoolLancashireIrelandNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Chris Petit and Emma Matthews have turned their fight into a filmPeter BradshawSat 1 Feb 2025 11.15 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2025 11.19 ESTShareThat uniquely valuable British writer and independent film-maker Chris Petit, creator of downbeat classics such asRadio On from 1979and An Unsuitable Job for a Woman from 1982, may not these days find it easy to get an outlet for his work; this would be appear to be his first feature credit for 15 years. But he and co-director, editor and partner Emma Matthews have emerged with a deeply personal movie: painful, complex, challenging and engaging.Petit and Matthews riff and free-associate on the themes of memory, memory-loss and the moving image on video and celluloid, but at the centre of this is an urgent story from their own lives. In his early teens, their son Louis, now 22, a talented artist and musician, began to have epileptic seizures that wiped out his memories of childhood; some of these were of the type nicknamed“Alice in Wonderland” syndromebecause of the resulting misperceptions of time and space – though these were scary, oppressive and brutal experiences very different from the beguiling world of Lewis Carroll.The heartless medical bureaucracy in the UK was unable to help, one consultant even advising Louis’s parents simply to “grieve for the child he once was”. But medical cannabis of the sort theNHSrefuses to provide, and which they now source in Europe means his seizures have stopped, although paying for it is still a constant worry.Using a third-person voiceover narrative read by Jodhi May, and home videos taken by Louis’ parents showing the upsetting reality of his seizures, as well as clips from early cinema, Petit and Matthews try to negotiate a creative way through this agony, relating Louis’ courageous engagement with his incomplete personal history to their own continuing projects, and making Louis’ story part of their own psychogeography.Petit appears to be working on a film project connecting the occult worlds of US author William Burroughs and James Jesus Angleton, CIA chief in the postwar period – and now connecting Louis with them. Burroughs brooded on the concept of a “pre-recorded universe”, a master tape of reality somewhere beyond our immediate perception, of which our actual experiences are fragmented and realigned versions, and this might indeed relate to Louis’ experience. With his hat and glasses, Petit does look a bit like Burroughs.As for Angleton, he was the shadowy figure behind all sorts of hidden black operations and dirty tricks, including experiments in LSD – and this, too, resonates with Petit’s detestation of the medical-pharmaceutical complex that let down his son. I have to point out that Petit’s interest in conspiracy theories is of an innocently liberal pre-Maga form, the second-shooter JFK kind not the anti-vaxx kind, although I am not sure I agree when the film’s narrator says “everyone knows” that big pharma “is in the lethal addiction business”. Those of us glad of our anti-Covid vaccines take a different view, but of course the narration is not straightforwardly the director’s voice.The film shows us Chris and Louis going on trips together to Finland and the frozen north, ostensibly to scout locations, but perhaps also – or in fact mainly, or solely – as a bonding exercise, part of the continuing reconnection. It is a tender and emotional family portrait.D Is for Distance screened at the Rotterdam film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsEpilepsyNHSHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

The fascination here is Tsoy’s exploration of Brahms’s passion for music of the past, specifically for his towering predecessors, JS Bach and Handel. Brahms transcribed works of theirs for piano, forging his own distinctive voice with theirs in an act of homage and discovery.The magnificent Handel Variations, Op 24 spins an unexciting little baroque theme into 25 variations of brilliant variety and ingenuity. Brahms set himself a particular challenge with the Chaconne from Bach’s Partita No 2 in D minor. Attempting to reflect the immeasurable yet compressed range of a work written for solo violin, he restricted his arrangement to piano left hand only. This gives a shadowy poignancy to Bach’s work, which Brahms described as one of the “most wonderful and incomprehensible” pieces of music.Tsoy brings his heartfelt and subtle recital full circle with arrangements of Brahms (Four Serious Songs, Op 121 and Chorale Preludes, Op 122) by later composers Max Reger and Ferruccio Busoni. Think of this as a probing meditation on creativity, or just enjoy listening.Watch Samson Tsoy perform Brahms’s 11 Chorale Preludes, Op 122: No. 10, Herzlich tut mich verlangen.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicThe ObserverreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fresh from three Grammy nominations, a banging 2024 summer hit –After Hours– plus a decade of sultry, sexually fluid songs to back those up, the California R&B singer should be on top of the world. Unfortunately, the air is very thin up there, especially at the tail end of a European tour.“We were two seconds away from cancelling,” the star says. “I’m on my deathbed. I was struggling to breathe and talk.” Medical attention has ensured the show goes on, butKehlaniasks the audience to help them out by doing a lot of the singing. “Support me, don’t judge me,” they plead.The latter request could be the overarching theme of Kehlani’s career. The singer has lived it not just in the recording booth or on stage, but in the full glare of social media scrutiny.Few artists in their position haven’t endured some degree of intertwining between life and art. But Kehlani – who came out as LGBTQ+ in 2018 and nowidentifies as a lesbian, preferring they/them pronouns– plies their wares at a particularly busy intersection of prurient online commentary. Continuing topics include their relationship status (the internet is abuzz with acustody battle), what they are doing with their bodies (working out a lot) and where they are in their mental health journey (it’s a journey).Kehlani battles on for an hour and a half, keeping the more acrobatic vocal runs in checkBut Kehlani’s candid apercus on lust, love and their struggles are what make their work so compelling. Some titanium-plated swagger and one of the more elastic voices in R&B just add to that appeal. On the front foot, Kehlani has been vocal in their support for the Palestinian cause, most visually in the video for the set opener, Next 2 U.To an overweening ex – and probably much of the internet – Kehlani has this to say (viaNunya, a track from long-ago 2019): “Ain’t nunya business to know who I’m with, or none of my shit, it’d be good for you to let it go.” And yet fan engagement with Kehlani’s work-life double helix is what has filled this partly seated London arena, where they have the second-largest audience outside their native San Francisco Bay area (the singer reports). So Kehlani battles on for an hour and a half, keeping the more acrobatic vocal runs in check. Their charisma fills the gap.Watch the video for Next 2 U by Kehlani.Other issues feel thornier, however. Kehlani’s most recent album, the livelyCrash(2024), flirted with rock sounds. Kehlani’s tour band have taken the brief seriously. The long-haired, leather-jacketed guitarist often solos, his instrument held vertically. A man-mountain drummer pummels a kit the size of a small house. “This is a rock concert!” Kehlani declares near the end. The cartoon bombast is not what Kehlani’s voice needs at this moment – or, perhaps, ever. The only place where this heavy treatment seems fitting is the carnal, heavy-liddedSucia, a borderline psychedelic cut fromCrash.But against all these odds, Kehlani and their catalogue deliver tonight.Toxic, from 2020, is the first track where fans break the sound barrier with their anticipatory screaming. “That damn Don Julio made me a fool for you,” Kehlani mourns ruefully.View image in fullscreenKehlani and dancers at the O2.Photograph: Andy Hall/the ObserverTowards the end, there isRing, Kehlani’s 2018 collaboration with Cardi B, where the attitude of both artists amplified the track’s heady yearning. Kehlani’s ample confidence was the topic of another summer mini hit last year – up-and-coming UK singer Jordan Adetunji’s Kehlani,whose remix Kehlani performs tonight.You can tell the singer is especially happy to see their one live guest, not least because it gives them a few verses to catch their breath before attempting some vocal fireworks. Kwn (pronouncedkay-wuhn) is a homegrown east London R&B artist whose appearance onCrashwas one of the album’s notable introductions. (This time last year, Kwn was delivering Amazon parcels, she confides.)Clothes Offis a sapphic slow jam that sees the two singers facing off, trading melismas – one of the highlights of the set.R&B star Kehlani: ‘You can’t believe that everybody means what they say about you’Read moreThe adulterousWhen He’s Not Thereis another keeper with some particularly snappy writing. “I won’t end a happy home, but I’ll leave a condo broken,” purrs Kehlani, wickedly. It comes fromWhile We Wait 2, a more R&B-leaning mixtape released in the wake ofCrash.Borderis another sit-up-and-listen moment tonight, a mixtape cut that addresses Kehlani’s “demons and disorders” directly. “My exes want to see me in a padded room,” they sing, vulnerably, “But I think I need nature and a Valium.” Given the public storms they have weathered, it feels like it takes more than a mere fever to give Kehlani pause tonight.Explore more on these topicsKehlaniKitty Empire's artist of the weekR&BO2Pop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

The reasons are straightforward: snow is comparatively simple to render on screen, while the lilting rhythms of carving a path down a virtual mountainside encourage the sort of flow state that attracts many players to the medium.Lonely Mountains: Snow Ridersis not attempting to be the most realistic depiction of the sport, but rather an impressionistic interpretation that captures its essential spirit. It meets this goal with grace and flair, a game that democratises the joy of skiing, an increasingly rarefied activity in this climate-bewildered world.You first choose your skier, a blocky yet adept cipher, then take on a series of slopes across various snow-draped hills, racing to pass a series of generously spaced checkpoints in as quick a time as possible. These courses are not like racetracks; there are, instead, dozens of naturally formed routes and shortcuts, and much of the challenge derives from picking the optimal path down the slope, while still being able to adapt to accidents of physics that inevitably upset your plans.Glide into a rock or a pine tree or fall from too great a distance, for example, and your skier will crumple, cartoonishly. No matter: injury and death is but a momentary state, and, with a stab of the “respawn” button, you’ll be back on your skis, spirited back to the most recent checkpoint. It’s possible to skip entire portions of a slope but if you miss a checkpoint you’ll need to restart the entire run – an understandable limitation if the leaderboards (which at time of writing already have more than 100,000 entries) are to remain meaningful marks of attainment.It’s not all frenzied competition. A Zen mode allows you to “explore the mountains on your own terms”, as the game puts it, delightfully. This option showcases the exquisite execution, the delicious “game feel” as you become increasingly proficient at taking corners at speed, kicking up clouds of glistening snow dust, before leaping into the clear air, your skis two arrows aimed at the sun.Watch a trailer for Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders.Explore more on these topicsGamesSimon Parkin on gamesSports gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

TitledThe Feminist, it follows the life of a man who turns from a bell hooks-reading Supporter of Women into a bitter moderator in an online forum about how feminism is a cancer. Rejection has hardened him over the years. In university, he always supported his friends – predominantly women – throughout their emotional crises, and was surprised to discover that his attentiveness was not rewarded with love or sex. After university, his online dates ghost him. He fears the nerves of his penis have been dulled by vigorous masturbation. The Feminist satirised in witty and lurid detail a familiar type in the online zeitgeist: the staunch male ally, emerging out of the political currents of #MeToo and the movement against Trump. The more vocal they were, the more people began to wonder what they were trying to hide.Now, half a decade later, The Feminist and six other short stories have been gathered in an interlinked collection. I had enjoyed The Feminist when it was first published, but wondered how it would read today, when the earnest #Resistance rhetoric of the late 2010s internet has morphed into something more anarchic, and the dominant pose of online masculinity is not one of unearned sanctimony. The Feminist now feels like a prescient prequel to our current moment, while Rejection’s other stories take aim at wider subjects, following a range of characters: a woman who self-destructs after being romantically rejected; a man who comes out as gay, but really it’s his sadism he’s reckoning with; a disaffected Twitter addict who refuses all attempts to define them according to race, gender, and sexuality: they want to live beyond identity, that tiresome predominant organising category of our era. What these characters share is a basic inability to exist in the world, which to them is a dishonest place governed by stupid yet mysterious codes, populated by hypocritical idiots. “Love is not an accomplishment,” one character observes, summing up a key tenet of the book, “yet to lack it still somehow feels like failure.”What makes the stories so readable – what made The Feminist such a hit – is Tulathimutte’s magnetic prose, at once entertaining and acute. “Twitter,” one character observes of the website now known as X, “was the right word for it, birdsong being a Darwinian squall mistaken for idle chatter.” Few of the staple features of fiction are found in these stories. There is hardly any description of external settings; the characters routinely refuse any opportunity for growth; time passes quickly and insignificantly in their lives, liquid and unreal. In fact, Rejection feels like being inside the internet. At times it mimics the language of twentysomething online spaces (of a disappointing man: “we hate him now yes? typical venus in sag”). More broadly, the stories capture the spirit of our doomscrolling age: the paranoia, the dread, the defensiveness and resentment that has curdled into political death spirals everywhere. There is something cleansing about being confronted with these realities. One dissenter in The Feminist’s online forum declares: “This place is like staring into a cursed mirror where the longer you stare at it the uglier you get”. Reading Rejection is similarly compelling.The book concludes with a meta-text listing everything wrong with it: an editorial rejection letter which asks if Tulathimutte is actually projecting his own insecurities on to his characters.Fiction, as the previous stories have shown, is infinitely more interesting than this sort of pop psychology. But the letter is also an indirect meditation on the act of writing, and the terror of vulnerability. Every one of Rejection’s protagonists, the letter writer observes, becomes “a writer of some sort, committing acts of grotesque self-exposure – and self-destruction – by text”. Some of these texts go viral, interpreted in ways outside their authors’ control, making self-exposure and self-destruction feel like the same thing. And yet as the characters double down on their screen-based isolation, they compulsively write and write, both courting and fearing the possibility of being seen and even understood. “It hurts to be read,” the letter concludes. It also hurts not to try.Rejection by Tony Tulathimutte is published by 4th Estate (£16.99). To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

A horror about two young people whose nostalgic connection to an old TV show warps their sense of reality, the film manages to visually mimic the old VHS horrors of the 1980s while maintaining a strong modern message about gender identity. Martin Scorsese is a fan, calling it “emotionally and psychologically powerful.” More than anything, though, it will creep you out to a stupendous degree.SHOpen Fire, 11.10pm, Talking Pictures TVFor those wondering how Paul Greengrass was able to transition from ITV journalist to Hollywood power player, the answer is with films like Open Fire. This is his first work of filmed fiction; a 1994 made-for-TV movie about the real-life manhunt for escaped criminal David Martin, and the police blunder that led to a national scandal. As a finished piece of work it’s undoubtedly a little rough around the edges, and very much of its time.

The sanctuary was initially used by members of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit (Spiritans) to train young missionaries. In the past 20 years, the Spiritans have instead run a reception centre here, renting rooms to local groups and running ecology events in the gardens. Accommodation is open to all, with dormitories, single and family rooms, and in-house catering. Guests are welcome to join the Spiritans for daily prayers.

I just burst into tears,” Drayton, now 63, says. “I’d done a lot of travelling overseas and had a caravan and knew it was time.“I told my three boys I’d see them in a year, but then I never came home.”Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletterShe was on the road for almost six years, travelling to some of the most remote parts of Australia. Her guide was Australian Bush Pubs, a coffee table book by Craig Lewis and Cathy Savage, which she used as an itinerary and keepsake, marking those she visited off on a list. “Whenever I got to the pub, I had the publican sign the book,” she says.View image in fullscreenRobyn used the book Australian Bush Pubs as her travel guide.Photograph: Dean Sewell/The GuardianFrom Cape York to the south coast of Western Australia, along the Oodnadatta Track and theGibb River Road, Drayton drove with her beloved 13-year-old Shetland sheepdog, Porto, in the passenger seat. The experience “was over and above my expectations,” she says.Drayton is one of a growing number of older women adopting nomadic lifestyles on Australia’s roads.Recent researchfrom the University of Technology Sydney found women were challenging traditional views of ageing, travelling solo around the country in search of adventure, personal growth and new beginnings.PhD candidate Margaret Yates interviewed 29 solo female travellers to explore their motivations and experiences. Most were over 60 and described themselves as retired.View image in fullscreenRobyn in her caravan with her companion, Porto. Over several years she has notched up around 200,000km.Photograph: Dean Sewell/The GuardianYates says the women told her they loved the freedom, independence, and autonomy afforded when travelling alone. The interviews revealed women who had subverted societal expectations of how women should live and age, instead showing older women growing in self-confidence.“They love going to new places, doing new things and meeting new people,” Yates says. “They were in awe of how big, beautiful and diverse the country is. They grew in confidence dealing with any situation and travelling and felt healthier because of a less stressful lifestyle.”Caravan sales in Australiaspiked in 2021 with registrations jumping 4.2%. Some of this may be a matter of practicality, as the housing crisis causes many to opt for amore transient lifestyleout of necessity.View image in fullscreenRobyn is also a keen amateur photographer, documenting the landscape and people as she crossed the country.Photograph: Robyn Drayton/SuppliedBut Yates says the Covid pandemic also prompted people to reassess their priorities, fuelling a desire for meaningful experiences over material possessions.She says generational trends of increased financial independence and improved healthcare – including telehealth options – opened doors for women to travel solo.There is no firm data to back up Yates’s suspicion of an increasing trend – only a rise in membership to social media groups dedicated to solo women caravanning around Australia. It’s possible some of those members are just “travelling vicariously”, she says.The community network, both online and off, is a significant part of the experience, Yates says. Her research found that many solo female travellers developed informal networks at campgrounds and rest stops, sharing tips, stories and support.View image in fullscreen‘I think women are more adventurous and want to get out and enjoy themselves later in their lives’ … a photo from Robyn’s travels.Photograph: Robyn Drayton/Supplied‘I’ve learned a lot about myself’While the women who spoke to Yates say they generally felt safe, challenges including vehicle breakdowns, communication failures and the isolation of remote areas did cause minor hitches in the road. The stereotypes of both grey nomads and being older women also follow them.Before Drayton set out across the Nullarbor, she pulled her caravan in for a service in Port Lincoln. “It’s important to know your vehicle and be able to stand up for yourself,” she says. “I was having this conversation [with the mechanic] who tried to rip me off big time. He ended up saying: ‘oh, all you grey nomads are rich anyway’.“I said, ‘how dare you have that attitude’. I’ve met lots of women on the road and everyone has their own story to tell. Some are fleeing domestic violence, some are widows or are divorced or don’t have a home.”One of the study participants, Vivian*, who asked that her real name not be used, has been on the road for nine years. It has brought some tough lessons.View image in fullscreen‘Over and above my expectations’ … Robyn with Porto and her caravan.Photograph: Dean Sewell/The Guardian“If you are in a situation where you’re in the middle of nowhere and you get a flat tyre and there’s nobody about, you go, well, I’ve got to deal with it,” she told the study authors. “If I don’t deal with it, I’m stuck here. I’ve learned a lot about myself, my weak points and my strong points as well.”Now in her mid-60s, Vivian says travelling around Australia has been the best choice she has ever made.“I knew it wouldn’t be easy and I knew there’d be hurdles and tough times,” she says. “That probably made me even more determined.”Drayton says the opportunity to travel solo provided the chance to reflect on herself, her family, and what she wanted to achieve in her life.She’s set up in Nelson Bay, north of Newcastle, for the time being, but says she’s looking forward to her next adventure.“I think women are more adventurous and want to get out and enjoy themselves later in their lives,” she says.Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletterExplore more on these topicsThe rural network, VictoriaRural AustraliaAustralia holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On a recent visit, I once again fell for the fish and conch rotis, and mouthwatering jerk chicken, and I particularly love the use of spicing, with turmeric-stained curries scented with allspice, coriander seeds, fenugreek and cinnamon. Those curries are mostly mildly hot, and served with mounds of steaming rice and beans to mop up their juices, as well as chutneys made with local fruit. Sunny flavours for the bleak midwinter.Caribbean mutton curry (pictured top)Goat and mutton are popular throughout the Caribbean, and their flavour mellows and sweetens with slow cooking. Both are stunning in this soothing, aromatic curry.Prep15 minCook2 hr 30 min+Serves61.2kg mutton shoulder, or goat, cut into 10-12 large piecesSalt and black pepper4-5 tbsp vegetable oil, or butter2 onions, peeled and sliced1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger4cm piece fresh turmeric root, or 2 tsp ground turmeric1scotchbonnet chilli4 largegarlic cloves, peeled1 cinnamon stick4 tsp coriander seeds2 tsp fenugreek seeds2 tsp cumin seeds1 lime,plus extra, quartered, to serveSpiced banana and date chutney(see recipe below)Bring the meat to room temperature, then season generously. Put a large casserole on a high heat, add one and a half tablespoons of the oil, then sear the meat in two or three batches, until nicely golden on all sides, adding a little more oil with each new batch. Once browned, transfer the meat to a large bowl.Turn down the heat to medium, add the onions to the pan with a final tablespoon of oil (or a large knob of butter), and cook, stirring, for 10-12 minutes. Meanwhile, scrape the skin off the ginger and turmeric roots, then finely chop both and add to the onion pan. Stir and season well.Deseed the scotch bonnet, then finely chop it and the garlic, and stir both into the onions, along with the cinnamon stick. In a separate small pan, gently toast the remaining spices for a minute, then grind to a powder in a spice grinder (if you don’t have one, tie up the whole spices in a muslin bundle). Add the ground spices (or spice bag) to the onion mix, and stir to spread them about.Try this recipe and many more of Thomasina’s creations on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Return the meat to the pan, pour in enough cold water just to cover, and bring slowly up to a simmer. Leave to cook very gently for two to three hours, until the meat is soft and falling apart.The flavours improve over time, so make the curry in advance, skim off the excess fat once it is cooled and reheat gently. Check for seasoning, add more salt and pepper, if necessary, as well as the juice of a lime, then serve with rice and beans, some steamed greens, and the banana chutney below.Spiced banana and date chutneyView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ spiced banana and date chutney.Traditionally made with plantain, this chutney is also delicious with banana and is a great way touse upany that are threatening to spoil.

I made it, then Hugh, my husband, made it, and then the friends we’d cooked it for also made it. Conclusion: people love it. Staring at a gnarly celeriac, some tins of tomatoes and lentils, plus a couple of handfuls of cashews, you’d never imagine they’d create something so moreish. But that’s the strength of great knowhow (Jenny’s) and the transformative power of time and heat on even the most simple of ingredients.Jenny’s celeriac and lentil gratinThe original recipe is vegetarian and uses double cream and cheese, but I’ve used a homemade cashew cream, which you’ll need a blender for. The nutritional yeast, which is there in lieu of the cheese, adds a fantastic cheesy flavour and is available in most UK supermarkets.Prep15 minCook1 hr 20 minServes4-665g roasted and unsalted cashews150ml whole oat milkExtra-virgin olive oil1 large brown onion, peeled and finely diced6 garlic cloves, peeled and minced800g tinned chopped tomatoes(ie, 2 x 400g tins)1 medium celeriac(850g-1kg), peeled, quartered and finely slicedFine sea salt800g tinned brown lentils in water(ie, 2 x 400g tins), drained15g flat-leaf parsley, finely choppedJuice and finely grated zest of ½ lemon100g dried breadcrumbs20g nutritional yeastFirst make the cashew cream. Put the cashews in a heatproof bowl, cover with just-boiled water, leave to soak for five minutes, then drain. Tip the nuts into a blender, add the oat milk and two tablespoons of oil, and blitz to a smooth cream – it should be the consistency of double cream, so if need be, add a little more milk to loosen.Put four tablespoons of oil in a large, wide pan for which you have a lid, and set it over a medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the onion and fry, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, until soft and starting to turn golden. Add two-thirds of the garlic (save the rest for later) and saute for another two minutes.Stir in the chopped tomatoes, then add the celeriac and a teaspoon and a half of salt, cover and leave to simmer on a low to medium heat for 25 minutes. Stir in all but four tablespoons of the cashew cream, leave to bubble for another five minutes, then take off the heat.While the celeriac is cooking, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Tip the drained lentils into a medium bowl and add two tablespoons of oil, the remaining four tablespoons of cashew cream, the chopped parsley, the lemon juice and zest, and a half-teaspoon of salt, mix well and set aside.In a small bowl, mix the dried breadcrumbs with the reserved minced garlic and the yeast, add a big pinch of salt, then stir in two tablespoons of oil.Taste both the celeriac and the lentils to test for seasoning, and adjust if required. Line the base of a large, shallow ovenproof dish with a third of the celeriac mixture, then top with half the lentils. Lay another third of the celeriac on top, spoon on the remaining lentils and finish with the last third of the celeriac. Evenly sprinkle the breadcrumb mix all over the top, then bake for 30 minutes. Take out of the oven, leave to rest and settle for five to 10 minutes, then serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesThe new veganVegan food and drinkFoodMain courseTomatoesNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"

To prepare the giblets, give them a rinse, then cut away any thick fat or ventricles from the top of the heart and liver.Cibrèois a traditional Florentine sauce made using chicken offal, and often also includes the cockscomb, wattle and gonads, but I’ve adapted it to turn a more accessible bag of giblets into this remarkably flavourful dish.Chicken offal sauceCibrèomakes for a delicious amuse-bouche while you’re waiting for a chicken to roast, or turn it into a main course by mixing it through cooked pasta. One bag of giblets should make a nice snack for four to six people, a starter for two or a main course for two when mixed with pasta. If you need to multiply the recipe to feed more people but don’t have any more giblets to hand, buy some extra chicken livers and/or hearts to make up the difference.The recipe calls for chicken stock, but there’s so much flavour in the offal that just water will work just fine, too. I made a very light stock by cooking the chicken neck with the shallot skin, some other veg trimmings and 150ml water for 15 minutes.Cibrèo is usually thickened with egg yolk, but I used a whole small egg, to avoid any potential waste. It thickened the sauce perfectly, but be careful to add it when the contents of the pan are at a low temperature, and slowly bring the heat back up to create a thick, velvety sauce.Serves2 as a starter or main course with pasta15g butter15g olive oil6 sage leaves1 shallot, or 1 small onion, peeled and finely diced80-100g bag chicken giblets– heart, liver, lungs, kidney and crop, if included, cleaned (see main introduction); save the neck to make the stock (see recipe introduction)Sea salt and black pepper1 tsp flour, for dusting30ml white wine, or 15ml cider vinegar or wine vinegar120ml chicken stock, or water1 small eggJuice of ¼ lemon, or 10ml cider vinegar or wine vinegar1 pinch ground nutmegCooked pasta or crusty bread, to serveMelt the butter and oil in a wide saucepan on a low-medium heat. Fry the sage leaves untilcrisp, then scoop out on to a plate. Add the diced shallot to the hot fat and saute, stirring, for five minutes, until translucent.Chop the giblets into rough pieces, season with salt and toss withthe flour to coat. Add to the hot fat in the pan and fry, stirring, for five minutes. Add the wine, boil for a minute, then pour in the 100ml of the stock and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer, cook until the sauce thickens a little, then turn down the heat to very low.In a small bowl, whisk the egg, lemon juice and the remaining chicken stock, then stir into the giblet pan and return to a boil, stirring the whole time. Once the sauce has turned thick and luxurious, season with salt, black pepper and ground nutmeg to taste.Serve at once, either tossed through cooked pasta (add enough of the pasta cooking water, or more hot stock, to create a velvety sauce) or simply with crusty bread. Either way, garnish with the crisp sage leaves.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkWaste notFoodFood wasteChickenMeatVegetablesPastafeaturesShareReuse this content"
