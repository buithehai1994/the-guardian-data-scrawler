Its candidate Andrea Jenkyns, the former Conservative minister, easily won the new mayoralty of Greater Lincolnshire, and the party also took the mayoralty in Hull and East Yorkshire.Graph of byelection resultBy late on Friday, Reform had taken control of 10 councils – Durham, Kent, Lincolnshire, Lancashire, Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, North Northamptonshire, Doncaster and West Northamptonshire – with a gain of 648 seats.The Tories lost all 15 of the councils they were defending.‘They really are all horrible’: political anger marks Reform UK’s Runcorn winRead moreWhile moving from a protest party to one with responsibility for policy and delivery could bring risks, Farage used a victory rally in County Durham to pledge a pushback against equality and diversity programmes and allowing council staff to work from home.“I would advise anyone who’s working for Durham county council on climate change initiatives, or diversity, equity and inclusion, or thinks they can go on working from home, I think you had all better really be seeking alternative careers very, very quickly,” he warned.Farage also said Reform would resist asylum seekers being accommodated in Reform-run areas, while Jenkyns called for them to be placed in tents. “I say no to putting people in hotels. Tents are good enough for France, they should be good enough for here in Britain,” Jenkyns said, an apparent reference to the makeshift camps used by asylum seekers along the French coast.A rout of Conservative councillors had been widely predicted, including by Badenoch, in part because the party had done so well the last time the seats were contested, during the short-lived Covid “vaccine bounce” under Boris Johnson in 2021.But the shedding of so many seats – by late Friday there was a net loss above 50% – plus the fourth place in the projected vote share will place renewed pressure on Badenoch, whose insistence of a slow buildup on policy ideas has worried some of her MPs.The Liberal Democrats made renewed gains in previously Conservative heartlands, taking control in Oxfordshire as the Tories lost 15 seats, and also taking over in Cambridgeshire and Shropshire. The Greens picked up dozens of new councillors and came third in the West of England mayoral race, one they had harboured hopes of winning.More surprising was the scale of Labour losses, with the party losing proportionally fewer seats than the Tories, but with some major localised drubbings, such as a net loss of 38 seats in Durham and 27 in Lancashire.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer visited a defence factory in Luton on Friday.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesSpeaking on a visit to a defence factory in Luton, Starmer said: “What I want to say is, my response is, we get it. We were elected in last year to bring about change … I am determined that we will go further and faster on the change that people want to see.”Labour officials accepted that some results had been bad but in part blamed a greater-than-expected collapse in the Tory vote, which helped Reform make gains in three-way contests.A Labour source said there were some signs of government policies starting to resonate with voters, pointing to Ros Jones holding off Reform to keep the Doncaster mayoralty following central investment to reopen the local airport.“Doncaster is a good example of the sort of muscular government that voters notice,” the source said. “When the PM says further and faster, it’s about positive change, now we’ve made the difficult fiscal decisions.”It was nonetheless notable that Jones was among the most vocal critics of Starmer’s record on Friday, highlighting cuts to the winter fuel allowance as a subject stoking voters’ anger, as well as reductions in disability payments and a rise in national insurance.View image in fullscreenLabour’s Ros Jones speaks to supporters as she is declared the winner of the mayoral elections in Doncaster.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesAsked whether the prime minister was listening to her voters, Jones said: “I would say no. They haven’t actually realised, because the people of Doncaster know how hard life can be, and it’s about delivering for them.”Pat McFadden, a senior cabinet member, said late on Friday that Labour would “welcome” a contest with a Reform party that wants to “rewind the clock”.Pointing to comments from Jenkyns, who saidReform UKwould “reset Britain to its glorious past”, McFadden said: “We’re in a fast-changing world, we’ve got a changing security situation here in Europe, a changing trade picture, massive technological change.“If the battle in the future is one side saying they want to rewind the clock and another side saying we’re going to lead you into the future, we will make the most of these changes, we’re going to try to have Britain best placed in this changing world, then that’s a battle that we will welcome.”There was criticism from a number of Labour MPs, albeit with those going public tending to be from the left of the party.Others did join in. Ayesha Hazarika, a Labour peer and former adviser, said the party needed to “admit that some mistakes were made, like the winter fuel allowance”. Speaking on Times Radio, she said the result in Runcorn would “throw up some big questions about the strategy and the operation”.When given anonymously, the verdict was particularly damning. One seniorLabourMP said: “I was quite shocked at how complacent the campaign was, especially in Runcorn but nationally as well. Everyone seemed convinced we were going to win by a reasonably comfortable margin.“The NHS message does not work against Farage, but the centre wouldn’t hear it, or the fact that Keir’s unpopularity was brought up on almost every door.”A second Labour MP said: “The boys in No 10 should spend less time briefing about who’s driving the train and more time actually getting on with building the tracks.”A third said: “It’s all very well for No 10 to say we’ve got to keep delivering. The problem is that it’s the stuff we’ve delivered that people hate.”Explore more on these topicsLocal elections 2025Local electionsReform UKLabourConservativesLiberal DemocratsGreen partynewsShareReuse this content"

It was 2.30am and Nigel Farage had arrived at a Cheshire leisure centre, ready to declare victory in the closely-foughtRuncorn and Helsby byelection.But as camera crews gathered,Reform UKofficials who were ready to welcome their leader frantically scrambled back to the ballot boxes. The result, it seemed, was too close to call.It would be another three hours before Farage sauntered into the DCBL Stadium, looking relaxed despite the knife-edge contest that had left his sleep-deprived aides looking increasingly frazzled. The 61-year-old laughed off claims he had spent daybreak touring Widnes after aborting his earlier grand entrance. He had, he said, been “having a quiet drink”. By 6am, it was time to toast victory.“It’s a very, very big moment, absolutely no question,” declared the perma-tanned populist, as his party grasped hold of one of Labour’s safest seats by just six votes after a dramatic recount. It was the narrowest parliamentary byelection win this century.View image in fullscreenThe Runcorn and Helsby byelection required a recount after the initial result was too close to call.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAs Farage’s aides celebrated in the stadium car park – one puffing on a large cigar – the leader planned a victory lap of England. His once-fringe party was now centre stage, gaining a fifth MP, hundreds of council seats, a regional mayor and at least seven county councils from Durham to Staffordshire and Lincolnshire. He had decimated Kemi Badenoch’sConservativesand dealt a damaging blow to Labour.On the southern banks of the River Mersey inCheshire, from the post-industrial town of Runcorn to the Conservative villages around Frodsham, Reform UK had united an uneasy coalition of voters against Labour. One party activist described its supporters as a combination of “those who set their alarm for work in the morning and are angry at those who don’t – and those who don’t”.Labour, meanwhile, had relied on those who despise Farage – and they span all political shades – but it was not enough to save their 14,700-vote majority. Many had voted for Reform UK as a protest against the government. Others expressed their displeasure more creatively. “I’ve never seen so many drawings of penises,” said one seasoned Labour campaigner after examining spoiled ballot papers.The discontent was palpable on Friday in Murdishaw, a 1970s housing estate in Runcorn where barely one in four voted in Thursday’s contest – the lowest turnout in the constituency. A 65-year-old retiree, who forgot to vote, was horrified when told by the Guardian that Reform had won by just six votes. “Oh you’re kidding me. I’m not happy about that,” she said, adding: “I forgot all about [the election]. If only I’d remembered.”Underlying Reform UK’s dismantling of the historic two-party system in Westminster is a much more troubling trend: the growing numbers of voters detaching completely from politics. “I don’t see any point in any of them. They really are all horrible. Once they’ve been voted in, they forget about us,” said Tommy Young, 59, outside Murdishaw’s Co-op.Reform’s candidate, Sarah Pochin, a former Conservative councillor and local magistrate, becomes the first non-Labour MP elected by Runcorn in more than half a century.But 200 miles across northern England, Reform gained its most powerful role yet as Andrea Jenkyns, a former Tory MP, was crowned mayor of the newly created authority of GreaterLincolnshirewith a thumping 40,000-vote lead over the Conservatives.View image in fullscreenAndrea Jenkyns took a 40,000-vote lead over her Conservative rival to become the mayor of Greater Lincolnshire.Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty ImagesVoters will now look to Greater Lincolnshire, Durham and Staffordshire to see what Reform UK can do in power. On the east coast, Jenkyns has pledged to ape Elon Musk’s cost-cutting “department of government efficiency” by launching a “Doge Lincolnshire”.A close ally of Boris Johnson, Jenkyns wasted no time in burnishing her hard-right credentials in her victory speech, telling the count centre in Grimsby that vulnerable asylum seekers should be forced to sleep in tents rather than housed in hotels. “Tents are good enough for France, they should be good enough for here in Britain,” she said.Speaking at a celebratory rally later on Friday at a working men’s club inCounty Durham, Farage made a similar point, saying Reform-run areas would “resist” efforts by central government to house asylum seekers locally. The elections were “a truly historic landmark”, he declared.Back in Cheshire, Conservative voters in the leafy village of Kingsley, which recorded the constituency’s highest turnout, were cheering Labour’s defeat. “It’s gone from Labour and that’s a good thing,” said one cheerful retiree.At Kingsley community centre, Labour voter Steve Easton, 56, said he believed the byelection was won as a result of divisive national concerns such as immigration rather than local issues.“I think there’s been a lot of noise created around this and a lot of noise by Reform,” he said. “It’s this big-picture politics, making statements about illegal immigrants – who are not the same as asylum seekers – and trying to bias the views of the public.”Explore more on these topicsLocal elections 2025CheshireLincolnshireByelectionsEnglandLocal electionsNigel FaragefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But enough has happened for each of the five main parties to have a good sense of how well or badly they did in Thursday’s local elections.1.Reform UK – 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐The earliest results seemed to point at Nigel Farage’s party doing much as the polls had predicted – very well, and from a standing start, but with some squeeze from voters trying to keep it out. Thus the Runcorn and Helsby byelection, labelled by bookmakers a dead cert for Reform,was taken by just six votes, and it fell short in some mayoral races.But as the council tallies streamed in, Farage’s grin became ever wider. Reform was not just winning councillors, but a series of whole authorities, giving the party new power and prominence. The bulk were in expected areas, such as Kent and former Labour heartlands in the north. But it also won 23 seats in Warwickshire and 27 in Worcestershire, becoming the largest party in both.2.Labour – 2 stars ⭐⭐This was perhaps an election night of two halves for Keir Starmer’s party. The loss in Runcorn was desperately disappointing but also closer than many predicted, and Labour also picked up three mayoralties, including a perhaps surprise top place in the West of England area.But as the council results came in,so did the disappointment. A limited number of seats being defended limited the losses – when the same elections were last run in 2021, Starmer’s leadership was at a low ebb – but they were proportionately significant. Some individual councils saw something of a Labour bloodbath, with the party losing a net 38 councillors in Durham and 27 in Lancashire.3.Conservatives – 1 star ⭐It was widely predicted, with expectations duly managed, but it was nonetheless brutal. Defending not far short of 1,000 seats won during the brief and heady Boris Johnson “vaccine bounce” of 2021, the Conservatives were on course to lose most, as well as a dozen or so councils. The BBC’s projections of how the voting would take place if held nationally saw them slump to just 15%, pushed into fourth behind the Lib Dems.If there was good news for Kemi Badenoch and her party, people were paying them less attention than Reform and Labour. The bad, potentially terminal, news is thatFarage’s boasts about replacing the Toriesas the main rightwing opposition across not just England but the whole UK now feel like more than hopeful rhetoric.4.Liberal Democrats – 3.5 stars ⭐⭐⭐★One of the LibDems’ main if sightly niche battles was to persuade people they were doing well in a results schedule which saw most of the areas for which they had hopes, mainly a series of councils in Conservative-heavy areas, declaring later on Friday. There was also the cheer of beating the Tories in the projected national vote share, with a healthy 17%.And their famously disciplined electioneering machine did make good gains, mainly from the Tories, if perhaps not quite as spectacular as the party has been used to recently. For example, Tory-dominated Warwickshire was knocked into no overall control – but more because of Reform gains than Lib Dem ones. And admittedly ambitious hopes of a win in the Hull and East Yorkshire mayoralty also faded.5.Greens – 3.5 stars ⭐⭐⭐★This was not necessarily a round of elections designed for mass Green gains, although yet again they picked up dozens of new seats, and the BBC’s projected national vote share saw the party reach a healthy 11%.There were, however, some disappointments, with a few heavily targeted council gains failing to materialise, and the mooted potential win for Mary Page in the West of England mayoral contest ending in a third-placed finish in a closely bunched race, behind Reform.Explore more on these topicsLocal elections 2025Local electionsReform UKLabourGreen partyConservativesLiberal Democratskey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

A man who walked away from not just a plane crash but any number of iterations of parties carved in his image. Rising from near-death experiences time and again. The last cockroach standing after a nuclear holocaust.In Reform, Nige has found his most successful reinvention yet. You’ve got a grievance? Then Farage is there to verbalise it and sell it back to you. Always on hand to spot division and feed on it. The politics of the far right may be his preferred habitat – he’s never yet come across an asylum seeker he didn’t want to deport – but he’s nothing if not the consummate opportunist.Sensing he might have maxed out his fanbase among the right, he’s happily dipped his toes into the politics of the left,championing the nationalisation cause. He will be whatever you want him to be. He’s not fussy. Anything to ramp Brand Nige.And now it feels as if his time may have come. Previous triumphs have always felt transitory – ships in the night – but the results of Thursday’slocal electionshave a patina of permanence. The possibility at least of an end to a politics dominated by Labour and the Conservatives. A new multiverse where Reform – for now – has the most public support. The more Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch try to mirror Nige, the less popular they become.Populists like Farage promise voters a simpler life. In fact, they produce ever more hassle and chaos | Andy BeckettRead moreThe danger for Farage is that with success comes obligations. An expectation to deliver. A problem Nige has never encountered before. He’d only ever carped from the sidelines. Trash-talking the governing parties while offering no real solutions himself. Someone you wouldn’t trust with his own debit card, let alone to run the finances of the entire country. His only real tangible achievement in the past 25 years was to front one half of the campaign to reduce the UK’s GDP by 4% by leaving the EU. And then to disown his part in it by claiming Brexit hadn’t been done in the way he had imagined. Shape-shifting avoidance of responsibility.But all this could wait for another day.Friday was Nige’s personal triumph. Hisnew MP, Sarah Pochin, and Lincolnshire mayor, Andrea Jenkyns, may have been the winners on the night but everyone knew they were only there out of an act of kindness granted by Farage. Decoration. Largesse. Nothing more.This is the faultline that runs through Nige’s entire career. Nige is only ever about Nige. He can’t do collaboration. His team are primarily followers – devotees – rather than MPs or mayors. Satellites to his lodestar. Anyone showing any sign of independence of thought is crushed. There can be no challenge. Nige is the centre of his own universe. A little man with grandiose narcissistic ambition. Dicky Tice and Lee Anderson are only tolerated because they understand the rules. Their ambition is to collect the crumbs that Nige drops.So no surprise that for Reform’s victory lap in Durham, it was Farage alone to take centre stage. You might have thought that with the hint of power would come some kind of leadership. A willingness to reach out to those who hadn’t voted for him. Reassurance, even. But Nige has no personal charm. His smile is only ever a veneer. Behind it there is an anger born of the fragility of a man who believes he has been hard done by. He is the establishment man who feels he has been ignored by the establishment. The millionaire masquerading as the little people.You might have thought Nige would want to thank his proxies. As an unheartfelt courtesy if nothing else. But no. He was rushing on his run. This was his triumph and no one else’s. He owed nothing to anyone.“We are the agents of change,” he said. The royal we. Then he went to his familiar bugbears. Diversity. There was too much of it. Time for middle-aged white men like him to be given a chance. Too many foreigners. He’d make sure there were no asylum seekers in any council Reform controlled. They would be eradicated. Not just in tents like Andrea had promised. As for net zero? Forget it. Let the planet burn. Drill, baby, drill.Elsewhere, Starmer was out and about at a drone factory in Luton. For him the biggest story of the day was defence manufacturing. It took a while, but eventually a journalist got a word in edgeways. What about the elections? Keir looked baffled. Elections? What elections? Oh, those elections. He had completely forgotten about them. They were mere nothings, really. A meaningless distraction.But the message Keir wanted to take away was that what the country really wanted was for him to keep doing exactly what he had been doing. Only doing it a bit faster.That might spell bad news for pensioners and farmers, but Starmer was adamant he knew what he was doing. His victorious mayor, Ros Jones, and several MPs from the left of the Labour partysaw it differently. They reckoned their traditional voters were sick of a party that was Reform lite. Why would anyone vote for that when they could have the real thing?If it was a bad day forLabour, it was a crushing one for the Tories. Near annihilation. No wonder then that most of their MPs took a vow of silence. Nigel Huddleston popped up on the radio to say that the message he was hearing from voters was that people really liked Badenoch. You dread to think how badly the Tories would have done if they hated her. The only people who visibly loved Kemi were the Reform candidates. As for Kemi, she contented herself with a brief note on social media. Sorry, not sorry. I’m going nowhere. Other views are available.The last word went to Nigel. “I will be the next prime minister,” he said. It’s a depressing possibility. A UK that has lost hope. Lost its moral compass. A country that no longer believes in itself. “Take me or leave me,” Nige snapped. “I just don’t care.”And he doesn’t care. He never has done. About anything but himself. We have been warned.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageThe politics sketchReform UKLabourKeir StarmerConservativesKemi BadenochLocal elections 2025commentShareReuse this content"

I always have done, despite what some people in that country have done. I miss the UK. And it’s really quite sad I won’t be able to show my children my homeland.”Harry had sought to overturn changes to his security provision while in the UK, which were made after he and the Duchess of Sussex stepped away from royal duties in 2020.He was offered “bespoke” security, which he felt was inferior and claimed the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (known as Ravec), which authorises security measures, had breached its own terms of reference by not conducting a risk management board (RMB) before making the decision.He insisted his father could help resolve the issue, though he had not asked him to intervene. “I can only come to the UK safely if I am invited, and there is a lot of control and ability in my father’s hands.“Ultimately, this whole thing could be resolved through him, not by intervening, but by stepping aside and allowing the experts to do what is necessary and to carry out an RMB,” he said.It is understood it would have been constitutionally improper for the king to intervene while the matter was being considered by the government and reviewed by the courts.Although the royal household provides representation and input into the Ravec decision, Friday’s judgment laid out that the chair of the Ravec committee was the decision maker on the provision of security. Royal private offices and private secretaries should be consulted as to the practicalities of the protection measures agreed, the ruling said.Harry appealed to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, saying: “This all was initiated under a previous government. There is now a new government. I have had it described to me by people who know about the facts that this is a good old-fashioned establishment stitch-up. And that’s what it feels like.”Asked whether the prime minister should “step in”, he replied: “Yes, I would ask the prime minister to step in.“I would ask Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, to look at this very, very carefully and I would ask her to review Ravec and its members, because if it is an expert body, then what is the royal household’s role there if it is not to influence and decide what they want for the members of their household?”The prime minister would be “quite reluctant” to become involved in decisions about Harry’s security, a senior cabinet minister said on Friday night. Pat McFadden told Sky News: “I think he would be quite reluctant to make a judgment about someone’s personal security needs. We have experts who do that for a reason, and I’m not sure it’s a good idea for any politician to be saying that that person requires this level or that level of security.”On his family rift, Harry said: “There have been so manydisagreements, differences between me and some of my family. This current situation, that has been ongoing now for five years with regard to human life and safety as the sticking point. It is the only thing that’s left.“Of course some members of my family will never forgive me forwriting a book, of course they will never forgive me for lots of things, but … I would love reconciliation with my family.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t know how much longer my father has. He won’t speak to me because of this security stuff. But it would be nice to reconcile.”He added: “If they want that, it’s entirely up to them.”Harry said he could never leave the royal family, though he had left the “institution” because “I had to”.He continued: “Whether I have an official role or not is irrelevant to the threats, risk and impact on the reputation of the UK if something was to happen. What really worries me more than anything else about today’s decision [is that] it set a new precedent that security can be used to control members of the family, and effectively, what it does is imprison other members of the family from being able to choose a different life.”He claimed that, through the court disclosure process, he had “discovered that some people want history to repeat itself, which is pretty dark”. Asked who he meant, Harry declined to answer.In astatement released on the Sussexes’ website, Harry said: “Ravec’s ability to make decisions outside of its own policies and the so-called political sensitivities of my case have prevailed over the need for fair and consistent decision-making. The court has decided to defer to this, revealing a sad truth: my hands are tied in seeking legal recourse against the establishment.“This all comes from the same institutions that preyed upon my mother, that openly campaigned for the removal of our security, and that continue to incite hatred towards me, my wife and even our children, while at the same time protecting the very power that they should be holding accountable.”He told the BBC he was “devastated” by the court’s decision, adding: “Not so much devastated with the loss [as] about the people behind the decision feeling as though this is OK. Is it a win for them? I’m sure there are some people out there, probably most likely the people that wish me harm, [who] consider this a huge win.”He indicated that he would not be seeking a further legal challenge, saying Friday’s ruling had “proven that there was no way to win this through the courts”.A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said: “All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.”Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryMonarchyKing Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

At least one civilian was killed and four people were injured as a result of the Israeli bombings late Friday night, according to Syrian state media.The latest round of strikes come after Israel killed four civilians earlier on Friday in a bombing in southern Syria and struck the vicinity of Syria’s presidential palace.Syria’s new rulers hadangrily denounced the raids launched by Israel’s air force against unidentified targets near the presidential palace earlier in the day, warning of a “dangerous escalation”.Syria’s presidency called the strike “a dangerous escalation against state institutions and its sovereignty” and accused Israel of destabilising the country.Israeli officials said the attacks were intended to send a message to the Syrian government after days of bloody clashes near Damascus between pro-government militia forces and fighters from the Druze minority sect.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and the defence minister, Israel Katz, said in a joint statement that the attack early on Friday, the second this week in Syria, was intended to deter the country’s new leadership from any hostile move against the Druze.“This is a clear message to the Syrian regime. We will not allow the deployment of forces south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community,” the statement said.The Israeli army confirmed in a statement that fighter jets struck near to the area of the palace of the president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in Damascus but gave no further details.Israel has said that it will protect the Druze religious minority in Syria, a declaration that most Druze leaders have rebuffed.The head of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria condemned the Israeli strikes in an interview with Al Jazeera on Friday.”The Israeli attacks on Syria are absolutely unacceptable. There is nothing in international law that allows for pre-emptive bombing,” said Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, the chair of the commission.The government in Damascus took power after ousting Bashar al-Assad in December last year and is dominated by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which has its roots in the al-Qaida jihadist network. Though Syria’s new rulers have promised inclusive rule in the multi-confessional, multi-ethnic country, they face pressures from extremists within their own ranks.Clashes broke out in Druze-majority areas outside Damascuson Tuesday after an audio clip circulated on social media of a man making derogatory comments about the prophet Muhammad. The clip, which was falsely attributed to a Druze cleric, angered many Sunni Muslims, but may have been fabricated.On Thursday, one of the three Syrian Druze spiritual leaders, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, accused Syria’s government of what he called an “unjustified genocidal attack” on the minority community.Hijri released a statement calling for international protection for the Druze in southern Syria, asking international forces to “intervene immediately”. The two other Syrian Druze religious leaders chose to negotiate with Damascus directly and rejected calls for international intervention in Syria.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More than half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria, largely in the southern Sweida province and some suburbs of Damascus.Most of the other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war and annexed in 1981.The Syrian government has denied that any of its security forces were involved in the clashes with the Druze, which followed a wave of massacres in March whensecurity forces and allied groups killed more than 1,700 civilians, mostly from Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite community, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Since the fall of Assad’s regime in December, Israel has launched repeated airstrikes on Syria, destroying military hardware and stockpiles, in what it says is defence of the Druze. Israel has also sent troops to what was a demilitarised zone in the Golan Heights, on Syria’s south-west border with Israel, seizing key strategic terrain where Syrian troops were once deployed.Analysts in Israel say the strategy aims to undermine the new Syrian government while also protecting and so co-opting a potential proxy ally within the country. The strategy is controversial, however, with some officials arguing that a stable Syria would better serve Israel’s interests.The Syrian president, Sharaa, told a visiting US congressman last week that Damascus wanted to normalise ties with Israel.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Adjusted for inflation, that is the equivalent of £521 in 2025, according tothe Bank of England’s calculator.The painting is believed to be one of the earliest sales made by the Stretford-born painter. Lowry also gave Wallace an additional work, The Manufacturing Town, which the family sold several years ago.LS Lowry painting sold to Guardian literary editor for £10 could fetch £1mRead moreWallace had edited a supplement for the Guardian to accompany a civic week organised by Manchester city council in October 1926, and featured three paintings by the then struggling artist.As Wallace’s grandson Keith explains, Lowry was featured in an accompanying exhibition at a Manchester department store, and Wallace – who had fallen for his sooty panoramas of factory-bound crowds – offered to buy one.“Lowry said with great daring: ‘Could we say £10?’ and Grandpa wrote a cheque. Then Lowry wrote back to him saying: ‘I think I’ve charged you too much. Can I give you another one as well?’ So Grandpa got two Lowrys for his £10.”Going to the Mill, which has been in the Wallace family for the last century, was recently on long-term loan to Pallant House Gallery in Chichester.Simon Hucker, a modern and contemporary art specialist at the Lyon & Turnbull auction house, said: “We’re absolutely delighted by the price achieved for this exceptional, early painting by Lowry, bought from him when he was a virtual unknown. There are few artists who become a household name in Britain and Lowry definitely falls into this category.“This is a painting shows that Lowry at his conceptual best, no naive painter of ‘matchstick men’, as the old pop song went. Instead he is an artist of true dexterity who is making deliberate formal choices, abstracting the figure in order to express an idea about loneliness and isolation within the teeming city.“Going to the Mill is the epitome of a 1920s Lowry, the period when he becomes a unique voice in British art. It is especially rare is for a painting such as this to have been in one collection for one year shy of a century and we are delighted to have played a small part in its history.”In 2024 a Lowry painting titled Sunday Afternoon sold for almost £6.3m at auction.Explore more on these topicsLS LowryPaintingArtManchesterNorth of EnglandEnglandGreater ManchesterShareReuse this content"

But the 15-year-old California sea lion’s talent shines most in bobbing to disco hits such asBoogie Wonderland.“She just nails that one,” swaying her head in time to the tempo changes, said Peter Cook, a behavioral neuroscientist at New College of Florida who has spent a decade studying Ronan’s rhythmic abilities.Not many animals show a clear ability to identify andmove to a beataside from humans,parrotsand someprimates. But then there’s Ronan, a bright-eyed sea lion that has scientists rethinking themeaning of music.Block-rocking beaks: Snowball the cockatoo – reviewed by our dance criticRead moreA former rescue sea lion, she burst to fame about a decade ago after scientists reported her musical skills. From age three, she has been a resident at the University ofCalifornia, Santa Cruz’s Long Marine Laboratory, where researchers including Cook have tested and honed her ability to recognize rhythms.Ronan joined a select group of animal movers and shakers – which also includesSnowball the famed dancing cockatoo– that together upended the long-held idea that the ability to respond to music and recognize a beat was distinctly human.What is particularly notable about Ronan is that she can learn to dance to a beat without learning to sing or talk musically.“Scientists once believed that only animals who were vocal learners – like humans and parrots – could learn to find a beat,” said Hugo Merchant, a researcher at Mexico’s Institute of Neurobiology, who was not involved in the Ronan research.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided by Instagram.

Was her past dancing a fluke? Was Ronan better than people at keeping a beat?To answer the challenge, Cook and colleagues devised a new study, published on Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.The result: Ronan still has it. She is back and better than ever.This time the researchers focused not on studio music but on percussion beats in a laboratory. They filmed Ronan bobbing her head as the drummer played three different tempos – 112, 120 and 128 beats per minute. Two of those beats Ronan had never been exposed to, allowing scientists to test her flexibility in recognizing new rhythms.Slaves to the rhythm: rats can’t resist a good beat, researchers sayRead moreAnd the researchers asked 10 college students to do the same, waving their forearm to changing beats.Ronan was the top diva.“No human was better than Ronan at all the different ways we test quality of beat-keeping,” said Cook, adding, “she’s much better than when she was a kid,” indicating lifetime learning.The new study confirms Ronan’s place as one of the “top ambassadors” of animal musicality, said Henkjan Honing, a University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher, who was not involved in the study.Researchers plan to train and test other sea lions. Cook suspects other sea lions can also bob to a beat – but that Ronan will still stand out as a star performer.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaAnimal behaviourMarine lifeWildlifeWest CoastAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Palestinian American family were renting rooms from Czuba at a suburban Chicago house at the time of the attack.“No sentence can restore what was taken, but today’s outcome delivers a necessary measure of justice,” said Ahmed Rehab, executive director of Cair-Chicago. “Wadee was an innocent child. He was targeted because of who he was – Muslim, Palestinian, and loved.”The boy’s great-uncle, Mahmoud Yousef, was the only family member who spoke during the hearing. He said that no matter the sentence length it wouldn’t be enough. The boy’s parents had plans for him and Czuba robbed them of that, he said.Yousef asked Czuba to explain why he attacked the boy and his mother, asking him what news he heard that provoked him, but Czuba did not respond, the Chicago Tribune reported.Evidence at trial included harrowing testimony from Shaheen and her frantic 911 call, along with bloody crime scene photos and police video. Jurors deliberated for less than 90 minutes on Friday before handing in a verdict.Illinoisdoes not have the death penalty.‘An all-American boy’: Classmates mourn six-year-old Muslim boy stabbed to deathRead moreThe family had been renting rooms in Czuba’s home in Plainfield, about 40 miles (65km) from Chicago. Central to prosecutors’ case was harrowing testimony from the boy’s mother, who said Czuba attacked her before moving on to her son, insisting they had to leave because they were Muslim. Prosecutors also played the 911 call and showed police footage. Czuba’s wife, Mary, whom he has since divorced, also testified for the prosecution, saying he had become agitated about theIsrael-Gaza war, which had erupted days earlier.Police said Czuba pulled a knife from a holder on a belt and stabbed the boy 26 times, leaving the knife in the child’s body. Some of the bloody crime scene photos were so explicit that the judge agreed to turn television screens showing them away from the audience, which included Wadee’s relatives.“He could not escape,” Michael Fitzgerald, a Will county assistant state’s attorney, had told jurors at trial.The attack renewed fears of anti-Muslim discrimination and hit particularly hard in Plainfield and surrounding suburbs, which have a large and established Palestinian community.Separately, lawsuits have been filed over the boy’s death and the US Department of Justicehas launcheda federal hate-crimes investigation.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeIllinoisIsrael-Gaza warHate crimenewsShareReuse this content"

In a video previously posted on his X account, Brand said he welcomed the opportunity to prove his innocence.On Friday he appeared in court wearing a dark blue shirt, dark grey trousers and carrying a pair of sunglasses. He spoke to confirm his name, date of birth and address in Buckinghamshire, and that he understood the proceedings.The chief magistrate, Paul Goldspring, told Brand he was being released on bail and would be expected to attend a hearing at the Old Bailey on 30 May. Brand thanked the magistrate, before being excused. He said nothing when leaving court flanked by three minders, jumping into a waiting car and being driven away.Brand presented a BBC Radio 2 show between 2006 and 2008 as well as the Big Brother spin-off shows Big Brother’s Big Mouth and Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack in the 00s.The presenter and actor was married to the US pop singer Katy Perry from 2010 to 2012, and is now married to Laura Gallacher – the sister of the TV presenter Kirsty.

Prosecutors claim Graham and Carruthers were together on a “moronic mission” to topple it and later revelled in the resulting headlines.Graham said that on the morning it happened Carruthers rang him and said he had cut down the tree. Graham told the jury: “I told him that he was talking shite, I didn’t believe it.”On a later date, he said Carruthers and another man, Lindsay Dalgleish, arrived at Graham’s property with pizza. They asked Graham to take the blame for felling the tree “because I have mental health issues. Apparently they would be more lenient with me”. Graham said “no”, he told the jury.Asked what their reaction was, Graham said they goaded him and told him: “Nowt will happen to you, you will get away with it.”Graham has named Dalgleish as a suspect in the case. DI Calum Meikle of Northumbria police told the court they had looked into claims about Dalgleish but were “satisfied that he wasn’t involved”.Graham’s barrister, Christopher Knox, asked his client if Carruthers had ever talked about felling the Sycamore Gap tree. “He’d mentioned it but he mentioned a lot of things,” said Graham.Graham said he recalled Carruthers talking about the tree in 2021 when Graham went to use some string and Carruthers said not to because it had sentimental value.Carruthers laid the string in a circle and said it was the circumference of the Sycamore Gap tree. “He told me it was the most famous tree in the world,” said Graham. That was the first time Graham knew about the tree, he said.Knox said it was clear two people had been involved on the night – one person cutting down the tree and one filming.“Adam felled the tree, I don’t know 100% who the other person was,” Graham said.Under cross-examination by the prosecuting barrister, Richard Wright KC, Graham was asked if he was lying and changing his story.The court heard Graham owned two dogs, one big and vocal. Wright asked Graham why his dog did not go “berserk” when two people came into his yard and took his Range Rover. Graham said it was windy, the dog may not have heard and it would not have barked if it heard Carruthers’ voice.Wright asked if it was a lie that Graham first knew about the tree in 2021 since he had reported a car being stolen from the Steel Rigg car park – used by visitors to Sycamore Gap – in 2020.Graham said: “Just because I know about the car park doesn’t mean I know about the tree.”At one point Graham said to Wright: “You might be a little bit more educated than me and you’re trying to make a fool of me.”The trial has heard that police have never recovered the chainsaw used to cut down the tree, or a wedge of trunk that was removed in order to cut it down and was photographed in the boot of Graham’s Range Rover.On Friday the jury was played a phone call Graham made to police a year after the crime in which he offered intelligence anonymously.Graham can be heard telling police that if they were to visit Carruthers’ home, a caravan on Kirkbride airfield, they would find the chainsaws and wedge. He also said Carruthers had access to firearms – a handgun and an old shotgun.Graham told the court he believed the “police did not do a very good job” investigating the crime.Graham, of Carlisle, and Carruthers, of Wigton, are jointly charged with causing criminal damage worth £622,191 to the tree. They are also charged with causing £1,144 of damage to Hadrian’s Wall, a Unesco world heritage site. The wall and the tree belong to the National Trust.The pair deny all the charges against them. The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

One of the strangest and most unsatisfying things about the Covid‑19 pandemic, among a great many deeply strange and unsatisfying things, is that it never actually had a shared end date or ceremonial send-off.Jarringly so, because this was a period in the national life built around a rigid roster of public events. The numerical rules. The weekly banging of pots in honour of people you secretly consider to be serfs. Such unlikely figures as Matt Hancock appearing in public every day in order to say inauthentic-sounding things about public health, all the while resembling the doomed subcommander of an imperial space galleon who keeps announcing that he’s got the situation under control, sir, just as the bridge behind him is cleaved in two and he’s sucked out into a skull-popping deep space inferno.Your Guardian Sport weekend: football, world snooker finale and F1 in MiamiRead moreAll these things happened in lockstep. The pandemic had a start date. But the closest we got to a national throwing-off of the shackles, our own VV day, was July 2021 and the sight of a lone England football supporterplacing a flare between his buttock cheeksbefore releasing it into the air of central London. This was our healing moment, our iconography of closure, our own white cliffs and union flags.Sport: always delivering. As it did that same evening with the commemorative Wembley Stadium riots. But for now the other strange thing about the plague times is that nobody wants to talk about it. Understandably so. It was horrible, traumatic and confusing. But the fact remains for sport this week does bring a significant pandemic anniversary. Not of the end or the beginning, but of the way things began to change, and significantly so.It is exactly five years now since the end of the only month that was entirely empty of sport through the pandemic. It is easy to forget now that this all came pretty much out of nowhere. The week before English football shut down the headlines were Eric Dier leaping into the crowd to confront a fan and Manchester United finally turning a corner with Bruno Fernandes at the wheel because,plus ça change, plus c’est the same thing all over again.The final live football event in the UK was 11 March,Liverpool v Atlético Madrid at Anfield, an occasion that should loom like an undying shadow over Boris Johnson and his government, still in its let-it-run-free herd immunity phase. The official pandemic report concluded 37 people died as a result of the game played at that late stage, a detail that deserves never to be lost.View image in fullscreenThe final live football event was Atlético Madrid visiting Anfield in March 2020.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Danehouse/Getty ImagesTwo days later Mikel Arteta tested positive, forever enthroned as the Franz Ferdinand of Britain’s Covid meltdown. Football took the lead, the Premier League and the EFL calling off their own competitions despite official dithering. Before long Euro 2020 had been suspended, the snooker and cricket put on hold. Two weeks later the Tokyo Olympics was banished to the ghost games of 2021.In the meantime April was a global whiteout, give or take the odd Belarusian Super league oddity. And by 3 May, five years ago this Saturday, the first stirrings appeared in the soil. World Athletics staged a well-meaning but deeply weird backyard video pole vault event featuring Mondo Duplantis. Footballers in England began to train again. Within two weeks the Bundesliga resumed to empty seats. Sport had taken a breath, a moment to think about what this thing is actually for, and what it should look like when the plague was all over.There have been some very clear changes in sport, both in its hierarchies and the basic spectacle, all related to the trials and opportunities of the pandemic. In many ways sport has never recovered, a mark that is most obviously present in the ever-wider separation of power.Look back now and the pandemic was good for Fifa, good for the BCCI, good for Saudi Arabia. It was good for some women’s sport. It was bad for athlete welfare, bad for grassroots, participation and children’s health. Above all, it was terrible for the idea of preserving physical space, the shared sense of ownership of our sporting institutions; another example of sport holding up its own mirror to the rest of the world.View image in fullscreenTheUltimate Garden Clash– pole vault edition: world record-holder Mondo Duplantis, Sam Kendricks and Renaud Lavillenie do battle.Photograph: World Athletics YouTube/PAMost obviously Covid-19 was good for Gianni Infantino and Fifa. Never let a good crisis go to waste. For Infantino, financial and cultural meltdown elsewhere presented a wonderful opportunity to maintain a constant public expression of grave and statesman-like concern, all the while ramping up his own ambitions.This was the moment Infantino ramped up his full-realised Football Jesus persona, dangling Fifa’s cash reserves, pulling rank on every entity that had ever tried to resist its power, taking decisive steps in the shadow-struggle with club football. The sense of an autocratic entity freed from any kind of scrutiny was codified. The expanded Club World Cup flows from this, as does the Saudi World Cup, whisked through without a vote.Other power grabs failed. The European Super League bubbled up and was then bundled out of the door as the returning crowds took to the streets in public protest and also, let’s face it, as something to do.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Internally there is a sense the pandemic caused a breakdown of trust that has never been restored, present in the Super League shemozzle and fuelled by the loss of revenues, the basic sense of brittleness. The biosecure summer league wrought its own changes, 92 live games in six weeks purely to appease the broadcasters, accompanied only by muffled managerial shrieking, like the sound of somebody being water‑boarded next door.Using five substitutes has remained, another little nudge for the more powerful clubs. The primacy of fans, of real-life humans in the physical space, has been chipped away at. Lines have been crossed, ground given up. Late‑night kick-off times have stayed. Ticket prices have spiralled.Left alone in the empty grounds, TV took control of the staging, stopping and starting the clock, bossing referees about and making strides towards some distant end point as a remote spectacle. Absurdly over-geared VAR has at least been slightly scaled back (never forget the outrages of the micro-handball penalty era). Pundits have remained on the pitch, a major step in the cretinising of the show, the guffaws and squeals and clipped-up rants now just part of the entertainment.In cricket this was the period when franchise T20 leagues basically took over. With all other cricket falling apart the biosecure Indian Premier League became the centrepiece of the year, the final in Dubai watched by 200m people. That model became the dominant one, with time slots carved out, TV-based styling, heavy BCCI/IPL investment. On the plus side women’s cricket got a significant boost, the first double-headers introduced as a necessity and then retained as a success. The Hundred got its foot in the door.Leicester v Southampton may be El Crapico – but it’s a game with meaningRead moreElsewhere the Covid Olympics was dystopian in the flesh, detrimental to athlete welfare, but rescued by the good fortune of a human-scale, beautifully memorable Paris Games last year. Darts had a very good pandemic, discovering a new hunger for its comforts and kitchen sink dramas.Tennis was strange during Covid, freezing its ranking points, losing some veteran players, at times descending into a hallucinogenically weird Novak Djokovic political-legal drama.Boxing flourished and basically became a Saudi gig, as did many other sports. LIV golf, a Saudi Grand Prix and the purchase of Newcastle United were all ushered through as a huge period of progress for anyone willing to suck up the costs, steamroller any protests and leverage their political ambitions.The great tragedy of the opposite end of the scale is the blow to participation, amateur sport and public health. Above all this feels like a missed opportunity. Many participation sports flourished, without fanfare in the pandemic months. At the same the structures of amateur sport were often filleted or left to die.View image in fullscreenLTA advice at the Bridge of Allan Tennis Club as to playing tennis during lockdown.Photograph: Jeff Holmes/PASubsequent studies have suggested a “lost generation” of young people who simply fell out of sport. Children’s physical activity has changed since, a decline stacked around gender and socioeconomic position. Childhood obesity shot up and has persevered in older age groups. Plus of course, as a referred pandemic pain, the cost of living has increased, with physical activity declining most among the poorest.The pandemic lingered on in sport. Planned returns were delayed. A surge in Omicron-based confusion the following Christmas saw football cancelled again, firebreaks talked up, Antonio Conte using a set of mannequins to make up the numbers in Spurs training, without, it is rumoured, any noticeable drop-off in effectiveness.Five years on, sport in the pandemic remains a blurry and confused landscape, at best a story of stratification and progress towards a more remote spectacle. For now it is worth remembering how many acts of sporting administrators are still bound in the losses and commercial paranoia of the time. And how vital is it to retain the right not just to be there in the flesh, but to be central to the show, both as participant and spectator.Explore more on these topicsSportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Patterson’s estranged husband, Simon, was expected to join them, but had cancelled the night before.It was unusual for Patterson to host the group, but she told them she faced an unusual circumstance: she had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and wanted their advice on what to tell the two children she shared with Simon.Before starting lunch, they said grace. Ian was the pastor at the nearby Korumburra Baptist church, and the rest of the group regularly attended his Sunday service.On the plates in front of them were individual beef wellingtons prepared by Patterson: eye fillet steaks, topped with a mushroom paste, and encased in pastry. They started to eat.Three months later, Patterson was charged with murdering Don, Gail and Heather, and attempting to murder Ian. She has pleaded not guilty, andher trial started on 29 April.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignThe Victorian supreme court heard this week that it is not in dispute that the beef wellingtons containedAmanita phalloides, or death cap mushrooms. It is not in dispute that Patterson put them there. The court also heard that both the prosecution and defence agree that Pattersonhad never been diagnosed with cancer.What is in dispute is whether she meant to poison her four guests. Her lawyer, Colin Mandy SC, described it as a tragic accident. The prosecutor, Nanette Rogers SC, said that Patterson “deliberately poisoned” her lunch guests “with murderous intent”.After both finished their opening address, Justice Christopher Beale said there were two key issues at the heart of the case: whether Patterson deliberately poisoned anyone, and whether she intended to kill or cause serious injury when she did.Map of Leongatha in VictoriaPatterson watched intently throughout the first week of her trial, often blinking rapidly, with her chin raised slightly, and her mouth downturned.She would become emotional at times, often when there was mention of family members or her deceased in-laws.Courtroom 4, on the second level of the Latrobe Valley law courts, has the jury box to the right, the witness box to the left, and the dock at the rear of the court.This means Patterson is seated behind most of the public seating. Reporters have to turn around in their seats and look behind them to gauge her reaction to proceedings. Often, she turns her head to meet their eye.The only witness in the first week of the trial was Simon Patterson.A civil engineer, he met Patterson about 20 years earlier, when both were working at a local council, Monash, in Melbourne’s south-east.TimelineErin Patterson: how Australia's alleged mushroom poisoning case unfolded — a timelineShow29 July 2023Erin Patterson hosts lunch for estranged husband Simon’s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt and uncle Heather and Ian Wilkinson.

They were part of the same “eclectic” group of friends at first, he said, before a relationship developed.The history of their relationship unfolded gradually during his time in the witness box: children arriving in 2009 and 2014, Patterson receiving a $2m share of her grandmother’s estate, a series of separations and reconcilements.The final separation occurred in 2015, though for much of the next eight years Simon felt they could again reconcile.The months between late 2022 and the lunch have taken on a central importance to the case, as they are seen by the prosecution as representinga deterioration in the relationship.Until this point, although separated, the couple holidayed together, and Simon even advised Patterson on the construction of her new property, where the lunch would eventually be hosted.At a church service on 16 July 2023, Simon said, Patterson invited him, his parents, and the Wilkinsons to lunch. It was to be held the Saturday after next, on 29 July.View image in fullscreenSimon Patterson was the only witness in the first week of his estranged wife’s trial.Photograph: Martin Keep/AFP/Getty ImagesSimon agreed to go, but the night before the lunch he texted her to cancel.“Sorry, I feel too uncomfortable about coming to the lunch with you, Mum, Dad, Heather and Ian tomorrow but I’m happy to talk about your health and implications of that at another time,” he wrote to Patterson at 6.54pm, according to a text shown to the court.“If you’d like to discuss on the phone, just let me know.”Patterson then replied at 6.59pm: “That’s really disappointing. I’ve spent many hours this week preparing lunch for tomorrow which has been exhausting in light of the issues I’m facing and spent a small fortune on beef eye fillet to make beef wellingtons because I wanted it to be a special meal, as I may not be able to host a lunch like this again for some time.“It’s important to me that you’re all there tomorrow and that I can have the conversations that I need to have. I hope you’ll change your mind.“Your parents and Heather and Ian are coming at 12.30. I hope to see you there.”Simon said he did not respond. He had already told his parents he would not be attending.View image in fullscreenThe exterior of the Leongatha home where Erin Patterson served served the beef wellingtons containing death cap mushrooms.Photograph: James Ross/AAPText messages in lead-up to deadly mushroom lunch revealed as Erin Patterson’s estranged husband testifiesRead moreThe prosecution say the guests’ beef wellingtons were served the following day on four large grey plates, with Patterson serving herself on a smaller, lighter coloured plate.Within 12 hours of the lunch, the guests were all violently ill. Patterson also told family and medical staff that she became unwell over the same period.Mandy says that it was in this context, having discovered that food she prepared had resulted in her guests becoming horribly unwell, that Patterson panicked.She lied to police about not owning a food dehydrator, nor using own, he said. CCTV footage showed her dumping the dehydrator at the local tip. A forensic analysis showed it had traces of death cap mushrooms, and her fingerprints.Patterson also lied to police when she told them she had never foraged for mushrooms, Mandy said.The prosecution say data from one of Patterson’s phones suggests that she twice travelled to locations that had been publicly identified as having death cap mushrooms. The locations were shared on iNaturalist, and the posts included exact coordinates and images.It is also alleged that one of the phones regularly used by Patterson in the lead up to the lunch has never been found by police, and that another she handed to them under the false pretence it was the phone she normally used was subject to a “factory reset” while they were searching her house.“The starting point for you is that Erin Patterson is innocent of these charges,” Mandy said towards the end of his opening address.View image in fullscreenErin Patterson’s defence barrister, Colin Mandy SC, arrives at the Latrobe Valley magistrates court in Morwell, Victoria.Photograph: James Ross/AAPHe then stood facing the jury, his hands outstretched, as if showing off the size of a particularly big catch.“If there’s a scale where innocent is at one end, and guilty is at the other, you’re down here at this end,” he indicated with his right hand, “and what the prosecution has to do is drag you as far up that line as they can before you could consider whether or not Erin Patterson is guilty.“Your starting point, the proper place for a jury to start at this point, is down at this end of the scale. And they have to pull you from there with evidence, and not with guesswork, speculation, theories. With evidence.“And it’s only if they get you all the way to the other end that you could return a verdict of guilty, because your oath that you’ve given is to give a true verdict according to the evidence.”The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsVictoriafeaturesShareReuse this content"

A case will be heard in September in which a survivor is suing Brighton’s Rape Crisis Centre Survivors’ Network for discrimination because it allegedly refused to provide a female-only peer support group.Others have said that such concerns can be based on a stereotyped view of what a transgender woman is like, as well as a misunderstanding of how such services already maintain users’ privacy and make thorough risk assessments before bringing survivors together in accommodation or group work.Immediately afterlast month’s supreme court judgment, which ruled that transgender women could be legally excluded from single-sex spaces, Refuge, the UK’s largest domestic abuse organisation, confirmed it would continue to provide services to trans people.However, Women’s Aid England (WAE) – which represents more than 180 member services – reiterated that the provision of single-sex domestic abuse services was “a founding principle”. Rape Crisis England and Wales (RCEW) acknowledged that “the definition and provision of ‘women-only spaces’ remains a powerfully emotive topic within the women’s sector”.Both RCEW and WAE run as federations, meaning individual refuges and centres are free to define whether women-only includes or excludes trans women.But at grassroots level, the individual services that these national bodies represent tell a different story, acknowledging those deep disagreements but emphasising how both trans inclusivity and exclusivity are managed day to day without harm.LGBTQ+ charities warn of ‘genuine crisis’ for trans people after UK rulingRead moreAlmost all of SARSVL’s work takes place one-to-one – in person or online or through its helpline. The organisation does offer group work, usually ranging from four to 12 people with two staff facilitating, but only for survivors it already knows and who have been assessed as suitable, not as a drop-in that anyone can attend.“Many service users are severely traumatised, so of course there could be a circumstance in which one survivor might object to the presence of or feel triggered by another,” says Russell. “That could be in relation to any number of things about the way they look, smell, something they say … things not necessarily related to their gender at all. We would handle that on a case-by-case basis as we always have done.”One refuge manager recalls a “tough time” after Women’s Aid England first published a statement in 2022 defending the principle of single-sex services, after which she says many multiple-occupancy refuges used the exemptions in the Equality Act to legally exclude trans women, although “most kept their heads down”.“It’s about applying common sense” says Angela, who manages a service that is part of the Women’s Aid network, in the south-east of Scotland. Based across several sites, it includes a refuge comprised of individual flats with communal space, which is single-sex, and other stand-alone accommodation that is available to all, including transgender women.While under the Equality Act it has always been legal to exclude trans women from services for a good reason, the supreme court ruling clarified that those with a gender recognition certificate could also be excluded.“I’ve always felt that the legislation was sufficient, with services like ours able to apply the legal exemptions to operate a single-sex service,” says Angela.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She is keen to emphasise that “every referral is case by case and based on a host of factors, not just gender presentation”.“For example, if someone has a history of substance use, we might decide to put them in a self-contained flat because of the impact on other residents, or if there are three women with a particular mental health diagnosis in a shared space, we might consider whether our staff have capacity for a fourth.”A number of refuges raised concerns that they had lost funding because of pressure from councils to provide gender-neutral services for male victims as well as trans people. One refuge manager said: “We have been marked down in funding applications because we weren’t considered trans-inclusive, despite having a specialist LGBT+ service and many years in this field. Even though we have applied theEquality Act 2010exceptions properly throughout, we have come under attack from civil servants, local politicians, other charities and sometimes local people.”It is an indication of the continuing toxicity of the debate that many service managers approached were unwilling to speak publicly, some citing fears of similar attacks from both sides, others having previouslybeen misrepresented in media reports.How will UK judgment on legal definition of womanhood affect policy?Read moreAll the services the Guardian spoke to underlined that the safety of survivors was paramount. Susan, who manages a single-sex refuge with dispersed LGBT+ placements in England, explains their protocols for essential male visitors such as handymen: “They have to wear high vis and all women are notified in advance so they can stay in their room and keep their children away too, who are often likewise frightened of a male presence. It’s something they avoid at all costs.”The majority of services had not encountered regular questions about their trans policy from women seeking help – “People have other things they are worried about,” says Angela – and reported very low numbers of trans women using their services, similar to that in the general population.“Refuge services have been used as a political football in this debate about trans inclusivity by people who don’t really understand the ins and outs of how they work,” says Maya.In 10 years, she has experience of one communal refuge accepting a transgender woman, who had medically transitioned, as a resident. She had disclosed her gender identity to management but didn’t share it with residents. Maya explains that residents would never get a say in who was admitted to the refuge, and staff never disclose private information to other residents. “People were free to share or not share anything they chose. She was part of that community and they bonded as women who had experienced abuse.”Explore more on these topicsTransgenderGenderEquality Act 2010LGBTQ+ rightsUK supreme courtViolence against women and girlsRape and sexual assaultfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You were going to the theatre. You had a toddler. You were of an age where you had a free bus pass. But now we are becoming a nation of early birds; 5pm is the new 8pm and restaurants are adapting accordingly. Special early-evening menus are on the rise.At Skye Gyngell’s Spring restaurant in Covent Garden, a £30 “scratch” menu – featuring dishes made using waste produce such as a moreish bread-and-butter pudding made from yesterday’s loaves – is served between 5.30pm and 6.15pm.Over atBulrush in Bristol, which opened in 2015 and has held a Michelin star since 2018, diners can enjoy a mini version of its signature tasting menu three days a week at 5.30pm. Instead of £90 for nine courses, you pay £65 for six.View image in fullscreenPortland offers courses at a reduced price between 5.30pm and 6.30pm.Photograph: Sam Harris/Portland restaurantPortlandin London, which has held a Michelin star since 2015, offers four courses for £55 between 5.30pm and 6.30pm. Its standard post-6.30pm tasting menu will set you back a steep £110 while a three course meal from its à la carte costs £89.Daniel Morgenthau, co-founder of the Woodhead restaurant group, which operates five restaurants including Portland, said they originally planned to run the early menu for a month in January to celebrate its 10-year anniversary. Thanks to its popularity, six months on it has become a firm fixture.The cost of living is one of the factors driving demand. Morgenthau describes the Portland menu, which changes monthly, as “striking a really nice balance between providing the full Portland experience and a lower price point”.George Livesey, chef and founder of Bulrush, said that prior to 2020 his 8pm tables were taken for casual dining by a much younger crowd. Nowadays 90% were booked for special occasions. Part of the reason he introduced his earlier and cheaper menu was to attract the younger demographic back.“This gives people a chance to experience a decent Michelin-sized tasting menu at a not outrageous price point,” Livesey said.Even east London hipsters are embracing toddler dining times. At Silo, the world’s first zero-waste restaurant in Hackney Wick, 6pm diners can opt for an abbreviated version of its full tasting menu. At Pophams in London Fields, a 6pm booking gets you a £30 three-course set menu featuring dishes such as goat’s cheese ravioli and an apple crumble croissant from its bakery.The trend is also having a knock-on effect on pre-dinner drinking. The Firmdale group, which includes London’s the Covent Garden hotel, has introduced a Martini hour. From 5pm to 6pm it serves them shaken or stirred – with free chips.Hybrid working is another driving factor. Since January, OpenTable, an online reservation site, has reported a 6% rise in bookings for tables between 4pm and 6pm in Britain. Morgenthau describes the 5.30pm slot as “busier than ever” across his group. The TWaT trend (Tuesday to Thursday in-office work) has also resulted in the traditional end-of-week dinner moving to Thursday.“We get a lot of couples that come into central London to work,” Morgenthau said. “They want to meet up before heading home but don’t want to be out too late.” This week, Livesey had a customer who flagged on their 5.30pm booking that they needed to leave by 8pm to catch a train home.Morgenthau said: “What creates a good atmosphere in a restaurant isn’t the time. The lovely hum comes from having a full room.” It seems nowadays you’re more likely to find that before 8pm.Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are several Con Air Cages in white vests, one of whom has a toy bunny in a small cardboard box. Several can genuinely claim an uncanny likeness to the actor; one or two others might uncharitably be said to be closer to Cage’s character in Face/Off, who surgically swaps his own distinctive features for the face of someone else – in that case, John Travolta – who looks nothing like him.For a performer whose public persona is never less than eccentric, a parade of several Cages might feel entirely appropriate. The explanation for this event is more prosaic, however. The actor has a new film out: The Surfer (“gloriously demented” –the Guardian), and as movie PRs are learning, if you’re after a burst of offbeat publicity these days, there’s no surer way to do it than with a supposedly spontaneous, designedly shonky celebrity lookalike contest.View image in fullscreenAli Plumb (L) and Daniel Breuer. Breuer said ‘Nicolas Cage has been the only constant’ celebrity comparison in his life.Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APt“I’ve had a whole lifetime of ridicule and this is my moment of glory,” says Raising Arizona Cage Daniel Breuer, who works in the music industry and says he is compared to someone famous almost every day of his life. While Serpico-era Al Pacino and Jerry Seinfeld also feature, “Nicolas Cage has been the only constant”.Patrick Doran, an actor and web designer, likewise says it is a constant refrain. “When I was younger, people used to say I looked like a young Nic Cage. Now it’s just: ‘You look like Nic Cage.’ I take it as a great compliment.”We can blame it all on 23-year-old American YouTuber Anthony Po (subscribers: 1.9m), who last October posted 100 sheets of A4 advertisinga Timothée Chalamet lookalike conteston lamp-posts around New York – he later said he had done it for a bet. Several dozen Chalamets showed up, as well as 10,000 or so other spectators and – surprising even Po –the real Chalamet. It concluded with four arrests, a $50 (£37.60) prize for the winner, and a worldwide publicity storm.Dublin was next on the bandwagon, hostinga Paul Mescal doppelganger contesta few weeks later, at which some other pale Irish men in short shorts competed for €20 (£17), three pints anda packet of Denny’s sausages. Though the actor didn’t make an appearance himself, he was later introduced to the winner, Jack Wall O’Reilly, a wannabe screenwriter,on a radio showand congratulated him on “captur[ing] the spirit of me very well”.View image in fullscreenThe lookalikes were awarded various prizes for their efforts.Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APFrom there, inevitably, things snowballed. AHarry Styles lookalike contest in Londonoffered prizes of £50, wine and some hair products. A group of friends in San Francisco, noting that only white male celebrity clones had been sought so far, organised a hunt forDev Patel doppelgangers. (“I just took people out and handed out burritos,” said the eventual winner, Jaipreet Hundal, of his $50 prize bonanza.)Chicago threw aJeremy Allen White contest, at which the cutest contender wasa toddler Carmiein white T-shirt and apron. New York sought a lookalike Zayn Malik, although it was unclear ifthe eventual winnerwas familiar with any One Direction songs.Glen Powellpersonally endorsedhis own lookalike contest in Austin, Texas, in November, inviting Powell clones to help him stage “a criminal Glenterprise” – “We all have the same face, it’s the perfect crime” – and attending (almost) in person, via a video call to his mum, who was one of the judges. He also offered the most distinctive prize: a cameo appearance for the winner’s parents in his next movie.By the timeDrake was offering $10,000to the winner of his own lookalike contest in Toronto in December – claimed by a 21-year-old woman, Makayla Chambers, who had pigtails and a drawn-on beard – you might have questioned if the trend had jumped the shark.Not according to Cage’s publicists, who on Friday were offering prizes for the People’s Cage (“best overall lookalike”), the Cagiest Cage (“best cosplay”) and the Ragiest Cage (hopefully self-explanatory).First prize – life membership of thePrince Charles cinema– was awarded by popular acclaim to Breuer, who said he felt “like I won the Oscar, which of course Cage did for Leaving Las Vegas”. Some of the other competitors had had him “quaking in his snakeskin boots”, he said, “but I knew I had the highest kick in the game”.Explore more on these topicsNicolas CageLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, she’s wrapping up her hit Netflix serial killer series and entering her detective eraFri 2 May 2025 08.00 EDTShareIn the beginning, Penn Badgley assumed his new co-star in the smash-hit Netflix thriller You was a lot like her character. This, jokes said co-star Charlotte Ritchie, was “somewhat rude. Because it shows he did no research about me.” If he had, Badgley would quickly have deduced that the Londoner was nothing like Kate Galvin, a ruthless British heiress, who – for some godforsaken reason – decides to marry his serial killer protagonist Joe Goldberg. Instead, the 35-year-old has cemented her place in the British comedy firmament with her perky, subtly goofy screen presence and impeccable comic timing, as showcased in beloved comedies from university life opusFresh Meatto the BBC’s ingeniously silly supernatural sitcom Ghosts.At first, Ritchie was nervous about joining You. The drama, thenthree seasonsin, was already a colossal hit, adored for its knowingly ludicrous premise, bizarre twists and Badgley’s virtuoso portrayal of an apparently empathetic femicidal maniac. On set, Ritchie was impressed by Badgley’s ability to segue from “smart self-awareness” to serial killer mode. “His eyes go kind of wide and his face goes totally blank and inside I was like: Oh my God, that’s so horrifying!” she says.She “struggled at the beginning of filming – the classic imposter syndrome of coming into something so big”. It didn’t help that, upon arriving on set, she “really felt like nobody knew who I was or what I’d done”. Thankfully, that didn’t last. “I have to say I was really chuffed because Penn got Covid. That’s not why I was happy. But he started watchingGhostsand he really loved it. And it was so nice to get to share that with him, because Ghosts is so important to me.” (That said, Ritchie admits she still hasn’t seenGossip Girl, the 00s teen drama that made Badgley’s name.)View image in fullscreen‘I discovered a go-getting spark in New York!’ … Ritchie.Photograph: David ReissI’m speaking to Ritchie – who is just as friendly, unassuming and mildly awkward as fans might assume – on the day the fifth and final season of You is released. She has decamped to New York for promo, and is currently in a swish hotel room overlooking Central Park. To celebrate the show’s swansong, Netflix created an immersive version of Mooney’s, the bookstore Joe manages and Kate later buys for him, and whose basement – unbeknown to her – houses a large glass cage used by Joe to entrap his victims. Ritchie didn’t get to meet many actual fans at the event – it was an influencer-heavy crowd – but excitedly recalls encountering some devotees in the wild. She was out getting pancakes when she chanced upon a group of girls discussing You. “It turns out they thought I looked a bit like the girl from the show. And, quite unlike me, I was like: hey, you guys talking about the show? It was so lovely.Actually,” she abruptly puts a lid on such earnest enthusiasm. “One of them hadn’t seen it. I might have ruined their breakfast.”Speculation about the end of You has been rife: would nightmarish “nice guy” Joe get his just deserts or live happily ever after with Kate, who returns to New York with him and his son Henry at the end ofseries four? (Critics, it must be said, weren’t hugely impressed with theeventual answer.) I won’t give away our antihero’s fate, but it’s no spoiler to say that the show closes with a meta comment on the viewers’ complicity in his crimes – after all, we’ve been lapping up the antics of a murderer for years. Ritchie endorses this take, but only to an extent. “The best way to shut down a toxic character – or an attention-seeking psychopath – would be to not pay them attention. But just as you think he could have some redemption, he says: well, I guess [the blame is shared] because you guys love me so much. Heaven forbid he just takes responsibility for his actions, and realises we’re watching because we want to see him punished.”As for the actual denouement, Ritchie has spent the last year keeping stumm. “I didn’t want to ruin it for people. Like when Dumbledore died in Harry Potter and someone put a big banner on the bridge.” She mentions this as if it’s some epochal world event; I have to say I have no idea what she’s on about. “The day after the book came out, someone skim-read it then [made the banner],” she says, still palpably outraged. “I thought: you suck!”View image in fullscreenKiller couple … Ritchie with Penn Badgley in You.Photograph: NetflixAs it happens, Harry Potter was one of the starting blocks for Ritchie’s career. As a schoolgirl, she can be spotted sitting behind Harry and Ron in a Hogwarts classroom inHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire– though she is determined to play down her role as an uncredited extra (“I am student number 4007 and I’m waggling my eyebrows for about five minutes”; when she saw the finished scene she “thought I really overacted and was pretty ashamed”). Ritchie had become enamoured with acting – particularly of the comic variety – as a child: “I remember really clearly making someone’s grandad in the front row laugh at a sketch I did at primary school and thinking that felt great. And I can’t work out if that was an ego boost thing or a control thing.” Was she the funny one among her peers? She makes a face: “All my friends would say nooo,no.”In fact, Ritchie soon set off on a different path, joining classical girl group All Angels, whose first album became the fastest-selling classical debut in UK chart history. Sixth form saw her ricochet between concerts at the Royal Albert Hall and the O2 and lessons. The juxtaposition was surreal: after an evening on stage she would find herself “in double history thinking: What?! Did I imagine that?” She didn’t mention her showbiz escapades to her friends, having “learned at a young age that telling hilarious stories about my acting adventures was only really interesting to my mum”.It sounds like an awful lot for a child to handle, yet it’s only now that Ritchie is “beginning to realise that the pace of life I thought was normal in my teens and my 20s was too much. But at the time I was running on adrenaline and I thought anxiety was a sign of doing really well.” At her selective, “high-pressure” girls’ school, Ritchie was a conscientious student, and unsurprisingly these instincts didn’t leave her at university. She was cast as Fresh Meat’s Oregon – an ordinary girl with an eye-watering determination to appear edgy and cool – in her final year at Bristol. The show was a big deal, but her perfectionist tendencies meant that after a hard day’s filming, Ritchie spent her evenings ploughing through her English dissertation. “Looking back, I do wish I hadn’t worked so hard on it. No one’severasked me what I did or got.” I seize the opportunity. “It was about how the movement of time manifests in language,” she says, baffled by the brain power of her younger self. “I don’t know how I managed to get that together. And I got a 2.1. I was pretty chuffed.”Despite her excellent performance in Fresh Meat – and the excellence of the show in general (it was, after all,SuccessioncreatorJesse Armstrongand his writing partnerSam Bain’s follow-up toPeep Show) – success wasn’t immediate. “I don’t even know if I got one job between series one and two. I’d met other actors who had been going to LA to do a pilot season, and I remember asking my agent, should I? And she was very sweetly like: I don’t know if this is the right time. You’ve done one thing.” To the casual observer, however, it looks as if she has been in high demand ever since, with lead roles in sitcoms Siblings and Dead Pixels, a four-series stint inCall the Midwife, an appearance on Taskmaster and cameos in comedies includingStath Lets Flats(she did an Edinburgh fringe sketch show with creator Jamie Demetriou when they were both students).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ritchie has just starred alongside Alicia Vikander and Elizabeth Olsen in the dystopian fertility dramaThe Assessment. Next, she’s joining Tom Burke and Steve Coogan in Legends, the true story of the UK customs officers who infiltrated drug-dealing gangs in the 1990s.But before all that, she’s entering her detective era thanks to ITV thriller Code of Silence. Written by Catherine Moulton, who recently penned twisty hitThe Stolen Girl, it follows Ritchie’s DS Ashleigh Francis, who enlistsRose Ayling-Ellis’s deaf canteen worker to lip-read on an investigation. Getting to run the gamut of police procedural tropes felt “quite monumental. It was really fun to say things like ‘stand down’ or use a walkie-talkie.” She frowns at her example. “That’s so basic, I can’t believe I said that.” But Ritchie was also keen to prevent her permanently exhausted Francis from becoming a stock character. “There’s details you can put in – I had her eating like a million sweets because she’s never slept enough and she’s had enough coffee. So there’s always a Haribo on the go or some strawberry laces.”If the actor herself is feeling at all worn out, she’s hiding it well. She says she feels reinvigorated – partly thanks to her experiences filming You: New York “ambition and optimism” has rubbed off on her. “I think I discovered a bit of go-getting in me while I was here. I definitely came back to London with a spark.” Does what she’s aiming to go and get stretch beyond her flourishing acting career? “Actually yes, but if I say it then I won’t do it so I’m going to try anddosome of it this year and if we speak again I’ll tell you …” She sighs at her own obfuscation. “That soundssomysterious – basically yes but I haven’t quite worked out what it is …” I am left none the wiser, yet also reassured: her time on slick US sets may have given Ritchie a new lease of life, but the bumbling Britishness that has made her one of our comedy queens clearly dies hard.Code of Silence is on ITV1 on 18 May; You is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsCharlotte RitchieTelevisionDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Katie, 28, who lives in Utah, remembers longing for candy as a child but “feeling like I couldn’t eat a single Skittle”.After nearly a decade of struggling, she sought medical help and was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. Katie’s hard-won recovery was driven by her dream of motherhood – she knew she wanted a baby and worried it “would suffer and not develop right because I was restricting food”, she recalls.When Katie became pregnant at 25, her relationship with food was the healthiest it had ever been. Soon, TikTok and Instagram began serving her motherhood wellness content, even though she hadn’t searched for it.One common theme was food purity. Posts warned against the “dangers” of common grocery items – that there was high-fructose corn syrup in most baby formula and harmful levels of pesticides in a box of cereal (both claimshave been debunked).Another theme: the corrupt medical system. “The content is telling you not to trust your doctor, saying the system is outdated and vicious, misogynistic,” says Katie. She recalls creators claiming theglucose drinkdoctors administer as part of a test for gestational diabetes was “poison”.Katie watched influencers who have beencritiqued by expertsfor exaggerating and misrepresenting health risks, including Courtney Swan, who hasrecommended a supplementto “detox the spike proteins” of the Covid vaccine; self-styled food-safety investigator Vani Hari, whom Vox called a “peddler of pseudoscience”; and siblings Casey and Calley Means, a physician and entrepreneur, the latter of whomclaimed“kids should be drinking moreraw milk” despite medicalconsensusthat it can contain pathogens linked to life-threatening illness.These creators have much in common: all encourage hypervigilance about supposed dietary threats, have publicly supported health secretaryRobert F Kennedy Jr, and profit from the ideas they spread. Many food-purity creators benefit from ad revenue driven by their attention-grabbing claims or sales of products like supplements, diet books, colon cleanses or online courses.“There is a small grain of truth in some alarmist food content”, which helps it appeal to people’s sense of skepticism and caution, says Christy Harrison, a registered dietitian, author and host of the Rethinking Wellness podcast. “But it often gets blown up beyond all proportion.”For instance, the American food industry engages in problematic practices, such as confined animal feeding operations and industry lobbying against regulations. “But in my many years of reading nutrition research, I’ve found that the rhetoric connecting food-industry practices to weight and human health is often overblown and not backed by sound science,” she says.What do we mean when we say women can be ‘too muscular’?Read moreWatching these sensationalist social media posts “planted a seed in my head”, Katie says. By the time she delivered her son in 2023, she was obsessively fixated on the healthfulness, safety and purity of food. “I was scared to even eat the vegetables in my fridge” because of pesticides, she says.“I thought it would be safer for me to risk going back to restrictive food patterns to protect myself and my breastfed baby from all these bad things,” says Katie.According to experts, anxious preoccupation with the safety and purity of food is aform of disordered eatingcalled orthorexia.“Orthorexia nervosa was coined in 1997 by an integrative physician named Steven Bratman,” says Harrison, the dietitian. “He was seeing a lot of obsessive thinking about food and nutrition in his patients.”Being mindful about food isn’t inherently disordered – many people want to eat healthily. By contrast, “orthorexia can be defined as an obsessive and extreme fixation on food, like purity of food, healthfulness of food, cleanliness,” Harrison says. “It’s a very common way people can be disordered about eating,” she says. Chemophobia, an irrational, broad distrust of chemicals based in misinformation, is another common symptom.Nonetheless, orthorexia remains under the radar. It is not yet listed in psychiatric classification systems such as the DSM-5, and can be difficult for doctors to distinguish from basic health-consciousness.Orthorexia can present on a spectrum and be harmful regardless of severity, explains Harrison. Severe orthorexia presents as a level of obsessiveness that can “interfere with people’s lives”, disrupting major factors such as social relationships and work, she says. It can lead to nutritional deficiencies, andco-occurwith body dysmorphia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and anorexia.“It’s not just healthy eating. It takes over your entire brain,” says Katie, who still considers herself orthorexic, but is working on recovery.A 2023meta-analysisfound that orthorexia is prevalent across genders, and that “the proportion of orthorexia nervosa symptoms seems to be increasing”. Men are more likely to frame restrictive eating around performance and fitness (think raw-meat diets and biohacking) and women around food-purity concerns.View image in fullscreen‘Orthorexia is politically useful to keep people anxious about what’s safe, what’s true and who can be trusted.’Composite: Guardian/Getty ImagesClinically significant orthorexia – cases where obsessive “healthy” eating causes impairment in daily life – israrein research studies. But the current literature does not capture what’s happening right now, says Danielle Shine, an Australian registered dietitian and PhD candidate researching nutrition misinformation in social media, who is working with several clients in recovery from orthorexia.“Social media is causing more and more people to develop disordered beliefs and behaviors” around food, says Shine.One 2017studyfound that 49% of Instagram users who followed health food-oriented accounts displayed orthorexia symptoms. Since then, short-form video platforms including TikTok have risen in popularity, supercharging the reach of alarmist food-purity content.Allison Hume, 40, an elementary school teacher and mother of two in Ontario, found herself acutely anxious about her and her family’s health and safety after a difficult second birth during the Covid pandemic.“While rocking my new baby, I spent hours on social media,” she said. In particular, she consumed information from Hari and Bobby Parrish. Parrish, a creator without formal nutritional qualifications, has been criticized bychemistsanddietitiansfor spreading alarmist misinformation.These creators “made me feel safe at the time, because their information was so black-and-white”, says Hume. “They would say: ‘Stop eating x, y and z and you won’t get cancer.’ It felt comforting.”Hari has a “no-no list” that includes many common ingredients generally recognized as safe when consumed in typical amounts, including natural flavors, emulsifiers and MSG. Many of these additives are found inultra-processed foods, which the National Institutes of Health generallyadviseseveryone to eat less of due to their frequently high fat, salt and sugar content. But seeing these additives framed as outright threats, Hume began to fear them.She tossed all foods containing these “no-no” ingredients, and shopped exclusively at high-end natural food markets. This doubled her grocery spending, “which was a big financial strain”, she says.My secret life as a model: ‘High fashion loved me most when I was visibly bony’Read moreTo check whether products contained forbidden additives, Hume used ingredient-scanning apps. If she had to purchase something “bad” because an approved item was unavailable, “it would be hard to sleep at night”, she says. “I really did think that our health was at stake if I didn’t follow these rules. The idea was that if we did get sick, it would be my fault and mine alone.”At the time, she didn’t know there was a name for the obsessive, disordered thinking she was experiencing. “I was in denial that anything was wrong with me,” she says.But her family noticed huge mood changes. Hume became irritable and controlling. “I remember asking myself why everything was so hard,” she says. “Why aren’t other people following the same food rules? Why don’t they care about their health as much as I do?”When she reflects on these habits now, Hume feels guilty. “It did end up affecting others around me as well, in particular my mom,” she says. “She also has a lot of health anxiety and it increased due to my influence.”Now, Hume is working with professionals to overcome orthorexia, and believes that content creators intentionally manipulate people like her.“They are very aware of what they are doing. They are making a lot of money off vulnerable people like me … people like parents, the elderly and the chronically sick, and I really don’t think they care,” says Hume.Since the Covid-19 pandemic, trust in American health institutions hasdeclined, creating fertile ground for wellness misinformation. In its place has risen aconspiratorial digital ecosystemandanti-sciencerhetoric promoted by figures such as RFK Jr – whose“Make America healthy again” (Maha) sloganhas been adopted by his supporters, including a subset of self-described “mama bears” who see themselves as family protectors.“If I’m nursing a baby and my brain is tired, it’s really easy to fall for these emotionally charged videos that are designed to target the ‘mama bear’ within me,” says Katie.Alarmist Maha posts can trigger or perpetuate orthorexic behaviors in viewers, even if that is not the creators’ intention.In food-purity culture, personal vigilance is the only safeguard against threats to health; sickness is caused by being lazy, ignorant and poisoning yourself. Mama bears have adopted this logic with particular fervor.

But Maha mom creators also spread misinformation; in one viral post, a creator falsely claimed that propylene glycol – used as a food additive in salad dressing – was the same asantifreeze.The underlying message of much Maha food content is that mothers must try to cook from scratch as much as possible, not just because it’s tasty or pleasant to do so, but because food in the US is inherently “dangerous”.Yet according to the 2022Global Food Security Index, the US ranks third in global food-safety standards, behind Canada and Denmark. “We have an incredibly safe food supply in the US in general. Historically, the FDA has done a pretty good job of keeping us safe,” says Harrison. “And I’m no apologist for the food industry.”“My issue with it is that they’re using food as a way to try to entrap women and give up certain types of political and economical power,” Dr Alex Ketchum, a professor at McGill University’s Institute for Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies, whose work explores food and culture, says of Maha ideology.More domestic work means less time for community engagement, activism and ambitions. In her 1995 work Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body, philosopher Susan Bordo describes dieting as a form of self-deprivation that aligns with broader cultural narratives requiring women to limit their presence in the public sphere, both physically, by being smaller, and socially, by conforming to restrictive ideals. For Bordo, this shrinking is less about weight than about diminishing women’s agency and visibility.Ozempic is hailed as a miracle drug. But how does it affect people with eating disorders?Read moreOrthorexia extends this logic: its norms of hypervigilance, self-reliance and purity represent another form of self-discipline serving systems of control. It is also politically useful to keep people anxious about what’s safe, what’s true and who can be trusted.“Holding citizenry in fear and making them anxious around food in particular is one of the ways authoritarian or totalitarian leaders exert their power,” observes Dr Emily Contois, an associate professor of media studies at the University of Tulsa.In Benito Mussolini’s fascist Italy of the 1920s-40s, says Contois, food became a political tool used to reinforce women’s roles in the home. The regime relied on women as domestic caretakers – what Contois calls “home-front civic engineers”. Mothers were expected to make do with food shortages, masking policy failures with their sheer force of labor as the government failed to provide basic care.Navigating the medical system can be frustrating for people with chronic illnesses who don’t feel like they’re getting satisfying answers from their doctors. The idea of experimenting with alternative paths to relief, like “cleaning up” one’s diet, can feel like a matter of survival. But attempts to get better can spiral into a harmful place.Anna Zambreny, 29, a Maryland-based healthcare recruiter, says she has spent at least six years with orthorexia.Zambreny cut out foods including gluten, dairy, eggs and meat while trying to heal various ailments, including eczema, Lyme disease and fatigue. The safest way to try eliminating food groups is with the help of a registered dietitian who can ensure adequate nutrition; Zambreny took advice from social media food-purity influencers and an allergist who recommendedscientifically uncrediblebooks like Dr William Davis’s Wheat Belly.“The idea that we weren’t being told the truth about food and that it was poisoning us started to affect my relationships. I didn’t really want to eat out … I didn’t really enjoy anything,” she says.Zambreny’s health symptoms progressed despite her efforts; now she reflects that many of them were likely rooted in self-inflicted malnourishment.“I felt like everything I was eating could make or break my health,” she says. “I don’t think I was getting enough variety of food.”Today, Zambreny feels angry and frustrated with the influencers she once trusted, some of whom she’s seen flip-flop on their messages.“They were vegan and then they’ve gone completely carnivore, or they were anti-medication and now they say getting on anxiety medication is the best thing that ever happened to them. And that feels very harmful to me because depending on when you tune into what they are talking about, it can really sway what you’re doing,” she says.“It makes me mad,” says Zambreny. “It feels like they don’t actually care about changing health policy. It’s more like status they’re looking for … They’re so out of touch with the health advice most people need.”Zambreny’s frustration may resonate at a moment when basic nutritional support is eroding,hunger rates are climbingandfood prices are surging. This year, Trump has cut$660m of fundingfor local produce in schools and childcare centres, and canceled another$500min funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which helps food banks. He has also proposed reductions to the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), threatening universal free meal programs for children and theSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), which approximately 42 million people rely on for food essentials.“There’s this expectation that you are personally responsible for your own health,” says Contois – despite social determinants of health, such as physical environment, education access and economic status, being largely beyond individual control.Fear-mongering around less urgent issues can distract people from more pressing health risks. “If you can make people afraid, you open the door for all sorts of policies to be possible,” says Contois.For instance, West Virginia recently bannedseveral food dyes. But the state has some of the highestdiabetes,heart disease,cancer,infant mortalityanddrug-overdose ratesin the country. Expertsarguethe ban is performative, and will not meaningfully improve West Virginians’ health.“It’s gamifying government and science and regulation instead of actually creating processes that ensure a safe, fair and transparent food system for all,” says Contois.Social media food-purity culture does not tend to focus on systemic problems such as the climate crisisdegrading waterandsoil quality, orreducedoil-and-gas industry regulations that could lead to more heavy-metal pollution in the environment and foodways.Telling people their biggest problem is junk-food additives or pasteurized milk is a “distraction from the collective challenges of the US food system”, says Ketchum.Orthorexia shows us what can happen when confusing, alarmist voices fill the silence left by collapsing health and environmental institutions.“Science-minded professionals saved me in the end,” says Hume, who now follows several evidence-based health and nutrition professionals on social media, including dietitianAndy Millerand health communicatorDr Andrea Love.Now comes the ‘womanosphere’: the anti-feminist media telling women to be thin, fertile and RepublicanRead moreFor people struggling with orthorexia, Harrison recommends working with a registered dietitian and a therapist. Treatments for orthorexia include “challenging disordered beliefs about food, [dietitians] offering ‘meal support’ to help clients get through anxiety-producing meals and referring to a higher level of care if needed”, she says.It has taken consistent hard work and patience, but Hume has “very few food fears” now. “I remember telling my psychotherapist that I ate a hot dog for the first time in three years,” she said. “I was very nervous about it, but boy, was it good!”But Hume has already lost a lot to her food-purity obsession. “I always get teary-eyed when I think back to missing all the special memories I could have made with my newborn and my three-year-old,” she says. “I was so preoccupied with what I thought was keeping them ‘safe’.”Recovery from orthorexia isn’t only about personal healing. It also requires a cultural shift: access to safe, science-backed nutrition for all; investment in public health infrastructure; and a renewed commitment to care, trust and collective responsibility for our shared wellbeing.“This isn’t a time to put up a fence and build a moat,” says Contois. “This is the time to build a longer table and invite other people into it. That’s the only way we get through this.”Name has been withheld for privacyIn the US, help is available atnationaleatingdisorders.orgor by callingANAD’seating disorders hotline at 800-375-7767.

But is a new publisher dedicated to ‘overlooked’ male voices necessary?Ella CreamerFri 2 May 2025 11.12 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 11.14 EDTShare‘Where have all the literary blokes gone?” is a question that has popped up in bookish discussions and op-eds from time to time in recent years. Who are this generation’s hotshot young male novelists, the modern incarnations of the Amis/McEwan/Rushdie crew of the 80s?The question flared again this week as writer Jude Cook launched anew press, Conduit Books, which plans to focus, at least initially, on publishing male authors.Cook says the publishing landscape has changed “dramatically” over the last 15 years as a reaction to the “toxic male-dominated” scene of the 80s, 90s and 00s. Now, excitement in publishing circles centres on a “new breed of young female authors, spearheaded by Sally Rooney et al”. While this is “only right as a timely corrective”, the side-effect is that male authors are “often overlooked”, their voices deemed problematic.Are male novelists actually in decline? Some metrics certainly say so: of all the writers to appear on the weekly Sunday Times bestseller lists for fiction hardbacks so far this year, just a third are men.However, there are multiple ways to cut the pie. Though women dominate the fiction charts, Richard Osman’s novels took the top two spots for the most books sold in the UK last year. While the 2024Booker prize shortlistfeatured five women and one man, the2023 listhad more people called Paul than women.In nonfiction the picture is clearer: men make up 63% of authors to feature on the Sunday Times nonfiction hardback bestseller lists so far this year and 70% of those on the nonfiction paperback charts, with titles such as Atomic Habits by James Clear continuing to sell well years after publication.Writers and publishing insiders disagree over the extent of the gender imbalance in fiction, and the extent to which that imbalance is a concern.View image in fullscreenCopies of Sally Rooney’s most recent novel Intermezzo.Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images“It is indeed the case that publishers are finding it increasingly difficult to break out male writers, as [publisher] Hannah Westland noted a few years ago”, said Neel Mukherjee, author of novels including The Lives of Others. In 2021, Westlandtold the Observerthat the “paths to success” are narrower for male writers.“There is no doubt male voices talking about male experiences – in middle age especially – are not getting much traction among agencies and publishers at the moment,” said one male agent, who asked to remain anonymous. However, men are “hardly underrepresented in the entertainment industry, and they need to earn their place as much as anyone else”.Men “should make the work and let everyone decide if it’s worth anyone’s time, rather than pretend they are a minority in the arts”, says Sheena Patel, author of I’m a Fan. “I feel like men are doing just fine.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The latest Publishers Associationworkforce surveysuggests that 68% of publishing staff are women.Another female agent said that class may be a “bigger issue than gender when it comes to what’s being published”. Lacking racial representation also continues to be a problem: just one person of colour appeared on each of the Top 10 fiction and nonfiction hardback bestseller lists last week, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie for fiction and Roxie Nafousi for nonfiction.Luke Brown, the author of My Biggest Lie and Theft, said he knows “so many working-class men from my generation who got into reading fiction through Irvine Welsh, for example, because it spoke to a world they recognised”.Welsh himself says that “men need to start reading before they start writing. My take is that men are becoming stupider because they over-rely on the internet and women are becoming smarter because they read more books.”Indeed, some suggest the decline of male novelists being commissioned is due to low demand from men. In 2024, 37% of fiction purchases in the UK were made by men, according to NielsenIQ BookData. While women buy more books overall, having made 58% of all book purchases last year, men buy more nonfiction (55% v 45% bought by women).“Men need to read women and I think women should read men,” says Brown. “It’s one of the great ways we can come to understand each other better”.Cook’s new venturemet with some criticismonline. However, Mukherjee said that the project comes from a position that is “the opposite of Farage-ist grievance or misogyny-driven rabble-rousing.”“No doubt there will be a lot of hand-wringing about this, and condemnation” he added. “But writing and publishing are not zero-sum games.”Explore more on these topicsBooksFictionPublishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A fortnight ago Vaibhav Suryavanshi, 14, was a fringe player for the Rajasthan Royals and the youngest of a bunch of teenagers on the books of the league’s 10 teams. On 19 April he made his debut and hit his first ball for six, then, on 28 April, in an hour of incendiary batting, hescored a hundred off 35 balls, with 11 sixes disappearing to all corners. It was the second fastest-century in the history of the tournament and, by the time he went to bed that night, Suryavanshi was one the most famous people in India.In the days since, Suryavanshi’s innings has been pored over by the league’s millions of fans, the clips watched and shared over and again on social media. His short life story has been retold endlessly on TV, radio, podcasts and in print. He has been praised by politicians, sportsmen and celebrities, and offered advice by everyone who is anyone in Indian cricket, including Sachin Tendulkar, who made his professional debut at the same age. Everyone who’s ever had anything to do with him, from his mother and father through to his junior coaches and his former teammates, has been sought out to share what they have to say.In that time Suryavanshi has weathered his first scandal. An old video interview in which he stated he was 18 months older than his registered age went viral and was reported on around the world. Cricket being the sport it is, he has alsoendured his first IPL duck, when he was caught off his second ball in Rajasthan’s match against Mumbai Indians on Thursday. The roar of applause that greeted him when he arrived at the crease, and the stunned silence that fell around the ground in the moments after he was out, were another sign that his life has changed out of all recognition in two weeks.“Let’s be realistic,” said Rajasthan’s coach Rahul Dravid earlier in the week. “He’s going to go through some ups and downs.” Dravid, who made his reputation as a coach by steering India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup, pleaded with the media to “please be realistic in how you write about not only his success but his potential failures”. After Suryavanshi’s duck, Dravid was duly confronted with a flood of stories about how he had apparently “failed to hide his own disappointment” after the teenager “crashed back to earth” by getting out for nought, a performance that launched a thousand memes.View image in fullscreenVaibhav Suryavanshi was dismissed for a second-ball duck against Mumbai Indians on Thursday.Photograph: Surjeet Yadav/APDravid ought to know better than to ask. When theIPLlaunched in 2008 the organisers made a point of encouraging actors and actresses to come in as investors to give it primetime celebrity appeal. Seventeen years later the tournament itself seems to have grown into India’s favourite soap and become one of the most successful domestic sports competitions in the world. According to the broadcaster JioStar, 525 million people watched last year’s tournament on TV and another 425 million on mobile devices. Wherever there’s a signal, there’s someone following the latest IPL goings-on.Including in Bihar, the impoverished north-east province where Suryavanshi was born and raised, dreaming, all the while, of a career in the big leagues. His is a very modern Indian story. The outline is familiar. There have been plenty of young players in the league before who had similar tales of humble beginnings and hard sacrifices. His father was a club cricketer who had to sell off a patch of farmland to pay for his boy to attend the nearest cricket academy, 90 miles away in Patna. His mother woke at 3am every day to make him breakfast for the commute.In Patna, Suryavanshi would train endlessly. He says he faced 450 balls a day and there were more in the little net his father built when he got back home again. Bihar used to be a bit of a cricket backwater, but the IPL teams have scouts everywhere now and they were monitoring his progress through the provincial ranks and the national Under-19 team, where he scored a century in a youth Test match against Australia. In 2024, still only 13, he earned his first contract when Rajasthan bought him for just over £100,000. The league is, as India’s beloved commentator Harsha Bhogle often says, the place “where talent meets opportunity”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the viral video he says he will be celebrating his 14th birthday on 27 September 2023. That would make him 16 now, although the game’s governing body, the Board of Control forCricketin India, insists that “bone tests” show he is not. It’s not unusual for there to be confusion about the exact age of players in his situation. Even now we don’t know the exact age of Hasan Raza, who became the youngest man to play Test cricket when he made his debut for Pakistan in 1996. And in truth his exact age doesn’t matter much, because what’s beyond doubt is that he is young, gifted and has the world at his feet.Explore more on these topicsIPLCricketTwenty20featuresShareReuse this content"

Despite being on Russia’s ‘wanted’ list, she remains hopeful for the futureFri 2 May 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 12.26 EDTShareTen minutes into our interview, Nadya Tolokonnikova ducks to fetch a piece of paper from the floor and I find myself looking at something unexpected behind her. Next to a double bed, two crucifixes hang on the wall. Given the Siberia-born artist is best known for a performance piece that so offended the head of the Russian Orthodox church that he called it blasphemy, the discovery of such devotional regalia comes as a surprise. It certainly doesn’t suggest “religious hatred”, which is what a Moscow court said in 2012 motivated Tolokonnikova’s groupPussy Riotto perform a “punk prayer” in the city’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, before sentencing her to two years’ imprisonment. Nor does it smack of someone bent on hurting the “religious feelings of believers” – the charge under which Tolokonnikova was sentenced again two years ago, this time in absentia, and put on Russia’s wanted list.Famous for performing in garishly coloured balaclavas, Pussy Riot appeared unmasked in court in 2012 – which turned the photogenic Tolokonnikova into the most globally recognisable face of a wave of protests against the then Russian PMVladimir Putin. But looking at those bedside crosses, and at her new exhibition in Berlin, you wonder if everyone got the wrong end of the stick. Part of the German capital’s gallery weekend, her solo show Wanted at Galerie Nagel Draxler feature not only a replica of her former prison cell and a screening of the Putin’s Ashes performance that led to her wanted status, but also Tolokonnikova’s own paintings of religious icons. She uses tasteful old Slavic calligraphy techniques – while putting the icons in Pussy Riot ski masks.Putin’s Ashes by Pussy Riot.“I don’t have any hatred of the Orthodox church,” says the 35-year-old, who prefers her location not to be disclosed, as she speaks to me over Zoom. “I don’t like the corrupt elements, but it is a part of the heritage our country can actually be proud of.” She pauses. “That was something very difficult to communicate to the judge, who didn’t want to listen.”The Punk Prayer electrified Europe and beyond. Balaclavas appeared inHollywood filmsand on the runway atNew York fashion week. “Progress is not guaranteed / I say Pussy Riot’s what we need”,sang American singer-songwriter Jeffrey Lewis. “Pussy Riot are a reminder that revolution always begins in culture,” the Guardianpronounced. But the revolution never came. Pussy Riot’s protest marked a genuine moment of weakness in Putin’s system, but their boldness may have inadvertently led the world to view Russian society as more courageous and determined than was the case.“I think it’s awesome that you guys romanticised Russian society,” says Tolokonnikova, with a cheerfulness that teeters on sarcasm. “The fact that you saw it as strong may have been a factor in it believing it actually was.”View image in fullscreenPussy Riot performing last year.Photograph: snapshot-photography/F Boillot/REX/ShutterstockThe last time shespoke to the Guardian, Tolokonnikova expressed hope that opposition leader Alexei Navalny could one day become a “worthy successor” to Putin. But Navalny, who supported Pussy Riot’s cause after initially dismissing them as “silly girls”, died in prison in February last year. “Maybe one day we’ll believe in someone as much as I believed in Navalny,” she says. “But not now.”What, amid all these devastating turns, does she find to draw hope from? In her 2018 book Read and Riot: A Pussy Riot Guide to Activism, Tolokonnikova wrote: “Art is capable of giving hope and meaning to those who are desperate.” But looking at her recent artistic output, you have to squint hard to detect much light.The Berlin exhibition is inspired by her reading of the work of the US clinical psychologist and trauma specialist Peter A Levine, who suggests patients close their eyes and revisit their traumas – while trying to relate different bodily experiences to them. So Tolokonnikova chose to build a replica of the isolation cell she was transferred to after going on hunger strike in 2013, leaving the open wards where she spent most of her incarceration. “I was thrilled when I was put in that cell,” she says. “The Russian system of penal colonies still resembles the gulag: people put in barracks without any personal space. So we only could dream about a personal cell.”View image in fullscreenTolokonnikova with her work Punk’s Not Dead Icon, left.Photograph: Philip Cheung/The GuardianAlongside this duplicate cell, other things will bring Tolokonnikova’s time there alive: her prison badge, the pay stubs for the paltry sums she received for her labour, and drawings sent to her by her young daughter. There will also be a print-out of theopen letterin which she announced her hunger strike in protest at the “slavery-like conditions”. It was smuggled out of jail by her ex-husband, the artist and activist Peter Verzilov, and led to an investigation, followed by the conviction of a member of the prison administration. It remains a work of enormous power.“It has been a year since I arrived at Penal Colony No 14 in the Mordovian village of Parts,” she wrote. “As the prisoner saying goes, ‘Those who never did time in Mordovia never did time at all.’ I started hearing about Mordovian prison colonies while I was still being held at Pre-Trial Detention Centre No 6 in Moscow. They have the highest levels of security, the longest workdays, and the most flagrant rights violation. When they send you off to Mordovia, it is as though you’re headed to the scaffold.”But there is an air of cynicism, even bitterness, to some of the new works. Mounted on the gallery walls are DIY “Molotov kits” that look like bottles of perfume. Shining in neon hues that echo Pussy Riot balaclavas, they seem to be making a provocative comment about the commodification of protest culture, something she was such a thrillingly pivotal part of.View image in fullscreenTolokonnikova holds her art work called Resilience: Riot Shield.Photograph: Philip Cheung/The GuardianShe does not hide her disillusionment. “I’m sad,” she says. “Ever since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine started I feel … defeated. I still do what I do. I still believe in the power of art. But these days, I feel like the musician from the movie Titanic, who was playing the violin. He can’t stop the ship from sinking, but he can lift the spirits of people while they are going down.”Talking of commodification, in her book Tolokonnikova insists Pussy Riot “don’t want to live in a world where everyone is for sale and nothing is for the public good”. But in 2021, she started an account on OnlyFans, the online platform where creators offer adult content to paying subscribers. She says that she also posts erotic self-portraits on her Instagram channel, and those are “for the public good”. And the stuff on OnlyFans? “Well, I really enjoy it. It arouses me. And it’s honest work. One needs to eat and pay the bills and pay for the kids’ education and that’s how I do it. Political art is not a good business strategy.”She catches herself and says: “I wouldn’t want this article to be called, ‘Nadya doesn’t have hope any more.’ If I didn’t have hope any more, I wouldn’t keep going, right?” She points to Mediazona, the independent news outlet she set up with Pussy Riot co-founders and the journalist Sergei Smirnov in 2014. Initially focused on Russian prison conditions, it has become one of the most-cited Russian-language media companies since the start of the Ukraine war, tracking Russian military deaths and allegingabuse of Ukrainian PoWs. Its staff recently said it was on the verge of collapse, unable to pull in enough crowdfunding revenue since Visa and Mastercard suspended operations in Russia. “I do still have hope,” she says. “It’s just not revolution. It’s more subtle and it’s more long-term.”Then she gets up to fetch one of those crucifixes and hold it to the camera. Pasted on the cross is a collage of naked women in pornographic poses, a riot of female genitalia. Suddenly the old Tolokonnikova seems not so far away.Wanted is at Galerie Nagel Draxler, Berlin, until 6 June.

Slot’s celebrations continued with his wife’s birthday meal on Monday before his focus switched back to business on Tuesday.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreSlot described last Sunday as one of the best days of his life and claimed it would motivate his squad to recreate the unforgettable scenes at Anfield next season. He believes Liverpool’s transfer targets will also want to be part of a “special” club.“To experience this once is really nice,” Slot said. “But we would love to experience it one more time. It has been special for all the fans and it’s definitely been special for the players and for us as well. Now we know why, when we start next season, what we do it for.“But it definitely helps to attract new players as well because mostly the players that we want, we are not the only club who thinks they are good players, so they have more options. Then maybe it helps for them to see that the way we do things here is special. Until now, if I spoke to players who we wanted to bring in, I always told them that our fans are really special and it is special to play at this club. But after Sunday I don’t think I ever have to tell anyone again how special our fans are because that was unbelievable.”View image in fullscreenArne Slot guided Liverpool to the title in his first season in charge.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAOne advantage ofwinning the Premier Leaguein April, according to Slot, is that it gives Liverpool more time to work on transfers and prepare for next season. He intends to use the final four matches as groundwork for next season by rotating his squad more than usual.He said of plans for next season: “I already did this a little bit in the background. It’s not like after we won the league was the first time Richard [Hughes, Liverpool’s sporting director] called me and said: ‘OK, these are the players we are interested in.’ That would be a bit weird. But there’s a bit more time now to have these conversations.“But let there be no mistake, we want to win every single game we play.

The Belgian’s dart into the box and clinical finish secured a fourth Premier League win in a row, at the expense of Wolves, to put City into third place and a step closer to qualifying for the Champions League.Manchester City v Wolves: Premier League – liveRead moreCity will be as pleased with the hard-fought victory, inspired by a humorous Neil Warnock team talk at training on Thursday, as Wolves are disappointed to leave with nothing. They rattled the woodwork twice and were the more dangerous team inside the box but when it comes to critical moments, there are few better in world football than De Bruyne as his experience outweighs his physical decline.“I am pretty sure it is not easy for him but the goal was massively important for us, it lifted our spirits,” Pep Guardiola said. “He does not have to prove anything, I know his quality, his level.”What Warnock made of City playing without a conventional striker is up for debate. De Bruyne, on his penultimate home game for City, was given freedom to roam in the final third as the hosts looked to dominate possession. Ilkay Gündogan and the Belgian rotated who was down the middle, while Omar Marmoush and Jérémy Doku attacked the flanks, looking to get in behind Wolves’ wing-banks, while creating space in the middle.With Vítor Pereira in charge, Wolves are very different from the brittle team that started the season under Gary O’Neil. They had won six in a row and were not intimidated by City, keeping things tight and every man working for everyone else in gold to limit the hosts all over the pitch.Wolves also have pace going forward and should have taken the lead when Matheus Cunha slipped a pass through a flat-footed City defence for Jean-Ricner Bellegarde to run on to. The winger raced into the box where he was joined by Marshall Munetsi and, having drawn out Ederson, he needed only to lay it to the Zimbabwean but overhit the pass, leaving the midfielder desperately stretching to reach it as the ball dribbled out for a goal kick.View image in fullscreenKevin De Bruyne tucks home the winner for Manchester City.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PACity were living dangerously, unable to deal with Wolves’ fast break. Rayan Aït-Nouri had two chances to open the scoring, first hitting a post and then Josko Gvardiol on the line with the rebound. City were enjoying the possession but Wolves looked the more dangerous, although Nico O’Reilly eventually tested José á after the half-hour mark with a rising shot.De Bruyne made Wolves pay and there was never a more popular scorer. Gündogan played in Doku, who showed off his quick feet, pulling the ball for his compatriot mid-slip, allowing the City captain to place into the bottom corner and instigated a chorus of “There’s only one Kevin De Bruyne” around the ground.There wasno new contract offer to De Bruyneand he will leave when his current deal expires in the summer. No one doubts that he still has the ability to influence games but Guardiola and City need players who can do so regularly. De Bruyne’s body has let him down in recent years but his trademark energy and vigour have returned for his swansong, able to offer the bursting runs and skills that have bedevilled opponents over the past decade. “A lot of teammates have said that it’s sad I have to go too but that’s just how it goes sometimes in life,” De Bruyne said. “I don’t know what the future will be, but I know that I can still play here.”Wolves have their talisman planning a summer exit but Cunha will be in much higher demand than De Bruyne. It was a sign of how dangerous Wolves were despite having to play on the break. City were increasingly sloppy in possession, allowing the visitors to frequently counter. O’Reilly was hooked by Guardiola for repeatedly giving the ball away, as Manuel Akanji was brought on to strengthen a susceptible back four, while the returning Erling Haaland remained unused.Wolves’ fight for parity almost took a huge blow when Aït-Nouri tried to perform a 360 degree turn, only to put his studs into Bernardo Silva’s ankle. VAR took a lengthy look but it was deemed no further action was required from the referee, Peter Bankes. “In the end I am very happy, very proud of my team, my players and supporters,” Pereira said. “Just the result was not right.”De Bruyne departed with seven minutes to go, giving fans a penultimate opportunity of a standing ovation, with Bournemouth’s upcoming visit his curtain call that is likely to include plenty of pomp and ceremony for the departing legend. He deserved the latest one for his performance on the night, not just for the sake of nostalgia. There is still plenty of time for that to come as City prepare to bid farewell to one of their heroes but he will leave with plenty of memories.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Last Saturday, three hours after Cardiff’s players sank to the turf when the final whistleconfirmed their relegation to the third tier, a division the club has not played in for 22 years, the squad slipped into suits for their annual black-tie awards night in a suite overlooking the same surface.At some point, Rubén Sellés, the Hull head coach, seemingly got wind of the jarring circumstances and cancelled his team’s bash, which had been scheduled for Tuesday, to prevent a similarly tone-deaf evening.Wrexham’s revolution faces a whole new challenge in the ChampionshipRead moreHull’s position is so delicate he even suggested he did not want his players having the added stress of adhering to the dress code. “It was my decision,” he said. “I told the club before we announced the player of the season [awards] that if we were playing for something, we didn’t want the distraction. The team needs to get out of the situation … I didn’t want the week to become a one-person week. The club respected that.”It has been that kind of week, at that time of the season. While Burnley and Leeds head into the final day of another enchanting English Football League season with eyes on taking the title, and the five-way fight for the two remaining playoff places promises more lunchtime drama, it is at the bottom where there is most jeopardy. Five teams – Stoke, Derby, Preston, Luton and Hull – are fighting to avoid joining Cardiff and Plymouth, who are all but mathematically relegated, in League One next season.PosTeamPGDPts1Leeds4564972Burnley4551973Sheff Utd4527894Sunderland4515765Bristol City454676Coventry454667Millwall450668Blackburn455659Middlesbrough45106410West Brom4586111Swansea45-56012Sheff Wed45-95713Watford45-85614Norwich4515415QPR45-115316Portsmouth45-135317Oxford Utd45-165218Stoke45-175019Derby45-84920Preston North End45-114921Luton45-224922Hull45-104823Plymouth45-364624Cardiff45-2344Sellés made another call this week, giving his players Monday off despite a late defeat at home to Derby plunging them deeper into trouble. “Under pressure, people need an extra space to breathe,” he said before their trip to Portsmouth. “Three training sessions this week will be enough to prepare the game.”The buildup has not been helped by the late payment of wages, even if Sellés says it pales into insignificance compared with the myriad of problems he encountered at troubled Reading, where at one point delays were commonplace.It appeared a significant upgrade when Sellés left Reading for Hull in December, but the teams could trade places if the Berkshire club, beset by off-field problems and awaiting a takeover, land a playoff berth on the final day. Last season, Hull went into their last game targeting the playoffs. Their hopes ended with defeat at Plymouth and three days later Acun Ilicali sacked Liam Rosenior, Hull’s owner citing a conflict of opinions. Rosenior, who led Hull to seventh in his first full season, is pushing to qualify for the Champions League with Ligue 1 Strasbourg, while his previous club are at risk of dropping into League One.View image in fullscreenLiam Rosenior, sacked by Hull after leading them to seventh place last season, is on the verge of reaching the Champions League with Strasbourg.Photograph: Sébastien Bozon/AFP/GettyThat provides another reminder the grass is not always greener. All the teams involved in the scrap to retain their second-tier status changed manager during this campaign – with mixed results. On 13 February, the day Derby turned to their former midfielder John Eustace to save their season, Luton were propping up the division and Preston were 11 points clear of the relegation zone. As recently as 3 March, Preston were closer to the playoffs than the bottom three, and they had a game in hand on Luton and Derby, who by that point had slid to the bottom after a winless start under Eustace. Paul Heckingbottom’s Preston had alsojust beaten their rivals Burnleyto advance to the FA Cup quarter-finals.Now Preston, who travel to playoff-chasing Bristol City, are bottom of the form table after taking six points from the past 30 available. Derby, who host Stoke, are one of the form teams after two defeats in their past 10 matches. Luton, who visit West Brom, have won three games on the spin under Matt Bloomfield, who made a slow start after jumping up a division.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mark McGuinness, their marquee signing from Cardiff last summer, has impressed in defence as has Thomas Kaminski in goal.Kaminski started Luton’s priceless victory last Saturday over Coventry, another team vying for the top six, despite the death of his father, Jacek, three days earlier. Bloomfield got the Eurostar to Brussels to accompany the Belgian back to England 48 hours before the win. “It means everything to me,” a teary Kaminski said. “Normally I should have had a message from my dad … I didn’t have it today but I know he is watching and with us and would have been very, very proud.”The only certainty from here is that the pendulum of emotions will continue given the stakes. This time last season Luton were winning friends in the Premier League, duking it out with Nottingham Forest to avoid the dropbefore succumbing on the final day. Derby were in party mode after clinching promotion as runners-up. Stoke finished strongly to dispel relegation worries. Preston, meanwhile, ended 10th – nestled in the safe zone – after a dismal five-match losing run.For one team, things are about to take a turn for the worse.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipHull CityLuton TownDerby CountyPreston North EndfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He continued his sublime breakthrough run on Friday night by holding on in a bruising encounter with the 10th seed Lorenzo Musetti to reach the Madrid Open final with a 6-3, 7-6 (4) win.This had already been another essential week in Draper’s blossoming career as his quarter-final winsecured his position inside the top fiveof the ATP rankings for the first time but he has taken it even further. He is now also the third man of the 2000s generation to reach a Masters 1000 final on hard court and clay after hisIndian Wells triumph in March. He is still yet to drop a set in Madrid.This time, the victory was made even sweeter by the presence of his mother, Nicky, in his player box after she flew in from London. “The last few times she’s come to watch me play, French Open first round I had a shocker, and then Monte Carlo this year was really poor in my second round,” he said. “Seems like every match she’s come to I’ve been terrible. So I was thinking when she said she was going to come yesterday I was like: ‘Ooh, I’m not sure if you should come.’“She ended up coming, and I’m glad she did, because tonight was a really good performance. Maybe her luck’s changed when she comes to watch me play, so we’ll see.”In the final, Draper will face Casper Ruud after the Norwegian 14th seed defeated Francisco Cerundolo of Argentina 6-4, 7-5.Throughout the event, Draper has repeatedly insisted that he always believed he could perform at a high level on clay despite the scepticism that often follows British players on this surface. He has backed up that confidence in full and has grown with every minute on the court.Draper’s performances have been testament to his increasingly complete game; he has served brilliantly at times, but he is also a top quality returner. As he continues to become comfortable moving on clay, it is extremely difficult to consistently put the ball past him. The most significant development in recent months, however, has been Draper’s forehand, a destructive weapon that has improved more than any shot in his game.“The impressive thing of him, he’s really a complete player,” said Musetti. “I would say he’s impressive also when he defends. For his height, it’s really high. And of course a lefty who can serve really well, especially for a one-handed backhand, it’s not easy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A Wimbledon semi-finalist and Olympic bronze medallist in the past year, the Italian reached his first Masters 1000 final in Monte Carlo last month. Armed with one of the most varied games on the tour alongside his excellent athleticism, Musetti was built to disrupt and neutralise Draper.From the beginning, the contest was predictably tough and physical but Draper overwhelmed the Italian with his weight and depth of shot, particularly off his forehand. Musetti remained calm, however, and he worked his way into the match by finding rhythm on his first serve and injecting pace into his forehand. By the second half of the set, Musetti was the better player and he constantly pressured Draper to hold serve and keep up.But the world No 5 has never been stronger, more mentally tough and as confident in his game. Under pressure against a classy opponent, he was patient and demonstrated his problem solving ability and his strength, taking back control of the match by mixing in serve and volleying. At the end of a high quality, breathless second set, Draper found a way to drag himself into the final and keep his remarkable run going.Explore more on these topicsJack DraperTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Thank you to Ronnie, he helped me a lot before. He’s my idol.”Ronnie O’Sullivan and Judd Trump roar into World Snooker semi-finalsRead moreO’Sullivan was gracious in defeat and warmly congratulated his opponent after he sealed victory with another effortless clearance to complete a 17-7 triumph. “Zhao deserves his victory,” he said.O’Sullivan trailed 12-4 going into the evening session and won the first two frames to spark hopes of a fightback, but it wasn’t to be.Zhao will meetJudd Trumpor Mark Williams in the final, which will be played on Sunday and Monday – and will benefit from a day off.There has been talk for a long time about a first Chinese world champion, but apart from Ding Junhui making the final in 2016, when he lost to Mark Selby, no one has come close. This could be the moment, with Zhao in brilliant form and seemingly unfazed by reaching the one-table set-up at the Crucible for the first time.O’Sullivan’s participation in the tournament had been in doubt after he had withdrawn from the Masters in January and every ranking event since on medical grounds. His only appearance on the tour this year was in the Championship League in January, when he snapped his cue after losing four of his five matches. He had come through to the semi-finals at the Crucible comfortably, though was unhappy with his form, and changed his tip and ferrule after the first session with the score level at 4-4.View image in fullscreenRonnie O’Sullivan during Friday’s morning session.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersAfter the match, he said: “I don’t even know if it was the cue, the ferrule or me. There were three things. I just don’t even know where the white ball’s going. I’m at a loss, to be honest with you. I don’t even know what to say.“Sometimes you’ve got to try something different, you know? It didn’t feel great before so I tried to go back to the old brass ferrule.“I’m not making the cue as an excuse or anything like that but if I hadn’t snapped my old cue maybe I’d have been able to give him a better game but really my performances have not been good enough.”Earlier, O’Sullivan’s mid-match change of tip backfired spectacularly as he was whitewashed in the second session. The seven-time champion had still emerged from the first session level at 4-4, but lost all eight frames on Friday morning as Zhao ruthlessly punished every missed pot and poor safety to move 12-4 ahead.Zhao made breaks of 57 (twice), 112 and 82 to establish an 8-4 lead, with O’Sullivan scoring just 50 points in those four frames and recording a highest break of 23. There was no respite for O’Sullivan after the mid-session interval as Zhao made breaks of 67 and 115 to extend his lead, with the Englishman then missing a yellow off the spot in the next frame to allow his opponent back to the table.The Chinese sensation needed two opportunities to take the frame and also took the last of the session with a break of 87 after O’Sullivan had inexplicably missed a simple blue to the middle pocket.The former UK Championship winner John Virgo, commentating for the BBC, praised Zhao’s performance. “Scintillating snooker,” he said. “What a player. What a future he’s got in the game. To do this to Ronnie O’Sullivan, it’s a phenomenal performance. Changing of the guard maybe, right here, right now.”View image in fullscreenMark Williams produced a fine display to hit back to level with Judd Trump at 8-8.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersWilliams fought back from a four-frame deficit against Trump to level their semi-final at 8-8. Trump resumed 5-3 ahead and set down an early marker to increase his lead and suggest that he could run away with the match.A break of 70 extended Trump’s lead to 6-3 and he pinched the next frame with a 65 clearance after Williams, on a break of 57, missed a black off the spot.Williams replied with breaks of 105 and 84 before edging a scrappier 13th to trail 7-6. Trump took the next without any big breaks but Williams, seeking a fourth world title, shaded a tense 15th frame, sewing it up on the pink. And a consummate 96 clearance from the Welshman ensured parity before the pair resume play on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipRonnie O'SullivanJudd TrumpSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

The manager felt the mood inside the club’s stadium shift sharply on Thursday night when they conceded for 3-1 towards the end of the Europa Leaguesemi-final first leg against Bodø/Glimt.Before that the atmosphere had been excellent, the players responding, but it seemingly does not take much for the fans to begin to fear the worst. The tie finished 3-1, which should be enough for Spurs to navigate Thursday’s return after Sunday’s Premier League trip to West Ham. Yet there has been nervous talk about Bodø’s impressive home record, the perils of their artificial surface and the cold that awaits in the Arctic Circle.Bodø/Glimt and friends return to Norway with Europa League dream alive | Nick AmesRead morePostecoglou noted that he had also felt a “real nervousness in the stadium” when Spursconceded at home against AZin the last 16 and Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-final. The concession against AZ was in the second leg for 2-1 on the night and 2-2 on aggregate. Against Frankfurt, it was the first leg and an early goal that gave the German club a 1-0 lead.“People are their experiences and Tottenham supporters have had some real near misses for a long time,” Postecoglou said. “So there’s always this safeguard of not getting too excited about what’s happening, but part of creating a winning culture is not to fall into that trap. Winners don’t think about things in that way; they don’t think about what could possibly go wrong.“I’ve said before that the narrative around the club is not positive at all. That’s existed for a very long time and you need to break through that. I’m trying to create a culture within the group at least that that can’t guide our destiny because that’s almost self-fulfilling. If you expect something to go wrong, it will.“I don’t know if it’s a culture in the club; it’s a culture around the club. Obviously if you accept that then you are almost self-prophesying what’s going to happen. I don’t accept that. But with all of these things, there’s really only one remedy: win. That’s what we’re trying to do.”Postecoglou was asked whether he could control what went on outside the squad. “No, I can’t control it,” he said. “It’s fair to say I’ve tried but it’s a losing battle because there’s a lot of stuff that feeds into that and people invariably react to it. If you’re feeling insecure about something and you’ve got 20 people telling you that you should be insecure, you’re going to be insecure. So I can’t change that.“You’ve got to stay very focused on what you can control and we can’t control how people feel, we can’t control the anxiety of … whether it’s our supporters or whatever narrative is around us. What we can control is our behaviours and our performance.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His task, though, was certainly made easier by a bitterly disappointing performance from Constitution Hill,the 2023 Champion Hurdle winnerand odds-on favourite here, who beat only one of his five opponents home.The race was billed as a rematch of the last meeting between Constitution Hill, State Man and Golden Ace in the Champion Hurdle, whichproved to be one of the most dramatic runningsof a championship event in living memory. Constitution Hill, unbeaten in 10 starts and odds-on there as well, fell midway through the race while State Man crashed out with the race at his mercy, leaving Jeremy Scott’s outsider, Golden Ace, to take the spoils.Horses helped shape the world as we know it. Now we run them to death | Elizabeth BanickiRead moreAll three horses – the past three winners of the Champion Hurdle – were in the field, and State Man, as usual, set out to make all the running at a track Paul Townend, his jockey, described as “his playground”.Constitution Hill, being ridden for the first time by James Bowen in place of the injured Nico de Boinville, travelled well enough in fourth place until four out, with Golden Ace and Kargese, a stable companion of the winner, just ahead. As State Man poured it on from three out, Constitution Hill was suddenly treading water and there was no hint of the brilliant turn of foot that, in conjunction with an exceptionally quick and accurate jumping style, had carried himto 10 straight wins, including two at the Cheltenham festival, in the early part of his career.By the second-last, he was struggling to stay in front of a 125-1 outsider, Break My Soul and he had only another rank outsider, Bottler’secret, behind him at the line as State Man, stayed on for a four-and-three-quarter length defeat of Golden Ace.Constitution Hill suffered falls at Cheltenham and Aintreethis year, but this was his first defeat in 11 completed starts. “It’s very disappointing, but it’s a tough game and a tough place to be,” Nicky Henderson, Constitution Hill’s trainer, said. “It’s sad it had to be that way. You could live with going down in a battle [but] he was beaten two out.“Something has gone wrong, obviously. That’s not him, we know that, so our job is to try to unravel the mystery. He’ll get scoped now, that’s the first thing we have to do, but it’s a mystery. He’s got such a great mind, this horse, it [the recent falls] is unlikely to worry him. He was travelling very well turning in but then it was all over very quickly.”Ruling Court can extend Gosden losing streakThirty-five years on from saddling his first runner in the 2,000 Guineas, John Gosden will make the short trip to the Rowley Mile on Saturday with Field Of Gold, the 2-1 favourite, still looking for his first win in the Newmarket colts’ Classic, and possibly wondering too if he will ever have a better chance to fill the most obvious remaining gap on his impressive cv.It is not that Gosden has suffered a shortage of top-class three-year-old milers over the years. Roaring Lion, Too Darn Hot, Palace Pier and Kingman – Field Of Gold’s sire – have won eight-furlong Group Ones for the stable as three-year-olds since 2014 but, for various reasons, were either beaten or missing from the line-up on the first Saturday in May.Field Of Gold has been the likely favourite for Saturday’s Classic since his emphatic success in the Craven Stakes over the Guineas course and distance last month and certain to start favourite since Twain, Aidan O’Brien’s prime contender, was effectively ruled out on Tuesday.While his winning margin of three-and-a-half lengths was undeniably impressive, the time of the race was nothing special and while he tops the field on Timeform’sratings, he is 1lb in front of Shadow Of Light, last season’s Dewhurst winner.Field Of Gold also faces several lightly raced rivals with arguably more scope for improvement, including Shadow Of Light’s stable companion,Ruling Court(3.35), whose trainer, Charlie Appleby, is going for a third 2,000 Guineas success in four years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The McLaren driver insists he has never been so confident in his own ability before this weekend’s Miami Grand Prix, where he qualified in third place for Saturday’s sprint race and Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli took his debut F1 sprint pole.The British driver opened the season stronglywith a win in Australiaand led the championship until the last round in Saudi Arabia when he was overtaken by his teammate Oscar Piastri, who has now won three of the opening five meetings.Welcome to Miami, where F1’s sunshine party draws a crowd every sport cravesRead moreNorris has admitted he is struggling to adapt to this year’sMcLaren, particularly in qualifying, which has cost him dearly in recent races, not least the last round in Saudi Arabia where he crashed out in Q3.The 25-year-old maintained that he has no psychological problems with his performance as the pressure on him intensified. “I got into racing because I like to drive the cars, or the go-karts, I like to work with my team,” he said in Miami. “The rest of it is noise to me because it’s not something that I ever wanted to do. It’s not something that I’m natural with. It’s not something that I enjoy doing. If I could have asked for a perfect world, it would just mean to turn up, drive and go home.”He was also bullish about his title hopes despite Piastri now leading by 10 points. “My only need is to finish at the top at the end of the season. I don’t need to lead it at any other point,” Norris said. “I’m more confident than I ever have been. I’m more trusting in my own ability and my own speed. I’ve never felt so confident with my whole ability, with my speed and my knowledge of what I can go out and do.View image in fullscreenLando Norris remains bullish about his title chances this season.Photograph: Cristóbal Herrera/EPA“I’m in the best place I’ve ever been in terms of knowing what I can achieve. But of course the results have not turned into what I want for various reasons. There’s been some tough moments but now I still feel like I’m in the best place that I ever have been in terms of knowing what I can go out and do every weekend.”In qualifying for Saturday’s sprint race in Miami, Max Verstappen – who arrived at the track on Friday when he confirmed he had become a father after his partner Kelly Piquet gave birth to a baby girl named Lily – set the early pace on his second run in Q3, taking the top spot only to be pipped by Antonelli, becoming the youngest driver to claim a pole position.Piastri went close to him four-hundredths back in second, with Norris a tenth back in third but the Italian had delivered an immense lap for a deserved pole. Verstappen ended fourth with Mercedes’ George Russell in fifth and Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton sixth and seventh for Ferrari.The Miami race promoters also announced on Friday they had agreed an extension to their deal with F1 to host the meeting until 2041, a long-term commitment by both parties to the sport’s future in the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In truth, the first three months of Donald Trump’s second presidency have been calamitous on almost every measure. The single biggest achievement of those 100 days has been to serve as a warning of the perils of nationalist populism, which is effective in winning votes but disastrous when translated into reality. That warning applies across the democratic world – and is especially timely in Britain.Start with the numbers that matter most to Trump himself. Aslew of pollsappeared this week, but they all told the same story: that Trump’s approval ratings have collapsed, falling to the lowest level for a newly installed president in the postwar era. He has now edged ahead of his only rival for that title: himself. The previous low watermark for a president three months in was set by one Donald Trump in 2017.Back then, 42% of Americans approved of the way Trump was doing his job. The latest Ipsos survey for theWashington Post/ABC Newshas Trump at just 39%. This, remember, is meant to be the honeymoon period, yet Trump is 10 points behind where Joe Biden stood at this point, 30 points behind Barack Obama and44 points behind Ronald Reagan. Remember: US presidents tend to get less, not more, popular as time goes on.Perhaps most significant is that Trump is weak even in those areas where he’s meant to be strong. Confidence in his ability to handle immigration has tumbled and the same is true, even more critically, of his management of the US economy. On the latter,just 37% back Trump, a depth he never plumbed during his first term, even as the economy seized up under Covid. For the first time since 2001, a majority of Americans believe theireconomic situation is getting worse.With good reason. Because the economic data is almost as troubling for Trump as his poll numbers. This week, official figures showed that the US economycontracted by 0.3%in the first quarter of the year, further fuelling fears of a recession. Trump wasted no time in blaming the shrinkage on Biden, who was in charge for just 20 days of the first three months of 2025, an argument only slightly weakened by the fact that the last quarter with Biden in charge saw growth of 2.4%.It’s a precipitous drop, and the cause of it is hardly mysterious. Economists agree that the culprit is Trump’s tariffs, which prompted a surge in imports, as companies scrambled to buy in goods from abroad before the president’s on-again-off-again levies kicked in. Because those imported goods and services are not produced in the US, they’re subtracted from the headline GDP figure. Hence the contraction. Meanwhile, the chaos and volatility unleashed by Trump’s tariff policy has dented consumer confidence, now down to its lowest level since the recession of 1990, leaving Americans hesitant to spend money amid so much uncertainty. Even though the latest job numbers look healthy, analysts say the underlying picture is alarming.As Bloomberg reports, “corporate investment plans and expectations for growth and jobs have all plummeted – and the key reason is Trump’s trade war.”Trump knows that thewarnings from retail giantsWalmart and Target, of empty shelves as supplies from heavily tariffed China dry up, have cut through. He addressed that anxiety this week, but in a way that should make even Trump’s admirers, those who usually praise his ability to connect with ordinary folk, worry that he’s losing his touch.Asked aboutpotential shortages of toys at Christmas,Trump said, “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more.” Bit late in his career for Trump to don the saffron robes and preach a Zen flight from consumerist materialism. His two-toys remark – which strangely did not feature as one of his campaign pledges in 2024 – has already cast him asthe Grinchset to ruin Christmas.0:56Trump makes false claim more Americans think US going 'in the right direction' than not – video“BE PATIENT!!!” he urges on his social media platform, as he insists that the vertiginous downward slide of the stock market either doesn’t matter or is all Biden’s fault. But the whiff of desperation is strong as Trump begins to see why the one idea he actually believes in and has believed in for decades – tariffs – is an object of near-universal contempt among economists. Yes, tariffs may have succeeded in persuading Apple to shift manufacturing away from China. But those jobs are not about to move to the US. Apple has announced instead that it will assemble its US-bound iPhones in India. Better restitch those red baseball caps with a revised slogan: make India great again.By now, you’ll recall, Trump was meant to have ended the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, indeed he promised to do that by 21 January. But after a brief ceasefire, Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has resumed, the Trump administration having apparently lost interest. As for Ukraine, Trump got to brag of a breakthrough this week, with an agreement that gives the US a stake in Ukraine’s mineral wealth. But it’s far from the deal he sought.The case he always made was that the US had to be reimbursed for the billions it had given Ukraine in military support under Biden – plucking theentirely bogus figure of $350bnout of the air. But this week’s arrangement includesno such payback. On the contrary, the deal is one Kyiv can look on with quiet satisfaction. It seems the Ukrainians could smell Trump’s need to have something to shout about in time for his 100th day, and they leveraged that eagerness to their advantage.As for his expansionist threats to gobble up Panama, Greenland and Canada, the only concrete result those have brought is defeat in Canada’s general election for the pro-Trump Conservatives and a back-from-the-dead success for the Liberal party that vowed to defy him. Such is Trump’s narcissism that he even boasted about that, citing it as evidence of how much he matters in the world. As he put it, just before Canadians voted: “You know, until I came along, the Conservative was leading by 25 points,” he mused. “I was disliked by enough of the Canadians that I’ve thrown the election into a close call.”We’ve never seen a more error-prone, incompetent presidency | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreThe promise was that this second Trump term would be different, that the chaos and churn of Trump 1.0 would be gone. But on Thursday, we were back to the good old days, with the firing of his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, partly for his accidental admission of a journalist into a Signal group chat that discussed attack plans for Yemen, partly for advocating atougher stance on Vladimir Putin, and partly for earning the hostility offar-right conspiracist Laura Loomer, who has the ear of the president.So it’s fair to say the 100 days have not gone as Trump would have wished. And thanks to those serial failures, you can see the first, small signs that his power to terrify is fading. Witness thehandful of senate Republicanswho voted with Democrats against his tariff policy. And note how the reliably rightwing editorial page of the Wall Street Journal is now a fierce critic, slamming Trump as a “bully” anddenouncing tariffsas “the biggest economic policy mistake in decades”. For a few short hours, even Jeff Bezos seemed ready to take a stand,amid reportsthat Amazon was about to itemise the cost of tariffs to US customers, before the company backed down.Of course, none of this should be a surprise. Trump’s conman promises and delusional dreams of turning the clock back were always bound to fail. This is the nature of nationalist populism, whether it wears a red cap in Michigan or aturquoise rosette in Runcorn. It is expert at turning grievance, division and nostalgia into votes. But when it comes to governing, it will always fail. It offers an outlet for complaint – and has no answers at all.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump tariffsRepublicansUS economyUS politicsTariffscommentShareReuse this content"

But success comes with more pressure, more scrutiny and the risk of bruising exposureFri 2 May 2025 12.39 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 12.43 EDTShareWhat else would you expect from a byelection? Governments lose and this government is unpopular. To lose by a hair’s breadth – only six votes – is scant comfort in the forever Labour seat of Runcorn and Helsby, while Reform UK’s win of the mayoralty in Tory heartland Greater Lincolnshire is a symbolic blow to Kemi Badenoch. Both parties of the old duopoly have fallen under the wheels of political distrust and discontent.Change! That’s whatLabourpromised during the general election, and in Runcorn I heard that tossed back at Labour canvassers: well, where is it, then? Keir Starmer today pledged to go “further and faster”. Those changes that have been ushered in have been deeply unpopular. Labour’s mayor of Doncaster clung on, against predictions, by damning the winter fuel allowance, disability cuts and employers’ national insurance rise.Labour promises to “listen” after the day’s bad results – but to who, saying what? Nigel Farage is a threat: look at the damage of his 20-year Brexit campaign, and now he has bigger battalions. If any ill-adviser suggests to Labour that “listening” means turning Farage-wards, just examine the untempting pickings on Reform’s policy plate.Its manifestoshows how weirdly unpopulist these populists are: unexplored in a rebellious midterm spasm, most of its proposals will be a gift to Labour. The idea of tax relief for private health insurance was a disaster when the Conservatives tried it in their 2001 manifesto: dallying with core NHS principles touches a killer live rail in British politics. Likewise, offering 20% tax relief on private school fees is a blunder:Labour’s VAT on private school fees has been highly popular. Despite years of BBC appearances wildly unwarranted by his polling, Farage has proposed abolishing the licence fee, something which is unlikely to be a winner. Expect his new councillors to be grilled locally abouthis dismissal of Sendand children’s mental health as “massively” overdiagnosed.His big tax cuts for business may not resonate in hard times – though hisstealth levy on banks would. His renationalising of our lost utilities is a fruitful theme, but Labour may have done more of that and should boast more bravely about taking back steel (and its similar plans for rail) and creating Great British Energy.He (and the Tories) imagine that opposing net zero is their new Brexit, the great new anti-Labour wedge. On the Today programme last week, Farage was initially evasive when asked whether humans cause rising temperatures. Bring it on, Labour replies. The public is resolutely on the other side:YouGov finds that61% support the net zero target, with only 24% against. That made Tony Blair’sbizarre eve-of-poll interventioneven more quixotic when he called phasing out fossil fuels a strategy “doomed to fail”. The kickback from Labour was refreshingly instant: that sharp rebuke should signal an end to traffic with the Tony Blair Institute.Starmer had only just delivered one hismost forceful speeches, doubling down on climate policy. “This government is acting now, with a muscular industrial policy, to seize the opportunities [in low-carbon technology] to boost investment, build new industries, drive UK competitiveness, and unlock export opportunities. That is the change we need. We won’t wait – we will accelerate.” That’s the way to challenge Reform and Conservatives, further and faster.Now use that full-frontal attack on their immigration policies too: yes, smash the gangs and prevent small boats and strangers arriving without permits, as Yvette Cooper strives to, like all governments. But be honest about the need for particular migrants. Treat people as adults. When asked who should be admitted, public opinion is positive about every occupation, not just doctors and engineers: theyare in favourof migrants filling necessary jobs in areas such as hospitality, farming and care work. They back visas for construction workers by 38% to 16% against. On foreign students, the public are 61% in favour, only 27% opposed,according to British Future. Running away from voters instead of discussing immigration is a political mistake, when openness, clarity and explanation calm unreasonable panics. Do the same on a Brexit reset.This was Farage’s night and the Tories’ calamity. These elections were mainly in Toryland, so they took the most ravaging. The political drama is his tug-of-war with the Tories: will they, won’t they build an alliance, under whose leadership? Tactical voting, as in the last election, will drive together Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat supporters to vote against them, our monstrous system unfit for five-party politics.But this may be peak Farage. He will be weighed down increasingly by his Trump contamination, with the US president phenomenally disliked in Britain. Wait for more Trumptastrophes to inflict increasing damage on him. At a general election, how appealing is a British Trump and yet more mayhem? Brexit will age worse with every passing year.Farage, master communicator of ersatz chumminess, is a surprisingly poor tactician. His is a one-tune party, and even as salient an issue as migration doesn’t alone win general elections. Beyond his talent for dressing up a visceral nastiness with a smile, he blunders in ways that will come under more scrutiny now. His councillors will face bruising exposure.Noteworthy byelection and local election results pepper the past. When Shirley Williams won Crosby in 1981, the national polls soared over 50% for her nascent SDP. I remember internal discussions about who would be in the SDP cabinet. After so many flashes fizzling out, these results may be no augury of Farage ascendant.But if he is, then Labour and Tories should consider this: John Curtice today says Reform has reached the tipping point where first-past the-post can aid it. As Labour last year won a shocking 63% of seats on 34% of votes, so could Farage win a majority on puny votes. Electoral reform is now in every party’s interest, and above all, in voters’.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Just over 10 years ago, the comedian Russell Brand was lionised in some quarters for appearing on a Question Time panel with Nigel Farage, and producing what was widely, if bafflingly, interpreted as a brilliant zinger about the then Ukip leader. “He is a pound-shop Enoch Powell,” honked Brand, “and we gotta watch him.” Well now. Perhaps it takes someone who needs to be watched to know someone who needs to be watched. Mr Brand returned to the UK this week from the Florida base of his conspiracist Christian media outlet,appearing in courttoday on rape and sexual assault charges. He denies them.Anyway: the local elections, where the big thing that people said could never happen seems to be happening. Farage now leadsReform UK, which even last year used to be bundled in the “other” category by political pollsters – now its standalone poll results frequently top the charts, with the eponymous two parties of The Two-Party System doing not a whole lot better than simply wailing that it isn’t supposed to be this way. In terms of last night’s byelection, Reform has taken Runcorn and Helsby, one of Labour’s safest seats in the general election you might dimly recall it won by a massive landslide 10 months ago.Reform might have nicked it in record-breaking fashion by only six votes, but the word you rightly keep hearing is “seismic”. Speaking of the mineral kingdom, the missing link between that and the vegetable kingdom – former Conservative Andrea Jenkyns – was victorious in the Greater Lincolnshire mayoral election, and is now the most questionably gifted entity ever to hold the position of mayor, including Mayor Humdinger in Paw Patrol and that goat that was once elected somewhere in Texas. She holds a majority of 40,000.The Runcorn byelection may have been forced by the former Labour MP literallypunching one of his constituents, but people’s metaphorical sense of having been mugged by politics-as-usual was surely a big part of Reform’s surge. Keir Starmer didn’t even bother to go to Runcorn during the entire campaign. Hearing repeatedly this morning from the Labour party chair, Ellie Reeves, that “traditionally prime ministers don’t campaign in byelections” felt like just another way of falling back on weird conventions that no one normal has ever heard of, and expecting the old results. The old results are gone. Hearing people talk politician-speak has tipped over from being annoying, passed through being exhausting, and has now become actively enraging.Yet as the Runcorn result was confirmed early this morning,Labourissued a statement that in many ways epitomises the sense that the old guard won’t – or perhaps can’t – see that they are going to have to find completely different ways of talking to people, let alone how to do it. “Voters are still rightly furious with the state of the country after 14 years of failure and clearly expect the government to move faster with the Plan for Change,” it droned robotically. “While Labour has suffered an extremely narrow defeat, the shock is that the Conservative vote has collapsed. Moderate voters are clearly appalled by the talk of a Tory-Reform pact.” Leaving aside the amusingly questionable analysis, who talks like this? People in politics, I suppose. It’s starting to feel incredibly bizarre, in an age which supposedly prizes authenticity over all things, that most political parties are still communicating in a weird, desiccated way that has all the welcoming charm and accessibility of a panic room.Ditto the idea that a series of small precision pivots is the answer to what is happening with Reform. In the wake of the results, and with huge numbers still coming in, Labour figures were already briefing that the government might make little concessions this way or that. But which way? Going right loses you votes to the Lib Dems and Greens. Going left leaches more to Reform – with the same bind holding for theConservatives. And in any case, the people in question quite clearly aren’t voting for tinkering. They are voting for destruction – creative or otherwise – of the old ways, which haven’t worked for them. How on earth do you respond?Not like Kemi Badenoch, is one of various answers on offer. The Tory leader was in seclusion at time of writing, but her party’s co-chair did emerge to explain: “Kemi has said this is a marathon, not a sprint.” I’m sure whoever used to finish fourth to Usain Bolt liked to claim the same. At this rate, the stadium will have been knocked down and redeveloped before Badenoch has a full policy platform, let alone reaches the finish line.As for Reform, a huge amount of tearful wank was expended over the past few years about people “normalising” Farage, by extension suggesting that any voter who had time for his messages couldn’t really be normal. This is what I think of as the “People’s Vote Fallacy”, so-called after the equally wanky second referendum movement that was named in such a way as to suggest that its leadership were unaware either that there had already been a people’s vote, or didn’t really consider those who had won it to be people at all.Even now you have the general secretary of the TUC, Paul Nowak, this week informing people via the pages of this newspaper that Farage is “a political fraud and hypocrite” and a “public school-educated ex-metals trader cosplaying as a champion of the working class”. Paul must know plenty of trade unionists voted for Farage. Is he saying they’re too dumb to see through him, or just conceding that more of the working class might end up drawn to Farage’s movement than his? Across the conventional political spectrum you can find bigwigs lining up to say Farage is appalling and a chancer, apparently without realising what that then makes them. Namely, someone people find less appealing thanthatguy.Whichever way you slice it, we’re living in a time of flux, and though it is unclear what new order is coming down the line, it is increasingly possible to see that the old one has been fractured. There’s a good line in a Martin Amis novel about a man who begins to crave a cigarette even while he is smoking a cigarette, and on initial inspection it might seem like there is something of that to England, where, less than a year after a change election, people are fervently voting for change. But that would presuppose Labour had contrived to effect any sort of change at all – if it ever even had a plan for it. It doesn’t. Instead, politics is beginning to feel ineluctably tidal – like change is happening to this government, not because of it.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Judges in the high court hadmade it very clearthat laws that gave the police almost unlimited powers to crack down on any protest that caused “more than minor” disruption were unlawful. It orderedthat the laws should be scrapped. We celebrated. Given that the incoming Labour government had voted down these very same laws a year earlier, we believed that protest would be taken out of the culture wars arena and putback into the sacred space of fundamental rights.Yet Labourdragged us backto court, in a misguided attempt to be seen to look tough on public order. And now today, on a day of much Labour soul-searching,we’ve won again. A unanimous court of appeal victory that, alongsidechastening election results, must now trigger a total Labour rethink on how we treat protesters in this country.Five different judges over two separate hearings have made it clear: these anti-protest laws were a flagrant abuse of power and quite simply should never have existed. Ministers cannot step outside the law to do whatever they want to shut down causes they don’t agree with.These laws we defeated today were introduced in a toxic climate. The previous government made it its mission to stifle protest movements it didn’t like. Even when this regulation itself was created, the Conservative governmentspecifically namedclimate protesters as those they were targeting, even though the change in law impacted everybody. This is a dangerous way to do politics, and has led to hundreds of protesters being wrongly arrested under a law that should never have been created in the first place. Whether or not you agree with a protest cause – environmental justice, Palestine solidarity, farmers’ inheritance tax, the closure of your local library – laws that chip away at protest do damage to them all.The “more than minor” regulations are just one of many laws the last Conservative government created that narrowed the space for protest in this country. In the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, laws were created that were so broad that a protest could be shut down for simplybeing too “noisy”. In 2023, the Conservative government’sPublic Order Actwent even further, and brought in powers that have led to arrests for carrying any material that might be used tolock on, a common tactic used throughout history (such as by the Suffragettes), even if an act of protest has not happened yet. Things have shifted so much that we’re now in the farcical situation in which protesters in many cases are now unable to tell a judge aboutwhy they protestedin the first place.These laws are far reaching and have real consequences. A record number of protesters spent last Christmasin prisonbecause of anti-protest laws. Journalists have been wrongly caught up covering protests and wrongfully held in custody because policeassumed they were protesters. This is unsustainable, and is damaging the basic principles of our free speech and democracy in this country.And the assault continues. Going through parliament right now is a proposal to ban the use of face coverings at protests – a plan Labour has copied almost word for word from a bill theConservatives introducedlast year. What message does this send to those who rely on face masks to protest safely, such as Hong Kong dissidents who want to protest outside the Chinese embassy, or disabled activists protesting cuts in their benefits?Today’s ruling shows that the previous government’s approach was wrong – and now the Labour government must learn from its predecessors’ mistakes and change tack.This should serve as a wake-up call for Labour. It must accept this ruling and scrap the laws for good. We now urgently need a review of all thehundreds of arrests that happened under this law. And we need a complete review of all protest legislation that was made over the past few years.Quite simply, we need a new approach. Protesting brought us votes for women, the right to a weekend and Pride. Surely, that alone is reason enough to stop playing politics with the right to protest, and get back to being a country that isserious about protecting democratic freedoms.Akiko Hart is the director of the human rights organisation LibertyExplore more on these topicsProtestOpinionCourt of appealcommentShareReuse this content"

Instead, it is time to think, hard.Voting Reform is essentially lashing out, a howl of protest at the state of everything. It deserves an answer, but copying Greater Lincolnshire’s Andrea Jenkyns – who would putmigrants in tentsbecause hotels are too good for them – ain’t it. Mainstream politicians miserably echoing things they don’t believe merely tells Reform voters that Reform was right all along, while guaranteeing Tory extinction in the southern shires and repelling Greens or Lib Dems whose tactical votes Labour needs.Politics in a time of fragmentation is basically the race to build a winning bloc, some stable-ish combination of warring leftwing or rightwing parties, before the other guy. For Labour, that involves doing some things progressives hate (credible action on immigration, endless flag waving) but sticking to its guns on net zero, rebuilding public services, tackling poverty and hopelessness.If this is 2013 all over again – the last time Nigel Faragetriumphed in local elections– in 2015, David Cameron was reelected. Farage is beatable, but not by chucking the baby out with the bathwater.Now it’s clear: Reform is the new party of the rightJohn McTernanFormer political secretary to Tony Blair and current political strategist for BCWTwo-party politics is back. The election results declared so far this morning show that the future of British politics is a fight between two main parties – Labour and Reform. The opinion polls were right: Nigel Farage is the leader of the right in Britain. The humiliating slump in support for the Conservative party puts Kemi Badenoch’s leadership on life support and means that Reform will dictate the terms of any deal between the two parties of the right. In politics you can never argue with momentum – and Farage certainly has it.With support slumping, Labour retained mayoralties inDoncaster, North Tyneside, and the West of England, pushing Reform into second place – demonstrating that Labour’s Rolls-Royce election machine is still the best in class and that Green-leaning progressive voters can be turned out for Labour when it matters.What should be taken from the results? That the electoral contest is now all about change – that was Labour’s slogan last year and is also the message implicit in the name of Farage’s party. But change to what? Reform is clear – being pro-worker and pro-nationalisation, a sort of Labour-lite. That’s a fight Labour can win if it remembers who the party is for.Labour has no connection with voters on an emotional levelCarys AfokoCommunications strategist and co-host of the Over the Top, Under the Radar podcastThere are still many votes to be counted. And, even once they are in, the number of seats being contested this week is too small to tell us anything definitive about the UK’s political future. So far, turnout has been low, and Reform’s surge has mostly harmed the Conservatives. But the results, especially in Runcorn and Lincolnshire, are still a headache for Labour.They should be a sign that their current strategy isn’t working. There will undoubtedly be some in the party who look toMark Carney’s recent victoryin Canada and say the solution is a change of leader. Switch out Keir Starmer for Wes Streeting and all our troubles will be over.They are missing the bigger issue. What Nigel Farage and Reform have is momentum and, more importantly, a coherent story about what is wrong with Britain and what must happen to fix it. Until Labour has a competing story that connects with the public on an emotional level it will continue to flounder. Farage launched his local election campaign riding into a rally on a JCB and talking about potholes. He ended his speech with a five-year plan to get Reform into government. Labour needs to be similarly bold in setting out a vision and aseffective in communicatingit.Voters have lost faith in the old, tired partiesCaroline LucasEnvironmental activist and former Green MPWe are celebrating our gains in counties such as Gloucestershire, Devon and Worcestershire, where we have taken seats from both Labour and the Conservatives. And in areas now dominated by Reform, such as Staffordshire and Durham, it falls to us to show robust and principled opposition.We’re now in an unprecedented era of five-party politics in the UK, yet we’re stuck with first past the post – an electoral system built for a bygone era of two-party dominance. The result is a fundamentally broken relationship between how people vote and who holds power – and, as the outcomes of the byelection in Runcorn and theGreater Lincolnshire mayoraltyhave just shown, the main beneficiaries are the populist Reform, capitalising on public anger and weaponising it against minorities and against our institutions. Whatever the final results today, one thing is certain: if we’re serious about restoring trust in politics, we have to start by replacing our archaic voting system with a fairer alternative.There are particular lessons for Labour. Trying to out-Reform Reform doesn’t work. Instead of lurching to the right, the government urgently needs to rethink its approach. It could start by addressing the genuine concerns of working people by taxing wealth so we can rebuild our creaking public services, and reversing its cruel decisions toremove support from sick and disabled people.As Greens, we understand why people have lost faith in the old, tired parties. As they collapse in popularity, we know we will take votes from both, as we did in the general election, where even under the two-party system we’ve managed to work strategically to break through – often being the only credible alternative to the rise of Reform. And unlike Reform, we have a track record of delivery, having formed part of the ruling administration of over 40 councils, including Bristol city council, wherewe took controllast year. We’ve increased our number of councillors seven years in a row, and we are sure this will be an eighth. We know voters want change, and Greens have that bold and positive vision that stands in contrast to Reform whose politics breed fear and division.Labour should take note of how the Lib Dems have played these electionsMeral Hussein-EceLiberal Democrat peerIt is often said that all politics is local. We have rarely seen such volatility in local council elections, as voters are increasingly motivated by national concerns such as the cost of living.The Liberal Democrats have made significant council seat gains, especially in the south-west of England, building on the 72 MPs elected last July. At the time of writing, it looks as though the Lib Dems have overtaken Labour in terms ofcouncillors electedso far, making the second largest number of net gains.With Reform’s dramatic win of Runcorn and Helsby, it would appear that voting for the party is the new spoiled ballot paper, a protest vote from both former Tory and Labour voters. Reform’s success matters in terms of policy direction, if it means Labour will mimic its policies to win back voters. The Tories are already adopting Reform policies while telling people not to vote for them. The government should take note of how that is working out.Whatever their excuses, this was a dismal result for the ToriesHenry HillDeputy editor of ConservativeHomeThere are bad nights and there are very bad nights, and for the Conservatives last night was the latter.Reform has performed right at the top end of pollsters’ expectations, winning overall control of Staffordshire and Lincolnshire councils from the Tories, as well as chalking up significant wins against Labour, most obviously in the Runcorn and Helsby byelection.Most Conservatives had “priced in” a poor performance. While the party has in the past done well in local elections after leaving office (under William Hague it picked up hundreds of councillors in 1998), the circumstances this time were quite different.Rather than slowly falling apart during a whole parliament, as did the Major government, the last Conservative government fell from grace with extraordinary speed. That meant these elections were last fought at the apex of Boris Johnson’s popularity – and that was never going to be a flattering yardstick.Kemi Badenoch and her team have also been, from the start, making the case that these elections were simplytoo soon to countas a real test of the new leader.But it’s one thing to make these rationalisations to yourself in the abstract, and another not to panic when the real results come in. And Tory MPs have made a habit of panic.Reform should make the most of its success – it won’t lastPeter KellnerFormer president of YouGovNigel Farage should enjoy Reform’s triumphs while he can. This may be as good as it gets. In May 2015, his former party, Ukip, gained control ofThanet district council. Before last night, it was the only time any of his parties won the power to run anything. What pointers does it offer to the months ahead?Ukip’s 10-seat majority in Thanet should have given it four years of power to show what its new brand of politics could achieve. Alas, it turned out, that was very little. Six months later, five of its councillors defected, following internal rows about a local airport. A byelection subsequently restored its majority, but only until another councillor defected, saying Ukip had failed to make “significant change”. The following year, 12 Ukip councillors peeled off to form an independent group. Ukip’s days in charge of Thanet were over. In 2019, it fielded just three candidates. They all lost.Thanet was not the only place where Ukip struggled. In 2017, seven of its 12 councillors in Great Yarmouth defected to the Conservatives – although to be fair, some defections elsewhere went the other way, including two Tory MPs, Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless.Maybe it will all be different this time. After today, Reform will havemany more chancesto show what it does with power. An era of milk, honey and joyful unity – or arsenic, ashes and destructive divisions? We shall see.Explore more on these topicsLocal elections 2025The panelLocal electionsReform UKLabourConservativesGreen partyLiberal DemocratscommentShareReuse this content"

I shall not go into details here in a family newspaper. Suffice it to say, the one you’d expectisin first position, and “arse” is – ahem – bringing up the rear.But all such crude terms! And so unnecessary. I am reminded of a post I once saw on social media by a reverent American who’d been here for some time and had become deeply enamoured of and awed by the ability of Brits to express feelings of rage, frustration, disappointment and other emotions at the negative end of life’s spectrum with the use of “you absolute” plus a “[heavily emphasised]ordinary noun”. For example, “you absolutenana” was the first he heard. “You absolutewombat” another. But his favourite, never bettered over the years, was “you absolutesuitcase”.I am so, obscurely, proud of us.TuesdayGood news. A newmale contraceptivehas been shown in trials to be effective for two years so far. Experimental subjects, we salute you!The contraceptive comprises a hydrogel that is delivered (“via a quick injection”, according to its manufacturer’s website) to the vas deferens to block all the little swimmers intent on finding a receptive female and her gametes. The sperm back up behind the temporary blockage, wither and die. The hydrogel disperses and is absorbed over the years and fertility is restored.I have done some very complicated sums and statistical analysis on the back of an envelope and worked out that the only problem with this is there are roughly three men in existence at any given time who can be trusted, when they say: “Don’t worry, babe, I’ve had m’vas deferens blocked. You can relax!” Maybe each injection can come with a time and date-stamped video recording that can be presented to a potential mate, perhaps in lieu of flowers or ironing a shirt. What a brave new world may be upon us.View image in fullscreen‘Guys! guys?

Obviously this is harrowing, and yet I must be told. I must know.Alongside this masochistic compulsion, which I already knew I had because I have been alive and a fool for many years now, is a new, equally unwanted piece of self-knowledge. Which is that whatever the number is, I feel terrible. I feel I have failed. I have not sold … I don’t know – more of the books? Or all the books? I have to sit on my hands until the urge to email everyone involved in its making and apologise for not doing better has passed. I am told everyone is delighted with the sales figures. I scurry to my corner, hissing and spitting at these blatant lies and liars, and try to control the suffocating blaze of self-hatred that is spreading from my stomach throughout my system.There is no answer to this. There is no figure that would soothe me. This is literally a “me” problem and I have yet to find a solution to my personality.ThursdayView image in fullscreenThe Ikea store at Oxford Circus opens its doors.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/GettyOf course, as a classy laydee I am not going to tell you my age. But I am going to tell you how old I am. I am old enough to be thrilled that the new Ikea storeopenstoday on Oxford Street and to be in no measure contemplating joining the queue seeking to get in there as soon as the doors are flung wide open at 10am.Ikea is a wonderful place. It is restorative. It is balm to the soul. You laugh derisively because you know it only as a hellscape made of marital rowing and tealights. No. Ikea is a sanctuary – as long as you go there alone. Then you can gaze in peace at the perfect solutions to every storage need on offer. Then you can marvel at the clean lines, all the forms following function, the unfussy, egoless spirit that dwells in and among every well-designed, fairly priced item and imagine a world where everything is like this, until it is time to get meatballs and apple pie for your solitary lunch, wreathed in undisturbed dreams.Friday“It says here,” I say, shaking out the paper to read to my 82-year-old mother while she re-grouts Catford, “that being shouted at by parents can change children’s brains”.“Well, of course it can,” she says. “That’s the point.”“I think they mean – in a bad way.”“How can there be a bad way?

Here’s the truthNoel RansomeThe country has exported a myth of progressivism. It’s time to confront who we really areFri 2 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 11.08 EDTShareCanada has been canonized – safely, predictably.It’s the great, grave story we’ve exported – retold in economic rankings, stitched into tourism ads, held up in classrooms and cable news panels. We’re the cooler, mellower cousin nextdoor. The country that has it figured out. Where healthcare is universal, democracy is calm and diversity is politely managed.This image has been shared like a TikTok meme for decades – forwarded, favourited, lightly interrogated. Over time, we’ve become more vibe than nation; contradictions, history and horrors flattened into brand energy. Place that flag in your Twitter bio, mention how “we’ll never become like America,” and you’ve bought into the sauce. You’re not the problem, you’re proof the problem lives somewhere else.This kind of deception has always been fundamental to our story. But we need only a glimpse at our neighbour’s constitutional preamble – “We the people of the United States” – to get a hint of the delusion. Canada’s constitutional language, by contrast, never used the populist “we”. From the start, there was no sweeping assertion of collective identity. Instead, theConstitution Act, 1867, opened with:Whereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have expressed their desire to be federally united into One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland …Granted, Canada’s constitutional framework evolved. But from the beginning, the difference in language spoke to the shaping of our identity – through agreements, compromises, legal frameworks, not a people-centered vision. This historical nuance, while subtle, now echoes in modern politics.Canada narrowly missed a far-right prime minister. But we’re not in the clear yet | Tayo BeroRead moreAll that to say: times are spooky for the average Canadian forced to define and defend Canada’s sovereignty. Spooky in ways that can cause one to reflexively feed into a myth, rather than confront the truth of who we are. The gap between our negotiated past and our branded present has never been more plain. Our current leaders are no exception.To any Canadian progressive, it’s stating the obvious to say that Justin Trudeau, the figure most associated with Canada’s progressive identity, was more committed to feeding the myth than confronting it. With his well-timed, photogenic smile –post-blackface, naturally – Trudeau was the perfect mascot. Our self-image personified: tolerant, polished, unthreatening. But branding aside, his government sidestepped moral clarity at home –from pipeline expansionsandbroken promises to Indigenous communities, to a foreign policy on Gaza that rarely strayed from Washington’s script. In moments that demanded progressive definition, he was formless.It would have been naive to think many Canadians would takeDonald Trumpseriously when he half-jokingly suggested in November 2024 that Canada become the 51st state. After all, those words came from someone familiar to us – a man and a Maga movement forged in the belief that something sacred was always being stolen. The enemy, the fuel for his fervor, shifted with the news cycle: migrants, trans youth, teachers, climate scientists, Muslims, Black Americans, DEI initiatives, and the very idea of truth.But the speaker of those words wore the same jacket as Pierre Poilievre, who, just before Trump’s threat, was the undeniable favourite among Canadians to become the next prime minister.What Canadians and others need to confront is that the Trump machine wasn’t purely fueled by cultural resentmentHis rhetoric tapped into the same fears and scapegoating, presenting itself as the antidote to a broken system. Poilievre ticked off his own list of Trump-style grievances: DEI initiatives? “Garbage.” Trans women in women’s spaces? “No place at all.” Immigration policies? “Destroying” a system that requires caps over compassion to curb economic and social pressure. It’s as if he were part of the same tired flock – one that targets the marginalized while promising to fix what he claims is broken. The popular sentiments of a supposedly morally superior land.And this isn’t new. In 2008, as the country prepared to confront thebrutal legacy of residential schools, Poilievre dismissed the moment sanctimoniously, arguing that Indigenous people needed to learn “the values of hard work” more than they needed compensation for past abuses. That’s who was in line to lead the country, as anointed by our polls.In the end, his opponent Mark Carney was victorious. But it should be clear that a shift toward the Liberal leader isn’t clarity about who we are, as much as it is a hedge against a man who seeks to claim us from afar.Carney is no antidote – just a bandage.Cutting ministries for gender equality and disability rightsisn’t healing; it’s harm. His economic nationalism is safer than the far-right’s bluster, but it’s closer to US centrism than a remedy.Trump’s chaotic threats won Mark Carney the Canadian election – but only just | Colin HorganRead moreAs one union representing more than 80,000 educators put it, the move signals “an unwise change of direction” for a country where vulnerable groups are already living in fear. And while Carney served as an executive at Brookfield Asset Management, the companyfaced accusations of violating Indigenous rights.What Canadians and others need to confront is that the Trump machine wasn’t purely fueled by cultural resentment. It was powered, in no small part, by the United States’ historic desire to promote and believe the best of itself – even when the evidence said otherwise.For me, as a Black Canadian, home has rarely been the gentle myth so many sing about. Always polite and tolerant it wasn’t. I’ve seen just as much of the opposite: unmarked graves, flickers of grief, and then silence. I’ve seen headlines and acknowledgments of systematic racism turn to indifference: police brutality, missing Indigenous women, gone like breath during our winters. And yes, I’ve seen the Proud Boys, too. Their founder, Gavin McInnes? Canadian.Canada holds beauty, but it harbours moral rot just as much as the neighbour it claims to rise above. Myth-making can’t save us. If we want to hold onto our sovereignty in this moment, maybe it’s time we stop lying like them – to others, and most of all, to ourselves.Noel Ransome is a Toronto-based freelance writerExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionAmericasTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsJustin TrudeaucommentShareReuse this content"

Last July, Labour won Runcorn and Helsby with a majority of 14,696 and more than 50% of the vote. This week it waslost to Reform UK. Dramatic byelection swings are not new, and often overinterpreted. If Labour had won seven more votes, the outcome in Runcorn would have been different and the story, breathlessly narrated in Westminster, would have a different inflection. But on the same day, Reform took scores of council seats and comfortably won the newly created mayoralty of Greater Lincolnshire. The surge is real.Parties led by Mr Farage have done well before. Ukip and then the Brexit party made headlines with strong performances in local andEuropean electionsthroughout the 2010s. But those parties were associated with a single demand – leaving the EU. Mr Farage was not bidding for nationwide power.Now he is.For the first time, Reform fielded candidates in every seat being contested. The party has taken control of local authorities as well as the newly created mayoralty ofGreater Lincolnshire. That doesn’t mean Mr Farage is ready to swap protest politics for responsible administration. He is more likely to use a local government base as a platform to stir yet more grievance. The raised profile could be a liability for a party with flimsy policies and a record of listing cranks and extremists as its candidates.But Mr Farage’s personal brand has survived that tarnishing before. It would be complacent to imagine that his support has now peaked. His claim to have supplanted theConservativesas the main party of opposition in England, while characteristically boastful, is not completely outlandish.This was the first ballot box test of Kemi Badenoch’s Tory leadership, and it demonstrates how badlyshe is failingto rehabilitate her party. It shed scores of council seats. It was knocked into third place in Runcorn. It came fourth, behind Labour, Reform and the Greens in the race for the west of England mayoralty.There is scant comfort for SirKeir Starmerin Ms Badenoch’s woes. The Tories have not yet earned the right to an audience with voters who were sick of them after 15 years in office. But after less than one year, Labour is remarkably unpopular too, subject to scorn as the incumbent power in Westminster. Having won a huge majority with promises of change, Sir Keir is delivering something that feels too much like continuity with the regime it replaced.That disillusionment is expressed as much in support forLiberal DemocratsandGreensas it is in Reform’s victories. Allegiances that Labour once took for granted are fragmenting along multiple axes. A trap now lies wide open for Labour. Trying to woo Mr Farage’s supporters with more aggressive rhetoric on immigration, for example, or a retreat from net zero targets, could fail to sway the target audience, while further demoralising more liberal‑minded voters.One of Mr Farage’s most potent lines of attack is thatLabour, having campaigned on pledges to be different, are revealed as just more of the same. That lament is echoed by voters who abhor Reform, despaired of the way Conservative prime ministers danced to Mr Farage’s tunes and hoped a Labour prime minister might change the record. If Sir Keir cannot soon demonstrate that his government has an agenda to transform Britain for the better then truly no seat will be safe for his MPs.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Mr Blair shook the author’s hand and told him that he was a big fan of his work and had some of his paintings in Downing Street.Yoko Ono, Jarvis Cocker and Neil Tennant were also there, along with Queen Elizabeth II. As the gallery celebrates its25th anniversary, it is hard to imagine such an extravaganza happening today.Back then,Londonwas the only major European city not to boast a world-class gallery of modern art.This repurposed power station was set to become the UK’s cultural powerhouse. Hulking on a once unloved stretch of the South Bank, its 99-metre tower signalled a message of regeneration and possibility to the rest of the world. And the world responded. They had prepared for 2 million visitors in its first year – 5 million came.Following Cool Britannia and the Young British Artists in the 90s, Tate Modern blasted away the last vestiges of British stuffiness about contemporary art. To disguise the gaps in the collection,Mr Serotareplaced chronological hanging with athematic one(to muchcritical dismay). Instead of imitating competitors like the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Tate Modern rewrote the rules and set the tone for 21st-century museums.From the momentousMatisse Picassoin 2002 toCézanne20 years later, it has delivered enough masterpieces to appease those sniffy abouthelter‑skeltersandswings. But its greatest triumph is undoubtedly the 300 sq metre Turbine Hall. The cavernous space has encouraged artists to expand their imaginations to fit. Louise Bourgeois’s giant spider,Maman, which first greeted visitors, returns for theanniversary celebrations.From its earliest event, held for London taxi drivers, Tate Modern’s manifesto has been to make art accessible to all. Children draw on the floor, students hang out, families picnic. Mr Blair might have called it “the people’s palace”.It has also sought to expand the canon,adding more global and female artiststo its collection, alongside major exhibitions ofFrida Kahlo,Georgia O’KeeffeandYayoi Kusama, the last of which broke record numbers in 2023. A Tracey Emin retrospective is billed for next year.It hasn’t all been champagne and blockbusters. As with most cultural institutions, Brexit, thepandemicand afunding crisishave taken their toll. The gallery’sBP sponsorship, which ended in 2016, provoked a series ofprotestsfrom climate activists. And its success hasn’t done anyfavoursfor its less glamorous sister gallery, Tate Britain in Millbank.It is a very different picture in the world at large than when Tate Modern first opened its doors. Where once we were basking in the post-millennial glow of Olafur Eliasson’ssetting sun (The Weather Project) in 2003, now we seem to be flailing in the darkness ofMirosław Bałka’s big black box, which transformed the Turbine Hall into an anxiety dream in 2009.The National Gallery also marks a biganniversarythis year: on 10 May it turns 200. Tate Modern is still a whippersnapper by contrast. Over the first quarter of this century it has become part of the establishment without losing its edge – a hard act to keep up. But it is the job of modern art to evolve and challenge the status quo.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While long predicted, it has taken many years for multi-party politics to become a reality here. The main cause would appear to be our winner-takes-all voting system, whose demise should surely now be inevitable.Last year it delivered a massive majority for a Labour party that won barely a third of the vote, as it has often delivered Tory majorities in the past. So, whatever its mistakes, Labour still has quite a bit of time to turn things around. Besides, with turnouts nearer to 30% rather than 40%, par for the course in local elections, talk of revolution might be a little premature.My main concern is the local elections, where a large number of inexperienced councillors may have won seats. They will probably face a steep learning curve in order to deliver effectively. It’s not the colour of your rosette that will be important. It’s what, if anything, is between your ears.John MarriottLincolnAfter the Runcorn byelection, might it finally dawn on Labour’s leaders that voters who like the policies and tone ofReform UKwill vote Reform UK, and those who don’t are unlikely to vote for a kind of “Reform lite”, which is what Labour is fast becoming? Its turquoise social media ads and its macho talk of being “tough” on illegal immigrants haemorrhage voters to the Lib Dems and Greens, in a mirror image of what is happening to the Conservatives. But “the threat from Reform” will no doubt be what Morgan McSweeney will focus on, and the third and final Labour majority government of my lifetime will deliver as much fundamental, much-needed change as the previous two.Michael WoodgateBristolWe urgently need a more proportional result for elections to the House of Commons as well as for local, mayoral and other elections. This is the core mission of Make Votes Matter, a cross-party organisation which campaigns for a fair vote for every member of our society. At present, just one-third of voters chose Labour, yet the party secured 63% of the seats in the House of Commons and, with that, 100% of governing power.Factoring in the record low turnout of 59%, this means fewer than a third of eligible voters actively support the current government. The result is a system in which over two-thirds of the adult population are effectively unrepresented. That isn’t democratic – and it certainly isn’t fair. And fairness matters. Most British people have an innate sense of it; when it’s missing, it’s no surprise that some voters turn to more extreme alternatives in frustration. A proportional system wouldn’t just deliver fairer outcomes, it would also help foster more compassionate, consistent and competent politics.Susanna DammannChair, Make Votes MatterWinning candidates usually pledge to repay the electorate through their future endeavours in post with a humble commitment to service. Dame Andrea Jenkyns instead vocalises herwish for asylum seekers to sleep in tents. To delight in that thought demonstrates the most malevolent kind of schadenfreude. The title “Dame” confers honour and is one that many would be thrilled to uphold. If Jenkyns doesn’t meet King Charles’s “very best of humanity” standard, she should have the decency to rescind it.Mona SoodSouthend-on-Sea, EssexThe main issues influencing voters are poverty, low-paid jobs, and poor achievement in an education system based on academic prowess.

The result: more of us are getting hopelessly lost, 27 April). In terms of practical advice, though, rather than using the Ordnance Survey app backed up with a paper map, I do it the other way round.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Using a 1:25,000 OS paper map as the primary navigational aid conserves phone battery and allows you to keep an eye on the wider landscape for navigational clues all the time; and the scale is fixed, so after becoming accustomed to it, you have a feel for distances while on the move.TheOS Mapsapp is useful for zooming in on detail, and really comes into its own with its little red locator arrow if, for instance, there is no sign of a path on the open moor. And, of course, it is a godsend if you do lose your way. It is also great for plotting out a route before setting off, to calculate the distance and time to be walked (much more accurate and quicker than laying out bits of string on the paper map, which is how I used to do it). The OS app is the only phone app I pay for, and it is worth every penny.Juliet WoodinNottinghamJohn Harris’s highly pertinent piece on navigation in the outdoors highlights both the issues and some ways to avoid problems. As an experienced hill walker and bird surveyor, I use theOrdnance Surveysubscription OS Maps on my desktop. You soon learn to either print off or screenshot paper maps of varying scales. These can be made semi-waterproof with art pastels fixative and you are never without a perfect paper map matched to your purposes. Add a compass and off you go. We have just used five such maps to guide a curlew survey in south Cumbria and a climb of Blencathra, with stunning views of the lakes.John D PeatfieldBowston, CumbriaAs one of your “older” readers, I laughed out loud to read John Harris saying paper maps can occasionally be useful in our app-disoriented days. I still make my way round London using my old A-Z (it isstill being published), and I pass many people on street corners turning their mobile phones round and round, frowning, obviously lost. Occasionally I offer assistance. I understand that this is no help on a mountain, but I think it is worth reminding readers that it certainly is helpful in central London.Barbara EwingLondonSound advice from John Harris about how to use maps to avoid the navigational hazards ofGPS. For a simple space-time device, keep a pencil handy for sunny days. Held vertically on a flat surface (even a car dashboard can serve), it will cast a shadow to the north at solar noon (1pm BST) – the shadow will appear to move 15 degrees to the east every hour. Check the time, and you may then work out your direction accordingly. But keep the compass for overcast days.Austen LynchGarstang, LancashireI’ve never used GPS or What3words. I have a library of Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 maps that is augmented for each new trip. They are wondrous geographical and historical resources. I am laughed at by my juniors. Grid references and compass use enforce a spatial awareness and numeracy beyond the understanding of millennials. What will they do when the lights go out?

It came as part of a wave of litigation filed by dozens of US states, cities and municipalities in recent years.Donald Trump’s administration has pledged to put an end to these cases, which he has called “frivolous” and claimed are unconstitutional. In court filings on Wednesday, his justice departmentclaimedthe Clean Air Act “displaces” states’ ability to regulate greenhouse gas outside their borders.The agency specifically targeted Michigan, whose Democratic attorney general last year tapped private law firms to work on such a case, and Hawaii, whose Democratic governor filed its suit on Thursday. Officials from both states condemned the justice department’s filings.Friday’s filing from Puerto Rico did not list a reason for the lawsuit’s dismissal. The Guardian has contacted the territory’s attorney general’s office for comment and asked whether it was related to the Trump administration’s moves on Wednesday.Reached for comment, John Lamson, a spokesperson for the San Francisco-based law firm Sher Edling, which filed the 2024 suit on behalf ofPuerto Ricosaid: “We serve under the direction and control, and at the pleasure, of our clients in all of our representations.”Puerto Rico in November elected as governor the Republican Jenniffer González-Colón, aTrump ally. In February, González-Colón tappedJanet Parra-Mercadoas the territory’s new attorney general.Climate-accountability litigation has also faced recent attacks in the media. Last month, an oilfield services executivepublished an op-edin Forbes saying the Puerto Rico lawsuit “may derail” efforts to improve grid reliability.Groups tied to the far-right legal architect Leonard Leo have alsocampaignedagainst the lawsuits. And just days before the voluntary dismissal, the rightwing, pro-fossil fuel advocacy group American Energy Institute (AEI)sent a letterto González-Colón, Fox Newsreported, calling for an end to climate-focused “coordinated lawfare”.“Their goal is to bankrupt energy companies or to leverage the threat of tort damages to force outcomes that would be disastrous for Puerto Rico and the rest of the nation,” AEI’s CEO, Jason Isaac, wrote of the plaintiffs.AEI has attackedclimate-focused legal effortsand has beenlinked to Leo, the Guardian has reported.In December, a California-based trade association of commercial fishers voluntarily dismissed a lawsuit accusing big oil of climate deception.In two earlier lawsuits,37 Puerto Rico municipalitiesand thecapital city of San Juanaccused fossil fuel companies of conspiring todeceive the public about the climate crisis, seeking to hold them accountable for the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria.Explore more on these topicsPuerto RicoDemocracy and justiceTrump administrationOil and gas companiesClimate crisisLaw (US)US politicsHurricane MarianewsShareReuse this content"

We are crazy busy already. We are feeling the push right now.”Usually this time of year isknown as the “hungry gap”, when winter vegetables have run out and consumers are waiting for the summer crops to arrive. However, the sunny, dry weather has eliminated this, he said.“A few months ago we thought it would be the worst hungry gap ever, now we are saying there is not going to be a hungry gap. We got really poor harvests last year – we didn’t get very much squash, for example – so we didn’t have the storage vegetables that would usually get us through the hungry gap. Last year was awful, it was completely wet.”Farmers in England fear for nature after sustainable farming funding frozenRead moreThe extremes of weather, made more acute by climate breakdown, are catching farmers by surprise as they never know whether they will have to deal with floods or drought.“You just can’t predict the climate any more. What might be your predictable dates you might plant things by just don’t work any more,” he said. “We are having to try to be more adaptable to different techniques based on the climate. It’s keeping us on our toes for sure. Some rain would be great, though, we are looking at the weather waiting for the rain.”Kew Gardens, in south-west London, has noticed a glut of berries coming up early.Hélèna Dove, the head of the kitchen garden at Kew, said: “The recent warm weather is really showing how much our growing seasons are shifting. Traditionally, a good kitchen gardener would be proud to have ripe strawberries by Wimbledon as it would demonstrate their skill and expertise. We already have ripe strawberries in the kitchen garden at Kew Gardens, and it’s only April.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We’re even growing peaches, apricots, and nectarines outside currently, something that would have been unthinkable in previous years due to the risk of late frosts and lack of early pollinators.“This time of year is also known as the hungry gap for these early pollinators, once the winter crops have ended but the new season’s plantings are not yet ready to harvest, but with plants such as calendula flowering early, there is a reliable food source this year. While some traditional fruits, such as apples, are struggling, this is an opportunity to rethink what we plant, working with the climate to save energy, water, and potentially even reduce imports.”Farmers are, on the whole, enjoying the sunny growing season. Dale Robinson, supply chain head at the organic vegetable box company Riverford, said: “This spring has been one of the warmest many of us can remember, bringing a real sense of joy and hope to our fields. Crops like purple sprouting broccoli and wild garlic have thrived, and the early warmth has allowed for timely planting of main crops. It’s a welcome change from the delays caused by last year’s wet winter – the wettest on record.“While we celebrate these favourable conditions, our growers remain mindful of the increasing unpredictability brought about by climate change. The real challenge lies not in the gradual shifts, but in the erratic weather extremes – sudden frosts, hailstorms, droughts – all of which can undo months of hard work in a single day.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingVegetablesFruitFoodClimate crisisConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

But its chalk streams are some of the rarest habitats in the world – there are only 200, andEnglandboasts 85% of them. If you look properly, they are as biodiverse and beautiful as any rainforest.Despite the rarity and importance of these very pure rivers, which are full of minerals from the chalk aquifer, they have no specific legal protections. Environmentalists fear the Labour party’s planning bill willuse the country’s departure from the EUto make it legal for developers to destroy them, as long as they offset the damage by paying into a fund to createnature somewhere else.Labour’s great nature sellout is the worst attack on England’s ecosystems I’ve seen in my lifetime | George MonbiotRead more“Chalk streams are an irreplaceable habitat. They are incredibly fragile and incredibly rare, but we suck up our drinking water from them and dump our sewage in them,” Debbie Tann, the chief executive of the Hampshire and Isle of WightWildlifeTrust, said.Chalk streams currently have some protections under the EU-derived habitats directive, which safeguards some of the rare creatures the streams support. But Labour’s new planning and infrastructure bill overrides these protections, allowing developers to pay into a nature restoration fund instead of avoiding destruction and pollution in building. While this tradeoff will be beneficial in some cases, nature campaigners argue that you cannot offset damage done to a rare habitat as irreplaceable as a chalk stream.Tann said: “I think the levy is almost designed to create a replacement or an alternative habitat somewhere else for the thing that you’re impacting. That isn’t going to work in a chalk stream context. You can’t just create a new one somewhere else.”The Itchen looks flawless, its sparkling waters full of healthy vegetation, fish and invertebrates. Some ecologists are sampling the life in the river’s substrate; one little scoop of dirt and pebbles is teeming with life, from mayfly and caddisfly larvae to shrimps, sticklebacks and a long, wiggly leech.View image in fullscreenA stickleback in sampled water from the Itchen.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianBut the river is having to fight back against many pressures, from sewage that bubbles up from a nearby maintenance hole to abstraction for drinking water, as well as a new discharge pipe that will pump runoff directly from the motorway into its pristine waters.The river’s protectors say there is not much more it can take. Ideally, these rivers would be surrounded by meadows that could soak up some of the pollution brought by heavy rainfall.Tann said: “This is one of the best chalk streams in the country. It looks beautiful and is in pretty good condition, but it is suffering from climate change impacts. We do have pollution issues here. The surrounding land is not acting like a good buffer because it is full of housing and industrial estates. So any runoff with these extreme rainfall events will bring pollution straight into the river, so we’re just compounding more and more pressure on these really precious habitats.”Labour picked up votes in last year’s general election by focusing on the sewage scandal, in which water companies have been allowed to dump human waste into the UK’s rivers and seas. Keir Starmer promised to clean up the country’s rivers.People would not forget if broken promises meant their local river getting polluted further, Martin De Retuerto, the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust’s head of nature recovery, said.“The level of engagement and activity on these rivers by local people is really high now, and I think that there could be a bit of a tipping point amongst people in how they view those in charge, if river protection is not taken seriously.”Labour would not be able to change the law on habitat protection had Brexit not happened, as it would mean flouting the EU habitats directive. “This is a Brexit disbenefit of the highest order,” Tann said. “We’ve had successive governments promise to strengthen protections after Brexit, but this is the opposite.”Some of our chalk streams are dying or already dead. The River Ver near St Albans, Hertfordshire, dries up every summer as it is so overabstracted, and poor management means the gravel on which fish should spawn is often covered in a thick layer of silt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In turn, the river has taken care of the local city, Winchester.De Retuerto said: “In 2014 we had some very severe floods, a one-in-200-year event. Arguably, the city did not flood anywhere near as badly as it would because of the floodplain restoration we’ve done here.“Climate breakdown means we’re going to experience far more extreme flooding events as well as drought events, and we’re a bottleneck for the city. So this site will continue to do its part, but there’s a point where it can’t recover sustained frequency of more extreme events as well as soaking up all the other pressures it faces.”View image in fullscreenA swan on the River Itchen.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe Wildlife Trusts have supported an amendment to the planning bill, tabled by the Labour MP Chris Hinchliff, that would enshrine protections for chalk streams as irreplaceable habitats. Planners would have to ensure they were not harming the rare habitats with abstraction, pollution or runoff when designing their developments.Labour’s planning bill threatens protected habitats, says environment watchdogRead moreTann said: “We would like to see chalk streams properly classified as an irreplaceable habitat and have proper protection within planning. We’re not anti-development. We never have been, but it’s about the right development in the right place, and there has to come a point where there’s just too much surrounding these precious sites.”But Starmer has described people such as Tann and De Retuerto as “blockers” because of their nature campaigning. The government has also described nature protections as “red tape” that needs to be cut.Tann said: “Why call that red tape? You wouldn’t call protecting St Paul’s Cathedral red tape.“These streams are part of our identity as a country. And it’s not true that getting rid of nature protections is somehow this magic bullet that’s going to enable economic growth. It’s the wrong answer to the problem, and it’s not going to help. And in the meantime, we will lose these last bits of incredibly important natural environment that we have.”Explore more on these topicsRiversWildlifeConservationHampshireEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Trump has sought to escalate this further,declaringan “energy emergency” to open up more land and ocean for drilling and launching an unprecedented assault on environmental regulations in his first 100 days back in the White House.This new political climate means that the expected amount of greenhouse gas emissions from active and planned projects in US oil and gas fields has jumped under Trump, after previously dropping under Biden, forecasts shared with the Guardian show.Despite awarding more drilling leases than Trump in his first 100 days, Biden also pursued policies to combat the climate crisis that saw oil and gas companies revise down their production estimates. That situation has now reversed, threatening a pulse of new pollution that will further add to the fever of a planet already suffering from heatwaves, floods, droughts and other disasters accelerated by global heating.“The uptick in embodied emissions from forecast US oil and gas production is worrying,” said Olivier Bois von Kursk, policy adviser at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, whichtracksemissions projections from the lifetime of projects, based on data from research consultancy Rystad Energy. “The world can’t afford more climate chaos.”Chart showing the relative emissions forecasts during the first four months of Biden in 2021 and Trump 2 in 2025. Chart shows emissions forecasts are rising under TrumpTrump has already takenmore than 140 initial actions to reverse environmental regulations and promote the use of fossil fuels, dismissing established climate science as a “giant hoax” and exhorting further drilling.“We have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth, and by far, and now I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it,” the president told Congress in March. “It’s called drill, baby, drill.”This unabashed support for fossil fuels has been warmly welcomed by the fossil fuel industry, which donated heavily to Trump’s campaign. While “drill, baby, drill” won’t fully be realized unless Trump manages to push through significant deregulation and tax cuts for the sector, the US will still move towards a record peak of 15m barrels of oil a day, up fromabout13.5m barrels a day now, according to projections by Rystad.“In his first 100 days, President Trump has kept his promise to ‘drill, baby, drill’,” said a White House spokesperson. “We’re achieving historic results at record speed and we’re just getting started.”The International Energy Agency, which has forecast that global oil and gas demand will peak by 2030, has said thatno new major fossil fuel projects can occurif the world is to stay within agreed temperature limits and avoid catastrophic climate impacts. Last year was the hottest, worldwide,ever recordedand governments are collectivelyfailingto meet targets to avert escalating disasters.Trump’s ambitions for more drilling in the US have been clouded, however, by his own economic policies. While oil and gas has beenexempt from a barrage of tariffsimposed by Trump, the industry is smarting from tariffs placed on materials such as steel, which it needs for pipelines, and has been unnerved byfears of recessionamid an increasingly erratictrade war.The first 100 days of Trump’s administration have been the worst start of any presidency for the stock market since the 1970s, engulfing many fossil fuel firms that have seen their share prices slump.The price of a barrel of American crude oil brieflydroppedbelow $60, a threshold under which companies cannot operate profitably, before edging up slightly in recent weeks. Opec, the oil cartel, recently increased production at the urging of Trump, further putting downward pressure on the oil price.This has stirred anger within an oil and gas sector that has otherwise cheered on Trump. “The administration’s chaos is a disaster for the commodity markets. ‘Drill, baby, drill’ is nothing short of a myth and populist rallying cry,” one executive told a surveyconducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.Said another: “I have never felt more uncertainty about our business in my entire 40-plus-year career.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Until really there is a settlement on the tariffs, there’s going to be a lot of volatility.”While Rystad expects concerns over a recession to pass, and the price of oil to climb back to around $70 a barrel later this year, the outlook for renewable energy may be more difficult, with solar and wind projects facing potential cost increases of up to 30% due to the tariffs and attempts by Trump and Republicans in Congress to eliminate support for clean energy.Trump has already halted approvals of new solar and wind projects on federal lands and waters and criticized what he calls “scam” subsidies for clean energy. Tariffs on solar panels from Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia have beenratchetedup to as much as 3,521%. “We don’t want windmills in this country,” the president said shortly after his inauguration in January. “We don’t want windmills. You know what else people don’t like? Those massive solar fields.”While more than 90% of new power added to the US electricity grid this year isexpectedto be from solar, wind and batteries, the administration’s turn against renewables is already affecting planned projects that areoverwhelmingly located in Republican rural and exurban districts.Nearly $8bn in planned investments and 16 large-scale clean energy projects were shut, cancelled or downsized in the first three months of the year, according to E2, a nonpartisan business group. “Clean energy companies still want to invest in America, but uncertainty overTrump administrationpolicies and the future of critical clean energy tax credits are taking a clear toll,” said Michael Timberlake, a spokesperson for E2.Economic disruptions from the fluctuating price of oil, as well the climate impacts from burning oil and other fossil fuels, can be alleviated if “governments and investors make smart choices”, said von Kursk. “Clean energy is more competitive than ever, eroding demand for fossil fuels.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOil and gas companiesTrump tariffsClimate crisisRenewable energyDonald TrumpEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

We also know that many special schools are struggling to meet the demand on them for places and are massively oversubscribed.”The government is due to publish its plans to transform the Send system in Englandin a white paper, which is expected to prioritise inclusion and better support in mainstream state schools, with the aim of cutting council spending on costly private provision.Ministers plan major changes to Send education in EnglandRead moreGuardian analysisearlier this year revealed that many English councils had built up debts running into hundreds of millions of pounds as a result of Send spending on independent special schools, pushing the councils to the brink of bankruptcy.Whiteman said: “We are not opposed to the government wanting mainstream schools to be inclusive, and school leaders take this duty really seriously, but they need more funding, resources and specialist staffing to be able to support their students appropriately and effectively.“And this doesn’t remove the fact that there will also always be a need for special school places for pupils with the greatest needs. Capacity in both mainstream and specialist schools must match need.”Delegates to the NAHT’s annual general conference in Harrogate this weekend will vote on a number of motions calling for more funding, training and support for educating Send pupils. “There is no higher priority now in education than fixing the Send crisis,” Whiteman said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Staff morale is low and staff are leaving the profession.”A Department for Education spokesperson said the government had inherited a Send system on its knees and had already invested an additional £1.7bn to improve provision.They added: “It will take time, but as part of our plan for change, we are thinking differently about what the Send system should look like, to restore the confidence of families up and down the country and deliver the improvement they are crying out for so every child can achieve and thrive.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSchoolsSchool fundingDisabilityEnglandWalesNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

For Asian adults, the figure should be 18 percentage points higher.The error in the official figures is the result of government statistics not using new body mass index (BMI) calculations. Earlier this year, theNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence(Nice) updated its BMI measurement guidelines to recommend lower thresholds for adults from Black, Asian and other minority ethnic backgrounds.Nice’s revised thresholds reflect the fact that people from certain minority backgrounds have a greater risk of some chronic health conditions – such as cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes – at a lower threshold than their white counterparts.The updated guidance also addresses how body composition, which includes variations in fat and muscle mass, varies across ethnic groups. People from Black, Asian, and other minority backgrounds are more prone to central adiposity, which occurs when excess fat accumulates around the abdomen and is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and related mortality.Nesta, a charity that promotes innovation, said the government should make sure the updated Nice thresholds were adopted in future publications of theHealthSurvey for England.Parita Doshi, the deputy director of healthy life at Nesta, said: “Reducing Britain’s obesity levels is achievable, but only with a clear-eyed understanding of the size of the problem and levels of inequality.“NHS England and DHSC [the Department of Health and Social Care] should look to ensure these guidelines are adopted in future health data publications, to provide a clear picture of the challenge of reducing obesity in the country.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those who will conclude that it is individuals’ choices about diet and exercise that needs to change will have misunderstood Nesta’s analysis.”The DHSC was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsObesityHealthRaceNational Institute for Health and Care ExcellenceEnglandDiabetesnewsShareReuse this content"

On 21 March, another prisoner was taken to hospital after receiving trauma care for serious injuries.Mark Fairhurst, the national chair of the POA, said he had spoken to union representatives and officers at the prison.“This was far from a minor incident,” said Fairhurst. “A member of staff received stab wounds and was stamped on, whilst another was nearly taken hostage. Two female staff who responded were also hospitalised.“It is clear that senior leaders at Swinfen Hall have lost control and we now need a reset which involves a full lockdown search to eradicate weapons and illicit items, coupled with a regime refresh that reduces the amount of prisoners unlocked at any one time.”The union also said that in March, a serious incident occurred where approximately 20 prisoners fought with each other but then turned on staff, resulting in an officer being assaulted with a pool cue. Emergency transfers were needed to stabilise the wing.Concerns have been growing about violence across prisons, in particular among young men. Last week the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, authorised for the first time the use of synthetic pepper spray, or Pava, against 15- to 18-year-olds after an increase in violence in young offender institutions.Mahmood has also announced a trial deployment of Tasers to prison officers in high-security jails, a snap review of whether they should be equipped with stab vests and the suspension of kitchen access for offenders in separation units.It followsHashem Abedi’s assaulton officers at HMP Frankland using two homemade knives and hot oil. He has been moved to HMP Belmarsh, in south London, to continue to serve his life sentence for his part in 22 murders in the Manchester Arena terrorist attack.In April 2001, HMP Swinfen Hall was a young offender institution and was named as a centre of excellence by the then prison watchdog for its anti-bullying policies and programmes.The prison now specialises in taking young offenders who are serving between four years and life. A quarter of the inmates have committed serious sexual offences, and many others have been involved in gang-related violence.As a category C prison, it is supposed to offer education and training to prisoners. In December, the prison watchdog, Charlie Taylor, said the prison regime “lacked purpose”, with nearly a third of the prisoners locked in their cells and nearly half (45%) taking illegal drugs.Assaults in prisons have been rising, with an average of 74 a day recorded inEnglandand Wales last year, including 25 assaults a day inflicted on staff, House of Commons library research has shown.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Violence in prison will not be tolerated, and we will always push for the strongest punishment for attacks on our hard-working staff and do whatever we can to protect them. The lord chancellor has announced a review into protective body armour and a trial of Tasers in jails to better respond to serious incidents.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceEnglandStaffordshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The total cost of running the panels – and employing a dedicated commissioner – would be between £10.9m and £13.6m a year, the Whitehall document said.But the potential savings to the NHS of accelerating the deaths of terminally ill people were expected to range from between £919,000 and £10.3m in the first year to between £5.8m and £59.6m in the 10th.The 149-page document, produced by the Department of Health and Social Care, calculated the potential savings as part of an overall impact assessment. This was ordered as part of a parliamentary bill sponsored by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, which is due to be voted on again on 16 May.Leadbeater welcomed the impact assessment and said the proposed legislation was “effective and workable”. “By contrast, the law as it currently stands offers no protections, no oversight, and no support for people facing a painful and undignified death,” she said.“Having the safest assisted dying law in the world inevitably has an impact in terms of cost and resources. Again, as the impact assessments point out, unlike in England andWales, other countries do not have a voluntary assisted dying commissioner or multi-disciplinary panels to assess every application.”But Gordon Macdonald, the chief executive of Care Not Killing, which is opposed to a change in the law, said the document “confirms that changing the law will save money … exactly as we have seen in other jurisdictions which have introduced state-assisted killing, placing pressure on vulnerable terminally ill people to end their lives”.Tanni Grey-Thompson, a gold-medallist Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, said: “This impact assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and underresourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a ‘treatment option’.”The government is neutral on the legislation, which passed its first hurdle in the Commons last November. It would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales who have fewer than six months to live to apply for an assisted death. This would be subject to approval by two doctors and a panel including a social worker, senior legal figure and psychiatrist.The bill has undergone significant changes since that initial vote. A high court safeguard has been dropped and replaced by expert panels, while the implementation period has been doubled from a maximum of two to four years.It has been suggested some MPs who supported the bill last year could change their stance when it returns for a further vote, after the change to the high court safeguard.The impact assessment said it had “not been possible” to estimate the overall costs of implementing an assisted dying service at this stage of the process.A spokesperson for the health department said it “has a responsibility to make sure any legislation that passes through parliament is workable, effective and enforceable” and that the publication of the impact assessment was done “in order to help parliamentarians in their consideration of the bill”.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, who confirmed last month that he still planned to oppose the legislation at the next vote, said last year that there were “choices and trade-offs”, adding “any new service comes at the expense of other competing pressures and priorities”.Andrew Copson, the chief executive of Humanists UK, said the government had done a “thorough job” on the impact assessment. “Assisted dying isn’t untested. Legislation is already working in over 31 jurisdictions across the world, where implementation in Australia, New Zealand, the US, and Europe has shown it to be safe, compassionate, and practical. It’s time for parliament to grant people the dignity and autonomy they deserve at the end of life.”Liz Carr, the actor, activist and author of the BBC documentary Better Off Dead?, said: “The conclusion of the impact assessment that assisted suicide would save the NHS money only confirms the fears of many disabled people that our lives will be seen as expendable and a burden on public services should this dangerous law be implemented … Lives should never be measured on the basis of financial worth.”While it remains illegal in most of the world, more than 300 million people now live in countries that have legalised assisted dying. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain and Austria have all introduced assisted dying laws since 2015, when UK MPs last voted on the issue.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingEnglandWalesHealthHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

The industrial action caused enormous disruption to the NHS, to other medical staff and to patients waiting for treatment.On Friday, the union said three weeks had passed since it warned the government of the “consequences of the absence of a reasonable, timely pay offer” for 2025-26. Its ballot will open on 27 May and close on 7 July.If returned with a “yes” vote, a mandate for strike action would last from July 2025 to January 2026.The co-chairs of the BMA’s resident doctors’ committee, Dr Melissa Ryan and Dr Ross Nieuwoudt, said after a meeting with the health secretary: “Today we met with Wes Streeting and made clear that all he would have to do to avoid the need for a ballot was pledge to negotiate a fair deal that moved us toward pay restoration by 2027, in line with existing BMA policy.“Unfortunately, he could not make this commitment.“Resident doctors are not going to be ignored. We are going to stand up for our value to the NHS and to patients, and we are going to fight to stay on the path set out for us by last year’s deal: restoration of our pay to the level of 2008.“No doctor today is worth less than they were 17 years ago, and that is precisely what doctors voting ‘yes’ to industrial action will be telling the government.“We don’t want to be in the situation where we have to fight over and over again for our worth. We would rather get on with our careers and our work caring for our patients.“But our successful action over previous years shows clearly that if that is what we must do, then doctors are more than prepared to do it.”The 22.3% rise agreed in September last year was less than the 35% the BMA was seeking as “full pay restoration” for the fall in earnings experienced since 2008. But it proved enough to persuade a majority of resident doctors to call off their stoppages.Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers, said hospitals would be “alarmed” by the BMA’s decision to ballot resident doctors for strike action over pay.“Health leaders would urge all trade unions, including the BMA, to prioritise dialogue with the government rather than industrial action,” he said.Speaking earlier this week, Keir Starmer said he hoped the government could work with NHS staff to find a solution to avoid strike action, saying: “I don’t want to see strike action. I don’t think anybody wants to see strike action.”Both Unison and the RCN nursing union are consulting members about possible ballots for industrial action.Explore more on these topicsDoctorsNHSEnglandHealthIndustrial actionTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s therefore even more surprising that the current government chose to continue the appeal into this case and argue that wasn’t the case. As a result, even more people have been needlessly funnelled into the criminal system over the past 12 months through a law that should never have existed in the first place.“This ruling is a huge victory for democracy, and sets an important precedent that government ministers must respect the law, and cannot simply step outside it to do whatever they want. The next step for the government is simple: they must accept this ruling and agree to scrap this unlawful legislation once and for all.”The case centred around a statutory instrument, a type of legislation that can pass with minimal parliamentary scrutiny, introduced by Braverman to clarify the definition of “serious disruption” under the Public Order Act 1986, after lords had voted down similar provisions just months earlier.A cross-party parliamentary committee said it was the first time a government had ever sought to use so-called Henry VIII powers to make changes to a law that had already been rejected by parliament in primary legislation. One peerdescribed it in parliamentas a “constitutional outrage”.Liberty challenged the redefinition with a judicial review, arguing that Braverman had overreached by introducing the change under secondary legislation which requires less parliamentary oversight.But even as that challenge was under way, hundreds of campaigners were arrested under the new power, including the climate activist Greta Thunbergat a protest in London. She wasacquittedof all charges in a hearing in February 2024.Finally, in May last year,the high court agreed with the campaigners’ arguments, but judges suspended the reversal of the measures after the Home Office began an appeal that was continued after government changed hands in 2024.Upholding the high court’s ruling on Friday morning, Lord Justice Underhill, Lord Justice Dingemans and Lord Justice Edis said: “The term ‘serious’ inherently connotes a high threshold … [and] cannot reasonably encompass anything that is merely ‘more than minor’.”Liberty, despite claiming victory, warned that the section 14 power that has now been softened was just one plank of extensive legislation that had drastically circumscribed people’s ability to protest in the UK. It has issued a warning about new powers building on previous acts currently under consideration by lawmakers as part of a crime and policing bill.“It’s especially worrying that even more measures are going through parliament, including bans on face coverings at protests that would make it unsafe for disabled activists and political dissidents to protest,” said Katy Watts, a Liberty lawyer.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The court has ruled that specific regulations made by the previous government were unlawful. However, the central powers currently used by policing to manage protests and ensure that they remain peaceful are not affected by this judgment.“The right to peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy but the law remains clear that it does not extend to intentional intimidation or serious disruption to the life of the community.“We are already bringing forward new measures in legislation to prevent intimidatory protests outside places of worship. We will ensure that the police and the public have clarity on existing powers to manage protests that cause serious disruption, including where that disruption is cumulative, and undertake further work where required.”Explore more on these topicsUK civil libertiesSuella BravermanProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

The letter suggests this amounts to “significant overreach” that is inconsistent with the UK’s obligations under the Human Rights Act and the European convention on human rights.More than 400 actors and industry figures sign open letter backing trans rightsRead moreBut the chair of the EHRC, Kishwer Falkner, hit back at critics in an opinion piece in the House magazine, saying “it is unacceptable to question the integrity of the judiciary, or indeed the regulator, as some have done”.Acknowledging that “the public discourse on this topic continues to be polarised”, Lady Falkner called on “every legislator to read the judgment in full”, saying she regretted “any uncertainty among duty bearers and the public that has been fuelled by misunderstanding and distortion, particularly across social media”.Praising the judgment as “a model of clarity”, she underlined that “the law it sets out is effective immediately. Those with duties under the Equality Act should be following it and taking specialist legal advice where necessary”.Falkner also dismissed claims that trans people were not being listened to as “simply incorrect”, pointing to the commission’s plans to open a two-week public consultation in May to understand how the practical implications of the judgment can be reflected in an updated code of practice.Barclays says bank will bar trans women from using female bathroomsRead moreThe nonprofit legal organisation Good Law Project (GLP), which has raised more than £284,000 to challenge the supreme court’s judgment, said it was working on about 20 related legal initiatives, including one case already before the courts. In an update to donors, GLP added it had instructed an expert team to produce legal advice on what the court’s decision meant and would produce guidance for the trans community on what to do if they are challenged for using the spaces that align with their gender.Explore more on these topicsTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsUK supreme courtGendernewsShareReuse this content"

These characteristics closely resembled gambling, the Treasury committee found.The proposed ban is expected to face resistance from some fintech firms. Meanwhile, ministers have presented draft laws that will extend existing financial regulation to companies involved in crypto, aligning the UK with the US rather than the EU.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said after a recent visit to Washington she haddiscussed crypto regulation with the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent,and that the two countries planned to discuss the subject further in June.Bessent is known to be pro-crypto and, along with Trump, is against proposals for a central bank digital currency. Dismissing concerns that private companies such as Meta, Google and Apple might control digital currencies in the future, he told a Senate finance committee hearing in January: “I see no reason for the US to have a central bank digital currency.”Eurozone finance ministers said last month they were concerned the US stance could affect eurozone monetary sovereignty and financial stability.In the UK, the Starmer government has come under pressure from within the Labour party to take a tougher line. In 2023, MPs on an all-party parliamentary committee urged ministers to treat retail investment in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as a form of gambling.As part of her growth strategy, Reeves has called foran easing of regulationsin some areas, an approach backed by the FCA chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, who has suggested that rules in the Square Mile could be simplified to spur innovation.David Geale, the executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said clear crypto regulation would increase confidence in the sector, supporting growth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former is tightly inscribed, on remarkably well-preserved parchment, recording details of the service, processions, promises, who attended and what ceremonial roles they performed.The latter includes 11,500 copperplate words, is the first to use high-quality paper rather than animal skin, and took the calligrapher Stephanie von Werthern-Gill 56 days to inscribe.Also digitised, it details, at Charles’s request, the flowers and the music, and is decorated with illustrations by the designer of theking’s cypher, Tim Noad. And, while not all guests are mentioned by name, as a record of what happened at Westminster Abbeyon 6 May 2023, it could fairly be described as comprehensive and a work of art in itself.Now the two rolls, part of a tradition dating back at least seven centuries, are on public display for the first time in an exhibition at theNational Archivesthat also includes works of art commissioned by the government to mark the coronation.“Both rolls contain some element of narration. In 1308, there’s not a lot of that, but in 2023 there is plenty, that’s why it is very long,” said Dr Sean Cunningham, the head of medieval records at theNational Archives. “Edward’s is a more formal record.”While Edward’s makes no mention of his queen, Isabella – though does mention Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall and alleged to be the king’s lover – Queen Camilla features in Charles’s, Cunningham said.View image in fullscreenA finely detailed ink sketch by Manchester-based Leslie Thompson, produced in collaboration with Venture Arts.Photograph: Tony Harris/Government art collection, UKOther, less formal and more interpretive records of King Charles’s coronation day can be found in the works commissioned from artists that are now part of the government art collection.A monumental oil and acrylic entitled The Mall, by the London-based painterDale Lewis, spotlights individuals he saw in the central London crowd, including a top-hat wearer, a street sweeper, and a woman with a duck-feathered hat. Its vibrant foreground colours fade to greys at the back. It was not just to reflect the abysmal weather on the king’s big day. “I was thinking about Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, and wanted to bring a bit of the past back. It was very heavy rain,” Lewis said.Cornelia Parkerplays on the Chambers dictionary definitions of the words “king” and “queen” in her finely embroidered diptych King and Queen (recto and verso) produced in collaboration with Fine Cell Work, a rehabilitation charity training prisoners in fine needlework.View image in fullscreenThe collage Flag by Hew Locke features an image of the gold state coach.Photograph: Tony Harris/Government art collection, UKAn image of the gold state coach was enlarged and fragmented to makeHew Locke’s collage on velvet entitled Flag, which he described as a ship that “sets off hopefully but into unknown waters”. On the ship are portraits of Caribbean cane cutters, a reminder that coronation year was also the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the Windrush. “It’s layers of material, and layers of meaning,” he said.Joy Gerrardemploys a helicopter view of the crowds in the Mall in two large and finely detailed ink works, depicting the people surging towards Buckingham Palace as the police cordon was lifted for the balcony appearance of king and queen. She said being commissioned “opened up ideas of witnessing impartiality and celebration that I hadn’t considered before in my work”.A finely detailed ink sketch by Manchester-basedLeslie Thompson, produced in collaboration with Venture Arts working with learning disabled and neurodivergent artists, draws heavily on popular culture references in Crowd of People and the Different People. His Many of the TV Screens Everywhere series imagines London zoo animals, the Muppets, drinkers at a London pub and his own mum watching the coronation on TV.Other works on show include photographic studies from different communities around the UK on coronation day.Only 18 coronation rolls survive today, housed at the National Archives in Kew, including those for King William III and Queen Mary II, Victoria and Elizabeth II. “You could describe them as the ultimate public records,” said Cunningham.Details of the free exhibition, which runs until November 2025, can be found on theNational Archives website.Explore more on these topicsMonarchyKing Charles coronationKing Charles IIIExhibitionsNational ArchivesHeritageArtnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s called restitution.”However, she said, “the president has the power to pardon which can wipe out your entire sentence including your obligation to pay back the money.”Oyer alleged: “In total,Donald Trumphas granted pardons that have wiped out over $1bn in debts owed by wealthy Americans who have committed fraud and broken the law.”In the video, Oyer highlights the case of Michele Fiore, a former Republican politician from Nevada, who wasconvicted of wire fraud last year.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided by TikTok.

Instead of building the statues,prosecutors saidthat she used the funds on “personal and political expenses”.The White Housepardoned Fiore, and according to Oyer, this released her from repaying those funds.In adifferent video,Oyer pointed toTrump’s pardon of Trevor Milton, the founder of an electric vehicle startup, who was convicted of fraud in 2023 and sentenced to four years in prison.TheWashington Post reported thatthe judge had not yet determined the restitution amount, but that federal prosecutors estimated that Milton owed more than $680m to defrauded shareholders.Notably, Milton and his wife contributedmore than $1.8m to a Trump re-electioncampaign.Oyer said his pardon erased the restitution being sought.The Post reported that Oyer added up the alleged restitution amounts for the relevant individuals convicted of stealing.The newspaper also noted that some of Trump’s pardon recipients had not yet been sentenced, so their owed amounts had not been finalized by the courts.Additionally, the Post reported that Trumppardoned the cryptocurrency exchange HDR Global Trading (BitMEX),which eliminateda $100m fineagainst the exchange for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. Trump alsopardoned several company executives who had pleaded guilty to financial crimes.Oyer told the Post it was “unprecedented for a president to grant pardons that have the effect of wiping out so much debt owed by people who have committed frauds”.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.Last month, Oyer, who served in Joe Biden’s administration,testified before Congressabout her termination and the Trump administration’s treatment of the justice department and law firms.According to Oyer’s lawyer,the justice department had plannedto send armed US marshals to deliver a letter to her home warning her about testifying.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS justice systemUS crimeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Images posted to social media by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition showed a fierce blaze onboard the ship and two explosions.There was no confirmation or further evidence of the claim that drones caused the blasts, but images of the Conscience provided by Cypriot authorities showed significant damage.map showing location of the ship when it was attackedTwelve crew members and four civilians were “confirmed safe”, the Maltese government said in a statement on Friday. “The vessel had 12 crew members onboard and four civilian passengers; no casualties were reported,” the statement said, adding that a nearby tug had been directed to aid the vessel.The group said activists from 21 countries were onboard on a “mission to challenge Israel’s illegal and deadly siege ofGazaand to deliver desperately needed, life-saving aid”.The statement read: “Israeli ambassadors must be summoned and answer to violations of international law, including the ongoing blockade and the bombing of our civilian vessel in international waters.”Israel has not commented on the allegation.Gaza blockade: a Palestinian widow, her children and a cupboard that is almost bareRead moreAccording to the monitoring website MarineTraffic, the Conscience left the Tunisian port of Bizerte on Tuesday and arrived in the area where it reported being attacked on Thursday morning. The ship was heading to a point near Malta where it was to pick up activists, including the climate-change campaigner Greta Thunberg, from a smaller vessel.Thunberg confirmed to Reuters she was in Malta and had been supposed to board the ship.“I was part of the group who was supposed to board that boat today to continue the voyage towards Gaza, which is one of many attempts to open up a humanitarian corridor and to do our part to keep trying to break Israel’s illegal siege on Gaza,” she said. “This attack caused an explosion and major damage to the vessel, which made it impossible to continue the mission.”View image in fullscreenDamage on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla vessel Conscience.Photograph: Freedom Flotilla Coalition/ReutersThe group said it had been organising a non-violent action under a media blackout in order to avoid any potential sabotage.A previous sailing launched by the coalition from southern Turkey in 2010 ended in bloodshed when Israeli forces stormed the Mavi Marmara vessel,killing 10 people and wounding 28.Turkey’s foreign ministry said Turkish nationals were on board the Conscience at the time of the incident.“We condemn in the strongest terms this attack on a civilian ship,” it said, noting that there were “allegations that the ship was targeted by Israeli drones”.“All necessary efforts will be made to reveal the details of the attack as soon as possible and to bring the perpetrators to justice,” it said.Israel imposed a tight blockade on Gaza two months ago, allowing no food, fuel, medicine or other item into the territory, and resumed intense military operations in Gaza in mid-March after a fragile ceasefire collapsed.Humanitarian organisations in Gaza have distributed the last of their stocks of flour and other foodstuffs. Officials in the devastated Palestinian territory said on Friday that the kitchens that serve basic meals to those with no other option would be forced to close within a week to 10 days.On Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it would not have access to food, medicine and life-saving supplies needed for many of its Gaza programmes unless aid deliveries resumed immediately.“Aid must be allowed to enter Gaza. Hostages must be released. Civilians must be protected,” it said. “Without immediate action, Gaza will descend further into chaos that humanitarian efforts will not be able to mitigate.”Medical workers in Gaza’s remaining health facilities said they were now prioritising cases to make sure available medical stocks were reserved for the most serious. Medicine for chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure is virtually unobtainable, officials said.“I don’t know how people are managing. They have lost everything. The displacement continues every day and more people are searching for shelter and whatever they need to survive,” said Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGOs Network in Gaza.A UN team has been sent to the devastated Palestinian territory to assess levels of malnutrition and the risk of famine.Israeli officials justify the blockade with claims that Hamas routinely steals aid, distributing it to its fighters or selling it. Aid officials in Gaza deny any widespread theft of aid in recent months.Media in Israel have reported a plan to use private contractors to distribute food from centralised hubs protected by the Israeli military to Palestinians who have been vetted. Humanitarian officials in Gaza say the plan is unworkable and potentially illegal.The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’s attack on southern Israel in October 2023, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Thursday that at least 2,326 people had been killed since Israel resumed strikes, bringing the overall death toll since the war broke out to 52,418, also mostly civilians.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaMaltaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesEuropeIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The White House officials may be using the modified Signal in order to comply with the legal requirement that presidential records be preserved.The outlet 404 Mediareportedthat the app appears to be “a piece of software from a company called TeleMessage which makes clones of popular messaging apps but adds an archiving capability to each of them”.That function suggests the end-to-end encryption that makes Signal trusted for sharing private communications is possibly “not maintained, because the messages can be later retrieved after being stored somewhere else”, according to 404 Media.The photograph does not show much of the content of the messages Waltz was sending, though one to “Rubio” – probably the secretary of state – could be seen to read “there is time” while a message from “Vance” – probably the vice-president – read, “I have confirmation from my counterpart it’s turned off. He is going to be here in …”There was also an indication that Waltz had used Signal to call Gabbard, and that the phone’s scheduling function included an 8am meeting for “PDB”, probably the president’s daily brief.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They said: “The AfD will continue to defend itself legally against these defamatory statements that endanger democracy.”Donald Trump’s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, described the BfV ruling as “tyranny in disguise”. Posting on social media, Rubio said: “What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD – which took second in the recent election – but rather the establishment’s deadly open border immigration policies.”The AfD has faced growing calls from opponents for it to be outlawed on the grounds that it seeks to undermine democratic values, including protection of minority rights. Such a ban can be sought by either house of parliament – the Bundestag or the Bundesrat – or by the government itself.The German parliament may use the BfV decision to justify an attempt to cut or block public funding for the party.But Olaf Scholz, the outgoing Social Democrat chancellor, warned against rushing to outlaw the AfD. Some opponents of a ban say it could backfire and help promote a victim narrative within the party.Next week,Friedrich Merz, the Christian Democratic Union leader, will be sworn in as Germany’s new chancellor, after his conservative bloc won February’s snap election. However, his party has lost ground since the vote, with several recent polls showing the AfD in first place.Merz will lead a centre-right government with the Social Democrats. Theircoalition agreementbars any explicit or tacit cooperation with the AfD, a policy that all the mainstream parties have called a critical “firewall” to protect German democracy.However, Merz has faced calls from within his party to treat the AfD as a normal opposition force in order to prevent it from casting itself as a political martyr.Merz himself faced fierce criticism in Januaryfor accepting AfD supportfor motions in parliament to restrict migration, which Scholz before the election called an “unforgivable mistake”.The AfD won a record number of seats in the election, theoretically entitling it to chair several key parliamentary committees. However, the BfV’s decision could make other parties less willing to lend their support for such an outcome.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the same month, it also performed well in two other former communist regions.Afteractive endorsement by Elon Muskduring the campaign, the AfD achieved the best national result for a hard-right party in Germany since the second world war.The Cologne-based BfV based its decision on a 1,100-page report that was presented to the interior ministry this week.The report outlined the party’s efforts to erode democracy, including inciting hostility toward asylum seekers and migrants and viewing German citizens “with a background of migration from predominantly Muslim countries” as inferior.Political analysts and security authorities say the AfD, which was founded 12 years ago by a group of Eurosceptic professors, has become more radicalised with each change in leadership, and particularly when the country faced an influx of refugees in 2015-16.Benjamin Winkler, of the anti-extremist Amadeu Antonio Foundation, welcomed the BfV’s decision, blaming the AfD for increasing the influence of radical groups while stoking racist and anti-migrant sentiment in the wider population.“We see it in the large number of reports about attacks, and in police data about the record number of rightwing extremist crimes in Germany,” he told the news channel n-tv.The AfD has also called repeatedly for a break with Germany’s culture of historical remembrance of the Holocaust, using thinly veiled Nazi slogans, which are outlawed in Germany.In an online chat with Musk in January,Weidel referred to Adolf Hitler as a communist.Explore more on these topicsAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)GermanyThe far rightEuropeEspionagenewsShareReuse this content"

The request came after a judge found the tech giant was commandingan illegal monopolyfor the second time in less than a year.“We have a defendant who has found ways to defy” the law, US government lawyer Julia Tarver Wood told a federal court in Virginia, as she urged the judge to dismiss Google’s assurance that it would change its behavior. “Leaving a recidivist monopolist” intact was not appropriate to solve the issue, she added.The demand is the second such request by the US government, which is also calling for the divestment of the company’sChromebrowser in a separate case over Google’s world-leading search engine business.The US government specifically alleged that Google controls the market for publishing banner ads on websites, including those of many creators and small news providers.The hearing in a Virginia courtroom was scheduled to plan out the second phase of the trial, set for September, in which the parties will argue over how to fix the ad market to satisfy the judge’s ruling.The plaintiffs argued in the first phase of the trial last year that the vast majority of websites use Google ad software products which, combined, leave no way for publishers to escape Google’s advertising technology and pricing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Google lawyer Karen Dunn did, however, acknowledge the “trust issues” raised in the case and said the company would accept monitoring to guarantee any commitments made to satisfy the judge. Google is also arguing that calls for divestment are not appropriate in this case, which Brinkema swiftly refused as an argument.The judge urged both sides to mediate, stressing that coming to a compromise solution would be cost-effective and more efficient than running a weeks-long trial.Explore more on these topicsUS newsGoogleLaw (US)AlphabetChromeTechnology sectorShareReuse this content"

Now he must redefine itRead moreCarney’s Liberals are set to form a minority government after Monday’s election, and are projected to hold at least 168 seats, with recounts pending in at least two electoral districts. The Conservatives will form the official opposition with a projected 144 seats, while the Bloc Québecois won 23, the progressive New Democratic party seven and the Greens one. Carney praised the strength of the country’s democracy amid high turnout, telling reporters all party leaders “quickly and graciously” accepted the results.The prime minister said he would call a byelection immediately after Conservatives decide which member of parliament will step aside to give leader Pierre Poilievre, whofailed to win his own seat, the chance to run for a new seat.“No games,” he said.But Carney rejected the idea of signing a formal pact with the NDP in order to guarantee the survival of his minority government,as his predecessor Justin Trudeau didfollowing his narrow electoral victory in 2021. Carney said the Liberals had received a strong mandate “and the most votes in Canadian history”, adding: “Canadians elected a new government to stand up to President Trump and build a strong economy.”Carney told reporters he would announce a cabinet with gender parity on 12 May and parliament would return on 27 May in a move that “clearly underscores the sovereignty of our country”.The visit of a monarch to give the speech from the throne marks the first in more than half a century. The last time a sovereign opened parliament was in 1957, when Queen Elizabeth II came to Ottawa.The prime minister also acknowledged that a large portion of the voter base had concerns they felt the Liberals had so far failed to fully address.Ahead of the election, the Conservatives had emphasized a “tough on crime” message and Carney said on Friday that his party would strengthen both the criminal code and bail laws “for those threatening the safety of Canadians”, making it more difficult for those accused of auto theft, home invasion and human trafficking to obtain bail. Carney also pledged to build more houses and to cut taxes on new builds in an attempt to make the real estate market more accessible.“I’ve been clear since day one of my leadership campaign in January, I’m in politics to do big things, not to be something,” he said. “Now that Canadians have honoured me with a mandate to bring about big changes quickly, I will work relentlessly to fulfil that trust.”Much of the press conference, however, focused on Carney’s upcoming meeting with Trump. The prime minister told reporters he would not negotiate in public amid questions over how he might approach a possible trade deal with the president, as well as the presence of tariffs on Canadian goods that violate current trade rules.Canada election 2025: latest results as Liberal party wins federal electionRead more“Do not expect white smoke out of that meeting,” he said, a reference to the upcoming papal conclave.The White House has cited the alleged flow of fentanyl from Canada for imposing tariffs, even though only minimal amounts of the drug have been seized at the northern border in recent months.“There will be difficult discussions,” Carney said in French. “The fentanyl-related tariffs, we don’t understand why they’re still in place.”When pressed on Trump’s musing on making Canada the 51st state, Carney said any such proposal would be rejected by Canada.“It’s always important to distinguish want from reality,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCanadaKing Charles IIIMark CarneyDonald TrumpTrump tariffsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The divestment comes after Bezos sold $13.4bn ofAmazonstock last year.Bezos is the world’s second richest person, according to Bloomberg’s billionaire index, with an estimated total net worth of $212bn. Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, ranks first, with an estimated total net worth of $332bn.The announcement came just hours afterAmazon reported its first-quarter earningsfor 2025. Revenue rose by 9% in the period to $155.7bn, and profit came in at $17.1bn. Nevertheless, Amazon shares fell in after-hours trading amid concerns around how Donald Trump’s trade tariffs could affect the business.Andy Jassy, the chief executive of Amazon, said it was “hard to tell with tariffs how they’re going to settle and when they’re going to settle” in a call with analysts, adding that there had “maybe never been a more important time” to have the broadest selection of items at the lowest possible prices.Prices on Amazon’s online marketplace have started to rise since Trump announced new tariffs at the start of April, particularly on Chinese imports.Last week the White House accused Amazon of committing a“hostile and political act”after a report suggested the company was planning to inform customers about how much Trump’s tariffs would cost them as they shopped.Amazon has distanced itself from the report, saying the idea had been considered by Amazon Haul, a low-cost shopping hub within its group, but it had been rejected.Bezos and Trump have had a mixed relationship. During Trump’s 2016 campaign, the Amazon founder argued some of Trump’s rhetoric damaged democracy, while Trump said Amazon did not pay enough tax.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scientists have used antibodies from his blood to create the most broadly protective antivenom to date, which could revolutionise the treatment of snake bites.“For a period of nearly 18 years, [Tim] had undertaken hundreds of bites and self-immunisations with escalating doses from 16 species of very lethal snakes that would normally a kill a horse,” said Jacob Glanville, the chief executive of the US biotech Centivax and first author of the research. “It blew my mind. I contacted him because I thought if anyone in the world has these properly neutralising antibodies, it’s him.”The cocktail, which combines two protective antibodies from Friede’s blood and a small molecule venom inhibitor, opens a path towards a universal antivenom, according to researchpublished in the journal Cell. This could transform the ability to treat snake bites, which cause about 140,000 deaths and 300,000 permanent injuries each year.Most antivenoms rely on a 100-year-old method that involves immunising horses or sheep with venom from single snake species and collecting the antibodies produced. While effective, there is a risk of severe adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis, to the non-human antibodies. And treatments tend to be species- and sometimes region-specific.“I grew up in Guatemala and they recommend you try to catch the snake and bring it in in a plastic bag so they can determine if they have an appropriate antivenom,” Glanville said. “It’s not a great option to go chasing after the snake that’s just bitten you.”Friede, aware of the shortcomings of antivenoms and hoping to fortify himself against accidental bites from his collection of pet snakes, embarked on his self-immunisation quest in 2000.Despite spending four days in a coma in 2001 after being bitten while milking an Egyptian cobra, he continued with his meticulous dose escalation programme, injecting low doses of venom from 16 lethal species before offering up his arms to the snakes to bite.When Glanville came across an article about Friede, who had documented his project on his YouTube channel, he got in touch. “He was like: ‘Finally. I’ve been waiting for this call for a long time,’” Glanville said.To design the antivenom, the team selected 19 of the World Health Organization’s category 1 and 2 deadliest species, including coral snakes, mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits. After isolating candidate antibodies from Friede’s blood, they tested these out in mice envenomated from each species. This allowed them to identify just two antibodies that, when combined with a synthetic antivenom, provided complete protection against 13 of the species and partial protection against the others.“By the time we reached three components, we had a dramatically unparalleled breadth of full protection for 13 of the 19 species and then partial protection for the remaining that we looked at,” Glanville said.He said Friede’s meticulous dosing schedule, which involved cyclical exposure to different venoms, meant that any antibodies that offered broader protection were boosted more frequently and were amplified by his immune system.“Had I, as an immunologist, spent a bunch of time thinking about it, I don’t think I would have come up with a better solution,” he said.Snakes fall into four major families, two of which – elapids and vipers – account for the dangerous venomous species. The current research focused on elapids, but Friede also immunised himself against viper bites and the team are developing an equivalent antivenom cocktail for the viper family.The team are now looking to test the efficacy of the antivenom in the field, initially in dogs brought to veterinary clinics for snake bites in Australia, before moving to human trials.Prof Nicholas Casewell, the director of the Centre for Snakebite Research at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, who was not involved in the research, said: “This breadth of protective benefit is certainly novel, and provides a strong piece of evidence that combining relatively few antibodies and or drugs together is feasible as a therapeutic strategy and could lead to a future therapy that could be beneficial to snakebite patients in many different parts of the world. There is no doubt that this work moves the field forwards in an exciting direction.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

Four other firmshavesuedto block Trump’s orders, which restricted their business over the president’s claims that they had “weaponized” the legal system against him or his allies.One of the ex-Skadden lawyers, Rachel Cohen, said there is a need for attorneys “willing to stand up to the government when it oversteps”.Two other lawyers are also joining the new firm from Winston & Strawn.Lowell is representing the New York attorney general, Letitia James, after theTrump administrationreferred her to the justice department for allegedly falsifying real estate records. James has denied the allegations.The new firm said it was also representing clients fighting the cancellation of grant funding by the so-called “department of government efficiency” and the federal government.Lowell represented Hunter Biden, former president Joe Biden’s son, against criminal gun and tax changes before he waspardonedin December.

As the play celebrates its 20th anniversary, past performers explain its strange appealAnya RyanFri 2 May 2025 08.00 EDTShareThe standard routine in theatre goes something like this: an actor is cast in a play; they read, learn and rehearse it; and then, at last, they perform it to an audience, who will hopefully soak up their hard work. But forTim Crouch, one of the industry’s chief experimenters, this exercise began to feel reductive. “A lot of actor training is about holding focus within the stage and putting the audience into a receiving role,” says Crouch. “I used to go to pubs and bitch about it.”An Oak Tree– his 2005 play that is now seen as a landmark work – was born directly from these frustrations. The script, which is written to be performed by Crouch and a new actor each night, celebrates its changeability. “It is a finished piece, but it contains an unfinished element,” Crouch says. An Oak Tree’s story concerns a meeting between two men: a father who has lost his 12-year-old daughter in a car crash (played by the actor), and the person behind the wheel (played by Crouch). The one basic requirement is that the actor arrives at the theatre oblivious. They must have never seen the play, nor read the script, and be willing to stand on stage with no idea what will happen over the course of the evening. Frances McDormand, Peter Dinklage, Mike Myers and David Harewood are some of the many names to have played Crouch’s unwitting castmate over the years.One of the play’s early performers wasToby Jones, who “rocked up” at the Brighton festival run of the show in 2006. “Tim said you don’t need to know anything; come on stage, it will all become clear,” Jones laughs. Part of the appeal for him was the opportunity to “go on a journey with Tim” and lean into the unexpected. “In a way, it is about submission of control … it is very moving; there’s quite a lot to take in”.Susan Wokoma, who performed in An Oak Tree at Rada in London in 2018, was similarly excited by the play’s uncharted territory. “When I started acting as a kid, there was so much ensemble work, and it was about trust,” she says. “Then you become an actor, and there is absolutely zero risk.” After An Oak Tree finished, Wokoma “missed it immediately because I had to go back to what we’ve decided theatre is. I felt proud that I was part of it – you’re part of the largest company ever”.View image in fullscreenDavid Harewood.Photograph: Tim CrouchNow, 20 years after its conception, Crouch is preparing to celebrate its anniversary with a three-week run at London’sYoung Vic. Actors including David Tennant, Jessie Buckley, Meera Syal and Mark Gatiss are all due to take the second role in Crouch’s ever-evolving drama. As the one constant, Crouch has now performed An Oak Tree 380 times at theatres all across the globe. He keeps a list on his laptop of actors who have joined the play’s ever-growing company. His play, he says, “is like a lizard; it loses its tail and regrows it”.Crouch started his career in the theatre company Public Parts and trained as an actor at the University of Bristol and the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. He branched out into writing with his debut My Arm, a play that uses objects from the audience to a tell a story about a man who holds his arm above his head for 30 years. “I was an unhappy actor and didn’t know what the fuck I was doing,” he says, “[and] I wrote My Arm just for myself”. But the play was a success, and from it grew An Oak Tree. “I wanted to effectively keep doing what I was doing with My Arm – to use an actor’s projection to turn a human into another human.”It was quite unsettling, but Tim has written it so you’re constantly being reassured that however you’re doing it is rightToby JonesNowadays Crouch is considered a master of form. His plays challenge the traditional expectations of theatre. But it’s surprising to learn that An Oak Tree’s narrative came before its structure, with Crouch writing a story about two men meeting up after the death of one of their children. Inspired by a sculpture by Michael Craig Martin, which labels what is clearly a glass of water as an oak tree, the father in the play turns a nearby oak tree into his daughter.In 2005, Crouch, alongside his now-longtime collaborator Andy Smith, wrote a play that “aligned both” form and story. Originally, Crouch wanted the father to be played by a non-actor. “But then it expanded into using a different actor every time,” he says. “The story is about a man who is lost, played by an actor who is lost”. In rehearsals, Smith took the role of the unknowing actor/father. “Kind of like Men in Black, Andy would erase his memory of the previous day’s work,” he says. “He would note me on my tone, clarity, and how enabling my instructions were.” The second character is still called Andy in the published playscript of An Oak Tree.View image in fullscreenRandom factor … Tim Crouch.Photograph: Alex BrennerEventually, Crouch started to “bring in friends” to see how they’d react. “We’d talk to them afterwards and go: ‘How was that for you? Was there anything that was unclear? Where did you feel overwhelmed?’” he says. After two preview runs in Germany, An Oak Tree opened at the now defunct Nightingale theatre in Brighton with Deborah Asante playing the role of the father.Putting the second actor at ease is hugely important to Crouch. He meets them an hour before the show to prepare them for what to expect. “I start by saying they can’t get it wrong, and they can’t get it right,” he says.Taking part in Crouch’s “formal game” was a liberating experience for Jones. “It was quite unsettling, but Tim has written it so you’re constantly being reassured that however you’re doing it, it’s right,” he says. “I remember coming off and thinking the play was just a beautiful idea.” Since then, Jones has encouraged any actor considering signing up for An Oak Tree to do it. “I tell them they’ll be absolutely fine”.Michelle Terry, the actor and artistic director of Shakespeare’s Globe in London, who is on the cast list for the forthcoming Young Vic run, admits that she’s been a fan of Crouch’s work “for ever” and lists off some of her favourite plays that he has written, includingI, Malvolio, I Cinna (The Poet), and Truth’s a Dog Must to Kennel in quick succession. “I think anyone who loves theatre and works in theatre just thinks he’s the best,” she says.The rules of An Oak Tree are followed closely by the actors. Also due to appear at the Young Vic is Game of ThronesactorIndira Varma, who has avoided talking to anyone who has been in the play before. “We’re not allowed,” she laughs. “How do you prepare for something you don’t know anything about? I think I’m just going to go with the flow.”An Oak Tree review – making magic from how we see the worldRead more“It must be exciting for the audience,” she says, “watching someone potentially make a twat of themselves but also maybe succeed.” The only thing that worries Terry is that the script’s font might be too small to read; “otherwise, it is just a beautiful offer to go and just be there”.Now big-name actors queue to perform in An Oak Tree,a play that began its life on the fringes. How does this feel for Crouch, whose work is created in antithesis to the mainstream theatre world where Hollywood Oscar winners dominate? “I would very happily play to university theatres for ever,” says Crouch. “But I think the play is more than that. It has something to say about the bigger structures that operate in theatres.”Clearly, Crouch’s “imperfect” play appeals to the masses. “It took me a long time to have the confidence to call myself a playwright,” he admits. And yet Crouch has new ideas bubbling to the surface. He wants to write more work for children: his twist on A Midsummer Night’s Dream, I, Peaseblossom, is on at the RSC in May. But, never once in 20 years has he been bored by An Oak Tree. “It keeps my brain alive and alert,” he says. “Until theatre changes profoundly, I will keep doing it.”An Oak Tree is at the Young Vic, London, Tuesday to 24May.Explore more on these topicsStageActingYoung VicTim CrouchToby JonesIndira VarmaMichelle TerryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My most valued possession when I was twelve was a Casio GD-8 Car Race watch – a digital timepiece that included a built-in racing game on its tiny monochrome LCD display. Two big buttons on the front let you steer left and right to avoid incoming vehicles and your aim was to stay alive as long as possible. I lost count of the number of times it was confiscated by teachers at my school. I used to lend it to the hardest boys in the year, thereby guaranteeing me protection against bullies. As a socially inept nerd, this was invaluable to my survival. I’m pretty sure I still have the watch somewhere, and my determination to find it has been augmented by a recent discovery: these things are valuable now.Casio started making digital watches in the mid-1970s, using technology it had developed in the calculator market to compete on price, but as the decade drew to a close, the market became saturated and the company started to explore new ways to entice buyers.Speaking to Polygon in 2015, Yuichi Masuda, senior executive managing officer and Casio board member, explained, “Casio went back to its original thinking when it first entered the watch market; that is, ‘a watch is not a mere tool to tell the time.’ We started talking about a multifunction [approach], time display plus other things, such as telephone number memory and music alarms.”View image in fullscreenTaking off … children playing Space Invaders in 1980.Photograph: Eugene Adebari/REX/ShutterstockAt the time, Taito’s arcade game Space Invaders was a phenomenon in Japan. And so in 1981 Casio launched the CA-90/CA-901, a chunky calculator watch that included a sort of space shoot-’em-up but with numbers rather than alien spaceships advancing down the screen. “We wanted to create a new lifestyle of enjoying the game anywhere at any time,” said Masuda.But wasn’t Casio also inspired by Nintendo’s Game & Watch series? After all, this iconic range of handheld electronic games started in 1980 with the juggling and catching sim Ball, and its success led to a vast array of titles, including the famed two-screen Donkey Kong that inspired the Nintendo DS. Shinji Saito, general manager and chief producer at the product planning department of Casio’s timepiece business unit, says not. “In 1980, the year before Casio launched the CA-90, Casio launched the MG-880, a game calculator that allowed users to enjoy digital invaders. Nintendo’s Game & Watch was also launched in 1980,” he says. “In developing the CA-90, Casio utilised the development assets of its MG-880 game calculator, but the starting point for the idea was Casio’s development philosophy of creating a new culture using light, thin, short and low-power technology. We werenotinspired by Nintendo’s Game & Watch.”Indeed, Casio was developing a wide array of innovative features at the time including databanks, thermometers and pulse checkers. “Their entire watch range in the 80s was huge,” says watch enthusiast Andy Bagley. “I have been collecting for years and even now I will still come across a model I haven’t seen before; there were many hundreds. I only recently discovered Casio made a range of touch screen watches in the 80s – way ahead of their time!”View image in fullscreenTimes past … Casio Gaming watch page from Vintage Casio cataloguePhotograph: CasioWhatever the case, the CA-90 was such a success that it inspired a period of rampant creativity in the Casio R&D department. Between 1980 and 1985 the company produced dozens of different game watches – an incredible feat considering the limitations of LCD displays at the time, which couldn’t produce computer graphics or animation and simply relied on matrices of pre-set shapes that would switch on and off to suggest movement. There were several different racing games, there were shoot-’em-ups such as Heli-Fighter and Zoomnzap, and there were very rudimentary platformers including Jungle Star, where you play a Tarzan character leaping out of the way of rampaging panthers, and Hungry Mouse, where you are the mouse leaping over incoming cats.Some were more eccentric. Aero Batics was a stunt flying game, while Hustle Monira had you helping a dinosaur catch falling acorns (as opposed to Egg Panic where you caught … falling eggs). There were even rudimentary football and golf sims. As with Nintendo’s Game & Watch titles they were often merely visual variations on very simple game design concepts. But at the time, they felt like science fiction.Of course, Casio wasn’t the only tech company producing game watches in the 1980s. The US firm Nelsonic managed to get a Nintendo license and made watches with games based on Zelda, Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong, while Seiko had its Alba range of game watches throughout the 1980s, including the catchily named Y822-4000, which featured a baseball sim. The most aesthetically wild were from veteran electronic toy firm Tiger, which spent the spent the early 90s crafting gigantically chunky LCD game watches based on film licenses and arcade games such as Double Dragon and Altered Beast. Eventually however, technology and tastes moved on. After the high profilelaunch of the Game Boy in 1989, Nintendo swiftly cornered the portable gaming market. The game watch era was all but over.Now, there is a thriving collectors’ scene. “They are incredibly sought after and very expensive,” says Bagley. “A downside is that they were actually not that well made in comparison to say the all-stainless-steel Marlins, meaning there are not many survivors, hence rarity is an issue. In perfect condition the rarest, most collectible game watches will fetch many hundreds all the way up to £1,000.” For Bagley and other collectors, these watches are nostalgic treasures, recalling an era when kids were disrupting classes not with social media alerts, but hourly digital watch bleeps, and when one publication was absolutely unmissable: “Anyone like me who liked Casios in the 80s will no doubt remember the Argos catalogue,” he says. “It was my personal reference manual for the latest available models; I eagerly rushed to the watch section every time a new catalogue came out to check out the latest innovations.”The watch industry retains its interest in the classic video game scene. In 2022, Timex launched a limited edition range of Space Invaders watches featuring sounds from the game, and earlier this year Casio produced a similarly limited collection of gorgeous Pac-Man watches, sending old fans like myself scurrying to the pre-order section of its website. If you were a slightly nerdy kid in the 1980s these things were your smartphone, your Apple Watch, your grasp at playground cachet. That’s why I want to find my Car Race watch; it’s not really about the potential monetary value – it’s the one thing that really connects me to my 12-year-old self. For all that’s been lost along the way, we still have games in common.Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While we talked, the instrument sat beside us, like a temporarily silent twin. A few weeks before, though, I’d heard it sing in the Barbican, London, as he swept through Shostakovich’s first cello concerto with the Czech Philharmonic,the piece with which he won BBC Young Musiciannine years ago.It is hard to believe Kanneh-Mason is still only 26: he is touring with some of the best orchestras and conductors in the world, has an MBE, is a visiting professor at the Royal Academy of Music, and, for the two billion people who watched, is the young cellist who played atthe Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s wedding.He is also the most celebrated young Black musician in Britain, famously one of seven talented musical siblings, and was a hugely popular performer at the Last Night of BBC Proms in 2023. But when he appeared onDesert Island Discslast year, he was asked if he thought Rule, Britannia! ought to be part of the festival finale. Quietly, but without hesitation, Kanneh-Mason said: “No.”In his debut book,The Power of Music, he recounts what happened next: “My truthful and understated remark … was greeted with an uproarious wave of censure and horror against me in the media, and an unguarded uprising of racist bile on social media.”View image in fullscreen‘If there are things I am struggling with, practising and playing are always helpful.’ Kanneh-Mason at the Barbican, London, April 2025.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianHe had stumbled on an “ice-hard determination”, he writes – the book is a mix of autobiography and musical manifesto – to preserve a place for a deeply troubling song. Its “vigour and intent were born in Britain’s burgeoning slave trade and at the height of its thundering imperialism”, he writes.His remark let loose a “volcano of racism”. On social media people called for him to be “tagged, flogged and deported” and to “keep [his] n***er mouth shut”. He finds it, he tells me now, “very scary and sad, how angry and aggressive people can be about attacking groups of people”. The tidal wave of hate, he says, was “disproportionate to the intensity of the comment I made. It just came from the heart. I didn’t want to attack anyone with it.”All that, directed towards this gentle, unconfrontational young man. How did he and his family cope, I ask. “I spoke to lots of other musicians who reached out,” he says. “I find practising and playing always helpful. If there are things I am struggling with, that’s the one place I can always be. Exploring something wonderful, beautiful and interesting.” Since we spoke, thePromsprogramme for 2025 has been announced. He is not performing, for the first time since 2017 (pure coincidence, say the BBC and his agent).In The Power of Music, he writes about playing in a way that is so grounded, joyous and straightforward that anyone who has had the good fortune to make music with others – choir, school band, amateur chamber group – will feel his words resonating. In his telling, his upbringing was less of a hothouse environment than one in which music was as much part of life as eating or playing football. He writes of the “energetic conversation and teasing battle” of performing duo sonatas with his eldest sibling, pianist Isata, as if music-making was an extension of the babble round the dinner table. He now flat-shares in London with his brother, violinist Braimah, and their friend Plínio Fernandes, a guitarist – he likes to come home to a busy, sociable household, he says.Practice wasn’t lonely, even though it was done alone, because they were all doing it. “It wasn’t some big project,” he says of the family’s musicianship. “My parents love music, and they loved learning instruments as children, and so they wanted us to also do that. It became clear very quickly that Isata was very into it and enjoyed it, and then the rest of us kind of followed on from that.” He adds: “My parents also like the idea of learning something that you can do endlessly. You can constantly practise and explore and get more from music. And that’s such a universe to give a child.”And yet, they were often the only Black children in the room, or concert hall, or masterclass. It could cut both ways, Kanneh-Mason tells me: at times, it made him “very determined to therefore be on that stage”; at other times it made him feel that he wasn’t sure he could. “But my family, and particularly my parents, were very helpful, either talking to us very honestly or shielding us, depending on what was appropriate,” he says. In The Power of Music, he writes: “The dominant image of a classical musician when I grew up did not look like me. It was difficult to find a projection of who I might be if I became a professional cellist, but the people around me simply refused to admit this was a barrier.” Now, his presence helps to change that for others, and he is actively involved in sharing what he has achieved with a younger generation (when we speak, he is about to travel to Antigua, where he and his siblings support a youth music project, and he has justwritten a children’s bookabout an orchestra).It wasn’t just the family home where music was fostered. I was surprised to learn from the book how important his Nottingham state school was to his and his siblings’ musical formation – after all, he was in London having lessons at the Royal Academy of Music’s Saturday school from a young age. But, he tells me, the school was full of music. He loved playing instruments he wasn’t so advanced on – bass guitar and trumpet – in bands and for shows, and spent time “being part of a bigger musical community, and just sharing ideas … Without that I certainly wouldn’t be the musician I am.”View image in fullscreen‘I wouldn’t be the musician I am without being part of a musical community … sharing ideas’.

He donated his £3,000 prize money from his BBC Young Musician award to keep the school’s cello lessons going. “It’s completely different now, if I’m honest,” he says. He still has one sister at the school, and visited a couple of years ago. “Everything is reduced. It’s really sad to see. It is unrecognisable. And … it’s very difficult, I think, for it to come back.” He passionately argues the case for the arts being available to everyone but, of Arts Council England’s recent policy decisions, he writes: “The idea ofspreading funding outside Londonis laudable if it leads to extra money” but “ransacking excellence at the centre” seems to “go directly against the arts”.Despite this, Kanneh-Mason is, he tells me, “optimistic – just because I am an optimistic person”. Luckily, he says, he has tons of energy. There is so much to do, so much to learn. He relishes the fact that music is mutable, changing, liquid in his hands; the Elgar concerto, for example, is “never fixed in me … a restless, churning, growing thing”. He loves to draw and paint, he says, and takes a sketchbook with him on tour, using it “when other people would take out a book”. But when a drawing is done, it’s done, he says. Music is different. “I like the process of building something that you can’t see and you can’t preserve. And so, you have to constantly keep going further, further.” It is an act of love, of love that lasts a lifetime, and of joy.The Power of Music by Sheku Kanneh-Mason (Penguin Books Ltd, £16.99).

The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.“With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.”It has been more than a decade since the release of Grand Theft Auto V, which has now sold 210m copies, making it the one of the most successful video games of all time alongside Minecraft and Tetris. GTA V was itself delayed several times before its eventual arrival in September 2013.Little has been revealed about GTA VI since the release ofa teaser video in December 2023. The open-world crime thriller is set to take place in the fictional Vice City, GTA’s version of Miami, and its home state of Leonida. The story is expected to follow veteran criminal Lucia as she embarks on an ambitious heist with her male partner.No other information on the GTA VI delay has been given. However, Rockstar’s parent company Take-Two is due to report its financial results on 15 May, when questions from journalists and shareholders will no doubt dominate the session.Explore more on these topicsGamesGrand Theft AutonewsShareReuse this content"

Previtali makes no attempt to emulate Leonardo’s style. In fact this north Italian artist paints in a crisp, realistic way that’s the opposite of Leonardesque. Christ’s round face is very different from the Leonardo Salvator Mundi. His tunic is different, too. Rather than imitating Leonardo, it seems Previtali draws on the same inspirations. The Salvator Mundi icon was invented by Flemish artists in the 15th century. It seems this painting is influenced by those north European paintings. Which leads us to ask – why would an artist as great as Leonardo do the same, and copy Flemish art?National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get intouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterAlberto GiacomettiPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsSculpturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A denim jacket instantly makes a get-up more casual; a blazer, more smart. It can add a practical layer to an otherwise quixotic look or a hint of frivolity to a serious ensemble.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The other thing I love about jackets is that – unless it’s a tailored one you want to fit just-so on the shoulder – you can often be a touch more footloose and fancy-free with fit than you can with other garments. This makes shopping for them a more fun affair than, say, hunting for trousers. It also makes themeasier to source secondhand or online.I’ve tried to include something for everyone in this guide, and searched far and wide in the process: trying on, touching and turning inside out a range of lovely – and some not-so-lovely – jackets. Yet the funnest thing is that an array of jackets can be right for any one person. So, here’s a host that will make you feel smart, studious or ready for a picnic; I hope you discover something that fits the jacket-shaped hole in your wardrobe.Stylish spring jackets for womenBest denim jacketView image in fullscreenBahareh utility denim jacket£119 at AligneDenim jackets and spring go together like salt and vinegar crisps and chocolate. Most people likely have a classic denim jacket by now. So perhaps this season it’s time to add a more unexpected iteration to your roster, whether via cut, colour or an unexpected detail. That doesn’t have to mean rewriting the rulebook: take this collarless but otherwise simple denim jacket from Aligne, a female-led, London-based brand that makes timeless clothes that also somehow feel right for the moment.Best on-trend jacketView image in fullscreenA-line funnel-neck jacket£145 at & Other Stories£145 at AsosIf you want a jacket that will instantly signal that you know your Jil Sander from your Jacquemus, opt for a funnel neck. Call it the Phoebe Philo effect, call it what you like, but this one from & Other Stories is bang on trend, and comes in beige, dark blue and khaki green. The buckle at the neck adds a utilitarian twist, and the oversize fit will allow you to wear a layer – or two – underneath on those spring days that look hot but still feel cold.Best chore jacketView image in fullscreenChore jacket£95 at Community ClothingFrench mechanics and Harry Styles don’t lie:the chore jacket is wildly and widely popular with good reason. It’s an easy style to wear across multiple outfits, plus the number and depth of pockets are a dream. This one from Community Clothing, cut and sewn in Lancashire out of cotton twill, comes in classic light blue, tan, cream, a very pleasing bottle green and several other colours.Finisterre’s take on the chorealso makes a convincing case. All that being said, the best chore jackets don’t just look like the kind of thing Picasso might have worn, but also look old enough that Picasso could have worn them – good news for the planet, as well as your pocket. Etsy, eBay and Depop are full of them – simply search for “chore jacket”. However, if you’d prefer yours to look a little less lived-in, narrow your search by “condition” and opt for those a little less Picasso; fraying and paint-splattered. Find one that’s right for you – whether that’s the classic cobalt blue above, an understatedduck brown,herringboneorlinen.Best light-but-warm jacketView image in fullscreenLapwing insulated jacket£165 at FinisterreIf you’re looking for something cosy but also light and squidgy enough to pack down into a bag when the sun comes out, the Lapwing jacket is just that. Made from recycled materials, it’s insulated but down-free, and also feels lovely to the touch. The dark ochre is particularly nice, and the olive is undemanding.Best barn jacketView image in fullscreenOG Detroit jacket£115 at Huh StoreThe barn jacket has taken fashion firmly by the hand. It was great for autumn, and it’s perfect for spring. The workwear brand Carhartt is the look’s equivalent of a mother ship, making jackets that will last for years, though the high street is also rich with options: you could tryEverlane, or evenWhistles. To my eye, though, this is a jacket that’s best made by a workwear brand, durable enough to last for years and which will only get better with age. Better yet, get one with a bit of patina by buying secondhand – search “barn jacket” on eBay, Depop or Vinted; narrow your search to the likes of Carhartt, LL Bean or Woolrich for something fairly classic; and sift by size/condition.How to buy secondhand clothes online that you’ll actually wear – and the best sites to trawlRead moreBest lightweight parkaView image in fullscreenStormwear cotton-rich canvashooded parka£65 at M&SThe summer of Oasis is nearly upon us – you could call this our Definitely Maybe spring – and parkas are big news again. This M&S iteration has been receiving a lot of love, and rightfully so. It might not scream “mad fer it”, but it’s practical – water-repellent and hooded – as well as a cut above; the ties at the waist make a usually shapeless garment a little more shapely.Best jacket for the weekendView image in fullscreenRepurposed Ikat Kantha jacket£175 at ToastI have known this to be worn as a “house jacket” but, for my two cents, it’s so special that it deserves to be seen. One-of-a-kind, it’s stitched in India in collaboration with two Fairtrade organisations and made out of repurposed cotton saris. The only hitch is that it’s so spectacular you may want to keep the rest of your outfit subdued. It is reversible, though.Best classic jacketView image in fullscreenBouclejacket£99 at John LewisI take plagiarism seriously, but I am nicking this suggestion from my colleague Jess Cartner-Morley, who shouted out the classic Coco Chanel-inspired little boxy jacketin a recent column. As Jess put it: “This is the jacket equivalent of a classic bob haircut: chic, effortless polish, vaguely French.” It’s a boon to any wardrobe and perfect for this time of year.A century of chic: the best Chanel-style jackets to rival the real thingRead moreBest quilted jacketView image in fullscreenMonroe checkquilted jacket£169 at NextBarbour makes good-quality clothes and, while it may be more famous for its wax jackets, this quilted gingham one is worth a look. It might be quilted, but it’s not overly substantial. Beautifully cut and A-line in silhouette, it will fit layers neatly underneath it without feeling claustrophobic. The deep front pockets are a dream – ideal for dog poo bags, snacks or even a thin book.Best light rain jacketView image in fullscreenRain jacket£55.30 at Asos£79 at RainsThe proof’s in the name: this jacket from wet-weather Scandinavian brand Rains is unfussy in style and unfussy in substance, too. Windproof, lightweight and washable, it is also a practical choice and comes in a range of colours – the green is fun, thebutter-yellow “gleam” is of-the-moment andthe sand will suit the season while going with anything.From Scandi brands to plastic-free fabrics: 10 women’s raincoats to style out drizzly daysRead moreBest work jacket AKA blazerView image in fullscreenCotton-linen blazer£189 at ArketBlazers are arguably the most boring type of jacket. Yet they’re also useful, smart and, done right, chic. This is a blazer done right. Made from a blend of cotton and linen, the burgundy colour is more interesting than navy but still wearable, while the cut elevates it beyond the everyday. I take it back: blazers are great.Best shacketView image in fullscreenFjord flannel shirt£66 at Patagonia£71.50 at Cotswold OutdoorI’m reluctant even to type the word “shacket”, but a shirt/jacket is a staple few wardrobes should be without. SinceKate Moss walked the Bottega Veneta catwalk in a plaid shirtin 2022, it also has high fashion’s seal of approval. This one from Patagonia is organic cotton brushed flannel and should keep out a chill on a spring day. You can always size up if you want to wear it over a heavier layer. You can also try other outdoorsy brands, such asCotopaxi,PassengerandAyacucho.Finisterre does a respectable one too– particularly pleasing in sage green.However, the best, and most Kurt Cobain-coded, are plaid rather than plain. I swear by Pendleton wool shirts, and secondhand websites are brimming with them, such asthis design on Depop. Secondhand sites are well stocked beyond Pendleton, too. Be warned, though, that while there are a lot of high-street overshirts in good nick secondhand, most will be heavy on polyester. Heritage brands, such as Woolrich and Pendleton, are likely to offer better-quality fabrics. If you’re after something a little lighter, narrow your search to cotton or flannel. And don’t be afraid to ask sellers about moth holes – these woolly overshirts are a particularly tempting snack.Bestverylight jacketView image in fullscreenHemp-blend shirt-jacket£59.95 at MujiThis jacket from purveyors of Japanese snacks and very nice bedsheets, Muji, is perfect for days when a T-shirt is too little but much more is too much. It’s cleanly cut and made from a breathable mixture of hemp and cotton. The ivory-striped one is stylish if a little see-through; the black one is classic and just as good for the office as for a brunch or even a wedding.Best all-rounderView image in fullscreenOrganic workwear jacket£120 at Colourful StandardClassed as a chore, this jacket from Colourful Standard is available in 23 shades and will leave the purists curling their toes. Yet, with so many pretty colours to choose from, perhaps you’re too preoccupied with the electric ultraviolet one to mind. Excellently made, in Portugal from organic cotton, this is a versatile beast.Explore more on these topicsWomen's coats and jacketsThe FilterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These days, I won’t get a single one of 40 winks if I’m not lying on a decent mattress. Comfy but firm, cosy but breathable, and with loads of cool spots for my feet.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Today’s best mattresses promise all this and more. Gone are the days when your biggest decision was between a sprung double or a sprung king size. Pocket springs are still around, but they face stiff – well, medium firm – competition from hybrid mattresses that combine springs and memory foam to provide that all-important balance of comfort and support.The in-vogue bed brands tend not to have showrooms, so you can’t normally try out their mattresses before you buy. Instead, they vacuum-shrink them in the factory for delivery straight to your door. These bed-in-a-box mattresses come with long trials, but you’re still buying blind. I’ve tried to shed some light on which are the best by trying them out for you.The best bedding brands interior designers use at home, from luxury linen to cool cottonRead moreI, along with a panel of my family members, tested six bestselling bed-in-a-box mattresses. Among them was a pocket sprung model and five hybrids (which combine memory foam with other materials), covering various degrees of firmness, features and price tags. I’ll test more – including at least one all-foam mattress – in the coming months. Meanwhile, here’s how my family got on with our top picks, including the one my dad gave up on and the one my niece didn’t want to give back.At a glanceBest overall mattress:Otty Original HybridFrom £499.99 (single) to £874.99 (emperor) at OttyBest mattress for couples:Simba Hybrid ProFrom £799 (single) to £1,399 (super king) at SimbaBest budget mattress:Ikea ValevågFrom £149 (single) to £359 (super king) at IkeaWhy you should trust meI’ve spent three decades testing products, from mattress toppers toheated clothes airers, so I’m professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to magically improve our lives by buying their stuff. I also have a solid background in napping, insomnia and swearing at alarm clocks, so I welcomed the chance to sleep on the job.How I testedView image in fullscreenBalancing a glass of water on the mattresses tested their motion isolation qualities.Photograph: Jane HoskynFirst, I needed some sleepers. I wanted a broad range of feedback from people of varying sizes who sleep in various positions. I asked my dad (84), my niece (22), my sister and our husbands to join my mattress panel. We each spent at least a fortnight (and sometimes months) sleeping on an allocated mattress.Before we divvied them up, my panel assembled to offer their impressions of every mattress on test. We turned our house into a mattress showroom and invited everyone to sit, bounce and lie down on every test sample, alone and together. This enabled us to compare the mattresses side by side and get an overview of their pros and cons. I collected scores out of 10 for everyone’s assessment of firmness and other factors such as breathability, motion isolation and overall comfort, then worked out our average score for each mattress.We then divided the mattresses and began the sleeping tests. To quantify sleep quality, I used thePittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, which uses a questionnaire to assess factors such as how long it takes to nod off. I used this as the basis and added questions such as whether they felt back pain or woke up in the night. Some of us also used our smartwatches to gather sleep-tracking stats.View image in fullscreenWeights measured any sinking of the mattresses.Photograph: Jane HoskynOther factors were easier to test on my own. I used dumbbell weights to measure how far each mattress sank under various weights, while an infrared thermometer and heat pad revealed how fast they could cool under a warm body. A glass of water on the surface gave an idea of how well the mattress would absorb the movement of a restless partner (“motion isolation”).Environmental credentials were another important consideration. Mattress makers are secretive about the life cycles of their products, but I discovered what I could about the materials used, their manufacture and their potential for recycling. I also checked verified reviews from paying customers and excluded any mattresses for which delivery and customer service received significant negative feedback.Read on for my guide to the best mattresses, based on these thorough tests.The mattresses sourced for this article are being donated to two charities: Southampton-based poverty support groupScratchand Hampshire-based survivors’ advocacy organisationStop Domestic Abuse.To dive deeper in to my testing process, readhow I tested mattresses for comfort, cost and sustainabilityThe best mattresses you can buy in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Wonderfully breathable’: the Ikea Valevåg.Photograph: Jane HoskynBest overall mattress:Otty Original HybridView image in fullscreenFrom £499.99 (single) to £874.99 (emperor) at OttyOtty’s flagship offering is a firm but cosy and supremely comfortable mattress that helped me sleep fantastically from the first night of testing. The only other that managed this was the Simba Hybrid Pro, which is hundreds of pounds more expensive.Why we love itThe Otty has an outstanding balance of support, cushioning and breathability. My husband and I slept on it for two months and were sad to see it go. It feels ergonomically supportive from edge to edge, with no dip in the middle even after several weeks.It’s not too hard for comfort, though. As a small side sleeper, I get lower back pain on very firm mattresses, but this didn’t happen with the Otty. My sleep tracker also revealed that I woke up briefly in the night (“microarousals”) less often than usual. The surface felt breathable and cooled down faster than most other hybrids in my heat-retention tests.When I asked my family to dive in, they put the Otty fourth overall on firmness – squarely at the firm end of the wide medium-firm spectrum – and gave it the highest rating for overall comfort, with an average of 8.3/10.It’s a shame that …the firmness we loved won’t be welcomed by everyone. If you’re upgrading from a well-used pocket-sprung mattress, the strong flat surface of the Otty may take some adapting to.Suitable for:anyone who wants to upgrade to a hybrid without forking out four figuresType:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 8/10Depth:25cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:rotate once a month for first 12 months, then every three monthsTrial period:100 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£40Sustainability credentials:foam is CertiPUR- and Europur-approved for environmental standardsTo find out more, read our fullOtty Original Hybrid mattress reviewBest mattress for couples:Simba Hybrid ProView image in fullscreenFrom £799 (single) to £1,399 (super king) at SimbaThis sumptuous mattress also had me sleeping soundly from the off. It’s expensive, and won’t be firm enough for some, but its wonderfully comfy surface makes you feel like you’re sleeping on a cloud – and it may even bring peace if you share your bed with a fidgety partner (or the dog, or the kids).Why we love itThe medium-firm Simba Hybrid Pro is supportive enough for most people, but it has a cosy, yielding feel that may be down to its upper layer of natural wool. The overall effect is luxurious and decidedly soporific.The Hybrid Pro had the best motion isolation in my test. The mattress doesn’t completely lack bounce, especially on a slatted base, but its foam layers absorb movement so well that it genuinely helped me and my husband sleep through each other’s tossing and turning.Temperature regulation was less impressive, and I wanted to disown my armpits a few times after waking up. The mattress also softened noticeably in the middle after several weeks of testing, but this is common with hybrids and may be welcomed by sleepers who like the way foam adapts to our bodies over time.Our panel’s collective firmness score was 7/10, and our comfort average was an excellent 8.1/10, although my husband and sister found it a bit too soft.It’s a shame that …the price tag is chunky, especially for a mattress that may not maintain its support consistently enough for firm-bed fans.Suitable for:couples who crave a bit of peace (but still want to share a bed)Type:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 7/10Depth:28cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:rotate once a month for first three months, then every three monthsTrial period:200 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£50Sustainability credentials: Simba is B Corp certified and aiming for net zero by 2030.

It’s not a hybrid but instead wraps its pocket springs in slim layers of polyfoam for cushioning. It feels much less robust than its pricier rivals, but it’d be a great choice for the kids or the spare room.Why we love itSimplicity has its benefits. The Valevåg expanded to full size faster than the hybrids and was much lighter. Finally, a mattress I could lift and manoeuvre by myself, including up and down stairs.For similar reasons, Ikea’s mattress is wonderfully breathable and may feel cooler in summer than a hybrid. With no memory foam to trap heat, it cooled down faster than any other mattress in my temperature-control test. Hi-tech open-cell foam is all very well for letting the air circulate, but plain old springs do the same for a lot less cash.My 22-year-old niece, Alex, slept on the Valevåg for two months and was energetically reluctant to give it back. She said it felt supportive enough without being “solid like some of the others”.It’s a shame that …the Valevåg doesn’t hide its cheapness. Our average firmness score was 6.8/10, which barely qualifies for “medium firm” (although Ikea does make a “firm” version). The bounce of the springs also means motion isolation is poor.Suitable for:young buyers starting out, or for a guest roomType:pocket sprungFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 6.8/10Depth:24cmCover:not removableTurn or rotate:not neededTrial period:365 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£40 via theMattress Recycling PeopleSustainability credentials:2025 target of 20% recycled content in all Ikea mattress foamsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

If, like my sister Maeve and her husband, Ben, you crave the strong pushback of a solid mattress, you will love it. Lucky for them, they got to test it for two months.This gigantic, heavy hybrid also delivers outstanding temperature regulation and motion isolation. Maeve and Ben reported that the “silky surface with long dents” kept them cool without feeling cold, and after years on a pocket-sprung mattress, they declared its movement-absorbing powers to be “life changing”.It didn’t make the final cut because …this level of firmness is too hard for many, including me.

It has a solid central section that’s firmer on one side than the other, so you flip it (with a little effort) to select your level of firmness. You then zip on a thick, spongy “comfort layer” – much like a mattress topper – on whichever side you choose.My weight tests and family feedback revealed the two sides to be disappointingly similar. Both were too soft for Maeve and Ben, who slept on this mattress for a fortnight before switching to the much firmer Origin. Their daughter Alex tried it out and also found it too soft, as did my husband.The best sleep aids recommended by experts: from blue light-blockers to apps to help you napRead moreI liked the Wunderflip much more than my family did. Its supportive base layers provide strong, consistent pushback beneath the cushioned top layer, especially when you choose the “firmer” side. The foamy cushioning is brilliant at absorbing movement, and it all feels extremely robust.It didn’t make the final cut because …the “flip for firmness” idea doesn’t really work, because both sides are similarly soft – perhaps because the removable “comfort layer” is so soft. The hulking weight (more than 50kg for a double) makes it tricky to manoeuvre.

Its high-density foam makes it feel very firm at first, but over weeks of testing, it softened significantly without ever feeling saggy.I had allocated the Panda to my dad for the sleep test, but he couldn’t get on with it, describing it as “hard on my joints”. It felt too firm for me at first, too. But this mattress is a great illustration of why you shouldn’t judge memory foam too quickly. It adapted to become a cosy sleeping surface for me and my husband.It didn’t make the final cut because …the softening means it’s hard to judge whether it’s right for you.

Instead of packing a takeaway in a plastic box and whizzing it to your door, companies such as Otty, Eve and Simba shrink their mattresses into metres and metres of plastic and deliver them to your home.Is it necessary? No, but like Deliveroo, it’s convenient. The downside is that you’re left with an awful lot of packaging. I mean, ahideousamount. Your recycling collection may take the huge cardboard boxes, but in most areas (including mine), they won’t take the huge volume of plastic wrapping. You’ll have to take it to a household waste centre – unless you’re redecorating and need a dust sheet.Bed-in-a-box companies don’t have showrooms, so they let you sleep on your new mattress for months before you have to decide whether to keep it. My experience of these trials has been fairly smooth, with Otty and Emma both collecting mattresses and issuing refunds quickly. However, neither team was directly employed by the brands (only Ikea sent a branded van when delivering), and the Emma team didn’t know what they were collecting.No delivery team offered to take away my old mattress. Most brands offer to recycle old mattresses for a fee of about £50, but you have to organise that in addition to ordering your new mattress. It also seems expensive given that my local council’s recycling team collects mattresses for £20.Bed-in-a-box warranties typically cover 10 years. That’s excellent, but you’ll have to be careful you don’t void your guarantee by, for example, standing on the mattress or using an electric blanket (as foam can soften and even crack under too much heat).How do I know it’s a good deal?It’sBlack Fridayall year round in mattress world. Bed-in-a-box companies seem to regard “sale” prices as the rule rather than the exception, andSimba,EmmaandDormeohave all been sanctioned by the ASA for misleading marketing tactics.There are genuine deals to be found, however.

Free appAnytrackeris less quick but delivers richer results, including alerts when your desired mattress meets your desired price.How to clean a mattressHere are a few stats to help you sleep at night: the average mattress contains between 1.5 million and 10 million dust mites, depending on whom you believe. These mites feast on dead skin cells, of which you shed up to 40,000 a minute, and thrive on moisture, of which you leak about a pint a night. “Up to 10% of the weight of an old pillow could be made up of dust mite faeces,” sayresearchers from UCL. Sweet dreams.The war on dust mite poo begins with a good mattress protector and clean sheets, which you should change about once a week. A zip-off washable cover, as featured on many of our best mattresses, including theOtty Original HybridandSimba Hybrid Pro, is another key line of defence against grossness. Just make sure all these covers are fully dry after washing, because the last thing you want to do is get more moisture into the mattress. That will lead to mould – and you really do not want to share your bed withmould spores.With all the covers removed for washing, get out thevacuum cleaner. Vacuum every surface of the mattress, including the bottom if it’s one-sided, and get the nozzle into any nooks and crannies. While you’re at it, rotate the mattress from head to toe to keep it as sag-free as possible, or turn it if it’s two-sided. Now let your mattress air for a while, with an open window if the weather allows. You could even make like the Germans do and hang your duvet out to air for a few hours. Just remember that while fresh air can help dissipate smells, it also lets in allergens, so it’s worth vacuuming your mattress again before you put all the freshly cleaned elements back together again.If there are no stains or spillages on the mattress, that’s as far as you should go. But if there’s been a bed-wetting accident or breakfast-in-bed mishap, use a dry, clean sponge to mop up as much liquid as possible. The aim is to ensure no moisture soaks in. Recent blood, sweat or urine stains can be tackled by dabbing with a little cold water and washing-up liquid (don’t rub; this can spread the stain). Don’t spray carpet cleaner on the mattress because it will damage the fabric, but upholstery cleaner is safe in small doses. If there’s a smell, sprinkle baking soda over the whole surface of the mattress and leave it for several hours, then vacuum it thoroughly.Jane Hoskyn is a freelance consumer journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and “testing” coffee machines while deadlines loom.

It took six people to carry me to an ambulancePaul FifieldFri 2 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 04.40 EDTShareIn the spring of 1995 I was studying for my A-levels in Cambridge, along with my best friend, Kate. For her final art exam, Kate wanted to create a male torso in the style of a classical sculpture, which she would present along with her written assignment on the male nude. She asked if I’d be the model and I, of course, agreed – what teenager wouldn’t be flattered at the prospect of being immortalised as a Greek god?We decided to make the cast in the garden of Kate’s family home. Wearing just my Y-fronts and a pair of Mickey Mouse socks borrowed from Kate’s dad, along with a layer of baby oil, I lay down as Kate finished mixing the fine casting plaster, which she then poured from my neck to my ankles.As it ran into my pants, perhaps I should have been concerned that Kate had used baby oil as a barrier rather than Vaseline or clingfilm, but I was under the impression she had read up on the process and trusted her completely. In retrospect, I suspect she’d tossed the book aside halfway through the preface.As the first layer dried and Kate liberally applied a second I started to feel uncomfortable. It was a warm day, but under the plaster I felt as if I was being cooked. I told Kate, who started working faster, but the discomfort quickly became intolerable. “I want to get out,” I insisted. Kate wiped her hands. “All right,” she said. “You can get out then.” That’s when I realised I was trapped.I was given laughing gas, which at least meant I was able to join in with the general sense of hilarityIt wasn’t just that the plaster had already set hard, but, due to the lack of a barrier, it was also gripping every hair on my body. Even the slightest movement resulted in eye-watering torture, further exacerbated when Kate tried to free me with a hammer and chisel. Next up was boiling water, which failed to penetrate the hard shell and only increased the rate I felt I was broiling at. I fought not to panic, but it was horrible to feel so helpless.My distressed cries attracted the attention of our friend Ed, who happened to be walking past the house. Ed suggested phoning for an ambulance, which we did, but two fire engines turned up as well. One of the firefighters arrived brandishing a camera, and he took a photo of the local fire chief pointing and laughing as Ed helped two of his crew manhandle me out of the garden. In the end, it took six people to carry me down a narrow alleyway to the ambulance – agony, but I was relieved when a plan to winch me over the roof of the house was abandoned.A small crowd greeted me at Addenbrooke’s hospital – more doctors and medical staff than seemed strictly necessary, and more cameras, too. I was given laughing gas, which at least meant I was able to join in with the general sense of hilarity as hospital staff tore the plaster from me in what felt like the most aggressive full-body waxing imaginable – I think at one point they might have used hammers.Afterwards, I was given a gown and a pair of scissors and sent to tidy my most intimate areas in a hospital toilet, which led to some startled responses from other patients who walked in on me. By then, I really didn’t care.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The mood was celebratory, but at one point the delayed stress of the day’s events overwhelmed me briefly and I had a little cry. A neighbour passed on the story to the local paper, and from there it quickly got picked up by the national media, with many stories featuring the photo taken by the firefighters.Back then, I wanted to be an actor, and I’d had a tiny speaking part in Absolutely Fabulous that I perhaps overstated when speaking to journalists. As a result, reports went out with headlines like Absolutely Plastered and Badly Cast.I appeared with Kate on Channel 4’s The Big Breakfast, where one of Antony Gormley’s assistants gave her advice, and a US production company even filmed a re-enactment – assuming Cambridge was too obscure for an American audience, they showed me being pushed across Trafalgar Square in a wheelbarrow.Nowadays, I play guitar in aband, and there’s been talk of perhaps restaging the misadventure again for one of our music videos, if Kate’s up for it. We have remained friends – Kate went to the Slade School of Fine Art in London, and is now an establishedillustrator, so next time I  shouldn’t have to remind her to use clingfilm.As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

David Beckham first played for Chingford-based youth team the Ridgeway Rovers, where he was coached by his dad, Ted. Back then, he didn’t make the England schoolboys squad because he wasn’t burly enough – his father subsequently employing the somewhat nauseating tactic of feeding his son Guinness with raw eggs to gain weight. On the other hand, it did mean he could be a match mascot atManchester United, his dad’s passion, at the age of 11, because he was still so cute and shrimpy.1986View image in fullscreenIf the greatest burden a child must bear is the unlived life of the parent, well, not in football, chum; the parent can simply teach the child how to live out that dream, by doing a shed-ton of keepy-uppies in the garden. Ted was a Tiger Dad (that is, a keen disciplinarian invested in their child’s success), while Beckham’s mother, Sandra, worked longsufferingly, though ineffectively, to draw the line between parental ambition and child labour. That’s the picture that came out of the 2023 Netflix documentary, anyway.View image in fullscreenIn 1986, a young Beckham (pictured left) appears on the Thames Television showDaytime, hosted by Sarah Kennedy.1990View image in fullscreenBe careful what you wish for, is the bit Jung didn’t say. Playing for the Red Devils was the dream, and by the time Beckham won the under-15 player of the year award at the Brimsdown Rovers (an Enfield club he was playing for), he’d already signed schoolboy forms with Manchester United. On paper, the Beckham family, and its patriarch in particular, should have been happy for the rest of time. Not so much. Ted and Sandra split in 2002. Writing in his 2005 book, David Beckham: My Son, Ted said: “All the hype, all the stress, all the attention – it wasn’t a world we were used to and it was very tough … We just drifted apart.”1995View image in fullscreenFootballers in the 90s weren’t meant to be good-looking. You could get away with it if you were French (like Thierry Henry), or if you were French and you looked like you didn’t mind if your nose got broken (like Eric Cantona), but not if you were simply boyband gorgeous. Blame it on the pervasive, though dwindling, homophobia of the era: if you were too handsome, grown men couldn’t love you as hard and as vocally as they might wish, when you did a good thing playing football. Three people changed all that, and none of them were Posh Spice. There was Beckham himself, who just couldn’t help it; plus David Baddiel and Frank Skinner, who sprayed unabashed love all over the place in their TV series Fantasy Football League.1996View image in fullscreenBeckham was part of United’s hyper-talented class of 92, in the youth team with Nicky Butt,Ryan Giggs,Gary Neville,Phil NevilleandPaul Scholes, all of whom Alex Ferguson took a punt on (they were also known as “Fergie’s Fledglings”). There have been reams written about Ferguson, his moods, relationships, inner workings and whatnot, but pre-Posh, it does seem pretty open and shut; he was happy when they won and angry when they didn’t. It turns out they’d end up winning a lot – such as this victory in the 1996 FA Cup final against Liverpool.1997View image in fullscreenIt was the month of May. Tony Blair had just won the election, football was the emblematic pastime to unify a newly classless nation, and Beckham was the natural repository for all our optimism. He was young, pretty, industrious, wholesome; the poster boy for the new Cool Britannia. So why does he look like such a dork? Well, dur, it’s because he hasn’t yet met Victoria.View image in fullscreenBeckham’s Brylcreem campaign was his first big money-maker outside football – he got a reported £4m for the effort, which generated a sort of fascinated ill will towards both him and the modish hair styling product. Would the brand be adversely affected by the footballer’s footballing? Were they upset when he got a buzzcut? Was anybody really worth £4m for doing anything? Was he trivialising his personal brand by the association, and furthermore, was it definitely Posh’s fault? Ah, happy days, when “selling your soul” was still a thing, and we had the bandwidth to worry about it.View image in fullscreenA louche Beckham relaxes after anEnglandfootball training session at Bisham Abbey in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.1998View image in fullscreenThe breakdown in relations between Beckham and Ferguson did seem to be related to the match scores a lot of the time – but to keep the rest of us interested, there was a constant hum of things that the manager didn’t like about the growing legend of Posh and Becks. Ferguson didn’t like Posh’s fame eclipsing Becks’s, or even existing; he didn’t like the chemical reaction they made, where as a unit they were an entirely different and more powerful element; he didn’t like that Becks kept his phone on in case Victoria called; he didn’t like it when they went on honeymoon. Long story short, their engagement was a bad day for Ferguson and, by extension, the patriarchy.View image in fullscreenSince the pairing of John and Yoko – and some might accurately say, since the dawn of time – it has not been possible for a popular man and woman to be romantically involved without incurring the accusation that the female party is influencing him in some nefarious and underhand way. Beckham donning a sarong was taken as incontrovertible proof that Posh had somehow managed to steal him from the world of men, by witchcraft. It is absolutely impossible to overestimate how upset people were by sarong-gate, particularly the tabloid media. The Sun ran the pic with the headline: “Beckham has got his Posh frock on.”View image in fullscreenIn a moment ofmadness, Beckhamreceived a red cardinEngland’s 1998 World Cup match against Argentina,forkickingDiego Simeone. (Argentina would go on to win the game 4-3 on penalties.)1999View image in fullscreenDavid and Victoria’s wedding took place in Luttrellstown Castle in Dublin, Ireland. The theme was Robin Hood, though none of the £750,000 they spent on it seemed to end up with any poor people, and the guests were asked to wear black and white, so as not to clash with the purple-clad couple. Arguably, though, there is no colour that wouldn’t clash with this shade. Prince Philip said later that the reason thrones were eschewed for Queen Elizabeth’s 2012 diamond jubilee celebration was that they’d have “looked like Mr and Mrs Beckham”.Heshould be so lucky.View image in fullscreenEvery 90s kid remembersTopps Premier Leaguefootball sticker books – and thisclassic-era Beckham sticker was essential to any collection.View image in fullscreenDavid and Victoria arrive in matching leather suits to aVersaceparty in London.2000View image in fullscreenBaby Brooklyn, born four months before the wedding, was another source of tension for Beckham’s Manchester career, as he once missed something or other to look after his child, his wife being away on business. There was no end of sniffiness about Beckham’s fatherly tenderness, which was seen by many in the 00s as even worse than wearing a sarong.View image in fullscreenIn a consummate display of early 00s fashion, David and Victoria attend Capital FM’sParty in the Park for the Prince’s Trust.2001View image in fullscreenBy now, Becks was in a kind of philosophical, Schrödinger’s cat situation – everything he did got a lot of attention, so did it follow that his every action wasforattention? How could you ever judge the authenticity of the private self when society had made it its mission to invade that privacy? Into this quagmire came the buzzcut: after 10 years with their own public profile, his tresses vanished, replaced by a harder, or certainly balder, look. James Clarke, a Manchester paparazzo, said later: “When David Beckham shaved his head, I honestly thought a member of my family had died. Because my phone went off … The panic in people’s voices …”View image in fullscreenDavid and Victoriawalk the red carpet at the second annualNRJMusic Awards in Cannes, 2001.View image in fullscreenBeckham became a pariah after his red card in the match against Argentina, for a sin so grievous (the aforementioned lashing out at Diego Simeone) that even people who made it their business not to care agreed that it was utterly shocking. Fast forward to England nearly exiting the World Cup qualifiers in a game against Greece, only to be rescued by Beckham’s barnstorming last-minute free kick. His redemption was immediate and emotional.2002View image in fullscreenBeckham always looks as if he’s wearing the thing that originally cost a million quid, then got 70% knocked off it because no one else would be seen dead in it. Which is to say, extremely high fashion – just high in the sense of off your tits. His taste is a mystery. When, in the same year, he became the first footballer ever to appear on the cover of the gay lifestyle magazine Attitude, it was not as a style icon that they celebrated him, but rather as an LBGTQ+ ally, which is objectively a bigger deal.View image in fullscreenBeckham was England captain for six years from 2000. In that time, they won some matches, such as this one against Denmark – but they never won quite as many as people were expecting, and this was sometimes pinned on footballers with too much cash becoming petulant. Beckham is certainly first among equals in that respect (petulance notwithstanding), as he’s minted: he and Victoria now have a combined net worth of around £450m.View image in fullscreenBeckham and six-year-old Kirsty Howardhand thejubileebaton to Queen Elizabeth IIafter its final leg around the City Of Manchester Stadium, at the opening of the 2002 Commonwealth Games.View image in fullscreenA very 00sdisplay of frosted tips, from a gamebetweenManchester United andWestBromwich Albion.View image in fullscreenBeckham launching a new rangeof sunglasses for the Police brand, in London.2003View image in fullscreenWhen Beckham published his first memoir, My Side, in 2003, he described everything – his childhood, his love of football, his love of his wife, his children, his love of hard work – in such anodyne terms thatTerry Eagleton, reviewing it, said “the man runs the gamut of emotions, from chuffed to gutted”.View image in fullscreenBeckham sporting a small scar above his eye during Manchester United’s Champions League group game against Juventus in February 2003.View image in fullscreen…no sign of the injuryat the MTVmovieawards in Los Angeles, a few monthslater.2004View image in fullscreenA resplendent Beckham in a leather tunic, in a still from Pepsi’s gladiator-themed ad (which also starredFrancesco TottiandRaúl).View image in fullscreenA cleaned-up Beckham attends the launch of the Pepsi advert in Madrid.View image in fullscreenWhy would a man so physically perfect that he would be paid millions to wear some sunnies or drink a drink, so athletic that the whole world watches, frozen, to see what his body will do next, choose to deface himself? Is he experiencing his perfection as a burden? It’s easy to read too much into tattoos when you don’t understand them.2006View image in fullscreenBeckham’s transfer to Real Madrid – the club he left Manchester United for in 2003 – was vexed. It happened very fast. Posh wouldn’t go with him, supposedly because she had to find schools for Brooklyn and Romeo, but the rumour was that she thought Spain smelled of garlic. Then that alleged affair happened with Rebecca Loos. Perhaps this look, displayed towards the end of Beckham’s time in Spain, shows just how lost he was. A cardigan with a horse on it. No longer English, definitely not Spanish. A citizen of nowhere.2009View image in fullscreenIn retrospect, you can see the pure artistry of the Posh and Becks brand-building: the evolution, the agility, the canniness. Part of the reason the alleged Loos affair so transfixed the media was that it made this perfect union look like a lie. The couple let the dust settle, for ages, then roared back, revamped and reconnected.View image in fullscreenBeckham after England’s World Cup qualifier against Belarus at Wembley in 2009.2010View image in fullscreenBecks and Prince Harry had a proper bromance, which you can tell immediately from the look on William’s face here, the buttoned-up vibe of him wondering, “Why does this guy like my brother better than me?”. The relationship fell apart in 2020, when Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, reportedly suspected Posh of leaking stories about her to the press, a kind of farce-replayed-as-more-farce of the Wagatha Christie case.

How much money does he want?” (partly with big-ticket gestures like giving his Paris Saint-Germain salary to charity). So journalists were able to cut to the chase – was that his real butt in the H&M shoot? Did he have a packet double? “No,” he told a French journalist, “I can say the crotch is mine and the backside is mine as well,” he said. “I can confirm that’s my bum.”2013View image in fullscreenBeckham shows off a host of Chinese script tattoos at Peking university inBeijing, while touring the country as an ambassador for the Chinese Super League.2015View image in fullscreenTom Bower’s 2024 book, The House of Beckham, painted a rather snide portrait of the marriage, in which Beckham is constantly surrounded by lovelies, and Victoria is in a constant huff about it. But this image of a devoted spouse who is willing to sit with his children at a fashion show, at least one of whom is visibly ready to expire from boredom, while sitting next to Anna Wintour, tells a completely different story.2017View image in fullscreenBecks hits the big screen, with a minor role in Guy Ritchie’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.2018View image in fullscreenThe Beckhams attend the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.View image in fullscreenIf the first decade of Posh and Becks’s brand-building was defined by protecting the asset – which is to say, not saying very much and letting the sponsored content do the talking – their respective social media followings (he has 88 million followers on Instagram, she has 33 million) gradually created a more direct relationship with the public, through which Beckham could show his true self.

Unlike the slings and arrows of outrageous football, there aren’t many possibilities for split-second redemption in the world of moral principles. Yet, if he could redeem himself with one shot – a proud, lifelong gay icon, defiantly posing in his undies, we’ve been through this – it would be this one, in Hugo Boss’s Boss One bodywear.Explore more on these topicsDavid BeckhamVictoria BeckhamManchester UnitedEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tucked away on a sidestreet near the port, the menu is short and the atmosphere relaxed. The young owners, Nicolas and Hugo, are best friends and their passion for fresh seafood, especially sea urchins and oysters, simply radiates. If you’re after fancy, go to one of the exclusive beach clubs dotted along the coastline. If you want fresh, vibrant and delicious platters of seafood served with charm and glasses of ice-cold white wine, come here.Melanie ClarksonThe perfect country bistro in BeaujolaisView image in fullscreenThe countryside near Saint-Amour-Bellevue.Photograph: Connect Images/AlamyJoséphine à Table, in the pretty village of Saint-Amour-Bellevue in Beaujolais, is the little country bistro you were always hoping to find in rural France. Hearty portions of rusticcuisinepaysanneare the order of the day, or you could push the boat out and splurge on a sophisticated chicken invinjaunesauce with morels. And don’t forget to wash your meal down with a bottle of the local wine – there are plenty of cuvées to choose from on the extensive list, all priced unbelievably reasonably. A set main course and dessert is €24.Santé.Natasha HughesMenu magnifique, MarseilleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: CharlotteRipaille (onInstagram) – a bistro on Rue de Lorette just north of the Old Port – was the unexpected gem of our time in Marseille. Tucked down a street awash with the city’s characteristic street art, diners sit at snug Formica tables drinking delicious natural wines. There’s a soft glow and the hum of a local crowd having a good time. We had everything off the chalkboard menu between four. Highlights were radicchio with stilton, pear and hazelnuts; scallops in smoked lemon; grilled dorade with almond sauce; and desserts generous on the cream. The staff were brilliant: cool yet attentive.CharlottePork sausage and pike parfait, ParisA visit toLes Mauvais Garçonsoff the Rue de Rivoli in the Marais would be worth it for the name, which it shares with the street it’s on, but more so for its Lyonnais fare. After regaling ourselves with pork sausage in a sublime brioche, we moved on to the more serious work of enjoying the pike dumpling in an exotic lobster bisque. You can complete your trip down south by indulging in a fondant au chocolat that would make Baudelaire himself feel decadent. The excellent service belies the restaurant’s name.PatriciaAmazing value in BrittanyView image in fullscreenQuiberon in Brittany.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyPort-Haliguen is a quaint fishing village close to the beautiful town of Quiberon in Brittany. Here we foundLa Base, a bistro overlooking the harbour. The chef lets ingredients shine with minimal fuss, such as the freshest sardines to start, then a perfectly cooked medium rare côte de boeuf for two, while the chocolate mousse is velvety smooth and comforting. The impressive house red is served at only €4 a glass and bottles at about €20. The idyllic setting, precise cooking and amazing value made this a real highlight of the holiday.James AllisonLobster ravioli in the DordogneLa Récréationin the beautiful Lot department village ofLes Arquesjust south of the Dordogne is a fabulous restaurant. It is housed in what was once the village school and has plenty of outdoor seating for the summer months. The food is sublime and simply never disappoints. Lobster ravioli in a coral sauce and croustillants de Saint-Jacques are delicious signature dishes, but the experienced chefs are innovative and the menu changes frequently. The village itself is associated with the renowned 20th-century sculptor and painterOssip Zadkineand attracts artists. La Récréation is a very popular restaurant, which must be booked in advance and is wholly deserving of its reputation locally.LesleyProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

The owner was so welcoming and a great host. They were very accommodating when our group of eight arrived for lunch and were happy to shuffle tables so we could all sit together. Our children enjoyed the cheese and beef galettes with a lovely salad. The adults enjoyed a split galette, which included wild mushroom, spices and cheese on one half and garlic, aubergine and cheese on the other – it tasted fantastic. All were homemade and used local ingredients. A very tasty cider accompanied the food. The homemade cheesecake was just delicious. All at a reasonable price.Stefanie AshallPick your poissonnerie, Dinard, BrittanyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mick GeorgeLe Pic à Bulot(The Whelk Pick) in Dinard is the perfect place for a seafood platter. In the Saint-Énogat neighbourhood, the restaurant serves fresh fish and seafood from its ownpoissonnerienext door. We visited in early April, sat on the terrace, well wrapped up, and shared an iced platter of prawns, langoustines, whelks, oysters and, in a blast from the past for me, winkles. All helped on by a bottle of head-turning Pouilly-Fuissé (it was our wedding anniversary). It’s definitely worth a detour if you’re visiting Mont Saint-Michel or arrived at Saint-Malo, and is reasonable with set menus starting at €15.Mick GeorgeMarket cooking with a heart, BordeauxIn the gritty Capucins market quarter, Au Bistrot delivers straightforward French comfort food for hungry market shoppers. Chef Jacques In’On cooks whatever looks best on the stalls that morning in a small open kitchen, while the host, François Pervillé, pours affordable bottles from an all‑Bordeaux list. My lunch: slow beef bourguignon, deep and savoury, plus a creamy garlic‑laced potato dauphinoise. The room is tiled and the staff are relaxed and quietly efficient. Menus change daily but rarely break €25. Decent wine by the glass costs €4. Book ahead or queue. Outdoor tables spill on to pavement when the sun shines.PamelaWinning tip: A humble gem in Boulogne, Pas-de-CalaisView image in fullscreenA dish at Le Chatillon in BoulogneNestled in the industrial fishing port in Boulogne-sur-Mer isLe Chatillon. Business hours of 5.30am-4.30pm make it a staple breakfast location for fishers. Nevertheless, the average family on an average budget can eat well at this humble gem of a place, served by friendly, efficient and professional staff, and that feels like the definition of hospitality. Theboulonnaiseplate – smoked salmon, fillet of herring, smoked mackerel and toast – is a great place to start, and fillet of boneless turbot with triple cooked fries, while simple, was like nothing I’ve tasted before or since.Ruth KingView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsFrance holidaysReaders' travel tipsFood and drinkTop 10sEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you have the room to grow it, purple sprouting broccoli started from seed now will grow through the summer, stand in the ground overwinter and be poised for picking by early next spring.It’s a busy time in the veg patch, but it’s well worth finding an hour or so between all the planting and weeding to sow some purple sprouting broccoli seeds so that you’ve got crops to harvest in the leaner months.You can sow into modular trays or small pots if, like me, you can feel overwhelmed by early summer and leave seedlings to languish. As my veg patch is on the small side, my emerging broccoli plants can expect to dwell in containers for the next few months, until there’s space for them in the ground, and that often means I pot them up multiple times before they are put in their final position. If you have more room than me, your young plants can go into the ground once they’ve developed a few sets of leaves and are around 10cm tall, which will be about four to six weeks after they germinate. With these lengthening days and warmer temperatures, growth may be even more rapid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Generous watering is essential, tooClay, silty or sandy? Testing your soil type is an essential part of becoming a good gardenerRead moreMature purple sprouting broccoli plants can get pretty large and need adequate space to grow – so leave at least 50cm of space between each one when planting out. It’s a plant that needs to grow in a sunny spot in fertile soil in order to thrive, so add compost to the planting hole and consider feeding with nettle feed to give them a boost of that all-important nitrogen. Generous watering is essential, too. Once fully grown, they can become unwieldy, so putting a stake in the ground by each stalk and tying securely will keep them supported.As with most brassicas, purple sprouting broccoli needs to be protected from cabbage white butterflies, which lay their little yellow eggs on the underside of the leaves (the resulting caterpillars can destroy a crop). Keep your plants covered with insect-proof mesh, securely pinned to the ground. This should keep them out while also deterring pigeons, which like to peck the leaves.Once nearing your harvest date (the exact time will depend on the variety), keep an eye out for the first floret to appear in the centre of the plant. You should pinch this out – and eat it! – to prompt the plant to produce lots of side shoots for you to harvest. I either use a harvest knife or simply snap the spears with my hands, and then eat them as soon as possible.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensVegetablesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In blue are the Coalition opposition, whose promising start in this five-week election campaignseems to have unravelled.The finalGuardian Essential pollhas 32% of voters giving their first preference to Labor, with 34% to the Coalition.But once preferences are distributed, that would put Labor ahead of the Coalition on 52.1% to 47.9%. Depending on where the swings are, that is likely to put Labor in minority government but potentially in majority government, a position consistent withother published pollstracked throughout the campaign.View image in fullscreenThe opposition leader, Peter Dutton, meets young local people during a visit to Agfest in Lyons, Tasmania.Photograph: Dan Peled/Getty ImagesThe Greens will be in the scrum on Saturday, as they strive to win a balance of power if neither Labor nor theCoalitionwins outright.

They have competing housing policies for first home buyers,both of whicheconomists predict will increase already bloated house prices. Labor has relentlessly promoted its health policies, primarily to halt the decline in GP practices offering consultations free at the point of access, thoughdoctors’ groups and others have expressed scepticism.Who should I vote for? What are the key Labor, Coalition and Greens party policies in the 2025 Australian federal election?Read moreThe biggest policy differences between the major parties, arguably, are in energy generation.Both say they are committed to net zero emissions by 2050. Labor has legislated a 2030 target and says it will get to net zero by 2050 through increasing its share of renewables and phasing out coal. The Coalition is threatening tounwind Laborclimate measures, and sticking to a much-criticised plan tostart a nuclear power industry from scratchthat the Climate Change Authority warned would prevent net zero by 2050.One of the most unpredictable factors in the 2025 election campaign has been Trump. The trade war couldpummel the economy, cuts to foreign aid are causingpotentially deadly chaosin the region, and Trump’s re-election has re-invigorated culture wars in Australia.Dutton, a former police officer from Queensland, has long had a “hardman” image, although heperiodically tries to shake it. Trump’s election gave many on the right succour, and Dutton started echoing some of the US president’s policies.He appointed anElon Musk-sounding shadow ministerfor government efficiency, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, who said a Dutton government would “make Australia great again”.

His comments came aftera neo-Nazi heckledan elder during ceremonies on Anzac Day, when Australia commemorates its war dead.Dutton says he is relying on the “quiet Australians” to deliver him victory. Some in the opposition say their internal polling puts them in a better position than the published surveys do.They may be right.

Many of them are ageing and starting to need care themselves. It is an act of love and duty – but it can be precariousSusan CheneryFri 2 May 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 11.02 EDTShareDon Campbell and his wife, Marjorie, energetically travelled the world together. “We’ve had wonderful times” he says. They had season tickets to the symphony and opera – until illness intervened. “We’ve always done lots of theatre and music.” But the “lots and lots of memories” are fading now for Marjorie.She has rheumatoid arthritis and was diagnosed with dementia two-and-a-half years ago. Now she will ask him up to five times a day “what have we got to do today?” It requires, he says, “a huge amount of patience”. Her mobility is failing, she is losing her balance, she has frightening falls, soon she will be in a wheelchair. But no matter what happens from here Don is adamant: “She is not going into care, she is going to be looked after at home by me.”View image in fullscreenDon and Marjorie Campbell on their wedding day 15 years ago.Photograph: Dean Sewell/The GuardianAbout to turn 80, Don has been caring for Marjorie for the past eight years. Without family help he does the housework, the cooking and showers her. If he has to go anywhere, “she comes too”. This is love, the real thing. “She’s just my special friend, the love of my life, my soul mate. It is just something so special that I can never, ever not love her. I could never, ever not care for her.”Campbell is one of 3 million unpaid carers in Australia who are providing care worth about $78bn, according to 2020 figures. They provide a vital lifeline for their ailing family member. But, how precarious these relationships can be was borne out in the death of actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, in Santa Fe and David Lodge and his carer father, Peter, in the UK; both cases in which a carer died, leaving their loved one alone, and ultimately to die, soon after. What happens in those caring homes when something catastrophic happens to the carer?Many carers don’t even know they are carers. Barbra Williams, Dementia Australia’s director of client services, says research has shown “that there are many hidden carers who don’t know what services and support is available to them”. They are just doing what they have always done, looking after their family.View image in fullscreenDon is adamant about Marjorie: ‘She is not going into care, she is going to be looked after at home by me.’Photograph: Dean Sewell/The Guardian“For older carers they just assume it is their role” says Dr Mel Mylek of the University of Canberra and lead researcher onCarersAustralia’s Carer Wellbeing Survey. “They just need to care for their husband because he is getting older or their wife because she is getting frail.” And they are doing it 24/7, without holidays, days off or any respite.Often they are in a perilous situation as their own health starts to deteriorate.If anything happens to me with my health, what happens to my wife?Don CampbellDon knows he needs to look after himself but it is difficult. “I don’t ever have me time. I now neglect the things that I really enjoy.” At the moment he is in good shape, “I’ve still sort of got energy to do things”. But he gets anxious when Marjorie is “looking really, really not well. She has problems with her breathing, there have been a few times when I thought I was going to lose her.”His biggest concern, the constant underlying worry is, “If anything happens to me with my health, what happens to my wife?”In the UK, Peter Lodge was a dedicated full-time carer for his son, David, who had a range of complex health conditions which left him blind and unable to talk. He used a Lightwriter to communicate. When Peter died suddenly, David was left helpless on his own, unable to call for help. They were there for seven days in the winter cold before David’s sister discovered them lying together on the floor. Found with pneumonia and severe dehydration, David died 13 hours later.View image in fullscreenGene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa in November 1989.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyWhen Betsy Arakawa died suddenly, Gene Hackman was left on his own in their home in a state of advanced Alzheimer’s disease. He died a week later of heart disease. By the time their bodies were discovered they were mummified.‘They never get to retire’It is “very” isolating, says Campbell, who admits he sometimes goes and sits in a corner and cries.After the dementia diagnosis he stopped hearing from friends of many years. Emails and phone calls went unanswered. “They just don’t want to be watching this decline happen,” he says matter of factly.“Roughly 50% of people caring with someone with dementia are caring alone,” Williams says.View image in fullscreenMarjorie Campbell has rheumatoid arthritis and was diagnosed with dementia two-and-a-half years ago.Photograph: Dean Sewell/The GuardianTwenty-five per cent of dementia carers have been caring for more than 10 years. “That can take a huge toll on someone when it has been that long,” Williams says.Mylek’s research for the 2024 Carers Wellbeing Survey found that carers need to be cared for too. They have higher than average rates of psychological distress, are more than twice as likely to have low levels of wellbeing and are significantly likely to experience loneliness. They can also be worried about money. “The older carer has to continue caring, but they often don’t have money to help them as they themselves need support.”I keep telling people I know where the red line is, but I don’t know that I doJohn Dressler, 80, carerThere is no happy ending for Campbell or any family carer. “You’re watching someone slowly die,” Campbell says.“There is a big emotional and cognitive load on carers” says Annabel Reid, the chief executive of Carers Australia. “It is very distressing to have someone you love change who no longer recognises you and is not be able to speak. We need to do more to support carers. They are really doing a community service and they themselves are paying the price.”Older carers, Reid says, “may be losing mobility and need to lift the person they are caring for or help them downstairs or manoeuvre a wheelchair. These things get more challenging as people get older. They never get to retire.”Carers Australia is underfunded, she says, for supports like respite. “Which is care for someone so a carer can take a break. They have their own medical emergency to attend to. What would you do? If you are in a rural area there is just no one to help.”Love and dutyIn 2019 Penny Dressler was still skiing and going to the gym. Now because of Alzheimer’s she can’t do anything for herself. “She just sits in wheelchair” says her husband, John, 80. A self-funded retiree, Dressler can afford to have carers come in. He will keep Penny at home “until I am unable to do it. I keep telling people I know where the red line is, but I don’t know that I do. I am doing it because I want to do it.” He says he doesn’t want to visit her in a nursing home. “How long can I be in one little boxed room with her before I go nuts? I visit other people who are in a care home and I leave the place emotionally drained.”At home, he can talk to her.“When I wake up in the morning I’ve still got somebody in the room with me, I know she’s there.”View image in fullscreenDon and Marjorie Campbell at home in Raymond Terrace.Photograph: Dean Sewell/The GuardianDressler, who admits to being a grumpy old man, says the worst thing people can say to him is “I know what you’re going through. You’ve got no bloody idea.”While Dementia Australia has a range of services, including a 24-hour call line, Barbra Williams says: “We always say to carers, if you are unwell what happens then? You need to put in plans so that if something happens to you things can continue while you are recovering. Early planning is really important, before anything happens. Hopefully before dementia has progressed that way the person with dementia can have some input into the planning as well. And you have to prioritise your own wellbeing.”Some carers feel that it really gives their lives purposeAnnabel Reid, CEO, Carers AustraliaWhile carers reported to the Carers Wellbeing Survey that they were exhausted and burned out, Reid says “some carers feel powerfully motivated to look after someone, usually out of love but it can also be a sense of duty or responsibility. And some carers feel that it really gives their lives purpose.”It is an experience that crosses over all barriers: age, class, fame, country.Former US chatshow host Jay Leno is one who has spoken openly about the purpose and difficulty caring adds to his life. Leno chooses to mostly care for his wife of 45 years, Mavis, who has advanced dementia, himself. “It’s a challenge” he says “having to feed her, change her, carry her to the bathroom. It’s not that I enjoy doing it but I guess I enjoy doing it.“I like taking care of her. I like that I am needed. That’s really what love is.”Explore more on these topicsCarersFamilyHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Armed with tractors, beach owners flatten every imperfection from the sand, dragging it to sift out anything large enough to be considered waste. As the sun rises, tourists flood the coastline, often unaware of what lies hidden beneath their feet.View image in fullscreenIn Puglia, southern Italy, beach tourism is damaging turtle populations during hatching season.Photograph: Reda/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesTwo feet below the surface, delicate eggs laid by loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) are waiting to hatch. For the turtles, the beach is not a beauty spot but a habitat.As sand groomers have been transforming beaches from vital habitats into backdrops for photoshoots, their work has had an enormous impact on the turtle population. “Occupation of the beach by private owners reduces a vital living space for the turtle,” says Salvatore Urso, a naturalist and co-founder ofCaretta Calabria Conservation, who has been monitoring and protecting loggerhead turtle nests since 2005. “There is still not much sensitivity to coexisting with this species.”Tractors not only crush or displace eggs – their mere presence can scare away female turtles, preventing them from nesting.As tourismsurges in the region, the nests are protected by a handful of committed experts and volunteers. Piero Carlino is director of the Sea Turtle Recovery Centre in Calimera, where staff dedicate their summers to rescuing turtle eggs. They monitor the beaches on foot and with drones to spot nests, and when a nest is identified, volunteers place a fence around it to protect it during incubation. Later, they provide support during hatching, helping to guide the turtles towards the sea. “People look at our dedication and think we’re crazy,” says Carlino.The sand groomers versus the turtles is one of a series of conflicts between wildlife and tourists seeking picture-perfect locations that scientists and activists say are playing out around the Mediterranean as the holiday season looms.View image in fullscreenTourists pack the beach in Scala di Furno, Porto Cesareo, Salento, Italy on 21 August 2023.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesAcross southern Europe, tourists driven by Instagram and TikTok are taking to remote areas in greater numbers, threatening local environments and biodiversity. Visitors to the region account for abouta third of all the world’s tourists, or about330 million people in 2024– and areforecast to reach500m by 2030.Tourist expectations have been moulded to a new standard ... at the expense of local ecosystems and peopleAs a criterion for holiday choice, “Instagrammability” is here to stay, according toa poll by travel booking agency eDreams, where 59% of French people aged between 25 and 34 said they chose their holiday destination because of it. The2023 Experiences Traveler, a report based on a survey of 4,000 travellers across Europe and the US, concluded that Instagram was now the most influential platform for tourists planning activities and trips.On the Greek island of Naxos, in the Cyclades, local campaigner Eleni Andrianopulu expresses her worries over coffee. Tourist expectations, she argues, have been moulded to a new standard: the picture-perfect beach, villa and view – many of which are groomed and manicured at the expense of local ecosystems and people. “We, the people, and the place are just a decoration,” says Andrianopulu.View image in fullscreenSun, sea and the perfect Instagram shot: the bay of Torre dell’Orso in Salento, Puglia.Photograph: Ragemax/AlamyIn some regions, the ecological concerns are mixed with broader anger about the social consequences of overtourism, and grassroots movements are springing up in opposition. On Naxos and its Cyclades neighbour Paros, Andrianopulu and Nicolas Stephanou formed part of the international “beach towel revolt” movement in 2023, protesting against the privatisation of beaches. Paros and Naxos are some of the driest islands in Greece and their unique culture comes from a “minimalist” way of life engendered by scarcity, Stephanou says. The over-construction of modern hotel complexes, “totally contrasts with the Cycladic identity”.View image in fullscreenGreeks protest for free access on Marcello and Krios beaches on Paros island, Greece, July 2023.Photograph: ReutersThe growth of construction can require wetlands to be drained and soil tarmacked over. This limits the freshwater available to the185 million migratory birdsfor whom the Cyclades are a vital stopover. According to the WWF, in the Mediterranean basin the populations of wetland-dependent species havedeclined by 81% in the past 50 years.Across the Mediterranean, local and national governments are wrestling with the ecological and social effects of overtourism. Some, such asthe Ciés islands off Galicia, have instituted caps on tourist numbers. Others have introduced fees, such asVenice, where tourists have to pay €5-€10 (£4.25-£8.50) to enter the city,or “visitor zones” and assigned time-slotsto keep numbers in check. Elsewhere, authorities are experimenting with social media campaigns to reset tourist expectations of what they can photograph and experience.View image in fullscreenA placard reads ‘To reserve is to preserve’ on a path in Calanques national park, giving information on a reservation system to limit visitors.Photograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Calanques national park in south-eastFranceis famous for its azure waters, where visitors can plunge in from rocky shores. The best view can be found from the clifftop. To immortalise it, some unscrupulous visitors go beyond the trails or park their car on the rocks, trampling endangered flora such as the endemic astragale plant.The park receivesthree million visitors a year, and the high footfall has damaged trails around the creeks: rocks have been polished by the soles of endless shoes, and the soil eroded to expose the roots of Mediterranean pines. In response, authorities have launched a “demarketing” campaign on Instagram. The national park authority’s Instagram page now features images of volunteer clean-ups and instructions on how to behave rather than enticing images of the park. “We want to display the fragility of the park,” says Zacharie Bruyas, communication director of the park.View image in fullscreenThe influx of visitors to Calanques national park in south-east France is causing damage to its protected flora and fauna.Photograph: Andia/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesIn 2022, the authorities decided to limit access to some creeks to 400 visitors a day. The first results of the restrictions appear tentatively promising, according to Bruyas. “There are some plantlets that are growing,” he says, though adds “we remain cautious, nature needs time”. Hervé Menchon, the deputy coastline ecologist in Marseille, says the restrictions will continue for five more years, “so that we won’t be forced to make it a sanctuary”.Over time, the approach to social media in Calanques national park could become more common across the Mediterranean, with pictures of azure waters swapped for less glamorous shots of litter pickers. “This mission of protection is essential,” says Menchon. “The next generations won’t be tourists!”Some beach owners, such as Damiano Reale at Vivosa Apulia resort in Marina di Ugento, on the Ionian coast, are taking steps to protect sea turtle nests on their properties. Every morning, Reale and his team check if any eggs have been laid, and avoid using tractors and strong lights at night, which could disorient the turtles. If nests are found, they fence them off and monitor them 24/7 when it’s time for the hatchlings to emerge.“It is important to make tourists, politicians and researchers understand that a smart balance between commercial use of a beach and appreciation – whether of its history or its natural events – is absolutely possible,” says Reale.View image in fullscreenA loggerhead turtle nesting site is fenced off on Torvaianica beach, near Rome, Italy.Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersPuglia’s director of the coastal state property and assets, Costanza Moreo, said in a statement that the region was “committed to protecting the nesting ofCaretta carettasea turtles”, had issued an ordinance that it was “forbidden to carry out activities that may endanger the nesting and hatching of eggs of protected species” and that beach cleaning should be done in a way that does not disturb nests.However, scientists say these orders are not well enforced, and are only applied to known nests - leaving it possible for hidden nests and breeding grounds to be damaged.InGreece, Andrianopulu says they have successfully campaigned for a ban on vehicles being used for beach grooming this year. “It is a big success that the machines that were there for years to flatten the beach will not be working this year … my only concern is that the progress we’re making is too slow in comparison to the massive and rapid destruction.”This piece is being published in conjunction with the online magazineMagmaFind moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentThe age of extinctionReptilesWildlifeOvertourismEuropeItalyGreecefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But in the aftermath it has raised a common question for governments across the continent: could the same happen here?Europe’s political leaders and energy system operators have given assurances that such blackouts are extraordinarily rare, and that European power grids are some of the most stable in the world.Yet energy experts have warned that although wide-scale blackouts may be rare, no grid is infallible. Prof Jianzhong Wu, the head of the school of engineering at Cardiff University, told the Guardian blackouts “can happen anywhere”.“Despite today’s high standards of reliability, low-probability but high-impact blackout events can still happen. These networks are not designed to be completely blackout-free because achieving such a level of reliability would require investment far beyond what is economically feasible,” he said.Charmalee Jayamaha, a senior manager at the UK government-backed Energy Systems Catapult, said: “No system can be 100% resilient,” so risks “need to be balanced with our willingness to pay to reduce them”.If no power system is bulletproof, then what are the risks that could trigger a catastrophic blackout in any country? Here we look atthe top reasonsa power system might collapse.Why did Spain and Portugal go dark? – podcastRead more‘Hand of God’Major power system collapses are frequently due to factors that are difficult to foresee or control.Extreme weather events and natural disasters present a clear risk because storms, heatwaves and earthquakes can lead to devastating damage to critical national infrastructure. Lightning strikes and solar flares have also been known to damage vital equipment such as substations and power lines, which are crucial to maintaining the stability of the grid.Early reports suggested that Spain’s blackout had been caused by a “rare atmospheric phenomenon” due to a sudden change in temperature, which may have destabilised the grid. But the grid operator, Red Eléctrica, later dismissed the theory.Most outages due to natural disasters are easier to identify. In the US state of Texas, a series of three winter storms in early 2021 caused windfarms and gas power plants to freeze over, leaving 4.5m homes and businesses without power, some for several days.The risk of these events is on the rise as the climate crisis increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events.Human-made mayhemSome blackouts are entirely human-made. Jayamaha said geopolitical factors and cyber-attacks had the potential to cause “major interruptions” to the grid. Human error could also play a role.After the Iberian blackoutmany questionedwhether malevolent state actors had taken aim at the grid. However, Red Eléctrica was quick to insist there was no sign of an attack and later ruled the theory out.Still, the risk of a cyber-attack on power grid infrastructure is “not science fiction”, according to the Dutch cybersecurity expert Dave Maasland. He told the Dutch press that “attacks on power supplies are possible and have already caused disruptions in the past”. He pointed to Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s power system in 2015 and 2016, and a failed attempt after its invasion in 2022.Grid glitchesIn the most simple terms, a blackout is caused when the power system stops working: this can be due to an unexpected mechanical glitch involving power lines, substations or other grid infrastructure – or a more complex problem with how the system runs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Without a clear explanation for the outage it is too soon to comment, experts have said.What we know so far is that Spain’s electricity system suffered two major generation losses in the solar-rich south-west of the country within seconds, which may have destabilised the grid connection between Spain and France, and ultimately led to a full loss of power across the energy system. The initial triggerremains under investigation.It is true that a renewables-rich grid is more difficult to run than one powered by fossil fuels. This is because the grid was originally designed with big coal, gas and nuclear power plants in mind. These plants feature spinning turbines that create inertia on the system, which helps to maintain the grid’s frequency at about 50Hz. Wind and solar farms do not create inertia on the grid, meaning that at times of high renewables output it can be more difficult to keep the frequency steady if there is a sudden loss of power. A significant fluctuation in frequency can cause generators to automatically disconnect, leading to a collapse of the system.Jayamaha said the shift to renewables would require grid companies to invest in grid-stabilising technologies. “The electricity grid is undergoing unprecedented change as we reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and move to solutions that are cheaper, better, and cleaner. This creates different resilience challenges that need to be managed,” she said.“Resilience is no longer just about having enough spare megawatts you can simply switch on – but about the right mix of technologies and system capabilities to operate a grid with a lot more renewables.”Kate Mulvany, a principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said that in the UK, a key part of that effort had been the development of new balancing and system management tools, “particularly the integration of grid-scale batteries, which play a vital role in maintaining stability”.“The electricity system in GB is among the most reliable in the world. So, while a major blackout will always be possible, the extensive safeguards in place make it extremely unlikely,” she said.Blackouts tip Spain and Portugal into darkness – in picturesRead more‘Black swan’ eventIn many cases, the risk factors outlined above can coincide, meaning relatively common or innocuous events can compound to create a cascading failure that leads to catastrophe. These “black swan” events are nearly impossible to anticipate – meaning grid operators are under pressure to prepare for the unexpected.In August 2019 the UK suffered its biggest blackout in over a decade, leaving almost 1 million people in England and Wales without electricity and hundreds of people stuck on trains for up to nine hours.The blackout occurred after a lightning strike hit a transmission circuit north of London and managed to cause two electricity generators more than 100 miles apart to trip off the system within seconds of each other. It was described as an “extremely rare and unexpected event” by the energy system operator.Lightning strikes on energy infrastructure are relatively common, as are power plant outages, but the impact of the large double-outage on the grid’s stability was severe enough to cause scores of small generators and batteries using incorrect safety settings to trip off the system and make it impossible for the operator to avoid a loss of power.No single element in the event would cause a large-scale blackout on its own, but the combination proved devastating.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industrySpainPortugalFranceExtreme weatherRenewable energyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Kennedy has “an important position” overseeing health and human services agencies, Taylor said. “RFK Jr needs to recant his remarks, kill the [autism] registry, and actually sit down with autistic folks like myself and better understand us.”RFK Jr needs to recant his remarks, kill the registry, and sit down with autistic folks like myselfSeth Taylor, 34Nearly 200 people got in touch with the Guardian to express their concerns about the health secretary’s comments and the ways critical research and support services are being dismantled.They also highlighted the ways autism shapes their identities and their lives.Taylor was first diagnosed with autism as a non-speaking two-year-old. His world “opened up thanks to early diagnosis, therapy, and a mom who saw my brain not as a defect, but as something different and beautiful”, he said.“My autism drives my hyperfocus and advocacy, proving neurodiversity is a strength and not a tragedy, as RFK Jr suggests … [and] showing autistic people belong in leadership.Autismisn’t a barrier. It’s part of who I am, and I wouldn’t trade it for the world,” he said.When Kennedy blames families for introducing “environmental toxins” despite autism being overwhelmingly caused by genetics, Taylor said, it perpetuates stigma about the condition. The search for a “cure” distracts from the “real needs” of autistic people like services, support, accommodations and dignity in schools, workplaces and communities.Kennedy’s rhetoric “would almost be laughable, if it weren’t so dangerous”, said Leanne Maskell, 32, an autism and ADHD coach, trainer and author in London.“Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition impacting the brain’s structure. It’s like having a different operating system, like Google vs Apple – not something to fix,” she said.Jeremy, 36, is a trucker in Illinois.

He said he wishes Kennedy understood the condition he rails against.“I find his conclusions about a condition I doubt he’s done any real research about insulting,” Jeremy said. “To act like my entire immediate family is part of an epidemic is infuriating and terrifying.”To act like my entire immediate family is part of an epidemic is infuriating and terrifyingJeremy, 36Jeremy and his wife worry about the database of autistic people being compiled, and fear it could be used to send people to work camps, as Kennedy hasproposeddoing for people who take legal and illegal medications.A sweeping autism database drawing on personal data “risksHipaaviolations and echoes eugenics”, Taylor said. “Autistic people need support, not surveillance.”Some individuals and parents are now wondering if getting a diagnosis is worth the risks of being tracked in the database or facing greater scrutiny and discrimination.Jeff*, 43, a cybersecurity consultant in Wisconsin, had an appointment to be tested for autism in May. “I canceled the appointment upon hearing of RFK Jr’s plans,” he said. “I don’t want my probable diagnosis to be on a government registry, where it may come back to haunt me.”For some, getting a diagnosis is required to qualify for some supportive services.One of Roxie Riemann’s children, Ellowyn, has an official diagnosis and is considered disabled by the state.“For her to even get any sort of help, they get to label her, and it’s unfortunate – but she gets physical therapy and speech therapy because of it, and we’ve met some really interesting people who love my kid as much as I do,” said Riemann, a parent in Birmingham, Alabama.“The kids aren’t broken. My three-and-a-half-year-old, she can’t write a poem, but she adds to the poem of my life. The idea that people are reduced to whether or not they’ll pay taxes – that’s what contributes to society? Not someone’s joy or the impressions that they give, all the things that can’t be checked on a balance sheet?”My three-and-a-half-year-old, she can’t write a poem, but she adds to the poem of my lifeRoxie Riemann in Birmingham, AlabamaKennedy has also said autism rates have exploded in recent decades, claiming that when he was a child, very few people were diagnosed.But scores of people told the Guardian they were only diagnosed as adults, because of reduced stigma, changes in how ASD is diagnosed, and more knowledge among the public about what autism is.Elizabeth*, 77, a retired teacher in Oregon, was only diagnosed at the age of 75 after a series of YouTube videos made her understand the issues she had dealt with her whole life.“Since I was diagnosed as autistic, I am still re-evaluating my life through a different lens,” she said. “I have a master’s degree. I have had a couple of successful careers and have a comfortable retirement income. I raised two successful children and have a gentleman friend. And I always paid my taxes.”Brian, 70, a retired teacher, educator and librarian in Massachusetts, was also formally diagnosed later in life, in his 50s. He endured highly invasive procedures as a baby, including having holes drilled into his head to “relieve the pressure” and stop “seizures”, since his behaviors were believed to be related to epilepsy.“As it turned out, my brain was just trying to find its way,” Brian said.While autism spectrum disorders are now being diagnosed at higher rates, they are stillunderdiagnosed.“It is difficult to be diagnosed with ASD as an adult in Alabama. Even kids can be on a waiting list for years,” said Bryan McClelland, 35, who lives in Birmingham and is married to Riemann.He and his children “are individuals, like others, in a misunderstanding world trying to survive”, McClelland said. “Saying publicly without evidence that autism is something preventable detracts from the reality that we already exist and probably always have. It removes our rightful place amongst humanity and makes us a problem that needs solving.”Saying publicly without evidence that autism is something preventable detracts from the reality that we already existBryan McClelland in Birmingham, AlabamaSome of those who support Kennedy interpreted his references to an “environmental toxin” as a code for vaccines.Kat, 42, in Illinois, gave up a corporate career to care for her son, Ian, who has autism. Now, she helps support other families with autism.Ian was developmentally delayed from a young age, and diagnosed with autism before his third birthday. He is non-speaking, but learning to use a device to communicate.“I don’t need a new son. I got a good one,” she said. “We wouldn’t want to take his autism from him, even if that is possible, which it is not. What we want is more support.”Kat wants Ian to have more options for support – good options that offer him choices, just like anyone else.“We need well-trained and thoroughly vetted professionals to work with him. He needs safe and supported small-group living situations when he is an adult. He needs job training, and job openings, and he needs to be able to keep his earned money without being punished by the government for making a (hopefully) living wage. We need understanding from insurance companies, medical professionals, and the general public.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsRobert F Kennedy JrAutismChildrenHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Vought wrote a chapter for Project 2025 about consolidating power in the executive branch and advances a theory that allows the president to withhold funds from agencies, even if Congress has allocated them. Consolidating power, in part through firing a supposed “deep state” and hiring loyalists, is a major plank of the project – and of Trump’s first 100 days.Trump tried, repeatedly, todistance himselffromthe project, led by the conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation, on the campaign trail after the left used it as shorthand for the dismantling of government that would take place if he won. Since he’s taken office, the illusion that his ideas were drastically different from the project has fallen.Trump 100 days: tariffs, egg prices, Ice arrests and approval rating – in chartsRead more“The whole distancing themselves fromProject 2025may have pulled some voters,” said Manisha Sinha, a history professor at the University of Connecticut, but “my sense is that they’re going to try and push all the items within Project 2025 as much as they can.”Many of Trump’s moves in his first 100 days comedirectlyfrom Project 2025, which involved more than 100 conservative organizations and represented a sort of consensus among the Trumpist right about what he should do in a second term. In some instances, he has gone beyond the project’s suggestions. And in other cases, because the project was written in 2023, subsequent policy ideas from the Heritage Foundation have shaped his actions and goals.For instance, the project predated Elon Musk’s outsized role in the election and then in the Trump administration, but the goal to slash government programs using the so-called “department of government efficiency” fits the spirit of the project. It also predates the war in Gaza and the crackdown on speech in the US in the name of antisemitism, but Heritage’sProject Estherlaid out a strategy to crack down on civil society groups that support Palestinian rights.Trump’s campaign once said people associated with the project wouldn’t get jobs in his administration. Instead, severalhold prominent roles, in some cases now carrying out the plans they wrote about in the project.He chosePeter Navarroas a trade adviser; Navarro wrote a chapter for the project that advocates for increased tariffs and a restructuring of US trade, which Trump is now working on. His press secretary,Karoline Leavitt, appeared in training videos for Project 2025. Brendan Carr, Trump’s nominee to chair the Federal Communications Commission, wrote the chapter on the FCC.The former director of the project, Paul Dans,stepped downfrom his role amid concerns that the project was derailing Trump’s re-election effort. Danstold Politicoin March that Trump’s second term was “actually way beyond my wildest dreams”.“What we had hoped would happen has happened. So I can’t imagine how anything could end really any better,” Dans said.Will Dobbs-Allsopp, policy director of Governing for Impact, and James Goodwin, policy director at the Center for Progressive Reform, havepublicly trackedthe executive actions suggested for 20 different agencies in Project 2025 as Trump has carried some of them out. Of the 532 proposals in the project that fall under these actions, Trump has already proposed, attempted or completed 153 of them – about 29%.The belief that Trump was not fully prepared, and the broader conservative ecosystem was not aligned completely with his agenda, underpinned his first term. For his second term, conservative donors put major money into efforts to get the right on the same page and to come up with plans and personnel who would stand ready to implement these plans immediately if Trump won.Readers give their verdict on Trump’s 100 days: ‘Extraordinary destruction’Read moreWhile thinktanks often seek to influence policymakers, the project stands out for its focus on Trump.“Really, it was written for Trump or Trumpism,” Goodwin said. “There really was an audience of one in mind … Trump had as much gravitational pull on Project 2025 as Project 2025 hopes to have on Trump. It’s just a very unusual thinktank-policymaker relationship.”Where Trump has used the projectThe threads of Project 2025 are visible across the federal government in Trump’s second term.He is in the process of firing people disloyal to the Trump agenda, a first step in creating a government more beholden to him. An executive order signed in April called for tens of thousands more roles being listed as political appointments rather than career civil servants, a move Project 2025 promoted as a way to drive out the kinds of people who stood in the way of success in his first term.Project 2025called fordismantling the Department of Education, which would require congressional action. Trumpsigned an executive ordercalling on the education secretary to start the dismantling process by shutting down major parts of the department’s work.The project wanted to scale back the US Agency for International Development. Trump axed it.“Libs are realizing that Project 2025 was the watered down version of this White House action plan,” Tyler Bowyer, a leader with conservative youth group Turning Point,saidon X in early February.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump has weaponized the department to achieve his goals and to go after his enemies.In nearly all agency recommendations, the project suggested scrapping any diversity efforts. Trump ended diversity, equity and inclusion programs government-wide. He has taken actions to prohibit transgender people in sports and in the military and limited access to gender-affirming care, which aligns with ideas in the project that seek to reinforce binary genders.The project recommended a host of ways to deport undocumented immigrants, end visa programs for people to come to the US legally, and restrict border crossings – a key part of Trump’s first 100 days, though the project didn’t suggest using the Alien Enemies Act, as Trump has, or going after birthright citizenship.Trumpsignedan executive order that would make states carry more of a burden for disaster relief, another ideasuggestedby Project 2025, which also said withholding disaster funds was one way to enforce immigration laws.The FCC, now led by a Project 2025 author appointed by Trump, is investigating National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System and will potentially defund them, which Carr wrote about in the project.What could happen nextThe first wave of Project 2025-aligned actions has been conducted largely by executive orders. A second wave of recommendations requires the rulemaking process at agencies and others would require congressional action.Tracking Trump – everything that’s happened in the president’s first 100 daysRead more“They’re only just now starting their kind of policy, deregulatory effort, rescinding regulations in earnest. They haven’t even really gotten there yet. They’ve been so focused on agency operations and personnel for the past few months,” Dobbs-Allsopp said. “We would expect that at six months or a year, they will be even further along.”Sinha predicted that the full-scale dismantling of the administrative state, if successful, could bring the US “back to the era of tainted meat and lead in hot water”.Project 2025 represented the extreme version of what the Republican party has been selling since the Nixon and Reagan years, she said. It mixes the anti-government rhetoric with demonizing immigrants, poor people and people of color. “The Republicans have trafficked on this for a very long time,” she said.“The people who hate government basically are running government,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationProject 2025Donald TrumpUS politicsUS domestic policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In their first interview for two decades, the original lineup talk about their hopes and fears for rock’s ultimate gigFri 2 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 06.23 EDTShareOn a video call from his home in Los Angeles, Ozzy Osbourne is struggling to recall the exact details of recent years, ones he calls “the worst of my life”. “How many surgeries have I had?” he wonders aloud. “I’ve got more fucking metal in me than a scrap merchants.”The trouble began in earnest in early 2019, when he was midway through what his wife and manager Sharon had firmly told him was his farewell tour. For one thing, both of them had been working constantly since their teens; for another, Ozzy had been diagnosed with a form of Parkinson’s disease, after years of insisting an intermittent numbness in one of his legs was the result of a drinking binge (or rather its aftermath, during which he says he didn’t move for two days). The tour was going well, but then he caught pneumonia, twice. “And then I had an infection. I’m still on antibiotics to be honest with you, I had a thing put in the vein in my arm to feed in IV shots of them.” Six years later, “I’ve still got it on – it comes out this week, with a bit of luck. Antibiotics knock the hell out of you.”View image in fullscreenBlack Sabbath in the Wye valley, August 1977.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlamyThe European dates of the tour were postponed to give him time to recover. Then, in February 2019, “I went to the bathroom in the night, I didn’t put the light on. I thought I knew where the bed was. I was stupid, I dived and there weren’t a bed there. I landed straight on my face. I felt my neck go crunch. I went: ‘Sharon! Call an ambulance!’ She said, ‘Where the hell are you? Get into bed!’ I said: ‘Sharon, don’t ask questions.’ I thought I was going to be paralysed.”The fall had “pushed out of whack” existing damage to his neck vertebrae from a2003 quad bike accident. In intensive care, he was told that if he didn’t have an operation, he would be left paraplegic, but the operation itself was, Ozzy says, “the worst fucking surgery you can imagine. I should have got a second opinion, but you think surgeons know what the fuck they’re doing.”I’d take painkillers recreationally – they’re very addictive. I’d whack my arm with a lump of wood to get a bottle of themOzzy OsbourneTwo metal plates were put in either side of his spine, but the screws became loose, creating bone fragments and lesions. “They haven’t figured out the damage, it’s so intricate,” Sharon says. Another surgeon was found, who slowly removed all the metal. “Five operations later, it just fucked his body. It was torturous for him: Parkinson’s and damage to his spine. It’s just been horrendous.”Incredibly, Ozzy continued to work. He released two acclaimed albums,2020’s Ordinary Manand 2022’sPatient Number 9; guested alongside Travis Scott on Post Malone’s multi-platinum singleTake What You Want; and managed to make an appearance at the 2022 Commonwealth Games closing ceremony in Birmingham, performing Paranoid alongside his Black Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi, with a bracket supporting his back. More incredible still, he says he did it all without the aid of pain medication. “Not anything,” Ozzy says. “And I could have gone ballistic on the medical cabinet. I’ve been on that road before – I used to take painkillers recreationally, they’re very addictive. I’d whack my arm with a fucking lump of wood to get a bottle of them. I mean, there’s so many bent doctors over here [in LA], and I was their best friend.”View image in fullscreenOzzy and Tony Iommi during the band’s US tour, 1978.Photograph: Richard E Aaron/RedfernsNevertheless, he says, he was horribly depressed after his surgery: at his lowest, he was in so much discomfort that he prayed to die in his sleep. “You wake up the next morning and find that something else has gone wrong. You begin to think this is never going to end. Sharon could see that I was in Doom Town, and she says to me, ‘I’ve got an idea.’ It was something to give me a reason to get up in the morning.” He laughs. “I thought: oh, fucking hell, she’s got an idea. Here we go.”Sharon’s idea was to stage a farewell show, for charity, in Ozzy’s home town of Birmingham, featuring not just a reformation of the original lineup ofBlack Sabbath, but a litany of artists they influenced. It says something about the respect the band are held in, about the sheer length of the shadow Sabbath cast over hard rock that, as Ozzy characteristically puts it, “everyone and their fucking mate started jumping on board”.The lineup for the gig is genuinely extraordinary: Metallica, Guns N’ Roses, Slayer, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Anthrax, Mastodon, Tool; members of Judas Priest, Limp Bizkit, Smashing Pumpkins, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Megadeth, Van Halen, Ghost and Faith No More. Moreover, the bill appears to be growing all the time: when I speak to Sharon, she informs me that Soundgarden and Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler are the latest additions. The show’s musical director, Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave guitarist Tom Morello, says, “There’s some pretty great surprises that are not posted anywhere.” It’s hard to argue with Morello’s assessment that the gig, called Back to the Beginning, might represent “the greatest day in the history of heavy metal”. Equally, it seems fraught with potential issues.The Beatles were my thing, they were everything to me. When I met Paul McCartney, it was like seeing GodOzzy OsbourneFirst of all, it involved reconvening the four original members of Black Sabbath. The quartet formed in 1968. It’s almost impossible to overstate the impact of the music they made between then and Ozzy Osbourne’s initial departure from the band in 1979: there’s a chance metal, grunge and the rest might have come into existence without their cocktail of sludgy downtuned riffs, overpowering volume and bleak lyrics delivered in Osbourne’s despairing wail – the sound, as Morello puts it, of “the no-hope working class driving a stake through the heart of the flower power generation” – but it’s very difficult to picture what it might have sounded like.“The Beatles were my thing, they were everything to me,” Ozzy says when the subject of Sabbath’s influence comes up. “When I met Paul McCartney it was like seeing God. I was telling a guy about it one day. His kid was with him, and he said to me, ‘You know what you said to that guy about meeting Paul McCartney? That’s what I felt like when I met you.’ I was like, ‘You what?’ You never think about it.”He describes the frequently turbulent relationship between the band’s four original members as “like a marriage: you have a row with the wife, but then you make up again”. Certainly, said marriage appears to have been going through a particularly rocky patch since the four last played together, 20 years ago. Ozzy says part of the appeal of a final reunion was the involvement of drummer Bill Ward, who had declined to take part in Black Sabbath’s last album,2013’s 13, or the ensuing farewell tour. Depending on whose story you believe, Ward was either unfit to perform live, or unable to secure a proper contract: either way, a public slanging match ensued. Meanwhile, bassist Geezer Butler – who had been openly critical of what he calls “the politics behind the making” of 13 – says he “hadn’t spoken to Ozzy since the last Sabbath show in 2017, mainly because his wife and my wife had fallen out over God knows what”.Sabbath’s enmities were apparently remedied with a series of phone calls and texts. Ward and Ozzy were already back in touch – the pair reconnected when Ozzy fell ill – while Ozzy thinks “religious” Aston Villa fan Butler might have been swayed by the fact the gig is taking place at Villa Park – “My first thought was: that’ll make Geezer fucking happier.”Iommi says he was the member who took the most convincing. “I’m the one that said, ‘I don’t know if we should do it’, because we did a farewell tour and I didn’t want to get into that thing like all the other bands are doing, saying it’s the last tour and then reappearing again. But I’ve been convinced, because we’re doing it for a reason.” The gig will raise money for Parkinson’s and children’s charities: “No one’s getting paid or anything.”But even with the other members of Sabbath on board, questions loomed – and still loom – over the state of Ozzy’s health. Certainly, none of the members of Black Sabbath seem to know what form their performance is going to take (“I think Ozzy might be on some kind of throne,” offers Iommi, “but I’m in the dark as much as anybody else”), and it’s hard to miss a certain trepidation on their part. “I’m already having palpitations,” says Butler. “In fact, I had a nightmare last night. I dreamed everything went wrong on stage and we all turned to dust. It’s important that we leave a great impression, since it’s the final time that people will experience us live. So it has to be great on the night.”View image in fullscreenOzzy Osbourne at Birmingham NEC in 1997.Photograph: Mick Hutson/RedfernsWhen I speak to Morello, he’s bullish: “Sharon and Ozzy were like, ‘You’regonnahave Black Sabbath’. And that felt good.” Others are less certain. The day I interview Ozzy, one artist on the bill, Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan, seems to cast doubt on the whole enterprise: “I’m cautious about saying, ‘Yeah, all in, he’s gonna do it.’ Because man, I don’t know what kind of modern miracles we’ll come up with to get him on stage to do the songs … I’m kinda preparing for the worst, but hoping for the best.”It’s time to say ‘enough’. When you’ve given it your all, you can sit back and say: ‘I did it’Sharon OsbourneOzzy is at pains to point out that he isn’t going to be performing a full set. “We’re only playing a couple of songs each. I don’t want people thinking, ‘We’re getting ripped off’, because it’s just going to be … what’s the word? … a sample, you’re going to get a few songs each by Ozzy and Sabbath.”He says he’s in training. “I do weights, bike riding, I’ve got a guy living at my house who’s working with me. It’s tough – I’ve been laid up for such a long time. I’ve been lying on my back doing nothing and the first thing to go is your strength. It’s like starting all over again. I’ve got a vocal coach coming round four days a week to keep my voice going. I have problems walking. I also get blood pressure issues, from blood clots on my legs. I’m used to doing two hours on stage, jumping and running around. I don’t think I’ll be doing much jumping or running around this time. I may be sitting down, but the point is I’ll be there, and I’ll do the best I can. So all I can do is turn up.”If it works, it will be a remarkable victory against the odds, and as every member of Black Sabbath points out, that would be entirely in keeping with their career. No one thought they were going to make it, not even Ward, who legendarily had the eureka moment that shaped the band: why not try to come up with a musical equivalent to the horror films that were packing them in at his local cinema? When Iommi followed through, debuting the song that gave the band their name at a rehearsal, Ward says his first reaction was that, “It scared the hell out of me, I absolutely loved it. Then I thought: oh well, we’ve completely fucked our career now.”View image in fullscreenOzzy with wife/manager Sharon Osbourne in 2020.Photograph: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagicEven when their career took off, Ozzy points out, “I don’t think we ever had a good review. Maybe that was a catalyst in a way: every critic didn’t like us, so more of the people liked us. We were a people’s band: four guys from Aston, one of the poorest parts of Birmingham.” Growing up, “I used to have an old tyre and a stick, rolling it around the streets of Birmingham. We never had a car, never went on holiday, never saw the ocean until I was in my late teens. Couldn’t hold a job down – I’d get four weeks into a factory job and go, ‘Fuck it.’ But we just had a crack and it worked out.”Whatever happens on 5 July, Sharon says it’s definitely the end. The rest of Black Sabbath seem to be immersed in projects – Ward says he has seven unreleased solo albums to put out, Butler is working on a novel, Iommi has recently helmed, of all things, a Black Sabbath-themed ballet and his own perfume – but, she insists that, for her and Ozzy, “it’s time to say ‘enough’. When you’ve given it your all, you can sit back and say: I did it.”Hang on: are the Osbournes really going to repair to their home in Buckinghamshire and live a life of genteel retirement? “Yeah. Get some ponies and chickens, and a million dogs. I want to open a dog rescue centre and a horse rescue centre. Scream at the neighbours a couple of times. There you go.”Ozzy concedes that he’s done, too. “I’d love to say ‘never say never’, but after the last six years or so … it is time. I lived on the road for 50-odd years, and I’ve kind of got used to not picking up my bags and getting on the bus again. I don’t smoke dope or do any of the rock star lifestyle any more. I’m kind of like a homebody. I never go out. I never hang out in bars – I don’t drink. So what the fuck is out there for me? I hate going shopping with my wife. I feel like stabbing myself in the neck after half an hour. But it’s time for me to spend some time with my grandkids, I don’t want to die in a hotel room somewhere. I want to spend the rest of my life with my family.”Back to the Beginning is at Villa Park, Birmingham, 5 JulyExplore more on these topicsBlack SabbathMetalPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They rap about drugs – and are named for the notorious punishment meted out by the IRA at the height of the Troubles to drug dealers, while one of the trio wears a tricolour balaclava.But for their fans – especially those “ceasefire babies” who, like them, grew up in the aftermath of the Good Friday agreement – they are a breath of fresh air. They play with Republican imagery – often mocking it – but are staunch in their nationalism, explains the Guardian’s Ireland correspondent,Rory Carroll. Asemi-fictionalised filmabout their originswon a Bafta. And they have won more praise and fans for their unusual and political choice to rap in Irish.The Irish writer and editorRoisin LanigantellsMichael Safiwhat that means. “Irish has always been so denigrated,” she says, that hearing it used in hip-hop “does feel important and just cool – I didn’t realise that Irish could sound like that”.But this year Kneecap have found themselves in a storm more intense than any they have weathered before. Last month the trio played Coachella andled the US crowd in chants of “Free Palestine”, making clear their view that Israel is committing genocide. Afterwards older clips from concerts emerged of band membersappearing to shout out support of Hamas and Hezbollah, and call for the deaths of Conservative MPs. Counter-terrorism police have confirmedthey are now investigating the band.Now politicians have condemned the band and even called for them to be dropped from festivals. In response, musicians from Pulp to Massive Attack have written a furious response saying politicians should not be interfering in musical expression. Meanwhile the hip-hop stars and their manager have said the attacks are confected by those who want to demonise them, and that this is a deliberate distraction from the plight of people in Gaza.Photograph: Hannah McCallum/The ObserverExplore more on these topicsMusicToday in FocusKneecap"

Witnessing deaths and the destruction of homes and livelihoods in floods made worse by extreme rainfall has had a profound impact on her.She decided to try to bring about change – to do what she could to amplify the voices of those in the Ugandan communities worst affected by the climate crisis.Now 27, Nabukalu is one ofseveral young climate activistswho travelled to London this week to attend what has been predicted to bethe last in-person AGM held by HSBC. They will deliver a letter to the bank’s CEO, Georges Elhedery, urging him to stop financing the expansion of oil, gas and coal projects and harmful industrial agribusiness, and to stop providing money to companies that forcibly remove people from their homes to make way for such infrastructure.“This is an opportunity to talk to real people, not just anHSBCoffice,” said Nabukalu, speaking before the meeting at the Intercontinental hotel. “I will be so happy to get the chance to hand over the letter and to ask: ‘Has HSBC measured the damage they have done by financing corporations that are driving the climate crisis?’”View image in fullscreenNabukalu in London ahead of the protest.Photograph: Jess Midwinter/Action AidThe letter refers to a2023 Action Aid report, which identifies HSBC as “the largest European financier of fossil fuels in the global south”, channelling $63.5bn (£48bn) into fossil fuel activities between 2016 and 2022.The letter to Elhedery, from young people all over the world, refers to HSBC’s plans, announced earlier this year, to review its commitment toscaling back its financing of fossil fuels.“This has made something very clear: you value profit margins and boardroom agendas more than the lives of millions of people bearing the full brunt of your decisions,” the letter reads.Environmentalists criticisedHSBC after it delayed key parts of its climate goalsby 20 years, and watered down environmental targets in a new long-term bonus plan for Elhedery that could be worth up to 600% of his salary.In February, the lender said it was reviewing its net zero emissions policies and targets – which are split between its own operations and those of the companies it finances – after realising its clients and suppliers had “seen more challenges” in cutting their carbon footprint than expected.The activists’ letter asks “that you not only stand by your commitments to end your support for the fossil fuel industry in line with what the science requires, but also put an end to all lending and underwriting for corporations involved in fossil fuel expansion”.Nabukalu will also urge the bank to stop funding corporations that are backing the east African crude oil pipeline from Uganda to Tanzania. Once constructed, the pipeline would produce an estimated379m tonnes of CO2over 25 years. The main backers of the multimillion-dollar pipeline are the French oil company TotalEnergies and the state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).Nabukalu, who has visited people living along the proposed route, said: “This pipeline is already causing damage even before its construction. Thousands and thousands of people have been displaced. They were promised land titles, but have none. Their livelihoods have been sabotaged. They cannot build agriculture, the water table is low, so they have little access to water.We know who caused the climate crisis – but they don’t want to pay for it | Vanessa NakateRead more“These people should be at the centre of the bank’s decisions.”“We will talk to HSBC and ask them to stop financing fossil fuels that are driving the climate crisis,” said Nabukalu. “By continuing to finance TotalEnergies they are destroying our future.”A report published in Aprilfound that those displaced along the pipeline’s proposed route had reported being inadequately compensated and rehoused.Some western banks have declined to fund itafter pressurefrom a coalition of organisations and community groups.A spokesperson for HSBC said: “We follow a clear set of sustainability risk policies which support our ambition to align the financed emissions in our portfolio to net zero by 2050. We do not comment on client relationships.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentHSBCClimate crisisFossil fuel divestmentUgandaAfricaBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

No international pressure, judicial blackmail, or foreign tribunal will make us back down from this conviction.”The sparsely populated area under dispute represents two-thirds of Guyana and is rich in gold, diamonds, timber and other natural resources. It also is located close to huge offshore oil deposits, with current production averaging about 650,000 barrels a day.Venezuela has always considered Essequibo as its own because the region was within its boundaries during the Spanish colonial period. It has long dismissed the border drawn by international arbitrators in 1899, when Guyana was still a British colony.After years of fruitless mediation, Guyana asked the world court in 2018 to rule that the 1899 border decision is valid and binding. Venezuela argues that a 1966 agreement to resolve the dispute in effect nullified the original arbitration.The case is still pending in court while tensions between the two countries keep rising.In late 2023,Maduro threatened to annex the region by forceafter holding a referendum asking voters if Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state. Days later, Caribbean leaders, joined by Brazil and the UN, held an emergency summit where Guyana and Venezuela agreed to refrain from using force. But the dispute continues.In March, Guyana’s president, Irfaan Ali, denounced anincursion by an armed Venezuelan naval vesselin disputed waters that are home to a major offshore oil deposit being developed by ExxonMobil. The Venezuelan vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, disputed Ali’s claims and called ExxonMobil’s oil installations “illegal”.Venezuelan voters will head to the polls later this month to elect governors and lawmakers.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaGuyanaUnited NationsNicolás MaduroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Now he must redefine itRead moreCarney’s Liberals are set to form a minority government after Monday’s election, and are projected to hold at least 168 seats, with recounts pending in at least two electoral districts. The Conservatives will form the official opposition with a projected 144 seats, while the Bloc Québecois won 23, the progressive New Democratic party seven and the Greens one. Carney praised the strength of the country’s democracy amid high turnout, telling reporters all party leaders “quickly and graciously” accepted the results.The prime minister said he would call a byelection immediately after Conservatives decide which member of parliament will step aside to give leader Pierre Poilievre, whofailed to win his own seat, the chance to run for a new seat.“No games,” he said.But Carney rejected the idea of signing a formal pact with the NDP in order to guarantee the survival of his minority government,as his predecessor Justin Trudeau didfollowing his narrow electoral victory in 2021. Carney said the Liberals had received a strong mandate “and the most votes in Canadian history”, adding: “Canadians elected a new government to stand up to President Trump and build a strong economy.”Carney told reporters he would announce a cabinet with gender parity on 12 May and parliament would return on 27 May in a move that “clearly underscores the sovereignty of our country”.The visit of a monarch to give the speech from the throne marks the first in more than half a century. The last time a sovereign opened parliament was in 1957, when Queen Elizabeth II came to Ottawa.The prime minister also acknowledged that a large portion of the voter base had concerns they felt the Liberals had so far failed to fully address.Ahead of the election, the Conservatives had emphasized a “tough on crime” message and Carney said on Friday that his party would strengthen both the criminal code and bail laws “for those threatening the safety of Canadians”, making it more difficult for those accused of auto theft, home invasion and human trafficking to obtain bail. Carney also pledged to build more houses and to cut taxes on new builds in an attempt to make the real estate market more accessible.“I’ve been clear since day one of my leadership campaign in January, I’m in politics to do big things, not to be something,” he said. “Now that Canadians have honoured me with a mandate to bring about big changes quickly, I will work relentlessly to fulfil that trust.”Much of the press conference, however, focused on Carney’s upcoming meeting with Trump. The prime minister told reporters he would not negotiate in public amid questions over how he might approach a possible trade deal with the president, as well as the presence of tariffs on Canadian goods that violate current trade rules.Canada election 2025: latest results as Liberal party wins federal electionRead more“Do not expect white smoke out of that meeting,” he said, a reference to the upcoming papal conclave.The White House has cited the alleged flow of fentanyl from Canada for imposing tariffs, even though only minimal amounts of the drug have been seized at the northern border in recent months.“There will be difficult discussions,” Carney said in French. “The fentanyl-related tariffs, we don’t understand why they’re still in place.”When pressed on Trump’s musing on making Canada the 51st state, Carney said any such proposal would be rejected by Canada.“It’s always important to distinguish want from reality,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCanadaKing Charles IIIMark CarneyDonald TrumpTrump tariffsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In this case, the child was reportedly not allowed to leave with her mother even though it was what both parents said they wanted.The administration’santi-immigration crackdownhas put many people in a difficult position becausethey riskbeing summarily detained and deported when turning up for routine Ice check-ins.

As part of Donald Trump’sflurry of tariffson China, the US is closing a loophole that allowed low-value goods to be shipped into the US without paying any import fees. The “de minimis” loophole, known by the Latin phrase for “of little importance”, was “a big scam going on against our country”, the US president said on Wednesday. “We put an end to it.”What is the ‘de minimis’ loophole?“De minimis” refers to a trade policy introduced in the 1930s that allowed travellers returning to the US to bring goods with them worth up to $5 without declaring them to customs. Since 2016, the threshold has been $800 (£600).The term “de minimis” may mean “of little importance”, but the policy is responsible for a huge volume of consumer goods. About 1.36bn shipments entered the US via the loophole in the fiscal year 2024, more than double the number four years earlier, according to the US customs agency. That represents more than 90% of all the cargo entering the US. About 60% of those packagescome from China.As of Friday, parcels worth less than $800 will be subject to a 120% levy or a flat fee of $100, rising to $200 from June. That is on top of the 145% tariffs already placed on all Chinese imports, as part of thewider US-China trade war.Why is Trump closing the ‘de minimis’ loophole?The White House has accused sellers in China of “deceptive shipping practices” to take advantage of the loophole. Industry associations in the US have complained of unfair competition from Chinese sellers and have beenpushing for yearsfor the loophole to be closed.Trump also argues that the free flow of small packages into the US has allowed deadly drugs, especiallyfentanyland the chemicals used to make it, to arrive unchecked into the country. “These exports play a significant role in the synthetic opioid crisis in the United States,” Trump said in anexecutive orderin April.What does it mean for buying cheap goods in the US?Prices will probably increase and some options have become unavailable. The Chinese e-commerce company Temu announced on Friday that it would stop shipping low-cost items from China and sell directly to US consumers. The fast-fashion company Shein has also reportedly already started increasing the prices of some goods. Data compiled byBloombergfound that the average price for the top 100 products sold by Shein in the beauty and health category increased by 51% in the past week, while a 10-piece set of kitchen towels increased in price by 377%. The average increase for women’s clothing was 8%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is hoped that increased checks on small packages will allow more illicit imports to be apprehended.Before 2020, the year after China cracked down onfentanyl suppliers, 90% of the fentanyl consumed in the US came directly from China. Now nearly all of the supply comes across the US-Mexico border, not from packages shipped directly from China.How has China reacted?China’s government and trade associations say the pain will be felt by American consumers rather than Chinese exporters. He Yongqian, a spokesperson for the commerce ministry, said earlier this year that the US tariff hikes “will undoubtedly increase costs for American consumers and degrade their shopping experience”.Industry groups, including the China textiles association, have backed the government’s position and accused the US of “hegemonic actions”, according to Chinese state media.Shein is reportedly considering pausing its widely anticipated London IPO, amid uncertainty around how the tariffs will affect its business. The company did not respond to a request for comment.JD.com, one of China’s e-commerce companies, has promise to buy 2bn yuan (£206.6m) worth of products from Chinese exporters to sell in the domestic market.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsInternational tradeTrump administrationChinaAsia PacificexplainersShareReuse this content"

The suggestion that Beijing was potentially willing to negotiate with Washington – along with a better than expected report on US jobs - sent markets higher on Friday on both sides of the Atlantic.Ren Yi, a nationalist blogger who writes under the nickname Chairman Rabbit, wrote that he had learned from sources that the US had “frequently and proactively contacted the Chinese side through various channels, hoping to negotiate with the Chinese government on economic and trade issues”.China has denied claims made by US officials that talks were already under way, or that China had initiated them. Trump said last week thatXi Jinping, China’s leader, had called him. China’s foreign ministry accused the US of “misleading the public” on the status of negotiations. Ren wrote: “If China had given in and taken the initiative to give in to the United States, then naturally there would not have been the United States taking the initiative to contact China.”Why is Trump ending the ‘de minimis’ tariff loophole on low-value imports?Read moreThe commerce ministry said on Friday that Washington needed to show “sincerity” in negotiations and that it should not engage in “coercion and extortion”.China has repeatedly accused the US of bullying in its approach to trade policies. The two countries have been at loggerheads since Trump launched a new US-China trade war in early April, with US tariffs on Chinese goods now at 145% while China’s retaliatory tariffs have reached 125%.But although neither side wants to be seen to blink first, the US and China have already introduced a number of exceptions to their respective tariffs tosoften the blowof a trade war that risksupending the global economy.Chinesefactory activity slowed in April. The statistics bureau blamed “sharp changes in [China’s] external environment” for the decline.This week Xi called on officials to adjust to changes in the international environment, although he did not mention the US by name.Elsewhere, Chinese propaganda has been more explicit. This week the foreign ministry releaseda videothat accused the US of bullying and said that bowing to such behaviour would be like “drinking poison”.A US executive order to close a multibillion-dollar tariff loophole, known as “de minimis”, came into effect on Friday.The ending of the de minimis regime, which allowed low-value goods to be shipped to the US without paying customs fees, primarily affects Chinese exporters.Scott Bessent said this week he was confident that China would want to reach a deal. The US treasury secretary said: “First, we need to de-escalate, and then over time, we will start focusing on a larger trade deal.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsChinaXi JinpingDonald TrumpAsia PacificTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Labor leads the Coalition 51.5-48.5 on the two-party-preferred measure according to our latest average, although there is still uncertainty in the polling.The two-party-preferred vote has been trending towards a repeat of the last election, but this masks a more than two-point primary vote drop for both major parties. The votes lost by the major parties have gone “everywhere”, according to pollsters who spoke to Guardian Australia. Our model estimates the support for independents and minor parties is four points higher than at the last election.With an estimated primary vote of about 33%, a Coalition win on Saturday would represent a “major polling failure”, says Luke Mansillo, the political scientist who builtGuardian’s Australia’s poll averaging model, which amalgamates data from a number of published polls.The model factors in sample sizes, previous results and the “house effects” (inadvertent bias towards a party) of each pollster.Research showspollsters systematically overestimated the support for Labor in the 2019 and 2022 elections, which is one reason the model estimates Labor’s primary vote is slightly lower than the published polls themselves report.Some published polls in the final week haveput Labor on course to comfortably attain majority government, even with a primary vote similar to 2022, or even lower.Mansillo says it remains very unlikely that theCoalitioncould win enough seats to form minority government, let alone win an overall majority, but it is pinning its hopes on minor parties to its right taking votes from Labor and sending preferences to the Coalition.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter“They would have to rely on preference votes from One Nation and a rag tag of rightwing parties,” Mansillo says.One Nation has risen in the polls in recent months, but that appears to be mostly at the expense of the Coalition’s primary vote. Inprevious electionsonly about 62-64% of preferences from One Nation and the United Australia party ended up with the Coalition. By contrast, 86% of Greens preferences went to Labor at the last election.All the polls have shown a steady decline in the Coalition’s position in recent months, mostly thanks to its primary vote falling rather than Labor’s increasing.2:02The most memorable moments of the 2025 Australian federal election, in two minutes – videoThe Coalition first took a two-party-preferred lead in our poll tracker early last year, and really started to pull away around November. The lead continued into the new year, but has slowly fallen away ever since.As polls can be intermittent and noisy, it’s hard to pinpoint when exactly the Coalition peaked.“I really noticed the change in February,” says Shaun Ratcliff, who has been modelling and running polls with Redbridge throughout the campaign.“There were a couple of weeks there where you had the Labor party’sMedicare announcement, theWhyalla announcement, and the Reserve Bankcutting interest rates.“It felt like they were in campaign mode and they were making all these announcements in areas that were clearly researched.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They didn’t seem to really have a response to this messaging. Certainly through February and March.”Guardian Australia’s poll tracker shows Labor overtaking the Coalition towards the end of March, not long afterCyclone Alfred hit the Queensland coast. This is when Mansillo thinks the race flipped.“It was all a collapse in the Coalition primary vote,” Mansillo says. “There was nothing happening for Labor. More recently there has been an increase for One Nation.”Early in the campaign pollsters identified a number of seats to watch. These included seats to the north and south of greater Sydney, and on the fringes of Melbourne, the new seat of Bullwinkel in Perth, Lyons in Tasmania, and some seats in and around Brisbane. As the Coalition has struggled in the polls, its path to victory in these suburban and regional areas has started to close.Seats to watch in the 2025 election“At the start of the year [the Coalition] were looking very well placed,” says Ratcliff, who has been polling a collection of key seats. “In the first wave of the tracker in early February we had the Coalition at 52% two-party preferred, which was a three-point swing since the last election.“Our last wave has them losing ground since the last election. If anything we are seeing the Coalition going backwards in these key seats.”Josh Nicholas is a data journalist for Guardian AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsCoalitionLabor partyanalysisShareReuse this content"

But Labor remains on edge as election nearsRead moreThe published national opinion polls show Labor on track to form government but party strategists expect it will need to gain ground to retain a 76-seat majority as they brace for losses, including in suburban Melbourne and regional New South Wales.Dutton is adamant he can pull off a surprise win, drawing hope from Scott Morrison’s “miracle” 2019 election victory against Bill Shorten.But seniorCoalitioncampaign sources are downplaying that prospect, acknowledging that forcing Labor “deep” into minority is likely the best-case scenario after a tumultuous five-week campaign.3:31Voting 101: What's a hung parliament, and what happens if no major party wins a majority? - videoThe two leaders made their last pitch to the remaining undecided voters on Friday in a frenetic final full-day of campaigning.Albanese made an 11th-hour visit to Dutton’s own electorate of Dickson in Brisbane in a further sign Labor believes the opposition leader’s seat is winnable.View image in fullscreenAnthony Albanese with Labor’s candidate for Dickson, Ali France, in Brisbane on Friday.Photograph: Asanka Ratnayake/Getty ImagesAlmost 40% of ballots were already cast as ofmid-morning on Friday,surpassing the early voting figure from 2022.Albanese insisted Labor still had a “mountain to climb” as he urged voters to grant him a second-term to fulfil promises in health, housing and cutting student debt.If successful, he would be the first prime minister to win re-election since John Howard in 2004 and the first Labor leader to achieve the feat since Bob Hawke in 1990.“In uncertain times you can be certain that Labor has a plan to build Australia’s future and you can be certain that the Coalition have cuts and chaos, as the way that they’ve run this campaign,” Albanese told reporters in the seat of Longman north of Brisbane.2:41Voting 101: How do you actually vote on election day? – videoDutton, who campaigned in Adelaide and Perth on Friday, said the election had echoes of 2019, when Morrison defied the polls to defeat Shorten.“I think we’re seeing a 2019 situation, where you’ve got a lot of interesting contests playing on the ground, where we’ve had a very significant effort by great candidates,” Dutton told ABC’s AM.“And I think there’ll be some big surprises on election night, because people have had enough.”Labor insiders believe Albanese and the party national secretary, Paul Erickson, have run a “textbook campaign”, capitalising on the Coalition’s missteps and voters’ negative perceptions of Dutton to prosecute the case for continuity in a period of global upheaval.View image in fullscreenPeter Dutton holds a how-to-vote card during a visit to a fuel station in the electorate of Moore in Perth on Friday.Photograph: Dan Peled/Getty ImagesBut the government – which holds a notional 78 seats – remains in a fight to retain a majority amid the threat of a voter backlash from outer suburban and regional voters over the cost of living.The worst fears of an electoral “bloodbath” in Victoria, where half-a-dozen seats were once considered at serious risk, have subsided in recent weeks.Nevertheless, one strategist said the party was bracing for “one of the toughest results we’ve had in a very long time” in the traditionally safe Labor state.Both sides expect Labor to loseAston while Chisholm and McEwen are considered tight races.The Coalition believes it is in contention in the western Melbourne seats of Hawke and Gorton, although Labor is confident of holding both.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About 1,300 students had finished exams at the Canterbury site and were trying to leave with their parents, as another 1,300 students plus their parents attempted to enter the facility.About 90 minutes after the second exam’s scheduled start at 1.30pm, children waiting were told it had been cancelled.The tests – which qualify students for accelerated streams in public primary and secondary schools – are normally sat in high schools but the department had organised this year’s sessions in bigger venues because the test was online.Murat Dizdar, the education department secretary, apologised for the “inconvenience and stress” caused to students and their parents.“What occurred was unacceptable and fell well short of the department’s expectations,” he said.“I understand the frustration of families who had made arrangements to attend the tests.”Dizdar said that further tests scheduled across the weekend at Randwick, Homebush and Canterbury had all been cancelled due to concerns around crowd control.“Testing will go ahead as planned at the other 104 testing sites across the state,” he said.“I want parents and carers to know that we are committed to rectifying this situation.“The department will be in direct contact with a range of options for make up tests.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian educationNew South WalesSydneynewsShareReuse this content"

Electoral advertising laws only impose a blackout period on broadcast TV and radio.Fibs and exaggeration have always been part of politics – but who knows what lies are now being pushed online? | Julianne SchultzRead moreAdvocates have pushed for changes to the decades-old laws, which stop legacy media outlets airing political ads two days before the election, but do not extend toFacebook, Google, YouTube, the TV catch-up services and podcasts.Guardian Australia analysis, using data from Populares’ ad tracker, showed political parties and affiliated groups spent more than $39m for political ads since 28 March across Facebook,YouTubeand Google search.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterLabor’s pages – including candidate and MP accounts – totalled $11.4m, about 29% of that bill, booking $4.2m worth of Meta ads, $6.8m on YouTube and more than $400,000 in ads onGooglesearch and display.The Liberal party’s pages trailed Labor, spending $7.1m – about $3.8m onMetaads and $3m on YouTube.Overall spend by party or affiliated groupOverall spend by party or affiliated groupPalmer is no stranger to splashing cash at federal elections and his new minor party,Trumpet of Patriots, racked up a big ad bill.While the mining billionaire spent a comparatively small $1.2m on Meta ads, he spent almost $5.5m on boosting hundreds of YouTube ads.The ads primarily featured the Hunter candidate, Suellen Wrightson, speaking about the party’s “commonsense” policies.You can spend an enormous amount of money selling a beer that no one wants to drinkKos SamarasTeal independents, which includes Climate 200’s page and their candidates, amassed a $3.5m bill with $2.6m on Meta ads.The Greens and Nationals gave no advertising money to Meta, instead booking ads on YouTube worth $316,400 and $212,150 respectively.Third-party groups spent big trying to influence the election’s results. Progressive groups including It’s Not a Race and the Clean Energy Council spent close to $2m on online political ads.Unions, including Australian Unions and the United Workers Union, followed closely behind with $1.6m on Meta and Google ad placements.The rightwing advocacy group Advance has asked supporters to dig deep tounseat the Greensand Labor. Analysis showed Advance spent about $1.6m on online political ads.Other rightwing groups, such asBetter Australiaand the Australian Taxpayers’ Alliance, spent a cumulative $1.5m promoting their ideas to social media users.Redbridge pollster Kos Samaras said political parties might spend large on social media but without adapting to the online world, it could end up as “burnt money”.“You can spend an enormous amount of money selling a beer that no one wants to drink,” he said.Influencing battleground seatsWhile the overall figures demonstrate political parties are willing to spend more than ever on online campaigns, further analysis shows their advertising is increasingly targeted to influence battleground seats.And it was Labor again spending most on that front. At the top of the list is Bennelong in Sydney’s inner north. Labor and the Liberals are fiercely contesting the marginal electorate on the ground and online.Labor spent $270,000 on targeted Google advertising to those living in the seat, more than double the Liberals. Unions and Advance have also boosted their messages in Bennelong, spending $49,200 and $8,250 respectively.Political parties and groups have spent more than $350,000 on YouTube advertising in five other seats too: Blair, Brisbane, Bruce, Chisholm and McEwen.Who is H Fong, the man authorising the flurry of annoying Trumpet of Patriots text messages in Australia?Read moreBoothby and Paterson are among the few seats where the Liberals have outspent Labor. The opposition has boosted $165,700 worth of ads compared with Labor’s $140,600 in Boothby while Labor spent $10,000 less than the Liberals’ $84,350 in Paterson.In Melbourne’s inner-north seat of Wills, where the Labor incumbent Peter Khalil is fighting off the Greens, Labor has spent $268,300 on Google ads while the Greens have spent just $600.Social media ad spend by party or affiliated group across key electoratesSocial media ad spend by party or affiliated group across key electoratesTargeted advertising was effective for influencing local battles but still had to consider the audience’s values, Samaras said.While the Trumpet of Patriots spent $5.5m on YouTube and Google, it paid $69,000 in targeted advertising for one seat – Hunter.Calls to modernise lawsIn the 2022 federal election, the Australian Communications and Media Authority received 34 complaints alleging election ads were shown during the blackout period. The majority of these complaints were for ads shown on streaming services, where the blackout rules do not apply.Free TV Australia, which represents the broadcasters, this week called for the blackout period to be removed. Its chief executive, Bridget Fair, called it “a relic of the 1980s”.“It’s absurd that broadcasters are banned from airing political ads in the final days before an election” she said.“It creates an uneven playing field.”The University of Canberra’s News and Media Research Centre told a parliamentary inquiry into the 2022 election it was “crazy” that restrictions on election ads did not also apply to online services.Meta told the parliamentary inquiry it supported laws that would apply the same treatment to both traditional broadcast and digital platforms.The parliamentary committee noted the disparity had been an ongoing issue since the 2016 election.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsMetaFacebookYouTubeGoogleAdvertisingnewsShareReuse this content"

The outgoing interior minister, Nancy Faeser, made the bombshell announcement on what is effectively her last day in office.Faeser said “there was no political influence on the assessment”, despite the AfD’s insistence to the contrary. But the move puts the incoming conservative-led government ofFriedrich Merzunder great pressure, as well as Faeser’s Social Democrat colleagues, who will be the junior partners in the new coalition that gets to work next Tuesday.On the back of the decision, Merz will now be responsible – on top of the myriad other challenges in his in-tray – for deciding whether and how to ban the AfD, a decision that will involve the most precarious of political tightrope walks.View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz would like to be seen as a pragmatic rationalist, aiming to reduce the AfD to what he refers to as the ‘marginal phenomenon’.Photograph: Liesa Johannssen/ReutersMigration, Ukraine, Trump and an ailing economy are among the burgeoning issues that he will also have to tackle with urgency. The growing mood of dissatisfaction over these and other issues, exacerbated by the six months of political deadlock that followed the premature collapse of the previous government – which induced an added layer of nationwide ennui – has already caused the AfD to creep up in the polls.Having won second place in February’s election– doubling its previous result and making it the strongest opposition party, second only to the conservative CDU/CSU – in recent days the AfD has come top of the polls for the first time ever.The ruling by the BfV is unlikely to put people off supporting the AfD.Finding a way to reduce the AfD has been at top of the agenda among all of the political parties since it emerged as a protest force of professors and academics in 2013on the back of anger over the euro bailouts. The challenge has only grown in importance, as the populists – morphing from anti-euro to anti-migrant over time – have grown their success at the ballot box.Merz would like to be seen as a pragmatic rationalist, aiming to reduce the AfD to what he refers to as the “marginal phenomenon” it once was by addressing the nation’s concerns, taking the wind out of the sails of the AfD’s successful modus operandi of inciting fear and insecurity.Tackling “irregular” immigration is therefore at the top of his domestic agenda, as he seeks to address the topic viewed as having added the most fuel to the AfD’s fire.But many others believe it is too late for that, arguing that an extremist classification, followed by a ban, would be the only way to stop the flourishing party.Others say such a move would be in grave danger of backfiring, arguing that the AfD would turn such a branding by the state into its own “seal of approval”, which would serve to enhance its already strong sense of victimhood or martyrdom.Merz’s party, the Christian Democratic Union, has been torn over how to deal with the AfD. Merztacitly cooperated with the party earlier this year– despite insisting he would not – to push migration policies through parliament. And on the local level, his party and the AfD have cooperated on issues such as a ruling that the German flag should be hoisted in schools.Jens Spahn, Merz’s close ally, recently prompted scorn by suggesting the AfD should be treated as a “normal opposition party”, arguing that excluding the party from parliamentary procedures only boosted its popularity.Those who reject that approach say Friday’s ruling will now give them more justification to block the party at every opportunity – but they argue that this will only work if a cross-party consensus prevails.Explore more on these topicsAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)Friedrich MerzGermanyThe far rightEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Images posted to social media by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition showed a fierce blaze onboard the ship and two explosions.There was no confirmation or further evidence of the claim that drones caused the blasts, but images of the Conscience provided by Cypriot authorities showed significant damage.map showing location of the ship when it was attackedTwelve crew members and four civilians were “confirmed safe”, the Maltese government said in a statement on Friday. “The vessel had 12 crew members onboard and four civilian passengers; no casualties were reported,” the statement said, adding that a nearby tug had been directed to aid the vessel.The group said activists from 21 countries were onboard on a “mission to challenge Israel’s illegal and deadly siege ofGazaand to deliver desperately needed, life-saving aid”.The statement read: “Israeli ambassadors must be summoned and answer to violations of international law, including the ongoing blockade and the bombing of our civilian vessel in international waters.”Israel has not commented on the allegation.Gaza blockade: a Palestinian widow, her children and a cupboard that is almost bareRead moreAccording to the monitoring website MarineTraffic, the Conscience left the Tunisian port of Bizerte on Tuesday and arrived in the area where it reported being attacked on Thursday morning. The ship was heading to a point near Malta where it was to pick up activists, including the climate-change campaigner Greta Thunberg, from a smaller vessel.Thunberg confirmed to Reuters she was in Malta and had been supposed to board the ship.“I was part of the group who was supposed to board that boat today to continue the voyage towards Gaza, which is one of many attempts to open up a humanitarian corridor and to do our part to keep trying to break Israel’s illegal siege on Gaza,” she said. “This attack caused an explosion and major damage to the vessel, which made it impossible to continue the mission.”View image in fullscreenDamage on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla vessel Conscience.Photograph: Freedom Flotilla Coalition/ReutersThe group said it had been organising a non-violent action under a media blackout in order to avoid any potential sabotage.A previous sailing launched by the coalition from southern Turkey in 2010 ended in bloodshed when Israeli forces stormed the Mavi Marmara vessel,killing 10 people and wounding 28.Turkey’s foreign ministry said Turkish nationals were on board the Conscience at the time of the incident.“We condemn in the strongest terms this attack on a civilian ship,” it said, noting that there were “allegations that the ship was targeted by Israeli drones”.“All necessary efforts will be made to reveal the details of the attack as soon as possible and to bring the perpetrators to justice,” it said.Israel imposed a tight blockade on Gaza two months ago, allowing no food, fuel, medicine or other item into the territory, and resumed intense military operations in Gaza in mid-March after a fragile ceasefire collapsed.Humanitarian organisations in Gaza have distributed the last of their stocks of flour and other foodstuffs. Officials in the devastated Palestinian territory said on Friday that the kitchens that serve basic meals to those with no other option would be forced to close within a week to 10 days.On Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it would not have access to food, medicine and life-saving supplies needed for many of its Gaza programmes unless aid deliveries resumed immediately.“Aid must be allowed to enter Gaza. Hostages must be released. Civilians must be protected,” it said. “Without immediate action, Gaza will descend further into chaos that humanitarian efforts will not be able to mitigate.”Medical workers in Gaza’s remaining health facilities said they were now prioritising cases to make sure available medical stocks were reserved for the most serious. Medicine for chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure is virtually unobtainable, officials said.“I don’t know how people are managing. They have lost everything. The displacement continues every day and more people are searching for shelter and whatever they need to survive,” said Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGOs Network in Gaza.A UN team has been sent to the devastated Palestinian territory to assess levels of malnutrition and the risk of famine.Israeli officials justify the blockade with claims that Hamas routinely steals aid, distributing it to its fighters or selling it. Aid officials in Gaza deny any widespread theft of aid in recent months.Media in Israel have reported a plan to use private contractors to distribute food from centralised hubs protected by the Israeli military to Palestinians who have been vetted. Humanitarian officials in Gaza say the plan is unworkable and potentially illegal.The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’s attack on southern Israel in October 2023, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Thursday that at least 2,326 people had been killed since Israel resumed strikes, bringing the overall death toll since the war broke out to 52,418, also mostly civilians.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaMaltaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesEuropeIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

A lack of sand eels means seabirds such as puffins can starve to death.After the UK left the EU, the previous Conservative government banned European countries from fishing for sand eels in British waters.Specieswatch: Sand eel fishing ban offers hope of stock resurgenceRead moreThe EU took the UK to court over the decision in order to support Denmark, which has the largest sand eel fishing fleet. Lawyers argued ministers did not consider the “economic and social” effects of the ban. They used the dispute settlement mechanism of the EU-UK trade and cooperation agreement to contest the ban.The ruling found the decision to close Scottish waters to sand eel fishing was fully upheld, but that during the decision-making process to close English waters to sand eel fishing, the UK did not have sufficient regard to the principle of proportionality, specifically in relation to EU rights during the adjustment period. Ministers said they would bring the process back into compliance but that they did not need to reopen the fishery while they did so.Nature campaigners celebrated the decision. Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: “We are absolutely delighted the panel has found the ecological case for the closure of industrial sand eel fishing is sound. Also, that UK governments are within their rights to restrict sand eel fishing in UK waters to protect this valuable food source for declining seabirds.“This has been a great example of collaboration between the UK and Scottish governments, and all those in civil society across the UK and the EU that have campaigned long and hard for our threatened seabirds. We now expect the UK government and the EU to move forward and make this closure permanent. Safeguarding sand eel stocks is a key part of the jigsaw that will help set our puffins,kittiwakesand the wider marine environment on the path to recovery.”Ben Reynolds, executive director of green thinktank IEEP UK, said: “The decision of the tribunal is welcome news for the environment, and for the finding that there is no legal obligation to reverse the closures despite the procedural error being found in the English case. This is one of only a handful of issues where the UK has used its post-Brexit powers to go further than the EU on tightening up protection of the environment.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They said: “The AfD will continue to defend itself legally against these defamatory statements that endanger democracy.”Donald Trump’s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, described the BfV ruling as “tyranny in disguise”. Posting on social media, Rubio said: “What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD – which took second in the recent election – but rather the establishment’s deadly open border immigration policies.”The AfD has faced growing calls from opponents for it to be outlawed on the grounds that it seeks to undermine democratic values, including protection of minority rights. Such a ban can be sought by either house of parliament – the Bundestag or the Bundesrat – or by the government itself.The German parliament may use the BfV decision to justify an attempt to cut or block public funding for the party.But Olaf Scholz, the outgoing Social Democrat chancellor, warned against rushing to outlaw the AfD. Some opponents of a ban say it could backfire and help promote a victim narrative within the party.Next week,Friedrich Merz, the Christian Democratic Union leader, will be sworn in as Germany’s new chancellor, after his conservative bloc won February’s snap election. However, his party has lost ground since the vote, with several recent polls showing the AfD in first place.Merz will lead a centre-right government with the Social Democrats. Theircoalition agreementbars any explicit or tacit cooperation with the AfD, a policy that all the mainstream parties have called a critical “firewall” to protect German democracy.However, Merz has faced calls from within his party to treat the AfD as a normal opposition force in order to prevent it from casting itself as a political martyr.Merz himself faced fierce criticism in Januaryfor accepting AfD supportfor motions in parliament to restrict migration, which Scholz before the election called an “unforgivable mistake”.The AfD won a record number of seats in the election, theoretically entitling it to chair several key parliamentary committees. However, the BfV’s decision could make other parties less willing to lend their support for such an outcome.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the same month, it also performed well in two other former communist regions.Afteractive endorsement by Elon Muskduring the campaign, the AfD achieved the best national result for a hard-right party in Germany since the second world war.The Cologne-based BfV based its decision on a 1,100-page report that was presented to the interior ministry this week.The report outlined the party’s efforts to erode democracy, including inciting hostility toward asylum seekers and migrants and viewing German citizens “with a background of migration from predominantly Muslim countries” as inferior.Political analysts and security authorities say the AfD, which was founded 12 years ago by a group of Eurosceptic professors, has become more radicalised with each change in leadership, and particularly when the country faced an influx of refugees in 2015-16.Benjamin Winkler, of the anti-extremist Amadeu Antonio Foundation, welcomed the BfV’s decision, blaming the AfD for increasing the influence of radical groups while stoking racist and anti-migrant sentiment in the wider population.“We see it in the large number of reports about attacks, and in police data about the record number of rightwing extremist crimes in Germany,” he told the news channel n-tv.The AfD has also called repeatedly for a break with Germany’s culture of historical remembrance of the Holocaust, using thinly veiled Nazi slogans, which are outlawed in Germany.In an online chat with Musk in January,Weidel referred to Adolf Hitler as a communist.Explore more on these topicsAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)GermanyThe far rightEuropeEspionagenewsShareReuse this content"

A red warning, the highest warning level, was issued by the MetService (the national meteorological service).The area of low pressure quickly deepened in the Tasman Sea off the west coast of New Zealand and travelled eastwards, with the centre of low pressure moving across the northern island and creating very strong winds, particularly through the Cook Strait, the body of water that separates the two islands. The wind direction was a south-easterly to southerly, which caused the winds to strengthen as they were funnelled between the islands.New Zealand’s capital, Wellington, recorded some of the strongest winds, with gusts exceeding 90mph.Floodingwas also an issue, especially for the southern island as the winds brought in moist air from the sea which rapidly rose over the Southern Alps producing heavy rain. More than 100mm of rain fell in less than 12 hours across some eastern areas and the local government called a state of emergency in Christchurch, the largest city in the southern island, as rivers burst their banks and roads closed. Snow warnings were issued across mountainous areas, with some parts experiencing more than 50cm of snowfall in 24 hours. Large swell was produced by the area of low pressure, with waves of almost 6 metres through the Cook Strait.Meanwhile, large areas ofEuropeare experiencing above-average temperatures, particularly in central and north-west regions. Temperatures in Vienna in Austria are expected to soar above 30C through the weekend, more than 10C above the average. Some cities in Germany and France are also expected to experience temperatures of about 30C.The high temperatures are a result of a low-pressure system over Portugal that will continue to drive a warm southerly flow across Europe. However, the high temperatures are not forecast to last, as a cooler northerly flow develops across Europe into next week. This will cause temperatures to drop to about 10C below average, with places that were reaching high 20C this week struggling to get maximum temperatures much above low teens.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandWeather trackerFloodingExtreme weatherEuropeEurope weatherClimate crisisanalysisShareReuse this content"

At least one civilian was killed and four people were injured as a result of the Israeli bombings late Friday night, according to Syrian state media.The latest round of strikes come after Israel killed four civilians earlier on Friday in a bombing in southern Syria and struck the vicinity of Syria’s presidential palace.Syria’s new rulers hadangrily denounced the raids launched by Israel’s air force against unidentified targets near the presidential palace earlier in the day, warning of a “dangerous escalation”.Syria’s presidency called the strike “a dangerous escalation against state institutions and its sovereignty” and accused Israel of destabilising the country.Israeli officials said the attacks were intended to send a message to the Syrian government after days of bloody clashes near Damascus between pro-government militia forces and fighters from the Druze minority sect.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and the defence minister, Israel Katz, said in a joint statement that the attack early on Friday, the second this week in Syria, was intended to deter the country’s new leadership from any hostile move against the Druze.“This is a clear message to the Syrian regime. We will not allow the deployment of forces south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community,” the statement said.The Israeli army confirmed in a statement that fighter jets struck near to the area of the palace of the president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in Damascus but gave no further details.Israel has said that it will protect the Druze religious minority in Syria, a declaration that most Druze leaders have rebuffed.The head of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria condemned the Israeli strikes in an interview with Al Jazeera on Friday.”The Israeli attacks on Syria are absolutely unacceptable. There is nothing in international law that allows for pre-emptive bombing,” said Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, the chair of the commission.The government in Damascus took power after ousting Bashar al-Assad in December last year and is dominated by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which has its roots in the al-Qaida jihadist network. Though Syria’s new rulers have promised inclusive rule in the multi-confessional, multi-ethnic country, they face pressures from extremists within their own ranks.Clashes broke out in Druze-majority areas outside Damascuson Tuesday after an audio clip circulated on social media of a man making derogatory comments about the prophet Muhammad. The clip, which was falsely attributed to a Druze cleric, angered many Sunni Muslims, but may have been fabricated.On Thursday, one of the three Syrian Druze spiritual leaders, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, accused Syria’s government of what he called an “unjustified genocidal attack” on the minority community.Hijri released a statement calling for international protection for the Druze in southern Syria, asking international forces to “intervene immediately”.

More than half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria, largely in the southern Sweida province and some suburbs of Damascus.Most of the other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war and annexed in 1981.The Syrian government has denied that any of its security forces were involved in the clashes with the Druze, which followed a wave of massacres in March whensecurity forces and allied groups killed more than 1,700 civilians, mostly from Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite community, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Since the fall of Assad’s regime in December, Israel has launched repeated airstrikes on Syria, destroying military hardware and stockpiles, in what it says is defence of the Druze. Israel has also sent troops to what was a demilitarised zone in the Golan Heights, on Syria’s south-west border with Israel, seizing key strategic terrain where Syrian troops were once deployed.Analysts in Israel say the strategy aims to undermine the new Syrian government while also protecting and so co-opting a potential proxy ally within the country. The strategy is controversial, however, with some officials arguing that a stable Syria would better serve Israel’s interests.The Syrian president, Sharaa, told a visiting US congressman last week that Damascus wanted to normalise ties with Israel.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

These are meagre: a kilo or so of beans, a bag of lentils, a little salt, some herbs, spices, and enough flour for half a dozen flatbreads cooked on a griddle over a fire of wood splinters, waste plastic and cardboard.In the two months sinceIsraelimposed a total blockade on Gaza, stopping food, medicine, fuel and anything else from entering the devastated territory, Ghalia’s “cupboard” has slowly diminished.There have been better days, when Ghalia has received a cash distribution from an NGO and has been able to buy fresh vegetables or fruit on the market, or been given a kilogram of flour by a relative or friend.But prices have risen steadily as the blockade has gone on and basic foodstuffs become scarcer. Sugar that once cost a dollar a kilo now costs 20 times that. A sack of old, poor-quality flour costs far more money than Ghalia can muster. The bakeries run by the World Food Programme shut down weeks ago, all out of flour or fuel. The kitchens that hand out nearly 1 million meals every day in Gaza have limited supplies left.The warehouses of the UN are empty.The family has not eaten meat or dairy products for months.“We are trying as much as possible to stretch our food since the crossings closed … We now eat just one or two meals a day. I divide the bread among my children just to curb their hunger. I try to eat less so there’s enough for them,” Ghalia said.Every day since the ceasefire definitively collapsed six weeks ago, the sound of airstrikes and shelling has been clearly audible in the small tented encampment in farmland near the devastated town of Beit Lahia where Ghalia and her family have pitched their tent.View image in fullscreenIbtisam with her children: Hossam, 10, Jinan, 9, Layan, 8, and Mahmoud, 4.

In December 2023, her husband, Hamza, was killed in an Israeli drone strike along with an uncle and a cousin as they searched for food in the ruins of their former home.“I didn’t scream or fall apart when I found them. I thanked God that I was able to find and bury them. The hospital refused to receive or shroud them, saying they were already decomposing and there were no burial shrouds. So we wrapped them in blankets and buried them ourselves,” Ghalia, 32, remembered.“My children cried every day, asking to see their father. The older two [now 10 and nine] wept constantly, wanting to see him again. I kept comforting them, saying we’ll reunite with him in heaven.”Last week, Ghalia’s sister was hit in the leg by a stray bullet while she was cooking beside the tent.Every day her eldest son, 10-year-old Hossam, heads out into the surrounding wasteland to search for firewood. There is no other fuel, with no cooking gas available and benzene supplies so low that two-thirds of Gaza’s remaining battered fleet of ambulances have been immobilised and only a third of generators in the territory are working.“If he is just a little late coming back, I panic. I cannot lose a son as well as my husband. But we have to cook somehow so I have to send him off. He is only 10 but like an adult now with all his duties and worries.”Her daughter Jinan, 9, has recurrent nightmares about explosions and scattered body parts.“I miss my old life so much. I miss my father – his voice and his smell. He used to take us for kebabs at the weekend. Now, there’s nothing to buy in the markets. Water we get from the nearby school or from water trucks that come to the camp. My older brother and I carry it to our tent,” she said.“I miss school so much. My mother told me that when I grow up, I will become a teacher because I love learning, and I hope I succeed in that … All I fear now is losing one of my siblings. I have nightmares in which I see people being killed, and lots of blood.”View image in fullscreen‘I miss my father’: Jinan, 9, has been left bereft by the loss of their father, Hamza.

Each day is worse than the one before,” Shawa said.Israeli officials justify the blockade on Gaza with claims that Hamas routinely steals aid, distributing it to its fighters or selling it to raise vital funds. Aid officials in Gaza deny any widespread theft of aid in recent months, though say looting is on the increase since hostilities recommenced “due to the desperate humanitarian situation”.The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise attack launched by Hamas into Israel in October 2023, in which militants killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostages. Israeli officials say one aim of the blockade is to pressure Hamas to release the 59 hostages who remain in Gaza, more than half of whom are thought to be dead.According to the ministry of health in Gaza, between 22 and 30 April, 437 Palestinians were killed and 1,023 were injured. In all, 52,400 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed in the war, including more than 2,300 since Israel renewed its offensive in mid-March after reneging on a promise to move to a second phase of the fragile ceasefire which came into force in January.“We just want to live in safety. We want the fear to end, the war to stop, life to return to how it used to be. We want our homes back,” Ghalia said, then turned back to counting her dwindling supplies.

I always have done, despite what some people in that country have done. I miss the UK. And it’s really quite sad I won’t be able to show my children my homeland.”Harry had sought to overturn changes to his security provision while in the UK, which were made after he and the Duchess of Sussex stepped away from royal duties in 2020.He was offered “bespoke” security, which he felt was inferior and claimed the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (known as Ravec), which authorises security measures, had breached its own terms of reference by not conducting a risk management board (RMB) before making the decision.He insisted his father could help resolve the issue, though he had not asked him to intervene. “I can only come to the UK safely if I am invited, and there is a lot of control and ability in my father’s hands.“Ultimately, this whole thing could be resolved through him, not by intervening, but by stepping aside and allowing the experts to do what is necessary and to carry out an RMB,” he said.It is understood it would have been constitutionally improper for the king to intervene while the matter was being considered by the government and reviewed by the courts.Although the royal household provides representation and input into the Ravec decision, Friday’s judgment laid out that the chair of the Ravec committee was the decision maker on the provision of security. Royal private offices and private secretaries should be consulted as to the practicalities of the protection measures agreed, the ruling said.Harry appealed to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, saying: “This all was initiated under a previous government. There is now a new government. I have had it described to me by people who know about the facts that this is a good old-fashioned establishment stitch-up. And that’s what it feels like.”Asked whether the prime minister should “step in”, he replied: “Yes, I would ask the prime minister to step in.“I would ask Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, to look at this very, very carefully and I would ask her to review Ravec and its members, because if it is an expert body, then what is the royal household’s role there if it is not to influence and decide what they want for the members of their household?”The prime minister would be “quite reluctant” to become involved in decisions about Harry’s security, a senior cabinet minister said on Friday night. Pat McFadden told Sky News: “I think he would be quite reluctant to make a judgment about someone’s personal security needs. We have experts who do that for a reason, and I’m not sure it’s a good idea for any politician to be saying that that person requires this level or that level of security.”On his family rift, Harry said: “There have been so manydisagreements, differences between me and some of my family. This current situation, that has been ongoing now for five years with regard to human life and safety as the sticking point. It is the only thing that’s left.“Of course some members of my family will never forgive me forwriting a book, of course they will never forgive me for lots of things, but … I would love reconciliation with my family.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t know how much longer my father has. He won’t speak to me because of this security stuff. But it would be nice to reconcile.”He added: “If they want that, it’s entirely up to them.”Harry said he could never leave the royal family, though he had left the “institution” because “I had to”.He continued: “Whether I have an official role or not is irrelevant to the threats, risk and impact on the reputation of the UK if something was to happen. What really worries me more than anything else about today’s decision [is that] it set a new precedent that security can be used to control members of the family, and effectively, what it does is imprison other members of the family from being able to choose a different life.”He claimed that, through the court disclosure process, he had “discovered that some people want history to repeat itself, which is pretty dark”. Asked who he meant, Harry declined to answer.In astatement released on the Sussexes’ website, Harry said: “Ravec’s ability to make decisions outside of its own policies and the so-called political sensitivities of my case have prevailed over the need for fair and consistent decision-making. The court has decided to defer to this, revealing a sad truth: my hands are tied in seeking legal recourse against the establishment.“This all comes from the same institutions that preyed upon my mother, that openly campaigned for the removal of our security, and that continue to incite hatred towards me, my wife and even our children, while at the same time protecting the very power that they should be holding accountable.”He told the BBC he was “devastated” by the court’s decision, adding: “Not so much devastated with the loss [as] about the people behind the decision feeling as though this is OK. Is it a win for them? I’m sure there are some people out there, probably most likely the people that wish me harm, [who] consider this a huge win.”He indicated that he would not be seeking a further legal challenge, saying Friday’s ruling had “proven that there was no way to win this through the courts”.A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said: “All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.”Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryMonarchyKing Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

This is a highly complex situation, which we continue to investigate in conjunction with the NCSC and the NCA.“We have implemented measures to ensure that we prevent unauthorised access to our systems whilst minimising disruption for our members, customers, colleagues and partners.“We now know that the hackers were able to access and extract data from one of our systems.

Speaking to a Daily Telegraph reporter outside the hearing, he suggested he considered the appeal more important than his other legal battle against tabloids, saying “this one always mattered the most”.Barristers for Harry, 40, told the appeal court that Ravec did not follow its own “terms of reference” when deciding his security.Shaheed Fatima KC said his safety, security and life were “at stake”, and that the “human dimension” of the case should not be forgotten.“We do say that his presence here, and throughout this appeal, is a potent illustration, were one needed, of how much this appeal means to him and his family,” said Fatima.The Home Office, which is legally responsible for Ravec’s decisions, opposed the appeal. Sir James Eadie KC, for the Home Office, said Ravec was faced with a “unique set of circumstances”.A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.”In a ruling on Friday, Vos, Lord Justice Bean and Lord Justice Edis dismissed Harry’s appeal.Reading a summary of the decision, Vos said:”The Duke was in effect stepping in and out of the cohort of protection provided by Ravec.“Outside the UK, he was outside the cohort, but when in the UK, his security would be considered as appropriate.”He continued: “It was impossible to say that this reasoning was illogical or inappropriate, indeed it seemed sensible.”A high court judge ruled last year that Ravec’s decision, taken in early 2020 after Harry andMeghan, the Duchess of Sussex, stepped down as senior working royals, was lawful. Harry’s legal team argued the judge had erred in his judgment.Ravec’s final decision, shared on 28 February 2020, stated thatMetropolitan policeprotection would no longer be appropriate after the Sussexes’ departure, and that they should receive a different degree of protection when in the UK.The Sussexes would instead receive a “bespoke” security service, whereby they would be required to give 30 days’ notice of any plans to travel to the UK, with each visit being assessed for threat levels and whether protection is needed.Critics of Harry have said he raised his own profile as a possible terrorist target in 2023 after disclosing in his memoir Spare that he had killed 25 Taliban fighters.Harry could appeal, but would need permission to do so, according to the legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg.“There wasn’t an application for permission just now from the court of appeal. There might be one in writing. If permission is refused, then Prince Harry’s lawyers could go and ask the supreme court for permission,” Rozenberg told Sky News.“But what the supreme court will look at is whether this is a case of general public interest, general public importance. It seems to me it’s one of very, very specific importance to Prince Harry.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK government’s protective security system is rigorous and proportionate.”Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryHome OfficeMonarchyMeghan, the Duchess of SussexMetropolitan policePolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Its candidate Andrea Jenkyns, the former Conservative minister, easily won the new mayoralty of Greater Lincolnshire, and the party also took the mayoralty in Hull and East Yorkshire.Graph of byelection resultBy late on Friday, Reform had taken control of 10 councils – Durham, Kent, Lincolnshire, Lancashire, Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, North Northamptonshire, Doncaster and West Northamptonshire – with a gain of 648 seats.The Tories lost all 15 of the councils they were defending.‘They really are all horrible’: political anger marks Reform UK’s Runcorn winRead moreWhile moving from a protest party to one with responsibility for policy and delivery could bring risks, Farage used a victory rally in County Durham to pledge a pushback against equality and diversity programmes and allowing council staff to work from home.“I would advise anyone who’s working for Durham county council on climate change initiatives, or diversity, equity and inclusion, or thinks they can go on working from home, I think you had all better really be seeking alternative careers very, very quickly,” he warned.Farage also said Reform would resist asylum seekers being accommodated in Reform-run areas, while Jenkyns called for them to be placed in tents. “I say no to putting people in hotels. Tents are good enough for France, they should be good enough for here in Britain,” Jenkyns said, an apparent reference to the makeshift camps used by asylum seekers along the French coast.A rout of Conservative councillors had been widely predicted, including by Badenoch, in part because the party had done so well the last time the seats were contested, during the short-lived Covid “vaccine bounce” under Boris Johnson in 2021.But the shedding of so many seats – by late Friday there was a net loss above 50% – plus the fourth place in the projected vote share will place renewed pressure on Badenoch, whose insistence of a slow buildup on policy ideas has worried some of her MPs.The Liberal Democrats made renewed gains in previously Conservative heartlands, taking control in Oxfordshire as the Tories lost 15 seats, and also taking over in Cambridgeshire and Shropshire. The Greens picked up dozens of new councillors and came third in the West of England mayoral race, one they had harboured hopes of winning.More surprising was the scale of Labour losses, with the party losing proportionally fewer seats than the Tories, but with some major localised drubbings, such as a net loss of 38 seats in Durham and 27 in Lancashire.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer visited a defence factory in Luton on Friday.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesSpeaking on a visit to a defence factory in Luton, Starmer said: “What I want to say is, my response is, we get it. We were elected in last year to bring about change … I am determined that we will go further and faster on the change that people want to see.”Labour officials accepted that some results had been bad but in part blamed a greater-than-expected collapse in the Tory vote, which helped Reform make gains in three-way contests.A Labour source said there were some signs of government policies starting to resonate with voters, pointing to Ros Jones holding off Reform to keep the Doncaster mayoralty following central investment to reopen the local airport.“Doncaster is a good example of the sort of muscular government that voters notice,” the source said. “When the PM says further and faster, it’s about positive change, now we’ve made the difficult fiscal decisions.”It was nonetheless notable that Jones was among the most vocal critics of Starmer’s record on Friday, highlighting cuts to the winter fuel allowance as a subject stoking voters’ anger, as well as reductions in disability payments and a rise in national insurance.View image in fullscreenLabour’s Ros Jones speaks to supporters as she is declared the winner of the mayoral elections in Doncaster.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesAsked whether the prime minister was listening to her voters, Jones said: “I would say no. They haven’t actually realised, because the people of Doncaster know how hard life can be, and it’s about delivering for them.”Pat McFadden, a senior cabinet member, said late on Friday that Labour would “welcome” a contest with a Reform party that wants to “rewind the clock”.Pointing to comments from Jenkyns, who saidReform UKwould “reset Britain to its glorious past”, McFadden said: “We’re in a fast-changing world, we’ve got a changing security situation here in Europe, a changing trade picture, massive technological change.“If the battle in the future is one side saying they want to rewind the clock and another side saying we’re going to lead you into the future, we will make the most of these changes, we’re going to try to have Britain best placed in this changing world, then that’s a battle that we will welcome.”There was criticism from a number of Labour MPs, albeit with those going public tending to be from the left of the party.Others did join in. Ayesha Hazarika, a Labour peer and former adviser, said the party needed to “admit that some mistakes were made, like the winter fuel allowance”. Speaking on Times Radio, she said the result in Runcorn would “throw up some big questions about the strategy and the operation”.When given anonymously, the verdict was particularly damning. One seniorLabourMP said: “I was quite shocked at how complacent the campaign was, especially in Runcorn but nationally as well. Everyone seemed convinced we were going to win by a reasonably comfortable margin.“The NHS message does not work against Farage, but the centre wouldn’t hear it, or the fact that Keir’s unpopularity was brought up on almost every door.”A second Labour MP said: “The boys in No 10 should spend less time briefing about who’s driving the train and more time actually getting on with building the tracks.”A third said: “It’s all very well for No 10 to say we’ve got to keep delivering. The problem is that it’s the stuff we’ve delivered that people hate.”Explore more on these topicsLocal elections 2025Local electionsReform UKLabourConservativesLiberal DemocratsGreen partynewsShareReuse this content"

Reform campaigned principally on anti-immigrant sentiment, which Farage had long sought to cultivate. The Liberal Democrats also made more modest inroads in some councils, mostly at the expense of the Conservatives.Across the country, Reform won a 30% share of the vote, leaving Labour second with 20%, Liberal Democrats on 17% and the Conservatives relegated to fourth with 15% of the votes‘They really are all horrible’: political anger marks Reform UK’s Runcorn winRead moreThe one parliamentary byelection being fought on Thursday was Runcorn and Helsby, near Liverpool in England’s north-west, wherethe sitting Labour MP had been convicted of punching a constituent. It had been a solid Labour seat that the party won with 53% of the vote at the general elections, butit lost by six votes to Reform on Thursday, in a rebuke to the prime minister, Keir Starmer.Starmer admitted the results were “disappointing” and said he would draw lessons from the setback, adding: “We need to go faster on the change that people want to see.”Starmer has sought to compete with Reform by announcingstricter policies to contain illegal immigration, but many in his party have complained he has steered too far to the right and alienated Labour’s traditional supporters by introducing austerity measures such ascutting winter fuel payments for elderly people.Political analysts said Reform had performed particularly well in areas with a lot of pensioners and few university graduates.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the result showed that the country was “fed up” with the Labour government but “still not yet ready to trust us”.Speaking at a rally in Durham, where Reform won 65 of the 98 council seats, Farage claimed the vote “marks the end of two-party politics as we have known it for over a century in this country”. He said it was the “beginning of the end of the Conservative party”.Farage, who hashailed Donald Trump as his “inspiration”, said that in the county councils where Reform was now in charge, the party would try to block government efforts to house asylum-seekers in local hotels.Asked if councils had the power to do that, he replied: “We’ll give it a go.”Explore more on these topicsLocal elections 2025Reform UKDonald TrumpEnglandLocal politicsLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

The students in Swarthmore,Pennsylvania, were suspended without due process and were told to evacuate from campus, said Swarthmore’s Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) in a2 May statement.Of the six students who were temporarily suspended, four werepeople of colorand three were first-generation, low-income students, the statement continued: “This is part of a disturbing trend of Swarthmore exploiting the vulnerabilities of student protesters on the basis of racialized discrimination.” The students on interim suspension are banned from attending college events or stepping foot on campus. Swarthmore SJP did not respond to a request for comment by the publication date.In a 1 Maystatementto the campus community, Swarthmore College’s president, Valerie Smith, said that the protesters had vandalized campus property. “Should they continue to fail to disperse and violate the college’s policies and the law,” Smith said, “we will have no choice but to escalate our response as we consider all actions to bring the encampment to an end.”SJP used social media to encourage activists outside of the college to join the encampment, Smith said, and they ignored repeated requests to vacate Trotter Lawn, where they erected the camp. “We informed students multiple times, both verbally and in writing, that they were violating several policies in the student code of conduct. Students were instructed to disband the encampment and leave Trotter Lawn, and repeatedly warned that failure to do so would lead to interim suspensions.”Swarthmore College isone of 60 schoolsunder investigation for what the Trump administration considers antisemitic harassment on campus.Trump repeats legally dubious threat to ‘take away’ Harvard’s tax-exempt statusRead moreA handful of higher-education institutions have started campus encampments this spring in a revival of last year’s pro-Palestinian movement in opposition to Israel’s war on Gaza, where at least62,000 Palestinianshave been killed since 7 October 2023, when roughly 1,100 Israelis were killed. But this year, pro-Palestinian campus protests have been dampened by crackdowns and punitive measures from theTrump administration.On Yale University’s campus in late April, hundreds of student protesters set up an encampment thatdispersedwithin a couple of days.

The USDA had suspended those dollars after Maine officialssaidthe state would not comply with Donald Trump’s demands that trans girls be barred from participating in girls’ sports.In February, when the president directly threatened to revoke funding from the state at a White House meeting with governors, Janet Mills, Maine’s Democratic governor,had responded, “We’ll see you in court,” in a widely shared exchange.Maine thensued the USDA last monthto maintain its funding and agreed on Friday to drop its lawsuit in exchange for the restoration of funds.“It’s good to feel a victory like this,” the governor said a press conference, thePortland Press Herald reported. “I stood in the White House and when confronted by the president of the United States, I told him I’d see him in court. Well, we did see him in court, and we won.”The governor said USDA had frozen funds for a program that helps feed 172,000 children in the state, the paper reported.The USDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The settlement says the USDA and Brooke Rollins, the secretary of agriculture, “agree to refrain from freezing, termination, or otherwise interfering with the state of Maine’s access to United States Department of Agriculture funds … based on alleged violations of Title IX without first following all legally required procedures”.The Trump administration had alleged that Maine’s policy of allowing transgender youth’s participation in sports violated Title IX, the federal anti-discrimination law.Maine’s attorneys argued that the child nutrition program received or was due to receive more than $1.8m for the current fiscal year. Prior year funds that were awarded but are currently inaccessible total more than $900,000, the lawsuit said. The complaint also said that the program was anticipating about $3m that is typically awarded every July for summer meal program sponsor administration and meal reimbursement.A federal judge had ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze funds last month after finding that Maine was likely to succeed in its legal challenge.Aaron Frey, the Maine attorney general, said in a statement on Friday: “It’s unfortunate that my office had to resort to federal court just to get USDA to comply with the law and its own regulations.“But we are pleased that the lawsuit has now been resolved and that Maine will continue to receive funds as directed by Congress to feed children and vulnerable adults.”The settlement does not affectanother ongoing lawsuitfiled by the Trump administration against the Maine department of education over its policy for trans athletes.Mills said Friday she was “confident” the state would also prevail in that case, the Portland Press Herald reported. The governor, who has said the dispute was aboutdefending states’ rights, added: “These bullying tactics, we will not tolerate them.”Explore more on these topicsMaineTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The state park is roughly 16 miles (26km) west of Yellowstone.Authorities have not said what led to the crash.Both vehicles caught fire, the Idaho state police said in a press release. The driver of the Dodge Ram pickup and six people inside the Mercedes passenger van died. The van was carrying a tour group of 14 people, and the surviving occupants were taken to hospitals with injuries, a police spokesman, Aaron Snell, said.Air ambulances and emergency paramedics responded to the collision, which remains under investigation.The Fremont county coroner, Brenda Dye, was quoted by the New York Times as saying that the pickup driver was from Texas and that all six occupants of the van who died were from outside the United States, two of them from Italy.Roger Merrill, 60, was driving home when he saw the flames engulfing the two vehicles as bystanders tried to care for survivors from the van on the side of the highway. Merrill said he often saw tourist vans on the highway that leads to Yellowstone.“It is a very dangerous highway because it leads to the main entrance of Yellowstone national park,” he said. “It’s extremely busy.”Merrill captured video of the wreckage with smoke blanketing the van. Due to the remote location, Merrill said he anxiously awaited the help of first responders.“It took an unnervingly long time for help to arrive just because of the location,” he said.According to Dye, two eyewitnesses to the crash jumped out of their vehicle to pull victims from the van, and managed to extract eight people from the wreckage, including a child, before the van caught fire, the Times reported.The Idaho transportation department has identified the highway for safety improvements designed to reduce the severity of crashes, but the project is still in the research and planning phase.That portion of the highway had an average of about 10,500 vehicles traveling it daily in 2023, according to the agency.State police said the highway was closed in both directions for nearly seven hours while emergency and transportation crews worked to manage the scene and clear the roadway.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIdahonewsShareReuse this content"

The Palestinian American family were renting rooms from Czuba at a suburban Chicago house at the time of the attack.“No sentence can restore what was taken, but today’s outcome delivers a necessary measure of justice,” said Ahmed Rehab, executive director of Cair-Chicago. “Wadee was an innocent child. He was targeted because of who he was – Muslim, Palestinian, and loved.”The boy’s great-uncle, Mahmoud Yousef, was the only family member who spoke during the hearing. He said that no matter the sentence length it wouldn’t be enough. The boy’s parents had plans for him and Czuba robbed them of that, he said.Yousef asked Czuba to explain why he attacked the boy and his mother, asking him what news he heard that provoked him, but Czuba did not respond, the Chicago Tribune reported.Evidence at trial included harrowing testimony from Shaheen and her frantic 911 call, along with bloody crime scene photos and police video. Jurors deliberated for less than 90 minutes on Friday before handing in a verdict.Illinoisdoes not have the death penalty.‘An all-American boy’: Classmates mourn six-year-old Muslim boy stabbed to deathRead moreThe family had been renting rooms in Czuba’s home in Plainfield, about 40 miles (65km) from Chicago. Central to prosecutors’ case was harrowing testimony from the boy’s mother, who said Czuba attacked her before moving on to her son, insisting they had to leave because they were Muslim. Prosecutors also played the 911 call and showed police footage. Czuba’s wife, Mary, whom he has since divorced, also testified for the prosecution, saying he had become agitated about theIsrael-Gaza war, which had erupted days earlier.Police said Czuba pulled a knife from a holder on a belt and stabbed the boy 26 times, leaving the knife in the child’s body. Some of the bloody crime scene photos were so explicit that the judge agreed to turn television screens showing them away from the audience, which included Wadee’s relatives.“He could not escape,” Michael Fitzgerald, a Will county assistant state’s attorney, had told jurors at trial.The attack renewed fears of anti-Muslim discrimination and hit particularly hard in Plainfield and surrounding suburbs, which have a large and established Palestinian community.Separately, lawsuits have been filed over the boy’s death and the US Department of Justicehas launcheda federal hate-crimes investigation.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeIllinoisIsrael-Gaza warHate crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Spending reductions are also being projected for the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.In contrast to the squeeze on discretionary social programmes, the administration is planning a 13% rise – to more than $1tn – in the Pentagon budget, a commitment at odds with Trump’s frequent vows to end the US’s involvement in “forever wars” in the Middle East and elsewhere.The figures for the White House’s so-called “skinny budget” for 2026 represent a 22.6% cut in spending from that projected in the current fiscal year, which ends on 30 September.GOP budget goals impossible without Medicare and Medicaid cuts, budget office saysRead moreThey include big cuts to the National Institutes of Health – which undertakes extensive research on cures for diseases such as cancer – as well as for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but provide funding of $500m for the Make America healthy again initiative spearheaded by Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr.By contrast, the Department of Homeland Security – which oversees border security – would see its spending boosted by 65% in a graphic illustration of Trump’s intense focus on stemming the flow of migrants into the US.Non-defense discretionary spending refers to federal money that is reauthorised each year and generally covers areas like public health, transport and education. The latter sector faces cuts of $12bn under Trump’s plan.But it does not cover the highly sensitive areas of Medicare, Medicaid and social security, which provide healthcare and support for retirees and the poor and which the president has vowed to leave untouched. That has drawn widespread scepticism from Democrats, who accuse the Republican of plotting cuts to the programmes to pay for an extension of Trump’s sweeping 2017 tax cuts.The spending clampdown is consistent with the professed goals ofElon Musk’sunofficial “department of government efficiency” team, also known as Doge,which has infiltrated multiple federal agencies– including the Social Security Administration – in a supposed quest for “waste, fraud and abuse”. Doge’s aggressive onslaught has included the almost total shuttering ofUSAID, the federal agency for foreign assistance. The budget projections assume large-scale cuts to foreign aid.Russell Vought, director of the White House office of management and budget and a proponent of large-scale cuts to the federal workforce, said the plan was intended to tackle “wasteful spending and bloated bureaucracy”.“At this critical moment, we need a historic budget – one that ends the funding of our decline, puts Americans first, and delivers unprecedented support to our military and homeland security,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS defence spendingUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

The suggestion that Beijing was potentially willing to negotiate with Washington – along with a better than expected report on US jobs - sent markets higher on Friday on both sides of the Atlantic.Ren Yi, a nationalist blogger who writes under the nickname Chairman Rabbit, wrote that he had learned from sources that the US had “frequently and proactively contacted the Chinese side through various channels, hoping to negotiate with the Chinese government on economic and trade issues”.China has denied claims made by US officials that talks were already under way, or that China had initiated them. Trump said last week thatXi Jinping, China’s leader, had called him. China’s foreign ministry accused the US of “misleading the public” on the status of negotiations. Ren wrote: “If China had given in and taken the initiative to give in to the United States, then naturally there would not have been the United States taking the initiative to contact China.”Why is Trump ending the ‘de minimis’ tariff loophole on low-value imports?Read moreThe commerce ministry said on Friday that Washington needed to show “sincerity” in negotiations and that it should not engage in “coercion and extortion”.China has repeatedly accused the US of bullying in its approach to trade policies. The two countries have been at loggerheads since Trump launched a new US-China trade war in early April, with US tariffs on Chinese goods now at 145% while China’s retaliatory tariffs have reached 125%.But although neither side wants to be seen to blink first, the US and China have already introduced a number of exceptions to their respective tariffs tosoften the blowof a trade war that risksupending the global economy.Chinesefactory activity slowed in April. The statistics bureau blamed “sharp changes in [China’s] external environment” for the decline.This week Xi called on officials to adjust to changes in the international environment, although he did not mention the US by name.Elsewhere, Chinese propaganda has been more explicit. This week the foreign ministry releaseda videothat accused the US of bullying and said that bowing to such behaviour would be like “drinking poison”.A US executive order to close a multibillion-dollar tariff loophole, known as “de minimis”, came into effect on Friday.The ending of the de minimis regime, which allowed low-value goods to be shipped to the US without paying customs fees, primarily affects Chinese exporters.Scott Bessent said this week he was confident that China would want to reach a deal.

But Trump has sought to escalate this further,declaringan “energy emergency” to open up more land and ocean for drilling and launching an unprecedented assault on environmental regulations in his first 100 days back in the White House.This new political climate means that the expected amount of greenhouse gas emissions from active and planned projects in US oil and gas fields has jumped under Trump, after previously dropping under Biden, forecasts shared with the Guardian show.Despite awarding more drilling leases than Trump in his first 100 days, Biden also pursued policies to combat the climate crisis that saw oil and gas companies revise down their production estimates. That situation has now reversed, threatening a pulse of new pollution that will further add to the fever of a planet already suffering from heatwaves, floods, droughts and other disasters accelerated by global heating.“The uptick in embodied emissions from forecast US oil and gas production is worrying,” said Olivier Bois von Kursk, policy adviser at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, whichtracksemissions projections from the lifetime of projects, based on data from research consultancy Rystad Energy. “The world can’t afford more climate chaos.”Chart showing the relative emissions forecasts during the first four months of Biden in 2021 and Trump 2 in 2025. Chart shows emissions forecasts are rising under TrumpTrump has already takenmore than 140 initial actions to reverse environmental regulations and promote the use of fossil fuels, dismissing established climate science as a “giant hoax” and exhorting further drilling.“We have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth, and by far, and now I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it,” the president told Congress in March. “It’s called drill, baby, drill.”This unabashed support for fossil fuels has been warmly welcomed by the fossil fuel industry, which donated heavily to Trump’s campaign. While “drill, baby, drill” won’t fully be realized unless Trump manages to push through significant deregulation and tax cuts for the sector, the US will still move towards a record peak of 15m barrels of oil a day, up fromabout13.5m barrels a day now, according to projections by Rystad.“In his first 100 days, President Trump has kept his promise to ‘drill, baby, drill’,” said a White House spokesperson. “We’re achieving historic results at record speed and we’re just getting started.”The International Energy Agency, which has forecast that global oil and gas demand will peak by 2030, has said thatno new major fossil fuel projects can occurif the world is to stay within agreed temperature limits and avoid catastrophic climate impacts. Last year was the hottest, worldwide,ever recordedand governments are collectivelyfailingto meet targets to avert escalating disasters.Trump’s ambitions for more drilling in the US have been clouded, however, by his own economic policies. While oil and gas has beenexempt from a barrage of tariffsimposed by Trump, the industry is smarting from tariffs placed on materials such as steel, which it needs for pipelines, and has been unnerved byfears of recessionamid an increasingly erratictrade war.The first 100 days of Trump’s administration have been the worst start of any presidency for the stock market since the 1970s, engulfing many fossil fuel firms that have seen their share prices slump.The price of a barrel of American crude oil brieflydroppedbelow $60, a threshold under which companies cannot operate profitably, before edging up slightly in recent weeks. Opec, the oil cartel, recently increased production at the urging of Trump, further putting downward pressure on the oil price.This has stirred anger within an oil and gas sector that has otherwise cheered on Trump. “The administration’s chaos is a disaster for the commodity markets. ‘Drill, baby, drill’ is nothing short of a myth and populist rallying cry,” one executive told a surveyconducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.Said another: “I have never felt more uncertainty about our business in my entire 40-plus-year career.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Until really there is a settlement on the tariffs, there’s going to be a lot of volatility.”While Rystad expects concerns over a recession to pass, and the price of oil to climb back to around $70 a barrel later this year, the outlook for renewable energy may be more difficult, with solar and wind projects facing potential cost increases of up to 30% due to the tariffs and attempts by Trump and Republicans in Congress to eliminate support for clean energy.Trump has already halted approvals of new solar and wind projects on federal lands and waters and criticized what he calls “scam” subsidies for clean energy. Tariffs on solar panels from Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia have beenratchetedup to as much as 3,521%. “We don’t want windmills in this country,” the president said shortly after his inauguration in January. “We don’t want windmills. You know what else people don’t like? Those massive solar fields.”While more than 90% of new power added to the US electricity grid this year isexpectedto be from solar, wind and batteries, the administration’s turn against renewables is already affecting planned projects that areoverwhelmingly located in Republican rural and exurban districts.Nearly $8bn in planned investments and 16 large-scale clean energy projects were shut, cancelled or downsized in the first three months of the year, according to E2, a nonpartisan business group. “Clean energy companies still want to invest in America, but uncertainty overTrump administrationpolicies and the future of critical clean energy tax credits are taking a clear toll,” said Michael Timberlake, a spokesperson for E2.Economic disruptions from the fluctuating price of oil, as well the climate impacts from burning oil and other fossil fuels, can be alleviated if “governments and investors make smart choices”, said von Kursk. “Clean energy is more competitive than ever, eroding demand for fossil fuels.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOil and gas companiesTrump tariffsClimate crisisRenewable energyDonald TrumpEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

As part of Donald Trump’sflurry of tariffson China, the US is closing a loophole that allowed low-value goods to be shipped into the US without paying any import fees. The “de minimis” loophole, known by the Latin phrase for “of little importance”, was “a big scam going on against our country”, the US president said on Wednesday. “We put an end to it.”What is the ‘de minimis’ loophole?“De minimis” refers to a trade policy introduced in the 1930s that allowed travellers returning to the US to bring goods with them worth up to $5 without declaring them to customs. Since 2016, the threshold has been $800 (£600).The term “de minimis” may mean “of little importance”, but the policy is responsible for a huge volume of consumer goods. About 1.36bn shipments entered the US via the loophole in the fiscal year 2024, more than double the number four years earlier, according to the US customs agency. That represents more than 90% of all the cargo entering the US. About 60% of those packagescome from China.As of Friday, parcels worth less than $800 will be subject to a 120% levy or a flat fee of $100, rising to $200 from June. That is on top of the 145% tariffs already placed on all Chinese imports, as part of thewider US-China trade war.Why is Trump closing the ‘de minimis’ loophole?The White House has accused sellers in China of “deceptive shipping practices” to take advantage of the loophole. Industry associations in the US have complained of unfair competition from Chinese sellers and have beenpushing for yearsfor the loophole to be closed.Trump also argues that the free flow of small packages into the US has allowed deadly drugs, especiallyfentanyland the chemicals used to make it, to arrive unchecked into the country. “These exports play a significant role in the synthetic opioid crisis in the United States,” Trump said in anexecutive orderin April.What does it mean for buying cheap goods in the US?Prices will probably increase and some options have become unavailable. The Chinese e-commerce company Temu announced on Friday that it would stop shipping low-cost items from China and sell directly to US consumers. The fast-fashion company Shein has also reportedly already started increasing the prices of some goods. Data compiled byBloombergfound that the average price for the top 100 products sold by Shein in the beauty and health category increased by 51% in the past week, while a 10-piece set of kitchen towels increased in price by 377%. The average increase for women’s clothing was 8%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is hoped that increased checks on small packages will allow more illicit imports to be apprehended.Before 2020, the year after China cracked down onfentanyl suppliers, 90% of the fentanyl consumed in the US came directly from China. Now nearly all of the supply comes across the US-Mexico border, not from packages shipped directly from China.How has China reacted?China’s government and trade associations say the pain will be felt by American consumers rather than Chinese exporters. He Yongqian, a spokesperson for the commerce ministry, said earlier this year that the US tariff hikes “will undoubtedly increase costs for American consumers and degrade their shopping experience”.Industry groups, including the China textiles association, have backed the government’s position and accused the US of “hegemonic actions”, according to Chinese state media.Shein is reportedly considering pausing its widely anticipated London IPO, amid uncertainty around how the tariffs will affect its business. The company did not respond to a request for comment.JD.com, one of China’s e-commerce companies, has promise to buy 2bn yuan (£206.6m) worth of products from Chinese exporters to sell in the domestic market.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsInternational tradeTrump administrationChinaAsia PacificexplainersShareReuse this content"

It said it had never received a request for user data from Chinese authorities, or provided user data to them.TikTok was also ordered to suspend data transfers to China if its processing was not brought into compliance within six months.China’s National Intelligence Law of 2017, for instance, states that all organisations and citizens shall “support, assist and cooperate” withnational intelligence efforts.The DPC said data had been “remotely accessed by [TikTok] staff in China”.The watchdog also stated that TikTok had submitted “erroneous information” to its inquiry. TikTok initially told the regulator that it did not store user data from the EEA, but admitted last month that it did allow “limited” European user data to be stored in China.The Dublin-based regulator said it took the “inaccurate” submission very seriously and was considering whether further regulatory action was needed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Belgian’s dart into the box and clinical finish secured a fourth Premier League win in a row, at the expense of Wolves, to put City into third place and a step closer to qualifying for the Champions League.Manchester City v Wolves: Premier League – liveRead moreCity will be as pleased with the hard-fought victory, inspired by a humorous Neil Warnock team talk at training on Thursday, as Wolves are disappointed to leave with nothing. They rattled the woodwork twice and were the more dangerous team inside the box but when it comes to critical moments, there are few better in world football than De Bruyne as his experience outweighs his physical decline.“I am pretty sure it is not easy for him but the goal was massively important for us, it lifted our spirits,” Pep Guardiola said. “He does not have to prove anything, I know his quality, his level.”What Warnock made of City playing without a conventional striker is up for debate. De Bruyne, on his penultimate home game for City, was given freedom to roam in the final third as the hosts looked to dominate possession. Ilkay Gündogan and the Belgian rotated who was down the middle, while Omar Marmoush and Jérémy Doku attacked the flanks, looking to get in behind Wolves’ wing-banks, while creating space in the middle.With Vítor Pereira in charge, Wolves are very different from the brittle team that started the season under Gary O’Neil. They had won six in a row and were not intimidated by City, keeping things tight and every man working for everyone else in gold to limit the hosts all over the pitch.Wolves also have pace going forward and should have taken the lead when Matheus Cunha slipped a pass through a flat-footed City defence for Jean-Ricner Bellegarde to run on to. The winger raced into the box where he was joined by Marshall Munetsi and, having drawn out Ederson, he needed only to lay it to the Zimbabwean but overhit the pass, leaving the midfielder desperately stretching to reach it as the ball dribbled out for a goal kick.View image in fullscreenKevin De Bruyne tucks home the winner for Manchester City.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PACity were living dangerously, unable to deal with Wolves’ fast break. Rayan Aït-Nouri had two chances to open the scoring, first hitting a post and then Josko Gvardiol on the line with the rebound. City were enjoying the possession but Wolves looked the more dangerous, although Nico O’Reilly eventually tested José á after the half-hour mark with a rising shot.De Bruyne made Wolves pay and there was never a more popular scorer. Gündogan played in Doku, who showed off his quick feet, pulling the ball for his compatriot mid-slip, allowing the City captain to place into the bottom corner and instigated a chorus of “There’s only one Kevin De Bruyne” around the ground.There wasno new contract offer to De Bruyneand he will leave when his current deal expires in the summer. No one doubts that he still has the ability to influence games but Guardiola and City need players who can do so regularly. De Bruyne’s body has let him down in recent years but his trademark energy and vigour have returned for his swansong, able to offer the bursting runs and skills that have bedevilled opponents over the past decade. “A lot of teammates have said that it’s sad I have to go too but that’s just how it goes sometimes in life,” De Bruyne said. “I don’t know what the future will be, but I know that I can still play here.”Wolves have their talisman planning a summer exit but Cunha will be in much higher demand than De Bruyne. It was a sign of how dangerous Wolves were despite having to play on the break. City were increasingly sloppy in possession, allowing the visitors to frequently counter. O’Reilly was hooked by Guardiola for repeatedly giving the ball away, as Manuel Akanji was brought on to strengthen a susceptible back four, while the returning Erling Haaland remained unused.Wolves’ fight for parity almost took a huge blow when Aït-Nouri tried to perform a 360 degree turn, only to put his studs into Bernardo Silva’s ankle. VAR took a lengthy look but it was deemed no further action was required from the referee, Peter Bankes. “In the end I am very happy, very proud of my team, my players and supporters,” Pereira said. “Just the result was not right.”De Bruyne departed with seven minutes to go, giving fans a penultimate opportunity of a standing ovation, with Bournemouth’s upcoming visit his curtain call that is likely to include plenty of pomp and ceremony for the departing legend. He deserved the latest one for his performance on the night, not just for the sake of nostalgia. There is still plenty of time for that to come as City prepare to bid farewell to one of their heroes but he will leave with plenty of memories.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Now we run them to deathElizabeth BanickiFor centuries the horse was our most noble ally – in war, migration and myth. Today we repay that bond not with reverence, but with suffering at the racetrackFri 2 May 2025 04.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 04.54 EDTShareHumanity owes the horse an immeasurable debt. For centuries the horse has been our partner, has shaped our history and sacrificed itself for our defense, our causes, and our conquests. The Native American Comanches, master horsemen, created an empire on the power they conjured from their deep and unique connection with the horse. The horse was critical to their existence as it became to the white settlers of the western frontier who would never have prevented their own annihilation had they not adopted the native’s mounted war techniques. Yet modern society, which has long abandoned warring on horseback, still tolerates dangerous and violent exploitation of the horse. Indeed, taxpayers fund it. Despite the sacrifices these allies have made for our evolution, we continue to demand they forfeit their lives, but not for so noble a cause as our survival. Today horses die not in battle but for sport. Another Triple Crown season means another cache of young horses who will publicly risk their lives for profit and entertainment. Hence the life of the American racehorse, run to death by the hundreds every year, is cheapened and disrespected.Horses are central tomy personal history, and I am bedeviled by memories of my track life, my former self. Years ago, I was galloping racehorses and immersed wholly in the world of racing. I admit to this day as a rider I have pride in my past. Though now as I get older and think more broadly my sense of the wrongness of modern American racing expands to include the context of the historical and philosophical sacrifices horses have made for humans and how dismissed their enormous contributions generally are. Whether one’s love for the horse manifests in the act of dressing up for a day at the races or in recognizing and being honest about the reality of how brutal racing can be to horses it is critical to think of the animal itself and to consider the countless horses who have died and will die for the trivial activity of racing. For them my heart aches. For those who acknowledge that reality and still defend and endorse racing, I am bewildered by that degree of callousness. The human ego is the horse’s most vile predator.The racing industry boasts an era of new tech and practices that it claims lead to fewer deaths which is like saying we are still stealing, we are just stealing a little less. Do we applaud for the killing of fewer horses? To evaluate racing from a position of realism can only lead to the obvious conclusion that it is time to evolve away from this sport that subjugates so many horses to a life of misery and untimely death. It is hopeful to imagine that racing can be done in partnership with the horse and without taking its life but all the intelligence and creativity in the world won’t achieve that.View image in fullscreenA horse is washed after a training session on Thursday prior to the running of the 151st Kentucky Derby.Photograph: Grace Bradley/Getty ImagesOur technological gains as a society do not and cannot compensate for our shortcomings in empathy and decency. Should our society continue to tolerate a sport that routinely and violently kills horses, a creature who has been a solid friend across the ages, we only expose our backwardness. The racing industry’s willingness to sacrifice horses for money and prestige lays bare the fact that despite grandiose proclamations of advancement it is by nature primitive. To enter the starting gate in 2025 and die without finishing the race is no progress for the horse whose ancestors stepped onto a battlefield in 1800 and never saw the end of the fight. Modern day horse racing is simply bad medicine.That night he dreamt of horses in a field on a high plain where the spring rains had brought up the grass and the wildflowers out of the ground and the flowers ran all blue and yellow far as the eye could see and in the dream he was among the horses running and in the dream he himself could run with the horses and they coursed the young mares and fillies over the plain where their rich bay and their rich chestnut colors shone in the sun and the young colts ran with their dams and trampled down the flowers in a haze of pollen that hung in the sun like powdered gold and they ran he and the horses out along the high mesas where the ground resounded under their running hooves and they flowed and changed and ran and their manes and tails blew off of them like spume and there was nothing else at all in that high world and they moved all of them in a resonance that was like a music among them and they were none of them afraid neither horse nor colt nor mare and they ran in that resonance which is the world itself and which cannot be spoken but only praised.Cormac McCarthy, All the Pretty HorsesExplore more on these topicsKentucky DerbyHorse racingUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

The expectation and anticipation for when the team, backed by General Motors, hits the grid as Formula One’s 11th entry for the first race of 2026 is ratcheting up with every passing second.Appropriately for this all‑American marque, the team are launching their F1 entry on Saturday night with a red-carpet event at Miami Beach after the sprint race and qualifying have concluded at the Hard Rock Stadium circuit.Lewis Hamilton leads call for F1 drivers to be given more say in talks with FIARead moreBacked by GM and the TWG Motorsports group, their effort is a full-on startup rather than the more well-trodden route of buying an existing team, with all the expense and resources and perils and pitfalls that entails.At the helm almost since its inception has been Graeme Lowdon, one of the very few F1 personnel who can lay claim to having already done it and who knows how quickly the time will go between now and lights out in Australia next year.“We have on all of our facilities, on the wall of every office, a countdown clock which is showing the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds to the start of our first grand prix,” he says. “We don’t want to be in a position where there’s some mad panic at the end.”Lowdon is Cadillac’s British team principal and the 60-year-old has been here before, albeit in altogether different circumstances. He was integral to the Manor F1 team for their entry in 2010, a task he describes as starting in an empty room with a screwdriver and an A4 sheet of paper and ending up seven months later on the grid.Cadillac’s road to F1 has enjoyed a significantly longer gestation but did have similarly humble beginnings when, in August 2022, Lowdon and two others were asked to begin planning what would ultimately develop into the GM works-backed team.View image in fullscreenSergio Pérez has been mentioned as a possible driver for Cadillac for 2026.Photograph: Vince Mignott/MB Media/Getty ImagesThe initial phase involved small steps without any certainty of an entry, the process grinding slowly through the FIA and F1. But the team had to be constructed because starting cold if and when entry was granted would have made the task all but impossible. Lowdon had to recruit without using the phrase “Formula One team” with euphemisms such as “top-tier motorsport opportunity”.Nonetheless, the process went on and when GM came on board and committed to building its own engine for 2029 it was a gamechanger. Atthe Las Vegas GP in November,the Cadillac entry, using Ferrari engines until then, was agreed.The expansion since has been exponential. They are recruiting, on average, one person a day and are in the process of completing a new headquarters at Fishers in Indianapolis. It will sit alongside their facilities already in operation at Silverstone – the European hub – and the GM works in Charlotte, North Carolina, where they are building the facility to manufacture the new engine.Lowdon, however, has stressed the importance of people and many of the key roles have been filled as the project progressed. The chief designer is Lowdon’s former colleague from Manor, John McQuilliam, and the head of aerodynamics is Jon Tomlinson, from Williams. Nick Chester, formerly of Renault is the technical director, Peter Crolla is on board as the team manager from Haas and Pat Symonds, of Benetton, Renault and Williams, is an engineering consultant.Welcome to Miami, where F1’s sunshine party draws a crowd every sport cravesRead moreAssembling them and other personnel was indicative of how seriously the project was being taken, believes Lowdon. “It’s a huge, huge, huge testament to the owners. Throughout that whole time we were building a Formula One team but without certainty of an entry and that’s a commitment.”Even with the recruitment drive, the quest to get up to speed is going to be enormously hard, although Lowdon is calm and believes they are on target to do so. They have still to reach the first hurdle of completing the build and fire-up of the car – there is a countdown clock for that too. A functioning race team must be honed for competition and then what seems almost a bagatelle in comparison but which will attract the greatest attention, the task of hiring the drivers.The team will not discuss names of whom they are engaging in talks with but there is naturally some expectation that such a proud American brand will want an American driver in a seat. It was the original Andretti-Cadillac team’s attempted entry into F1 that transformed into the GM-backed Cadillac works entry. Mario Andretti remains an adviser and Andretti’s American IndyCar driver Colton Herta is considered a likely candidate, as is the experienced Sergio Pérez who is believed to be being actively pursued. Lowdon says the decision will be made on merit but notes US drivers are in that mix.View image in fullscreenGraeme Lowdon: ‘It’s a really, really big task.’Photograph: Every Second Media/AlamyThe importance for F1 of having a US manufacturer cannot be played down. F1 has one American team in Haas but this is a different ballgame. It is an American team backed by a global manufacturer with a long history in motorsport. Their entry is indicative of the weight they attach to F1 in selling their brand across the world and of the increasing significance of the sport in the US, which, as Lowdon, says has the potential to create an “enormous” fanbase.Which, for the moment, remains the stuff of ambitious intent in the boardrooms and perhaps the daydreams of fleeting moments for those at the sharp end of making it happen and for whom the clock never stops.“It’s a really, really big task,” says Lowdon. “The first race of next year we need to be on the grid. We can’t turn up a week later and just say: ‘Everyone else had the race last week, we’ll have it this week.’ That just won’t wash.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s an extraordinary turnaround in his careerAndrew LawrenceFri 2 May 2025 04.15 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 15.28 EDTShareFootball has never known a control freak like Bill Belichick, the Nixonian figure who ran the New England Patriots as if their facility was a CIA black site. But four months into Belichick’s new coaching tenure, at the University of North Carolina, there is a stunning lack of clarity about who’s actually in charge.Belichick was not the obvious choice to revitalize the Tar Heels. Not only does he lack any college coaching experience, he is dour, cold and gruff – traits you imagine might turn off a high school prospect who could choose to play for Deion Sanders, Lane Kiffin or another charismatic sideline general instead. Belichick is also 73 and deeply set in his ways, part of the reason why the Patriots fired him in 2023 after 24 years of service. No other NFL team has hired him since: the Atlanta Falcons considered Belichick for their head coaching vacancy in 2024, but wound up passing after Patriots owner Bob Kraft reportedly warned his Falcons counterpart, Arthur Blank, “not to trust Bill”. (The Patriotsdeny the allegation.)That’s not to say that Belichick didn’t haveanythingto recommend him for UNC. He did, after all, win a record six Super Bowls as Patriots head coach. But so far the most discussed figure in the program isn’t a player, coach or Belichick himself, weirdly. It’s Jordon Hudson, Belichick’s 24-year-old girlfriend.Hudson isn’t some trailblazing football careerist. She’s a fresh catch, the product of Maine fishing stock, a former cheerleader and beauty queen. (Incidentally, she’s slated to compete in the Miss Maine USA pageant later this month alongside the competition’s first transgender entrant – a political football this story is nowhere near ready for.) As the coach tells it, the romance started on a 2021 flight from Boston to Miami with Belichick (then 69 years old) striking up a conversation with Hudson (20 at the time) as she was reading a book called Deductive Logic for an undergraduate philosophy class. “Thanks for giving me a course on logic!” Belichick gushed in an autograph inside the book. “Safe travels!” (Who knew the coach was a fan of exclamation points!)Hudson’s relationship with Belichick became publicafterhe left the Patriots, when the couplehard-launched at the American Museum of Natural History Galain 2024. Sports fans familiar with Belichick’s humorless public persona couldn’t help snickering at the coach playingHudson’s yoga prop, or the fisherman to her mermaid inan extraordinary Halloween shooton Instagram – or “Instaface”, as he once gibed. But even as Hudson emerged as a prominent figure in Belichick’s professional life, it didn’t seem as if she would interfere with Belichick’s mission to make UNC a football power.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueBut then last week Hudsoninserted herself into a CBS Sunday Morning interviewwith Belichick pegged to the coach’s forthcoming autobiography. Most only saw the25-second clip of Hudson interrupting Belichickjust as he was asked how he and Hudson met. “We’re not talking about this,” she snapped off-camera, effectively shutting down that line of questioning. But her response – admirably Belichickian, if we’re being totally honest – has just made rubberneckersmorecurious about the nature of their relationship. (Pro Football Talkreportedthat Hudson, a “constant presence” in the interview, actually interrupted CBS’ Tony Dokoupil more than once and even stormed off set, expecting Belichick would follow.) “I might actually reach out to him to make sure everything’s good, but I am concerned from what I’m hearing,” Charles Barkley said while discussing his longtime friendon a recent Dan Patrick Show appearance. “It’s not a good look, right, I’ll admit that.”Typically when May-December relationships become gossip fodder, the scrutiny falls hardest on the older party. Even though Tom Brady and other former Pats have been publicly supportive of the coach’s new girlfriend, there’s still reason to believe Belichick is the passenger in this relationship. Among other things, viewers were shocked to see Belichick appear on camera in a tattered Navy sweatshirt – which was taken less by internet critics as an extension of the coach’s well-known dishevelled dress sense than evidence of spousal neglect. (Also: was theTar Heelsteam shop closed?)That’s not all.According to the Athletic, Hudson played an instrumental role in shutting down production of the NFL docuseries Hard Knocks after North Carolina agreed to be the first college program featured on the show, costing the school a mammoth recruiting opportunity. Hudson has also reportedly taken anactive role in the football program’s public relations, demanding to be copied on email correspondence to steer strategy even though she is not employed by the university. Despite that massive technicality, Hudson is said to have advised UNC’s social media team to promote the accomplishments of defensive coordinator Stephen Belichick instead of stating what many believe – that he got to where he is because he’s Bill’s son. Hudson is even mentioned in the acknowledgements for Belichick’s book, while Kraft – the owner he won six titles with – was left out. (For what it’s worth, Stephen’s wife called Hudson’s conduct in the CBS interview “unprofessional”.) Belichick even lets Hudson on the field for footballpractices, which he has historically kept off-limits to outsiders.View image in fullscreenNorth Carolina football head coach Bill Belichick and his girlfriend Jordon Hudson look on during the first half of a March men’s basketball game between the Tar Heels and the Duke Blue Devils at the Dean E Smith Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.Photograph: Jared C Tilton/Getty ImagesWhile Belichick has since issued a lengthy (for him) statement defending Hudson, defining their relationship as “personal and professional”, there’s growing concern that UNC football could end up as the third wheel. A number of high-profile Tar Heel players have signaledtheir intention to transfer schools, and the incoming recruiting class, while solid for UNC, suggests post-NFL Belichick may even have less star power than previously thought. The more Belichick is in the headlines for what he does away from football, the harder it is to believe this is the same guy who kept the Patriots humming through two massive cheating scandals andthe Aaron Hernandez saga.What’s more, you can’t help wondering if he is indeed making this scene as a pretext to get out of his Tar Heels deal and leave them hangingjust as he did the New York Jets. (In an effort to prevent history repeating, the Tar Heels included a $10m buyout clause in his contract.) Only this much is clear: Belichick has already proven to be a far bigger headache than Mack Brown – the 72-year-old former national championship winner who was thought to be too old and dull to remain in the job.They say it’s never too late to start over in life. But Belichick’s college try has already become exactly the all-consuming, legacy-endangering, off-fielddistractionthat he once so famously disdained. Maybe the threat of Hudson taking over is why NFL teams ultimately passed Belichick over? At the very least it’s the kind of concern the old Bill would’ve red-flagged if it had come up with a player on his radar. When Belichick was in his New England heyday, you would’ve been hard pressed to find much information about the day-to-day status of histeam, much less his own personal life. (Heck, we didn’t really meet Belichick’s kids until they started working for him.) All of which is to say: he’s the last coach you’d expect to suddenly lose control over the narrative.Belichick’s inability to separate the personal from the professional when it comes to his relationship with Hudson doesn’t just bode ill for the North Carolina program. It’s a sign that Belichick may in fact be losing his grip. Right now, Hudson looks for all the world to be the one calling the shots. For football’s biggest control freak, it’s a helluva turnabout.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last Saturday, three hours after Cardiff’s players sank to the turf when the final whistleconfirmed their relegation to the third tier, a division the club has not played in for 22 years, the squad slipped into suits for their annual black-tie awards night in a suite overlooking the same surface.At some point, Rubén Sellés, the Hull head coach, seemingly got wind of the jarring circumstances and cancelled his team’s bash, which had been scheduled for Tuesday, to prevent a similarly tone-deaf evening.Wrexham’s revolution faces a whole new challenge in the ChampionshipRead moreHull’s position is so delicate he even suggested he did not want his players having the added stress of adhering to the dress code. “It was my decision,” he said. “I told the club before we announced the player of the season [awards] that if we were playing for something, we didn’t want the distraction. The team needs to get out of the situation … I didn’t want the week to become a one-person week. The club respected that.”It has been that kind of week, at that time of the season. While Burnley and Leeds head into the final day of another enchanting English Football League season with eyes on taking the title, and the five-way fight for the two remaining playoff places promises more lunchtime drama, it is at the bottom where there is most jeopardy. Five teams – Stoke, Derby, Preston, Luton and Hull – are fighting to avoid joining Cardiff and Plymouth, who are all but mathematically relegated, in League One next season.PosTeamPGDPts1Leeds4564972Burnley4551973Sheff Utd4527894Sunderland4515765Bristol City454676Coventry454667Millwall450668Blackburn455659Middlesbrough45106410West Brom4586111Swansea45-56012Sheff Wed45-95713Watford45-85614Norwich4515415QPR45-115316Portsmouth45-135317Oxford Utd45-165218Stoke45-175019Derby45-84920Preston North End45-114921Luton45-224922Hull45-104823Plymouth45-364624Cardiff45-2344Sellés made another call this week, giving his players Monday off despite a late defeat at home to Derby plunging them deeper into trouble. “Under pressure, people need an extra space to breathe,” he said before their trip to Portsmouth. “Three training sessions this week will be enough to prepare the game.”The buildup has not been helped by the late payment of wages, even if Sellés says it pales into insignificance compared with the myriad of problems he encountered at troubled Reading, where at one point delays were commonplace.It appeared a significant upgrade when Sellés left Reading for Hull in December, but the teams could trade places if the Berkshire club, beset by off-field problems and awaiting a takeover, land a playoff berth on the final day. Last season, Hull went into their last game targeting the playoffs. Their hopes ended with defeat at Plymouth and three days later Acun Ilicali sacked Liam Rosenior, Hull’s owner citing a conflict of opinions. Rosenior, who led Hull to seventh in his first full season, is pushing to qualify for the Champions League with Ligue 1 Strasbourg, while his previous club are at risk of dropping into League One.View image in fullscreenLiam Rosenior, sacked by Hull after leading them to seventh place last season, is on the verge of reaching the Champions League with Strasbourg.Photograph: Sébastien Bozon/AFP/GettyThat provides another reminder the grass is not always greener. All the teams involved in the scrap to retain their second-tier status changed manager during this campaign – with mixed results. On 13 February, the day Derby turned to their former midfielder John Eustace to save their season, Luton were propping up the division and Preston were 11 points clear of the relegation zone. As recently as 3 March, Preston were closer to the playoffs than the bottom three, and they had a game in hand on Luton and Derby, who by that point had slid to the bottom after a winless start under Eustace. Paul Heckingbottom’s Preston had alsojust beaten their rivals Burnleyto advance to the FA Cup quarter-finals.Now Preston, who travel to playoff-chasing Bristol City, are bottom of the form table after taking six points from the past 30 available. Derby, who host Stoke, are one of the form teams after two defeats in their past 10 matches. Luton, who visit West Brom, have won three games on the spin under Matt Bloomfield, who made a slow start after jumping up a division.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mark McGuinness, their marquee signing from Cardiff last summer, has impressed in defence as has Thomas Kaminski in goal.Kaminski started Luton’s priceless victory last Saturday over Coventry, another team vying for the top six, despite the death of his father, Jacek, three days earlier. Bloomfield got the Eurostar to Brussels to accompany the Belgian back to England 48 hours before the win. “It means everything to me,” a teary Kaminski said. “Normally I should have had a message from my dad … I didn’t have it today but I know he is watching and with us and would have been very, very proud.”The only certainty from here is that the pendulum of emotions will continue given the stakes. This time last season Luton were winning friends in the Premier League, duking it out with Nottingham Forest to avoid the dropbefore succumbing on the final day. Derby were in party mode after clinching promotion as runners-up. Stoke finished strongly to dispel relegation worries. Preston, meanwhile, ended 10th – nestled in the safe zone – after a dismal five-match losing run.For one team, things are about to take a turn for the worse.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipHull CityLuton TownDerby CountyPreston North EndfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Slot’s celebrations continued with his wife’s birthday meal on Monday before his focus switched back to business on Tuesday.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreSlot described last Sunday as one of the best days of his life and claimed it would motivate his squad to recreate the unforgettable scenes at Anfield next season. He believes Liverpool’s transfer targets will also want to be part of a “special” club.“To experience this once is really nice,” Slot said. “But we would love to experience it one more time. It has been special for all the fans and it’s definitely been special for the players and for us as well. Now we know why, when we start next season, what we do it for.“But it definitely helps to attract new players as well because mostly the players that we want, we are not the only club who thinks they are good players, so they have more options. Then maybe it helps for them to see that the way we do things here is special. Until now, if I spoke to players who we wanted to bring in, I always told them that our fans are really special and it is special to play at this club. But after Sunday I don’t think I ever have to tell anyone again how special our fans are because that was unbelievable.”View image in fullscreenArne Slot guided Liverpool to the title in his first season in charge.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAOne advantage ofwinning the Premier Leaguein April, according to Slot, is that it gives Liverpool more time to work on transfers and prepare for next season. He intends to use the final four matches as groundwork for next season by rotating his squad more than usual.He said of plans for next season: “I already did this a little bit in the background. It’s not like after we won the league was the first time Richard [Hughes, Liverpool’s sporting director] called me and said: ‘OK, these are the players we are interested in.’ That would be a bit weird. But there’s a bit more time now to have these conversations.“But let there be no mistake, we want to win every single game we play. The players will be prepared in the same way [for Chelsea on Sunday] as they’ve been prepared for all the other games.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re calling itEl Chaffico.El Crapico.The Derby Della Mediocre. They’re calling it the first Premier League game in which both teams somehow manage to lose. They’re posting memes of old men playing walking football and Sideshow Bob stepping on rakes.They’re mentioning the fact that none of the three relegated teams have won more games against Premier League opposition than Paris Saint-Germain have. The fact that since Leicester scored their last league goal at home, Southampton havesacked a manager, appointed an interim,appointed a permanent replacement,sacked the permanent replacementand re-appointed the interim from earlier.And of course on the whitewater banter rapids of social media, Leicester v Southampton exists largely as a punchline, or perhaps two punchbags. Leicester have not scored at home in the league for five months. Southampton, in danger ofequalling the lowest points total in Premier League history, have not kept a clean sheet in their past 17 league games. Something, either way, is going to have to give here.Leicester’s Ruud van Nistelrooy has urged his players to treat this as preparation for facingSouthamptonin the Championship next season. Simon Rusk, the aforementioned interim, reckons that turning around Southampton’s fortunes this season will be a job akin to being “able to bring world peace”. But then no amount of soaring oratory or boosterism is going to put a positive spin on a combined total of 29 points and 51 defeats from 67 games.View image in fullscreenPatson Daka shows his anguish after Leicester’s relegation was confirmed.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesEven so, as all the promoted teams summarily disappear down the chute for the second successive season, it is worth asking: are Leicester and Southampton really that bad? In common with Burnley and Luton last season, there has been no great implosion here, no mass downing of tools, no training-ground punch-ups, precious few rumblings of internal revolt. Are either of these clubs any more dysfunctional than, say, Manchester United? Harry Winks wanted to commute from home. Jannik Vestergaard brought his dog to training. By and large, the centre has held. It’s just that the centre hasn’t been very good in defensive transition.All things are relative, of course, but the first point to note about Leicester and Southampton is that these are good teams with proper footballers. Between them the two squads boast 36 full internationals, 24 players with Champions League experience, champions and ballers with league titles in nine countries. Leicester have players whowon the FA Cup four years agoand one – Jamie Vardy – whowon the Premier League in 2016.Meanwhile Tyler Dibling, Taylor Harwood-Bellis and Bilal El Khannouss will almost certainly attract decent fees on the open market. And increasingly, relegated clubs are having little trouble finding suitors for their tarnished goods. Burnley sold seven players to clubs in “Big Five” leagues last summer. Southampton in 2023 reaped more than £150m from the sales of Roméo Lavia, Tino Livramento, James Ward-Prowse and Nathan Tella (who went on to win the Bundesliga with Bayer Leverkusen). Even Luton, a Championship-level squad at best, were able to get some money for Chiedozie Ogbene and Ross Barkley.There have been mistakes. There have been mis-steps – Leicester’s squandering of their golden 2016-21 inheritance remains a colossal failure of management – but fundamentally these are not wildly different clubs from the ones that got promoted from the Championship last season with 97 and 87 points, respectively.The bigger problem is that the rest of the league has got significantly better. The financial gap between the top two divisions has been growing steadily since 1992.But 2020 and Covid appears to have been an accelerating factor, allowing Premier League clubs with the safety net of immense broadcast revenue to consolidate and invest while clubs further down the pyramid scrambled to plug the gaps from empty stadiums.The result has been increased stability for middle-class clubs like Brighton, Brentford, Bournemouth, Fulham and Wolves, while clubs on the wrong side of the divide – Southampton, Burnley, Sheffield United, Leeds – find themselves cast increasingly adrift.The divide is still bridgeable: Nottingham Forest’s rise over the last three seasons has been one of themore remarkable underdog storiesin English football, and yet even this has required a miraculous alignment of circumstances: a big existing fanbase, brilliant coaching, a little luck with recruitment.Even so, surviving with 32 points andbreaking Premier League spending rulesis not exactly a model that could easily be replicated by a club like Ipswich or Bristol City.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Southampton are on course to register their highest average attendance at St Mary’s for more than 20 years.The King Power Stadium, too, has been pretty close to full all season: a remarkable effort to keep turning up and watching, in the face of rising prices, defeats and derision, despair and declining returns.View image in fullscreenSouthampton’s Taylor Harwood-Bellis (left), Kyle Walker-Peters and Flynn Downes can still help the club beat Derby’s points record.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAAnd perhaps there is a lesson here that we should all heed: even at the highest level, football is about more than winning and losing, that devotion and sacrifice is not a results business, that fans are not consumers, that for the vast majority of people who follow the game it is a form of ritual and community, an expression of individual and collective identity that endures through promotions and relegations, summer clearouts and spending sprees, buzz and column inches, owners both engaged and aloof.So yes, for all the gags and sniggers, this does matter. There is basic professional pride at stake, of course, but more too: the chance to give Vardy a fitting sendoff, the chance to beat Derby’s 2007-08 points record, the chance to reward some of the most long-suffering fans in the country with a small island of joy in what has largely been an ocean of pure misery.It may not be world peace. But at the fuzzy end of the Premier League lollipop, you have to take your grace where you can find it.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeicester CitySouthamptonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Guardian has learned there are concerns among some MPs that an existing clause in the bill stating clubs must seek the regulator’s permission “to move home games elsewhere” is not robust enough, and there are plans to submit an amendment at the committee stage which explicitly rules out taking a match abroad.Although the government is not planning to introduce the amendment, multiple sources have confirmed it is sympathetic to the principle and opposed to English fixtures being moved overseas. Ministers could support the amendment, suggest changes to it or oppose it depending on the wording.The Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, said last summer it had “no plans” to take games abroad and that the subject had not been formally discussed since 2008, when plans for an “international round” – the so-called 39th game – were abandoned after a fan backlash and opposition from Fifa. Premier League policy is decided by its members, however, and if 14 clubs wanted to play overseas the executive would be unable to stop them.Fifa regulations that prevent league matches being played outside domestic national territories are set to change. The world governing body set up a working group last year to issue new recommendations on the subject after settling a legal dispute with the American sports promoter Relevent, which had argued that Fifa’s refusal to sanction overseas games was anti-competitive.La Liga and Serie A have stated a desire to move games abroad as soon as next season.Explore more on these topicsFootball politicsPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

He became the youngest goalscorer in the history of the Uefa Youth League in September at the age of 14 years, eight months and 19 days and also starred for Arsenal’s under-18s in their run to the quarter-finals of the FA Youth Cup.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead morePremier League regulations prevent players who were not 15 at the start of a season from playing, meaning Dowman will not be able to surpass Ethan Nwaneri’s record as the competition’s youngest player, set in September 2022 when Nwaneri was 15 years and 181 days old. But Arteta was asked whether the attacking midfielder, who has drawn comparisons to Martin Ødegaard, could be an option for next season after the success of the academy graduates Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly.“For the near future, yes,” he said. “Now he is involved in the squad. He trains with us a lot. Does that mean he will play in the Premier League many games? I don’t know; depends how good he is and how impressive he is and how much he offers the team like Ethan, like Myles, like any other player in the squad. Let’s see how this evolves but we certainly got a big, big talent there.“I think he is in the right pathway and everybody in the academy has done an incredible job to consistently protect him, inspire him, challenge him, keep him always up and the levels that he could produce, and he is doing well. He is doing the right steps and taking it slowly. He will dictate how fast we go.”Arteta admitted it had been “painful” to watch “a small part” of Liverpool’s title celebrations last weekend but congratulated Arne Slot’s side for their achievement. Thomas Partey is expected to return in midfield against Bournemouth on Saturday after missing the first leg of their Champions League semi-finalagainst Paris Saint-Germain, and Arteta was positive about the prospect of Kai Havertz returning from a hamstring injury ahead of schedule. “If everything goes the way it’s going at the moment and the way it’s planned, I think he will have a chance to play a few games in the season,” he said.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta (centre) is likely to play Thomas Partey (right) against Bournemouth.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesArteta also said midfielder Jorginho is recovering from a lung problem and may play again this season. The 33-year-old, who is out of contract in the summer, made his last appearance on 12 April against Brentford, when he was forced off with an apparent chest injury. “It got a bit more complicated than expected,” said Arteta. “He’s fine, he’s recovering well.”Arsenal have not confirmed details of the Italian’s injury but sources have indicated he sustained a punctured lung. On the prospect of his vice-captain playing again this season, Arteta said: “I think so, if everything goes OK in the next week or so.”The manager was also optimistic about William Saliba’s future despite the Frenchman having been linked with a move to Real Madrid as he enters the final two years of his contract. “I leave those kind of things more for [the sporting director] Andrea [Berta] and the club to talk about,” he said. “What I’m certain, because I had a conversation with him, that he’s so happy here, that he wants to continue with us.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetanewsShareReuse this content"

The manager felt the mood inside the club’s stadium shift sharply on Thursday night when they conceded for 3-1 towards the end of the Europa Leaguesemi-final first leg against Bodø/Glimt.Before that the atmosphere had been excellent, the players responding, but it seemingly does not take much for the fans to begin to fear the worst. The tie finished 3-1, which should be enough for Spurs to navigate Thursday’s return after Sunday’s Premier League trip to West Ham. Yet there has been nervous talk about Bodø’s impressive home record, the perils of their artificial surface and the cold that awaits in the Arctic Circle.Bodø/Glimt and friends return to Norway with Europa League dream alive | Nick AmesRead morePostecoglou noted that he had also felt a “real nervousness in the stadium” when Spursconceded at home against AZin the last 16 and Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-final. The concession against AZ was in the second leg for 2-1 on the night and 2-2 on aggregate. Against Frankfurt, it was the first leg and an early goal that gave the German club a 1-0 lead.“People are their experiences and Tottenham supporters have had some real near misses for a long time,” Postecoglou said. “So there’s always this safeguard of not getting too excited about what’s happening, but part of creating a winning culture is not to fall into that trap. Winners don’t think about things in that way; they don’t think about what could possibly go wrong.“I’ve said before that the narrative around the club is not positive at all. That’s existed for a very long time and you need to break through that. I’m trying to create a culture within the group at least that that can’t guide our destiny because that’s almost self-fulfilling. If you expect something to go wrong, it will.“I don’t know if it’s a culture in the club; it’s a culture around the club. Obviously if you accept that then you are almost self-prophesying what’s going to happen. I don’t accept that. But with all of these things, there’s really only one remedy: win. That’s what we’re trying to do.”Postecoglou was asked whether he could control what went on outside the squad. “No, I can’t control it,” he said. “It’s fair to say I’ve tried but it’s a losing battle because there’s a lot of stuff that feeds into that and people invariably react to it. If you’re feeling insecure about something and you’ve got 20 people telling you that you should be insecure, you’re going to be insecure. So I can’t change that.“You’ve got to stay very focused on what you can control and we can’t control how people feel, we can’t control the anxiety of … whether it’s our supporters or whatever narrative is around us.

Maguire was asked what the greatest threat was to United’s progress.Fernandes stars as Manchester United cruise against 10-man Athletic BilbaoRead more“Everyone will say it’s [done], and so you’re going into the game thinking the tie’s over,” he said. “Every scenario can happen in a game. We know that they could score first but we’ve got to remain calm. We’ve got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments. I think Cassie [Casemiro] was brilliant tonight, Bruno as well, so we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”United are the only undefeated side in European club competitions despite a troubled domestic campaign that has them 14th. Maguire said this was due, in part, to the squad not negotiating the transition between Erik ten Hag’s sacking in late October and Ruben Amorim’s arrival.“It’s been a bit of a mess in the middle of the season,” the defender said. “The transition period we didn’t handle well enough, us players. We didn’t take the responsibility well enough from moving manager to manager and we took too long embedding new ideas.“It’s been a difficult, disappointing season but of course football is about memories, it’s about creating memories, it’s about winning trophies and we have a great opportunity to win a trophy.”1:31Ruben Amorim says Athletic Bilbao win is ‘best result’ of his time in charge  – videoMaguire’s cross led to Casemiro’s header, after the centre-back had tricked the left-back Mikel Jauregizar. “Dribbling has always been an attribute of mine,” he said. “I did it a lot more when I was younger – dribbling the ball up the pitch out of defence and stepping into midfield. It was a bit strange finding myself on the right wing. I managed to put a good ball in the box and we had a lot of bodies in the box so they must have trusted me to get the ball in.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Amorim said: “It was really tough on us [to lose him] because in that moment he was the player that created all the situations. But now he is returning.

Days earlier, in between wheeling around the Racecourse Ground celebrating promotion fromLeague One, he told Ryan Reynolds things were about to get “a little pricier from here on”.Wrexham: welcome to the Championship. Afterthree successive promotionsto earn a slice of English football history, the Welsh club and their owners are steadying themselves for one of the most chaotic and competitive leagues on the planet.So if there are no plans to consolidate, where do they go from here? Reynolds and McElhenney have known nothing but success since their takeover in February 2021. From a missed promotion in 2021-22, their side have romped through league after league, making a mockery of cynics’ predictions on the way.How Wrexham and Birmingham City’s US owners got one step from the Premier LeagueRead moreBut the Championship is a behemoth and McElhenney is wise to prepare for a dramatic increase in costs. Wrexham’s many critics will indicate they have been able to use their money and celebrity status to cherrypick the best players from higher divisions to aid their sharp rise.That is unlikely to happen now, even amid spurious transfer links with high-profile free agents such as Kevin De Bruyne and Jamie Vardy. Their revenue is no match for the bigger Championship clubs.As the manager, Phil Parkinson, says: “We’re going into one of the most competitive leagues in world football. One of the most supported leagues. The jump in salaries is mind-blowing. I don’t think people outside football quite realise. But what we’ve always tried to do is make sure the culture in the club is right. No superstars, no egos in the dressing room. You always need extra quality when you go up a level, but it’s going to be the right people coming into the building.”The director Humphrey Ker says: “People will talk about the money, but it’s never been about blank cheques. The aim has always been to live within our means so the club doesn’t suffer when Ryan and Rob move on, which will eventually happen, even if it’s decades from now.”Parkinson says any big-name signings would struggle to top Reynolds and McElhenney for superstar status anyway. He praises the Hollywood duo for their smart and selfless ownership, as he has done regularly on this journey, their mantra being: “We don’t make football decisions.” That humility will be all-important to survive and compete in the Championship, for all Reynolds’ claims that the Premier League has always been the goal.“It’s a collective,” says Parkinson. “There’s lots of ways owners can be supportive: it can be to make sure we get that key player when we need it most, but it can also be support when results don’t go your way. They’re invested in all the decisions but they trust us and that’s been a key element to our success.“You look at people who buy football clubs – and there’s lots of examples recently – and I think: ‘Hmm, that’s going to be an expensive learning curve for you.’ Because if you buy a business you have to employ people to run it for you unless you’ve got great experience.”View image in fullscreenWrexham’s Phil Parkinson kept Bolton in the Championship in 2017-18 despite the club being under a transfer embargo.Photograph: Paul Currie/Colorsport/ShutterstockParkinson has his own scars from the Championship. He still ranks sealing second-tier survival for Bolton in 2017-18 as one of his greatest managerial achievements. Wanderers were under a transfer embargo yet defied the odds to stay up. They began the next season locked out of their training ground and with players on strike over unpaid wages, amid a series of financial difficulties, and were relegated in 2019.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIt will be very different for Wrexham, who will continue to sign and sell players with the goal of challenging the Championship status quo. “The speed we’ve evolved as a club means some great players, great characters have left us,” Parkinson says. “But my job is to keep improving the squad all the time.”One player who may have to leave with a heavy heart after Wrexham complete their season at Lincoln City on Saturday is Paul Mullin. The striker scored goals by the bucket-load in the National League and League Two to earn folk hero status in Wrexham, but has been frozen out in recent months after the January arrivals of the club record £2m signing, Sam Smith, and Jay Rodriguez. Mullin is 30 and has never played in the Championship.“There’s a lot of tough decisions to be made,” Parkinson says. “We’re going to recruit the right players and get the squad as strong as we can, and enjoy the ride, because I think that’s really important.”The building of a new Kop Stand, a 5,500-capacity facility that includes hospitality sections to generate more revenue and a roof that will amplify the atmosphere, is in the works, although it will not open until summer 2026 – by which time Wrexham will hope to be in the Championship at the least.“I’m confident we’ll be ready,” says Parkinson. “We need to evaluate in terms of the budget, the wages those players are going to demand and balance that quality with the culture we’ve built here. We’ll sit down and reflect with the owners.”After Parkinson joked that Reynolds and McElhenney “must think this game is easy”, it is clear the next chapter in Wrexham’s Hollywood story will be the most captivating.Explore more on these topicsWrexhamLeague OnefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But there is plenty of intrigue in the playoff places.Stockport,WycombeandCharltonare simply jostling for position: Wycombe in fourth host third-placed Stockport on Saturday knowing the winner would come third, the loser would be overtaken by Charlton if the Addicks beat Burton at home, and a draw would almost certainly lead to all three staying where they are. But if they will all have a handy advantage on points over whoever ends up in sixth,Leyton Orientwill be the playoffs’ form side if they sustain their late-season surge.It is an extraordinary turnaround for a team who won only three of their first 13 games and went into November in 20th place; in 32 games since they have the division’s second-best record, behind only Birmingham. But having reached the top six in February they immediately suffered a serious wobble, losing five games in a row. By 10 March they were ninth, seven points behind sixth-placed Bolton, who had a game in hand.Since then Bolton have lost seven and won two – only four teams have earned fewer points – while Orient have won seven and lost one – only two teams have won more – including all their past five.“When I first joined this football club, I said that if the fans are with me and they’re with the players, we’ll take you on a journey,” their manager, Richie Wellens, said last month. “Let’s just enjoy the journey because at the moment it’s not a bad journey, is it? We were relegated by November, then we were safe by December, then by March we can’t get in the playoffs. It is what it is.”Orient’s only remaining competition for the final playoff place comes fromReading, who sit level on points but with a goal difference inferior by eight. For the Royals too sneaking into the top six would be a serious achievement, givenuncertainty over the club’s futureunder the chaotic ownership of Dai Yongge.“We have to put a team out on the pitch that will compete and fight, and they all know the importance of it and feel it, see it and smell it,” said their manager, Noel Hunt. “It’s an unbelievable position to be in, from where we were two years ago, and with all the circumstances around the place.”Given the goal difference Reading, at home to Barnsley (who have won one of their past 11), need more points than Orient get from their visit to a Huddersfield side who have lost 11 of their past 14, and all of their past five.PosTeamPGDPts1Birmingham45521082Wrexham4531893Stockport County4528844Wycombe4527845Charlton4522826Leyton Orient4521757Reading4513758Bolton45-3679Blackpool4596410Huddersfield4566411Lincoln City45106112Barnsley45-65813Rotherham45-65614Stevenage45-85615Exeter45-135616Wigan45-25517Peterborough45-125118Mansfield45-165119Northampton45-185020Burton Albion45-154721Crawley Town45-274322Bristol Rovers45-294323Cambridge Utd45-273824Shrewsbury45-3733League TwoDoncasterandPort Valeare going up, but with only one point between them the title is in the balance: if Donny win atNotts Countyit’s all over, but if they slip up opportunity knocks for Vale, who would take the trophy if they beat Gillingham at home, or if they draw and Doncaster lose by three or more.Three teams are vying for the final automatic promotion spot, of whomBradfordgo into the final day in pole position, knowing victory at home to mid-table Fleetwood would take them up.Walsall, desperate to resurrect a season that has nosedived calamitously after a wonderful start, are a point behind. In mid-January, having played 25 matches and won their previous nine, the Saddlers had 58 points – no team in any division had so many – and were 12 ahead of second-placed Crewe with a game in hand. Since then Crewe and Walsall have won only 16 points – the division’s joint-worst total, level with rock-bottom, relegatedMorecambe– and the pair fittingly play each other at Gresty Road, with the Railwaymen having long since dropped out of promotion contention.Two points further back Notts need Bradford to lose, and for Walsall not to win, if they are to stand a chance of pipping them both – but even then they would need to become the first team since the first week of March to beat Doncaster.Below them five teams have their eyes on two playoff places. Of those two are playing each other: eighth-placedGrimsbyneed to beatAFC Wimbledonat home to secure a place while the Dons need a point, or for neitherSalford CitynorChesterfieldto win. Seventh-placed Salford need only beat relegatedCarlisle, who have belatedly discovered some decent form with three wins from their past five, including one over Vale.Chesterfield would overtake Salford and Grimsby if they win and neither of their closest rivals do, or if they draw and the other two both lose – though if that were to happenColchestercould leapfrog all three with a home win against Barrow.PosTeamPGDPts1Doncaster4522812Port Vale4520803Bradford4518754Walsall4520745Notts County4520726AFC Wimbledon4520707Salford City4510688Grimsby45-5689Chesterfield45186710Colchester4556611Bromley4526312Crewe4526213Swindon4586114Fleetwood Town4516015Cheltenham45-76016Barrow4525817Gillingham45-65518Milton Keynes Dons45-145119Accrington Stanley45-155020Harrogate Town45-195021Newport County45-214922Tranmere45-234823Carlisle45-274124Morecambe45-3136National LeagueMost business is settled with a game to go:Barnetare promoted as champions,York– quite the turnaround after finishing one point off relegation last season – andForest Greenhave qualified for the playoff semi-finals, andRochdale,OldhamandHalifaxwill play in the eliminators.The final eliminators place will be decided by what is essentially a playoff atGateshead, where the home side have one final chance to rescue a season on the verge of being ruined by a Walsallesque falloff – having lost eight of their first 34 games they have been beaten in nine of their past 11.Southend, who with impeccable timing climbed into the top seven last week for the first time, need only to avoid defeat at Gateshead to stay there.

What I am saying is when I am finished here I will take a break.”In the earlier interview with ESPN, Guardiola had seemed less certain, saying: “I don’t know if I’m going to retire, but I’m going to take a break.”Contemplating his trophy-laden coaching legacy, which also encompasses spells at the top of Spanish and German football, Guardiola added he was confident supporters of the clubs he had managed had enjoyed watching his sides play.“In the careers of coaches, there are good and bad ones, the important thing is that the good ones are remembered for longer,” he added. “There are new challenges as a coach, I don’t know what will happen in the future and in the end that doesn’t matter.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The McLaren driver insists he has never been so confident in his own ability before this weekend’s Miami Grand Prix, where he qualified in third place for Saturday’s sprint race and Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli took his debut F1 sprint pole.The British driver opened the season stronglywith a win in Australiaand led the championship until the last round in Saudi Arabia when he was overtaken by his teammate Oscar Piastri, who has now won three of the opening five meetings.Welcome to Miami, where F1’s sunshine party draws a crowd every sport cravesRead moreNorris has admitted he is struggling to adapt to this year’sMcLaren, particularly in qualifying, which has cost him dearly in recent races, not least the last round in Saudi Arabia where he crashed out in Q3.The 25-year-old maintained that he has no psychological problems with his performance as the pressure on him intensified. “I got into racing because I like to drive the cars, or the go-karts, I like to work with my team,” he said in Miami. “The rest of it is noise to me because it’s not something that I ever wanted to do. It’s not something that I’m natural with. It’s not something that I enjoy doing. If I could have asked for a perfect world, it would just mean to turn up, drive and go home.”He was also bullish about his title hopes despite Piastri now leading by 10 points. “My only need is to finish at the top at the end of the season. I don’t need to lead it at any other point,” Norris said. “I’m more confident than I ever have been. I’m more trusting in my own ability and my own speed. I’ve never felt so confident with my whole ability, with my speed and my knowledge of what I can go out and do.View image in fullscreenLando Norris remains bullish about his title chances this season.Photograph: Cristóbal Herrera/EPA“I’m in the best place I’ve ever been in terms of knowing what I can achieve. But of course the results have not turned into what I want for various reasons. There’s been some tough moments but now I still feel like I’m in the best place that I ever have been in terms of knowing what I can go out and do every weekend.”In qualifying for Saturday’s sprint race in Miami, Max Verstappen – who arrived at the track on Friday when he confirmed he had become a father after his partner Kelly Piquet gave birth to a baby girl named Lily – set the early pace on his second run in Q3, taking the top spot only to be pipped by Antonelli, becoming the youngest driver to claim a pole position.Piastri went close to him four-hundredths back in second, with Norris a tenth back in third but the Italian had delivered an immense lap for a deserved pole. Verstappen ended fourth with Mercedes’ George Russell in fifth and Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton sixth and seventh for Ferrari.The Miami race promoters also announced on Friday they had agreed an extension to their deal with F1 to host the meeting until 2041, a long-term commitment by both parties to the sport’s future in the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He continued his sublime breakthrough run on Friday night by holding on in a bruising encounter with the 10th seed Lorenzo Musetti to reach the Madrid Open final with a 6-3, 7-6 (4) win.This had already been another essential week in Draper’s blossoming career as his quarter-final winsecured his position inside the top fiveof the ATP rankings for the first time but he has taken it even further. He is now also the third man of the 2000s generation to reach a Masters 1000 final on hard court and clay after hisIndian Wells triumph in March. He is still yet to drop a set in Madrid.This time, the victory was made even sweeter by the presence of his mother, Nicky, in his player box after she flew in from London. “The last few times she’s come to watch me play, French Open first round I had a shocker, and then Monte Carlo this year was really poor in my second round,” he said. “Seems like every match she’s come to I’ve been terrible. So I was thinking when she said she was going to come yesterday I was like: ‘Ooh, I’m not sure if you should come.’“She ended up coming, and I’m glad she did, because tonight was a really good performance. Maybe her luck’s changed when she comes to watch me play, so we’ll see.”In the final, Draper will face Casper Ruud after the Norwegian 14th seed defeated Francisco Cerundolo of Argentina 6-4, 7-5.Throughout the event, Draper has repeatedly insisted that he always believed he could perform at a high level on clay despite the scepticism that often follows British players on this surface. He has backed up that confidence in full and has grown with every minute on the court.Draper’s performances have been testament to his increasingly complete game; he has served brilliantly at times, but he is also a top quality returner. As he continues to become comfortable moving on clay, it is extremely difficult to consistently put the ball past him. The most significant development in recent months, however, has been Draper’s forehand, a destructive weapon that has improved more than any shot in his game.“The impressive thing of him, he’s really a complete player,” said Musetti. “I would say he’s impressive also when he defends. For his height, it’s really high. And of course a lefty who can serve really well, especially for a one-handed backhand, it’s not easy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A Wimbledon semi-finalist and Olympic bronze medallist in the past year, the Italian reached his first Masters 1000 final in Monte Carlo last month. Armed with one of the most varied games on the tour alongside his excellent athleticism, Musetti was built to disrupt and neutralise Draper.From the beginning, the contest was predictably tough and physical but Draper overwhelmed the Italian with his weight and depth of shot, particularly off his forehand. Musetti remained calm, however, and he worked his way into the match by finding rhythm on his first serve and injecting pace into his forehand. By the second half of the set, Musetti was the better player and he constantly pressured Draper to hold serve and keep up.But the world No 5 has never been stronger, more mentally tough and as confident in his game. Under pressure against a classy opponent, he was patient and demonstrated his problem solving ability and his strength, taking back control of the match by mixing in serve and volleying. At the end of a high quality, breathless second set, Draper found a way to drag himself into the final and keep his remarkable run going.Explore more on these topicsJack DraperTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Thank you to Ronnie, he helped me a lot before. He’s my idol.”Ronnie O’Sullivan and Judd Trump roar into World Snooker semi-finalsRead moreO’Sullivan was gracious in defeat and warmly congratulated his opponent after he sealed victory with another effortless clearance to complete a 17-7 triumph. “Zhao deserves his victory,” he said.O’Sullivan trailed 12-4 going into the evening session and won the first two frames to spark hopes of a fightback, but it wasn’t to be.Zhao will meetJudd Trumpor Mark Williams in the final, which will be played on Sunday and Monday – and will benefit from a day off.There has been talk for a long time about a first Chinese world champion, but apart from Ding Junhui making the final in 2016, when he lost to Mark Selby, no one has come close. This could be the moment, with Zhao in brilliant form and seemingly unfazed by reaching the one-table set-up at the Crucible for the first time.O’Sullivan’s participation in the tournament had been in doubt after he had withdrawn from the Masters in January and every ranking event since on medical grounds. His only appearance on the tour this year was in the Championship League in January, when he snapped his cue after losing four of his five matches. He had come through to the semi-finals at the Crucible comfortably, though was unhappy with his form, and changed his tip and ferrule after the first session with the score level at 4-4.View image in fullscreenRonnie O’Sullivan during Friday’s morning session.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersAfter the match, he said: “I don’t even know if it was the cue, the ferrule or me. There were three things. I just don’t even know where the white ball’s going. I’m at a loss, to be honest with you. I don’t even know what to say.“Sometimes you’ve got to try something different, you know? It didn’t feel great before so I tried to go back to the old brass ferrule.“I’m not making the cue as an excuse or anything like that but if I hadn’t snapped my old cue maybe I’d have been able to give him a better game but really my performances have not been good enough.”Earlier, O’Sullivan’s mid-match change of tip backfired spectacularly as he was whitewashed in the second session. The seven-time champion had still emerged from the first session level at 4-4, but lost all eight frames on Friday morning as Zhao ruthlessly punished every missed pot and poor safety to move 12-4 ahead.Zhao made breaks of 57 (twice), 112 and 82 to establish an 8-4 lead, with O’Sullivan scoring just 50 points in those four frames and recording a highest break of 23. There was no respite for O’Sullivan after the mid-session interval as Zhao made breaks of 67 and 115 to extend his lead, with the Englishman then missing a yellow off the spot in the next frame to allow his opponent back to the table.The Chinese sensation needed two opportunities to take the frame and also took the last of the session with a break of 87 after O’Sullivan had inexplicably missed a simple blue to the middle pocket.The former UK Championship winner John Virgo, commentating for the BBC, praised Zhao’s performance. “Scintillating snooker,” he said. “What a player. What a future he’s got in the game. To do this to Ronnie O’Sullivan, it’s a phenomenal performance. Changing of the guard maybe, right here, right now.”View image in fullscreenMark Williams produced a fine display to hit back to level with Judd Trump at 8-8.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersWilliams fought back from a four-frame deficit against Trump to level their semi-final at 8-8. Trump resumed 5-3 ahead and set down an early marker to increase his lead and suggest that he could run away with the match.A break of 70 extended Trump’s lead to 6-3 and he pinched the next frame with a 65 clearance after Williams, on a break of 57, missed a black off the spot.Williams replied with breaks of 105 and 84 before edging a scrappier 13th to trail 7-6. Trump took the next without any big breaks but Williams, seeking a fourth world title, shaded a tense 15th frame, sewing it up on the pink. And a consummate 96 clearance from the Welshman ensured parity before the pair resume play on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipRonnie O'SullivanJudd TrumpSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

And now we’re 24 hours away.”Friday night’sinvite-only boxing card– headlined by Ryan Garcia, Devin Haney and Teófimo López – will unfold in the heart of midtown Manhattan, sealed behind 10-foot-high chain-link fencing and swarming with security teams. Just steps away, hot dog vendors bark over traffic and ambulance sirens. The Naked Cowboy strums his guitar. Tourists snap selfies. Nearby, counter-terrorist units wheel away trash bins as a precaution. And inside that footprint, one of the sport’s most surreal new realities is taking shape.Boxing takes over Times Square for surreal Garcia-Haney-López triple billRead more“Imagine the fascination,” Hearn says. “Imagine the viewership. Closing down Times Square – it’s iconic. In the normal world of promotion, you’d be leaving 10 million on the floor. But this is different.”Different is one way to describe it. The event – staged by The Ring magazine, recently acquired by Saudi Arabia’s boxing magnateTurki al-Sheikh– is the latest in a series of high-concept, deep-pocketed and highly curated boxing showcases. While the visuals promise a cinematic backdrop without precedent, the live audience will be vanishingly small. “It’s got the feel of Covid,” Hearn notes, recalling the empty-arena shows of 2020. “Some fighters underperformed in that environment. I think we’ll see some upsets.”The silver-tongued promoter is effusive in his praise of Al-Sheikh, often referred to as “His Excellency”, whose fingerprints have been on nearly every major boxing event in the last 18 months. Hearn points to Al-Sheikh’s “relentlessness” and obsessive problem-solving as the reason why fights long thought impossible –Fury v Usyk,Joshua v Ngannou,Beterbiev v Bivol– have now been made reality. “Once he has that vision, it’s happening. It’s not, ‘We can’t do it because–’,” he says. “It’s, ‘What do you mean we can’t? Let’s go again.’”Hearn’s role in the Times Square project is a curious one. As Matchroom Boxing’s frontman, he’s long been known as one of boxing’s most visible traditional promoters. But in this new Saudi-led chapter, his job has changed. “We were tasked with running the event on the ground, being the lead promoter,” he says. “The team has done an amazing job. But there’s been so many hurdles – everything from permits, to indemnity, to getting fighters changed on the night.”None of it, he makes clear, would have happened without Al-Sheikh. “People sometimes criticize when we talk so positively about him,” Hearn says. “But it’s just the truth. You’re solving so many short-term problems – and most of the time you don’t get over them. But he just keeps going.”View image in fullscreenEddie Hearn makes the media rounds in New York City ahead of Friday’s boxing card in Times Square.Photograph: Geoffrey Knott/Matchroom BoxingThat persistence, Hearn admits, has taught him something. “I’ve learned a lot from the vision,” he says. “Some of the stuff I thought was the worst idea ever. Then it happens, and I go: ‘That was brilliant.’”He cites how Al-Sheikh insisted on usingcelebritylookalikesas ring card carriersfor last week’s showat the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London. “I thought: ‘This is the worst idea I’ve ever seen.’ By the end of the night, it’s gone completely viral.”Hearn is aware that not everyone in boxing sees this new era as visionary. Criticshave accused Saudi Arabia of sportswashing, using lavish fight cards to rebrand the kingdom’s global image while distracting from its human rights record. But the questions go beyond symbolism. Al-Sheikh is a close ally of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and head of the kingdom’s General Entertainment Authority, a body tied to the state’s top-down soft power strategy.Arecent investigation by the Athleticrevealed that Al-Sheikh’s growing profile in boxing stands in sharp contrast to his lesser-known domestic role –one marked by reported abuses. Interviews with dozens of sources described a man who blends celebrity flamboyance with close proximity to repression. According to former detainees and Saudi dissidents, dozens have been imprisoned for criticizing Al-Sheikh’s policies, with one Riyadh jail wing informally dubbed “The Tutu Wing”, after his nickname.There are verified cases, court records show, of social media users being arrested and allegedly abused after criticizing Al-Sheikh – including one man reportedly abducted by masked security agents, blindfolded and slapped by Al-Sheikh in person before being dumped on the side of a highway.View image in fullscreenRyan Garcia, right, and Rolando ‘Rolly’ Romero are headlining what’s said to be the first ever sanctioned boxing card to be held at Times Square.Photograph: Amanda Westcott/Matchroom BoxingHuman rights groups have long accused Saudi Arabia of using high-profile sports events to deflect attention from internal repression. In one of the more alarming anecdotes from the Athletic’s reporting, a member of Al-Sheikh’s entourage at a recent heavyweight title fight was identified as a man wanted by the FBI for allegedly spying on dissidents inside Twitter.Asked directly whether there are ethical red lines on who should fund or control the sport, Hearn was careful but direct: “Every country has its issues. I think we’re one of them. But I’ve never seen anything but positive come from sport being there.”Has he ever been asked to sign a non-disparagement clauses or NDA on a Saudi show?“Never,” he replies, flatly.Does he feel pressure to defer to Al-Sheikh on matchmaking?“We represent over 100 fighters,” Hearn says. “We make decisions for them based on what’s best for their careers. There’ve been plenty of times where His Excellency offered us a fight and we said no – wrong weight class, wrong timing. But generally, the opportunities have been very good. Life-changing.”View image in fullscreenEddie Hearn, left, watches the December rematch between Oleksandr Usyk and Tyson Fury alongside Saudi Arabia’s boxing czar Turki al-Sheikh.Photograph: Mark Robinson/Getty ImagesThat power – the ability to shape cards, fund events, control promotional narratives, and now media via The Ring, an American boxing publication that has been around since 1922 — has many in the sport wondering where the lines are. Or whether any remain.But he also acknowledges the value of entertainment – and of disruption. “Boxing gets stale,” Hearn says. “The same weigh-ins. The same press conferences. The same look and feel. You’ve got to keep evolving. And he’s torn the script up.” For example, it’s one of boxing’s worst kept secrets that Al-Sheikh’s next scheme involves staging a fight on Alcatraz Island. As audacious as it sounds, you’d be brave to bet against it.Hearn doesn’t think Saudi’s involvement means the end of boxing’s traditional fanbases, either. “We did 96,000 for Joshua v Dubois at Wembley,” he pointed out. “We did 65,000 last week for Benn v Eubank. Boxing isn’t leaving anywhere. It’s growing.”He disagrees with fellow UK-based promoter Ben Shalom’s recent claim that women’s boxing has suffered in the Saudi era. “There’s only beenone female [world title] fight thereso far,” Hearn says. “But women’s boxing is cyclical, like everything. The top end is strong. The middle’s struggling a bit. That’s the same in men’s boxing too.”As for his own future, Hearn won’t deny he’s been tempted to walk away. “It’s the worst business in the world,” he said. “But it’s the most addictive. I’ve loved it since I was eight years old. And I love seeing people change their lives through boxing.”On Friday night, under the brilliant lights of Times Square and the watchful eye of Al-Sheikh, another chapter of that transformation will play out. Whether it marks a renaissance or a reckoning depends on whom you ask – but to Hearn, the answer is already clear. “You have to think differently now,” he said. “You have to be brave. This isn’t the normal world of promotion anymore. This is something else entirely.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingTurki al-SheikhSaudi Arabia and sportUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The ropes are up, the ring gleaming under LED billboards. And on Friday night, three of boxing’s most volatile and compelling stars – Ryan Garcia, Devin Haney and Teófimo López – step into what might be the sport’s strangest stage yet: a pop-up fight arena smack in the middle of Times Square.Barely half a block fromJimmy’s Corner, more than 100 digital screens will beam the feed across the famed Manhattan tourist spot. A closed-off footprint will morph into a fight zone, cordoned by security, hemmed in by chain-link fencing and pulsing with spectacle. A ring abutting the US armed forces recruiting station will be the unlikely epicenter of a tripleheader not quite like anything boxing has attempted before.‘What do you mean we can’t?’: Eddie Hearn on Times Square, Saudi billions and boxing’s new realityRead more“This is going to be very difficult for every single fighter,” said Oscar De La Hoya at Thursday’s weigh-in. “As you can imagine, there will be people everywhere, distractions everywhere.” Those distractions will be hard to ignore, but so will the consequences. For all three headliners – Garcia, Haney and López – Friday marks a pivotal crossroads. A win moves them toward megafights, championship clarity and, potentially, crossover stardom. A loss, on a night this exposed, would sting twice as loud.It’s been nearly a year since Ryan Garcia last entered the ring – and nearly a year since that night turned into something else entirely. Hisemphatic victory over Haneylast April, which featured three knockdowns, was later overturned after Garciatested positivefor the banned substance ostarine. He was also more than three pounds over the 140lb limit. The resultwas ruled a no-contestand Garcia was suspended for a year.Now back and making his debut at 147lb, the 25-year-old seems to understand what’s at stake against Rolando ‘Rolly’ Romero. “This is the weight class I belong in, and I’m excited to start my journey at 147,” Garcia said after weighing in at 146.8lb on Thursday. “I’m not here to give energy to the Haneys, because I’m focused on Rolly tomorrow. Without beating Rolly, we can’t have the rematch with Haney. I’m blessed to have this opportunity, and we’re ready to do our job.”View image in fullscreenRyan Garcia, left, and Rolando ‘Rolly’ Romero face off after Thusday’s ceremonial weigh-in at Manhattan Center ahead of their welterweight fight on Friday night at Times Square.Photograph: Cris Esqueda/Golden Boy/Getty ImagesHe’ll be in with an opponent as unorthodox as he is unpredictable. Romero, who’s 2-2 in his last four outings, has leaned heavily into his long-standing sparring history with Garcia, but isn’t playing it up anymore. “We’re both tired of watching [that video],” he said this week. “It doesn’t matter in the ring on Friday.” Then, on Thursday, he added flatly: “I’m envisioning a vicious knockout. It’s long overdue. I think we’ve been professional so far, but it’s gonna be a knockout tomorrow night.”Garcia will reunite with trainer Derrick James, hoping the partnership brings the discipline his last few fights have lacked. “We’re like yin and yang,” Garcia said. “He’s all technique. He’s not worried about flash.”While Garcia’s redemption arc leads the marquee, the looming subplot is Haney – still unbeaten, still defiant and still the most disciplined technician in the division. Officially, he’s facing former unified champion José Ramírez in a 144lb catchweight bout. But unofficially, everything he says – and doesn’t say – is aimed at Garcia.“I feel better than ever,” Haney said Thursday. “This is gonna be the best performance you’ve ever seen from me. He’s gonna get hurt. It all starts with José, and once I get past José, I’m gonna get to Ryan.”Ramírez, of course, has heard this before. The soft-spoken Californian upset Amir Imam at Madison Square Garden in 2018 to win his first world title and he believes history can repeat itself. “There’s nothing left to say,” he said. “I’ll be talking a lot tomorrow.”The main card opens with Teófimo López, a native of Brooklyn’s Bushwick neighborhood, defending his WBO junior welterweight title against the undefeated Arnold Barboza Jr. López weighed in at 139.6lb, Barboza at 139.8 – both comfortably under the limit for what promises to be the most evenly matched scrap of the night.View image in fullscreenDevin Haney, left, and José Ramírez face off after Thursday’s ceremonial weigh-in at Manhattan Center.Photograph: Geoffrey Knott/Matchroom Boxing“I want to fight,” said López, who donned a lucha libre mask for Thursday’s weigh-in. “I’m ready. I’m tired of everybody bullying me. No more. I’m here against all odds.”Barboza, riding high off a recent upset of Jack Catterall in Manchester, is confident the moment won’t overwhelm him. “We’re both ready to put on a show for New York City,” he said. “I got this from the dirt. I earned this the hard way. We’re the real ‘takeover’ tomorrow.”The undercard features Japanese standout Reito Tsutsumi making his pro debut and a Battle of the Badges three-rounder between NYPD and FDNY fighters. The whole show will start earlier than a typical card in New York with a reported hard out of 10pm.Staging a boxing event in Times Square presentedunique logistical and regulatory hurdles, including securing permits from multiple city agencies, coordinating with law enforcement and transportation departments and ensuring compliance with New York State Athletic Commission protocols in an outdoor, high-traffic public space. Organizers also had to navigate practical challenges like constructing a secure perimeter, identifying dressing room locations and planning fighter access in an area not built for professional sport. Thousands are expected to flood the streets, though only 300 or so will watch from inside the perimeter.That it happens to fall 10 years to the day sincethe sport’s last all-consuming spectacleis a reminder of boxing’s penchant for nostalgia, noise and theatrical excess, even when what it all means is harder to pin down.The unique setting – part marketing stunt, part statement of intent – reflects a sport’s ongoing transformation. For all the talk of lights and spectacle, the event arrives at a time when boxing is being reshaped by new power brokers, new venues and new expectations. But for the fighters, the focus is narrower: win, and control your future. Lose, and get left behind – in a city, and a sport, that waits for no one.Explore more on these topicsBoxingSaudi Arabia and sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The game had been scheduled for release this autumn, but the lack of a definite date was beginning to raise concerns within the industry.Announcing the decision viaa brief post on its website, the company said: “We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.“With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.”It has been more than a decade since the release of Grand Theft Auto V, which has now sold 210m copies, making it the one of the most successful video games of all time alongside Minecraft and Tetris. GTA V was itself delayed several times before its eventual arrival in September 2013.Little has been revealed about GTA VI since the release ofa teaser video in December 2023. The open-world crime thriller is set to take place in the fictional Vice City, GTA’s version of Miami, and its home state of Leonida. The story is expected to follow veteran criminal Lucia as she embarks on an ambitious heist with her male partner.No other information on the GTA VI delay has been given. However, Rockstar’s parent company Take-Two is due to report its financial results on 15 May, when questions from journalists and shareholders will no doubt dominate the session.Explore more on these topicsGamesGrand Theft AutonewsShareReuse this content"

It said it had never received a request for user data from Chinese authorities, or provided user data to them.TikTok was also ordered to suspend data transfers to China if its processing was not brought into compliance within six months.China’s National Intelligence Law of 2017, for instance, states that all organisations and citizens shall “support, assist and cooperate” withnational intelligence efforts.The DPC said data had been “remotely accessed by [TikTok] staff in China”.The watchdog also stated that TikTok had submitted “erroneous information” to its inquiry. TikTok initially told the regulator that it did not store user data from the EEA, but admitted last month that it did allow “limited” European user data to be stored in China.The Dublin-based regulator said it took the “inaccurate” submission very seriously and was considering whether further regulatory action was needed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The divestment comes after Bezos sold $13.4bn ofAmazonstock last year.Bezos is the world’s second richest person, according to Bloomberg’s billionaire index, with an estimated total net worth of $212bn. Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, ranks first, with an estimated total net worth of $332bn.The announcement came just hours afterAmazon reported its first-quarter earningsfor 2025. Revenue rose by 9% in the period to $155.7bn, and profit came in at $17.1bn. Nevertheless, Amazon shares fell in after-hours trading amid concerns around how Donald Trump’s trade tariffs could affect the business.Andy Jassy, the chief executive of Amazon, said it was “hard to tell with tariffs how they’re going to settle and when they’re going to settle” in a call with analysts, adding that there had “maybe never been a more important time” to have the broadest selection of items at the lowest possible prices.Prices on Amazon’s online marketplace have started to rise since Trump announced new tariffs at the start of April, particularly on Chinese imports.Last week the White House accused Amazon of committing a“hostile and political act”after a report suggested the company was planning to inform customers about how much Trump’s tariffs would cost them as they shopped.Amazon has distanced itself from the report, saying the idea had been considered by Amazon Haul, a low-cost shopping hub within its group, but it had been rejected.Bezos and Trump have had a mixed relationship. During Trump’s 2016 campaign, the Amazon founder argued some of Trump’s rhetoric damaged democracy, while Trump said Amazon did not pay enough tax.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He attended Trump’s inauguration earlier this year,alongside other big tech founders, and donated $1m to his inauguration fund.Meanwhile, the Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos, announced days before the most recent presidential election that itwould not endorse a candidate, for the first time in more than three decades. The newspaper thenoverhauled its opinion sectionin February to focus its output “in support and defence of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets”, Bezos said.Shares in Amazon slipped nearly 1% in early trading on Wall Street on Friday.Explore more on these topicsJeff BezosAmazonStock marketsE-commerceInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Analysts had estimated that the company’s EPS would come in at $1.36 on revenue of $155bn. In particular focus: Amazon’s advertising business, which grew 19% in the first quarter of 2025, handily exceeding analyst expectations as well. The company has exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for the previous two quarters.At the close of the first quarter last year, the company reported earnings of $0.98 per share on sales of $143bn. In spite of the growth, shares dropped in after-hours trading.Amazon’s earnings report comes as its stock price has dropped 17% this year over fears that consumers will cut back on purchases in response to the US president’s tariffs. A large number of products on Amazon ship from China, which faces a tariff of a whopping 145% imposed by Trump. The company is expected to report its slowest rate of revenue growth for any period since 2022.Poor consumer sentiment numbers alongside gross domestic product figures reported this week showed the US economy contracting at a 0.3% annualized pace in the first quarter.“It’s hard to tell with tariffs how they’re going to settle and when they’re going to settle,” said Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, in an earnings call, adding that there “had maybe never been a more important time” to have the broadest possible selection of items at the lowest possible prices.Jassy said Amazon had done forward buying of inventory and had encouraged third party sellers to do the same. “We may potentially be able to help customers find what they want no matter what the trends are,” he said.Amazon’s earnings are a backdrop for how the “magnificent seven” tech giants are learning how to deal with the Trump administration and its ongoing trade war with China and other countries.MetaandMicrosoftreported strong earnings on Wednesday despite the uncertainty brought on by the tariffs, though their businesses are somewhat more insulated from duties imposed on imports than Amazon.Analysts at UBS said in a note to clients that at least 50% of items sold on Amazon are subject to Trump’s tariffs and could become more expensive as a result.“Consumers therefore might have to make more difficult choices on where to allocate their dollars,” UBS analysts said.Earlier this month, Jassytold CNBCthat Amazon had not seen a drop-off in consumer demand and the company was “going to try and do everything we can” to keep prices low for customers. But he acknowledged some third-party sellers would “need to pass that cost” of tariffs on to consumers.Earlier this week, the company found itself in the White House crosshairs after a report said that the online retail giant was planned to itemize tariff-related increases in pricing. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt,called the movea “hostile and political act”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My most valued possession when I was twelve was a Casio GD-8 Car Race watch – a digital timepiece that included a built-in racing game on its tiny monochrome LCD display. Two big buttons on the front let you steer left and right to avoid incoming vehicles and your aim was to stay alive as long as possible. I lost count of the number of times it was confiscated by teachers at my school. I used to lend it to the hardest boys in the year, thereby guaranteeing me protection against bullies. As a socially inept nerd, this was invaluable to my survival. I’m pretty sure I still have the watch somewhere, and my determination to find it has been augmented by a recent discovery: these things are valuable now.Casio started making digital watches in the mid-1970s, using technology it had developed in the calculator market to compete on price, but as the decade drew to a close, the market became saturated and the company started to explore new ways to entice buyers.Speaking to Polygon in 2015, Yuichi Masuda, senior executive managing officer and Casio board member, explained, “Casio went back to its original thinking when it first entered the watch market; that is, ‘a watch is not a mere tool to tell the time.’ We started talking about a multifunction [approach], time display plus other things, such as telephone number memory and music alarms.”View image in fullscreenTaking off … children playing Space Invaders in 1980.Photograph: Eugene Adebari/REX/ShutterstockAt the time, Taito’s arcade game Space Invaders was a phenomenon in Japan. And so in 1981 Casio launched the CA-90/CA-901, a chunky calculator watch that included a sort of space shoot-’em-up but with numbers rather than alien spaceships advancing down the screen. “We wanted to create a new lifestyle of enjoying the game anywhere at any time,” said Masuda.But wasn’t Casio also inspired by Nintendo’s Game & Watch series? After all, this iconic range of handheld electronic games started in 1980 with the juggling and catching sim Ball, and its success led to a vast array of titles, including the famed two-screen Donkey Kong that inspired the Nintendo DS. Shinji Saito, general manager and chief producer at the product planning department of Casio’s timepiece business unit, says not. “In 1980, the year before Casio launched the CA-90, Casio launched the MG-880, a game calculator that allowed users to enjoy digital invaders. Nintendo’s Game & Watch was also launched in 1980,” he says. “In developing the CA-90, Casio utilised the development assets of its MG-880 game calculator, but the starting point for the idea was Casio’s development philosophy of creating a new culture using light, thin, short and low-power technology. We werenotinspired by Nintendo’s Game & Watch.”Indeed, Casio was developing a wide array of innovative features at the time including databanks, thermometers and pulse checkers. “Their entire watch range in the 80s was huge,” says watch enthusiast Andy Bagley. “I have been collecting for years and even now I will still come across a model I haven’t seen before; there were many hundreds. I only recently discovered Casio made a range of touch screen watches in the 80s – way ahead of their time!”View image in fullscreenTimes past … Casio Gaming watch page from Vintage Casio cataloguePhotograph: CasioWhatever the case, the CA-90 was such a success that it inspired a period of rampant creativity in the Casio R&D department. Between 1980 and 1985 the company produced dozens of different game watches – an incredible feat considering the limitations of LCD displays at the time, which couldn’t produce computer graphics or animation and simply relied on matrices of pre-set shapes that would switch on and off to suggest movement. There were several different racing games, there were shoot-’em-ups such as Heli-Fighter and Zoomnzap, and there were very rudimentary platformers including Jungle Star, where you play a Tarzan character leaping out of the way of rampaging panthers, and Hungry Mouse, where you are the mouse leaping over incoming cats.Some were more eccentric. Aero Batics was a stunt flying game, while Hustle Monira had you helping a dinosaur catch falling acorns (as opposed to Egg Panic where you caught … falling eggs). There were even rudimentary football and golf sims. As with Nintendo’s Game & Watch titles they were often merely visual variations on very simple game design concepts. But at the time, they felt like science fiction.Of course, Casio wasn’t the only tech company producing game watches in the 1980s. The US firm Nelsonic managed to get a Nintendo license and made watches with games based on Zelda, Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong, while Seiko had its Alba range of game watches throughout the 1980s, including the catchily named Y822-4000, which featured a baseball sim. The most aesthetically wild were from veteran electronic toy firm Tiger, which spent the spent the early 90s crafting gigantically chunky LCD game watches based on film licenses and arcade games such as Double Dragon and Altered Beast. Eventually however, technology and tastes moved on. After the high profilelaunch of the Game Boy in 1989, Nintendo swiftly cornered the portable gaming market. The game watch era was all but over.Now, there is a thriving collectors’ scene. “They are incredibly sought after and very expensive,” says Bagley. “A downside is that they were actually not that well made in comparison to say the all-stainless-steel Marlins, meaning there are not many survivors, hence rarity is an issue. In perfect condition the rarest, most collectible game watches will fetch many hundreds all the way up to £1,000.” For Bagley and other collectors, these watches are nostalgic treasures, recalling an era when kids were disrupting classes not with social media alerts, but hourly digital watch bleeps, and when one publication was absolutely unmissable: “Anyone like me who liked Casios in the 80s will no doubt remember the Argos catalogue,” he says. “It was my personal reference manual for the latest available models; I eagerly rushed to the watch section every time a new catalogue came out to check out the latest innovations.”The watch industry retains its interest in the classic video game scene. In 2022, Timex launched a limited edition range of Space Invaders watches featuring sounds from the game, and earlier this year Casio produced a similarly limited collection of gorgeous Pac-Man watches, sending old fans like myself scurrying to the pre-order section of its website. If you were a slightly nerdy kid in the 1980s these things were your smartphone, your Apple Watch, your grasp at playground cachet. That’s why I want to find my Car Race watch; it’s not really about the potential monetary value – it’s the one thing that really connects me to my 12-year-old self. For all that’s been lost along the way, we still have games in common.Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The result: more of us are getting hopelessly lost, 27 April). In terms of practical advice, though, rather than using the Ordnance Survey app backed up with a paper map, I do it the other way round.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Using a 1:25,000 OS paper map as the primary navigational aid conserves phone battery and allows you to keep an eye on the wider landscape for navigational clues all the time; and the scale is fixed, so after becoming accustomed to it, you have a feel for distances while on the move.TheOS Mapsapp is useful for zooming in on detail, and really comes into its own with its little red locator arrow if, for instance, there is no sign of a path on the open moor. And, of course, it is a godsend if you do lose your way. It is also great for plotting out a route before setting off, to calculate the distance and time to be walked (much more accurate and quicker than laying out bits of string on the paper map, which is how I used to do it). The OS app is the only phone app I pay for, and it is worth every penny.Juliet WoodinNottinghamJohn Harris’s highly pertinent piece on navigation in the outdoors highlights both the issues and some ways to avoid problems. As an experienced hill walker and bird surveyor, I use theOrdnance Surveysubscription OS Maps on my desktop. You soon learn to either print off or screenshot paper maps of varying scales. These can be made semi-waterproof with art pastels fixative and you are never without a perfect paper map matched to your purposes. Add a compass and off you go. We have just used five such maps to guide a curlew survey in south Cumbria and a climb of Blencathra, with stunning views of the lakes.John D PeatfieldBowston, CumbriaAs one of your “older” readers, I laughed out loud to read John Harris saying paper maps can occasionally be useful in our app-disoriented days. I still make my way round London using my old A-Z (it isstill being published), and I pass many people on street corners turning their mobile phones round and round, frowning, obviously lost. Occasionally I offer assistance. I understand that this is no help on a mountain, but I think it is worth reminding readers that it certainly is helpful in central London.Barbara EwingLondonSound advice from John Harris about how to use maps to avoid the navigational hazards ofGPS. For a simple space-time device, keep a pencil handy for sunny days. Held vertically on a flat surface (even a car dashboard can serve), it will cast a shadow to the north at solar noon (1pm BST) – the shadow will appear to move 15 degrees to the east every hour. Check the time, and you may then work out your direction accordingly. But keep the compass for overcast days.Austen LynchGarstang, LancashireI’ve never used GPS or What3words. I have a library of Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 maps that is augmented for each new trip. They are wondrous geographical and historical resources. I am laughed at by my juniors.

In truth, the first three months of Donald Trump’s second presidency have been calamitous on almost every measure. The single biggest achievement of those 100 days has been to serve as a warning of the perils of nationalist populism, which is effective in winning votes but disastrous when translated into reality. That warning applies across the democratic world – and is especially timely in Britain.Start with the numbers that matter most to Trump himself. Aslew of pollsappeared this week, but they all told the same story: that Trump’s approval ratings have collapsed, falling to the lowest level for a newly installed president in the postwar era. He has now edged ahead of his only rival for that title: himself. The previous low watermark for a president three months in was set by one Donald Trump in 2017.Back then, 42% of Americans approved of the way Trump was doing his job. The latest Ipsos survey for theWashington Post/ABC Newshas Trump at just 39%. This, remember, is meant to be the honeymoon period, yet Trump is 10 points behind where Joe Biden stood at this point, 30 points behind Barack Obama and44 points behind Ronald Reagan. Remember: US presidents tend to get less, not more, popular as time goes on.Perhaps most significant is that Trump is weak even in those areas where he’s meant to be strong. Confidence in his ability to handle immigration has tumbled and the same is true, even more critically, of his management of the US economy. On the latter,just 37% back Trump, a depth he never plumbed during his first term, even as the economy seized up under Covid. For the first time since 2001, a majority of Americans believe theireconomic situation is getting worse.With good reason. Because the economic data is almost as troubling for Trump as his poll numbers. This week, official figures showed that the US economycontracted by 0.3%in the first quarter of the year, further fuelling fears of a recession. Trump wasted no time in blaming the shrinkage on Biden, who was in charge for just 20 days of the first three months of 2025, an argument only slightly weakened by the fact that the last quarter with Biden in charge saw growth of 2.4%.It’s a precipitous drop, and the cause of it is hardly mysterious. Economists agree that the culprit is Trump’s tariffs, which prompted a surge in imports, as companies scrambled to buy in goods from abroad before the president’s on-again-off-again levies kicked in. Because those imported goods and services are not produced in the US, they’re subtracted from the headline GDP figure. Hence the contraction. Meanwhile, the chaos and volatility unleashed by Trump’s tariff policy has dented consumer confidence, now down to its lowest level since the recession of 1990, leaving Americans hesitant to spend money amid so much uncertainty. Even though the latest job numbers look healthy, analysts say the underlying picture is alarming.As Bloomberg reports, “corporate investment plans and expectations for growth and jobs have all plummeted – and the key reason is Trump’s trade war.”Trump knows that thewarnings from retail giantsWalmart and Target, of empty shelves as supplies from heavily tariffed China dry up, have cut through. He addressed that anxiety this week, but in a way that should make even Trump’s admirers, those who usually praise his ability to connect with ordinary folk, worry that he’s losing his touch.Asked aboutpotential shortages of toys at Christmas,Trump said, “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more.” Bit late in his career for Trump to don the saffron robes and preach a Zen flight from consumerist materialism. His two-toys remark – which strangely did not feature as one of his campaign pledges in 2024 – has already cast him asthe Grinchset to ruin Christmas.0:56Trump makes false claim more Americans think US going 'in the right direction' than not – video“BE PATIENT!!!” he urges on his social media platform, as he insists that the vertiginous downward slide of the stock market either doesn’t matter or is all Biden’s fault. But the whiff of desperation is strong as Trump begins to see why the one idea he actually believes in and has believed in for decades – tariffs – is an object of near-universal contempt among economists. Yes, tariffs may have succeeded in persuading Apple to shift manufacturing away from China. But those jobs are not about to move to the US. Apple has announced instead that it will assemble its US-bound iPhones in India. Better restitch those red baseball caps with a revised slogan: make India great again.By now, you’ll recall, Trump was meant to have ended the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, indeed he promised to do that by 21 January. But after a brief ceasefire, Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has resumed, the Trump administration having apparently lost interest. As for Ukraine, Trump got to brag of a breakthrough this week, with an agreement that gives the US a stake in Ukraine’s mineral wealth. But it’s far from the deal he sought.The case he always made was that the US had to be reimbursed for the billions it had given Ukraine in military support under Biden – plucking theentirely bogus figure of $350bnout of the air. But this week’s arrangement includesno such payback. On the contrary, the deal is one Kyiv can look on with quiet satisfaction. It seems the Ukrainians could smell Trump’s need to have something to shout about in time for his 100th day, and they leveraged that eagerness to their advantage.As for his expansionist threats to gobble up Panama, Greenland and Canada, the only concrete result those have brought is defeat in Canada’s general election for the pro-Trump Conservatives and a back-from-the-dead success for the Liberal party that vowed to defy him. Such is Trump’s narcissism that he even boasted about that, citing it as evidence of how much he matters in the world. As he put it, just before Canadians voted: “You know, until I came along, the Conservative was leading by 25 points,” he mused. “I was disliked by enough of the Canadians that I’ve thrown the election into a close call.”We’ve never seen a more error-prone, incompetent presidency | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreThe promise was that this second Trump term would be different, that the chaos and churn of Trump 1.0 would be gone. But on Thursday, we were back to the good old days, with the firing of his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, partly for his accidental admission of a journalist into a Signal group chat that discussed attack plans for Yemen, partly for advocating atougher stance on Vladimir Putin, and partly for earning the hostility offar-right conspiracist Laura Loomer, who has the ear of the president.So it’s fair to say the 100 days have not gone as Trump would have wished. And thanks to those serial failures, you can see the first, small signs that his power to terrify is fading. Witness thehandful of senate Republicanswho voted with Democrats against his tariff policy. And note how the reliably rightwing editorial page of the Wall Street Journal is now a fierce critic, slamming Trump as a “bully” anddenouncing tariffsas “the biggest economic policy mistake in decades”. For a few short hours, even Jeff Bezos seemed ready to take a stand,amid reportsthat Amazon was about to itemise the cost of tariffs to US customers, before the company backed down.Of course, none of this should be a surprise. Trump’s conman promises and delusional dreams of turning the clock back were always bound to fail. This is the nature of nationalist populism, whether it wears a red cap in Michigan or aturquoise rosette in Runcorn. It is expert at turning grievance, division and nostalgia into votes. But when it comes to governing, it will always fail. It offers an outlet for complaint – and has no answers at all.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump tariffsRepublicansUS economyUS politicsTariffscommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s the truthNoel RansomeThe country has exported a myth of progressivism. It’s time to confront who we really areFri 2 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 11.08 EDTShareCanada has been canonized – safely, predictably.It’s the great, grave story we’ve exported – retold in economic rankings, stitched into tourism ads, held up in classrooms and cable news panels. We’re the cooler, mellower cousin nextdoor. The country that has it figured out. Where healthcare is universal, democracy is calm and diversity is politely managed.This image has been shared like a TikTok meme for decades – forwarded, favourited, lightly interrogated. Over time, we’ve become more vibe than nation; contradictions, history and horrors flattened into brand energy. Place that flag in your Twitter bio, mention how “we’ll never become like America,” and you’ve bought into the sauce. You’re not the problem, you’re proof the problem lives somewhere else.This kind of deception has always been fundamental to our story. But we need only a glimpse at our neighbour’s constitutional preamble – “We the people of the United States” – to get a hint of the delusion. Canada’s constitutional language, by contrast, never used the populist “we”. From the start, there was no sweeping assertion of collective identity. Instead, theConstitution Act, 1867, opened with:Whereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have expressed their desire to be federally united into One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland …Granted, Canada’s constitutional framework evolved. But from the beginning, the difference in language spoke to the shaping of our identity – through agreements, compromises, legal frameworks, not a people-centered vision. This historical nuance, while subtle, now echoes in modern politics.Canada narrowly missed a far-right prime minister. But we’re not in the clear yet | Tayo BeroRead moreAll that to say: times are spooky for the average Canadian forced to define and defend Canada’s sovereignty. Spooky in ways that can cause one to reflexively feed into a myth, rather than confront the truth of who we are. The gap between our negotiated past and our branded present has never been more plain. Our current leaders are no exception.To any Canadian progressive, it’s stating the obvious to say that Justin Trudeau, the figure most associated with Canada’s progressive identity, was more committed to feeding the myth than confronting it. With his well-timed, photogenic smile –post-blackface, naturally – Trudeau was the perfect mascot. Our self-image personified: tolerant, polished, unthreatening. But branding aside, his government sidestepped moral clarity at home –from pipeline expansionsandbroken promises to Indigenous communities, to a foreign policy on Gaza that rarely strayed from Washington’s script. In moments that demanded progressive definition, he was formless.It would have been naive to think many Canadians would takeDonald Trumpseriously when he half-jokingly suggested in November 2024 that Canada become the 51st state. After all, those words came from someone familiar to us – a man and a Maga movement forged in the belief that something sacred was always being stolen. The enemy, the fuel for his fervor, shifted with the news cycle: migrants, trans youth, teachers, climate scientists, Muslims, Black Americans, DEI initiatives, and the very idea of truth.But the speaker of those words wore the same jacket as Pierre Poilievre, who, just before Trump’s threat, was the undeniable favourite among Canadians to become the next prime minister.What Canadians and others need to confront is that the Trump machine wasn’t purely fueled by cultural resentmentHis rhetoric tapped into the same fears and scapegoating, presenting itself as the antidote to a broken system. Poilievre ticked off his own list of Trump-style grievances: DEI initiatives? “Garbage.” Trans women in women’s spaces? “No place at all.” Immigration policies? “Destroying” a system that requires caps over compassion to curb economic and social pressure. It’s as if he were part of the same tired flock – one that targets the marginalized while promising to fix what he claims is broken. The popular sentiments of a supposedly morally superior land.And this isn’t new. In 2008, as the country prepared to confront thebrutal legacy of residential schools, Poilievre dismissed the moment sanctimoniously, arguing that Indigenous people needed to learn “the values of hard work” more than they needed compensation for past abuses. That’s who was in line to lead the country, as anointed by our polls.In the end, his opponent Mark Carney was victorious. But it should be clear that a shift toward the Liberal leader isn’t clarity about who we are, as much as it is a hedge against a man who seeks to claim us from afar.Carney is no antidote – just a bandage.Cutting ministries for gender equality and disability rightsisn’t healing; it’s harm. His economic nationalism is safer than the far-right’s bluster, but it’s closer to US centrism than a remedy.Trump’s chaotic threats won Mark Carney the Canadian election – but only just | Colin HorganRead moreAs one union representing more than 80,000 educators put it, the move signals “an unwise change of direction” for a country where vulnerable groups are already living in fear. And while Carney served as an executive at Brookfield Asset Management, the companyfaced accusations of violating Indigenous rights.What Canadians and others need to confront is that the Trump machine wasn’t purely fueled by cultural resentment. It was powered, in no small part, by the United States’ historic desire to promote and believe the best of itself – even when the evidence said otherwise.For me, as a Black Canadian, home has rarely been the gentle myth so many sing about. Always polite and tolerant it wasn’t. I’ve seen just as much of the opposite: unmarked graves, flickers of grief, and then silence. I’ve seen headlines and acknowledgments of systematic racism turn to indifference: police brutality, missing Indigenous women, gone like breath during our winters. And yes, I’ve seen the Proud Boys, too. Their founder, Gavin McInnes? Canadian.Canada holds beauty, but it harbours moral rot just as much as the neighbour it claims to rise above. Myth-making can’t save us. If we want to hold onto our sovereignty in this moment, maybe it’s time we stop lying like them – to others, and most of all, to ourselves.Noel Ransome is a Toronto-based freelance writerExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionAmericasTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsJustin TrudeaucommentShareReuse this content"

TheTrump administrationis demanding a say in whom they admit, whom they hire and even what courses they teach.It’s a grim message – abandon your fundamental values, or else. The idea of an “existential moment” has become a cliche, but this situation warrants that grim description. Academic freedom, the lifeblood of higher education, is being threatened.How should these colleges and universities respond?Columbia University has learned the hard way that you can’t negotiate with an autocrat – give an inch and he’ll just come back for more. Harvard has been widely praised for saying “no” to Trump, and justifiably so. But Harvard couldn’t have done anything else. The demands were so outrageous that if the university had capitulated it might as well have closed its doors.The cutoff of $2.2bn in federal contracts and grants, as well as the threat to rescind the university’s tax-exempt status, will take a bite out of research, teaching and financial aid, if ultimately upheld by the courts. But Harvard is, far and away, the richest university in the world, with an endowment north of $50 billion. That’s larger than the gross domestic product of nearly 100 countries. With its deep pockets, it is uniquely situated to carry on, while its phalanx of best-in-the-nation lawyers do battle in the courtroom.Other schools in Trump’s sight include far less wealthy private universities like Northwestern, as well as flagship public universities like the University of California-Berkeley, which have a comparative pittance to draw on. If they say shut the door when Trump & Co. come calling, the consequences would doubtlessly be devastating. But the Columbia debacle shows that there is really no option.Universities compete on many fronts. They vie for contracts and grants, professors and students and endowment contributions. Because they fetishize prestige, they take aggressive action to boost their place in the US News pecking order.But in these desperate times such competition is a ruinous course. The only strategy with a prayer of succeeding is for universities – public and private, well-endowed and scraping by – to come together, making it crystal-clear that they won’t give in to assaults on academic freedom.That’s precisely what happened last week, when more than 200 college and university presidents signed a statement, issued by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, which forcefully condemns the federal government’s “political interference” and overreach” for “endangering higher education.”Stanford, Chicago and Dartmouth are among the top-ranking schools that didn’t sign on. Perhaps their presidents believe that “duck and cover” is their best strategy. As Columbia – which did sign – can tell them, good luck with that.Higher education has long rested on its laurels, confident that Americans appreciate its intrinsic value, but that hasn’t been true for years. The just-issued statement of principle should be coupled with a full-throated campaign to make their case—to demonstrate the importance of universities and colleges in preparing the coming generation to contribute to society as well as carrying out essential, cutting-edge research.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

We can rebuild better than beforeFri 2 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 11.44 EDTShareApoll from the conservativeCato Instituterecently went viral. It found that 80% of Americans think the country would be better off if more people worked inmanufacturing. At the same time, only 25% of respondents said they themselves would be better off working in a factory. What should we make of the results?First, there’s nothing contradictory between these figures. It’s easy to see how it would be good for the country to reshore manufacturing jobs, even if it’s not good for you, personally, to work in a factory. Imagine a local pharmacist in an industrial town. He can see how his business would benefit from the expansion of a nearby plant. Yet he could also see that he would personally lose out on a lot of income if he gave up his trade and marched into the factory himself. The same can be said for any number of other workers. The reason so many people find appeals to reindustrialization attractive is because life was undoubtedly better when the old factories in their town were buzzing with activity than it is today, where they sit idle.Second, that 25% figure represents a lot of people. Across the political spectrum, libertarians atReason Magazine, liberals at theFinancial Times, mainstream conservatives, and even some on the far left have misread this figure. They think 25% indicates a woefully low ceiling for appeals to reindustrialization. Yet currently only 8% of Americans are directly employed in manufacturing. If we gave the people what they wanted, we would more than triple the amount of manufacturing jobs in the United States, an increase from about 12.7 million workers to more than 40 million. That is not small, it’s seismic. That a quarter of Americans think they would be personally better off with a factory job – jobs that are often dangerous and difficult – represents a scathing indictment of the so-called “knowledge economy” that promised prosperity but has often delivered devastation instead.A plea to the West: help us save America’s democracy | AnonymousRead moreBack in 1987, the economists Stephen Cohen and John Zysmanwarned:“Lose manufacturing and you will lose – not develop – high-wage service jobs.” How prescient they were. Everywhere factories have fled, social rot has followed. Since then, wage growth for most Americans has been stagnant. For those without a college degree it has declined. The promise of a “service economy” was built on the myth that jobs in services could simply replace jobs in manufacturing, without any real trade-off. But, as experience has shown, many service jobs have proved to be stubbornly low-waged. And there is good evidence that, all things being equal, jobs in manufacturing still offer payadvantagesover jobs in services. Moreover, as developmental economists have long acknowledged, the health of a nation is tied to the health of its industrial heartlands. Just look at China’s explosive rise to see how important manufacturing is to a nation’s economic strength. Or, alternatively, look at the deindustrialization of the United States, and now Germany, for examples of the equal and opposite effect. A decline, especially a rapid one, in manufacturing is linked to a decline in the social and economic health of the country as a whole.Still, some argue that the only thing special about manufacturing jobs in the US was that the sector was highlyunionizedand that in a more pro-labor environment, service jobs would make just as much money as factory jobs. For instance, Matt Bruenignotes: “McDonald’s workers in Denmark make more than Honda workers in Alabama.” He’s right. Yet, as he knows, the Danish example doesn’t just show the power of unions, it actually helps make the case for a strong manufacturing sector. For one thing, Danish manufacturing workers make nearlytwice the amountthat Danish McDonald’s workers do. For another, Denmark employs nearly twice as many (15.7%) workers inmanufacturingthan does the United States (8%). And, according to theWorld Bank, manufacturing counts for a significantly larger portion of Denmark’s GDP (about 16%) than it does in the United States (about 10%). Ultimately, a major reason Danish McDonald’s workers can earn high wages is that, thanks to intelligent industrial policy, Denmark has retained its manufacturing sector. It is because blue-collar Danes earn high wages that McDonald’s can afford to pay high wages. The same can’t be said of the United States.While unionized service workers at say, Starbucks, may be able to win significant wage increases through union bargaining, they won’t be able to make anything close to the wages made by union auto workers. And that is not due to a lack of effort or heroism on the part of the baristas. It’s structural. Manufacturing jobs simply have greater wage potential than many jobs in services because they have more room for productivity growth and a higher degree of leverage to win wage demands.Increases in productivity, the amount of work accomplished by each worker in a set period of time, make firms more efficient and more profitable. As productivity increases, so do profits, which can translate to higher wages through bargaining. But service firms and factories have very different productivity curves. A Starbucks store can introduce more efficient espresso machines but ultimately the potential for increased productivity is limited by the nature of the business itself. Starbucks is selling a service, a consumer experience, and it’s hard to increase the per-worker output of an experience. This is a problem across the service sector where the rate of productivity growthremains low. By contrast, manufacturing firms can rapidly increase the output of each worker by introducing new techniques and technologies.As a result, these workers have a regular claim to corresponding wage increases – each year they get more productive, they make the company more money, and therefore the company can afford to pay their wage demands. Still, whether they can win those demands depends on leverage. Here too manufacturing workers have the advantage. A strike in a key auto plant can shut down all downstream operations, resulting in windfall losses quickly. Yet no strike at any given Starbucks store could have the same effect. Productivity and worker-leverage give manufacturing its unique high-wage potential, and for these reasons, a strong manufacturing sector has a salutary effect on the entire economy.Even for union baristas,manufacturing matters.Besides the pay advantages, there are other good reasons for reshoring manufacturing. As John Maynard Keynes argued, nationalself-sufficiency, the ability of a nation to provide its own industrial necessities, has all sorts of benefits. Including increased leverage in trade negotiations, more sovereignty over economic policy, and greater potential for robust social programs (remember, none of the famously generous Nordic states allowed their major industries to shrivel and die the way that Britain and the United States have). Put simply, if we want more social equality, we need a better economic balance. Consider that in 1960 almost 95% of the clothing worn by Americans was made in the US – today it is 2%. And unionized American garment workers made more then than Bangladeshi garment workers make now.Finally, reindustrialization is great politics. With the left struggling to reach working-class voters, an economic appeal that reaches some 80% of the country is a good way to win back favor.Donald Trump’s chaotic and contradictory policies won’t yield an industrial renaissance, and his fumbling of the economy could make it yet harder to do so, but while we are in the political wilderness the left should figure out the right mix of industrial policies that can bring back manufacturing jobs. We need to figure out an exit path from neoliberal globalization and that involves a wholesale rethinking of trade and industrial policy; immigration and labor market policies; monetary and fiscal policies.Make America make again? Trump’s tariffs will only be manufacturing pipe dreams | John NaughtonRead moreThe good news is there is hope. As UAW’s president,Shawn Fain, notes, even a modest reorganization of economic policy can result in an instant boost in new manufacturing employment. By the union’s calculations more than 50,000 new jobs could be reshored simply by filling out the capacity of existing plants. That may not sound like a lot, and it’s far short of the 25% figure, but if you’re among those newly employed it could mean the difference between scraping by in a post-industrial town and having a living wage with union rights.Beyond the short term, US deindustrialization, ironically, could be an advantage for its industrial rebirth. After the second world war, Europe saw the most fantastic industrial turnaround ever recorded. Decimated economies such as France and Germany, where industrial towns were bombed to smithereens, suddenly emerged as manufacturing powerhouses. How? The destruction of their old factories gave them a fresh start. Industrial policy-makers didn’t have to deal with stubborn institutional inertia or outmoded infrastructure. While British firms struggled after the war, unwilling to build new plants, French and German manufacturers, with a clean slate upon which to build, surged ahead.Walking through America’s deindustrialized zones is a bit like walking through Dresden after 1945. Maybe then, with a clean slate, we can rebuild better than before.Dustin Guastella is a research associate at the Center for Working Class Politics and the director of operations for Teamsters Local 623Explore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionManufacturing sectorUS politicsInfrastructureUS unionscommentShareReuse this content"

Now we run them to deathElizabeth BanickiFor centuries the horse was our most noble ally – in war, migration and myth. Today we repay that bond not with reverence, but with suffering at the racetrackFri 2 May 2025 04.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 04.54 EDTShareHumanity owes the horse an immeasurable debt. For centuries the horse has been our partner, has shaped our history and sacrificed itself for our defense, our causes, and our conquests. The Native American Comanches, master horsemen, created an empire on the power they conjured from their deep and unique connection with the horse. The horse was critical to their existence as it became to the white settlers of the western frontier who would never have prevented their own annihilation had they not adopted the native’s mounted war techniques. Yet modern society, which has long abandoned warring on horseback, still tolerates dangerous and violent exploitation of the horse. Indeed, taxpayers fund it. Despite the sacrifices these allies have made for our evolution, we continue to demand they forfeit their lives, but not for so noble a cause as our survival. Today horses die not in battle but for sport. Another Triple Crown season means another cache of young horses who will publicly risk their lives for profit and entertainment. Hence the life of the American racehorse, run to death by the hundreds every year, is cheapened and disrespected.Horses are central tomy personal history, and I am bedeviled by memories of my track life, my former self. Years ago, I was galloping racehorses and immersed wholly in the world of racing. I admit to this day as a rider I have pride in my past. Though now as I get older and think more broadly my sense of the wrongness of modern American racing expands to include the context of the historical and philosophical sacrifices horses have made for humans and how dismissed their enormous contributions generally are. Whether one’s love for the horse manifests in the act of dressing up for a day at the races or in recognizing and being honest about the reality of how brutal racing can be to horses it is critical to think of the animal itself and to consider the countless horses who have died and will die for the trivial activity of racing. For them my heart aches. For those who acknowledge that reality and still defend and endorse racing, I am bewildered by that degree of callousness. The human ego is the horse’s most vile predator.The racing industry boasts an era of new tech and practices that it claims lead to fewer deaths which is like saying we are still stealing, we are just stealing a little less. Do we applaud for the killing of fewer horses? To evaluate racing from a position of realism can only lead to the obvious conclusion that it is time to evolve away from this sport that subjugates so many horses to a life of misery and untimely death. It is hopeful to imagine that racing can be done in partnership with the horse and without taking its life but all the intelligence and creativity in the world won’t achieve that.View image in fullscreenA horse is washed after a training session on Thursday prior to the running of the 151st Kentucky Derby.Photograph: Grace Bradley/Getty ImagesOur technological gains as a society do not and cannot compensate for our shortcomings in empathy and decency. Should our society continue to tolerate a sport that routinely and violently kills horses, a creature who has been a solid friend across the ages, we only expose our backwardness. The racing industry’s willingness to sacrifice horses for money and prestige lays bare the fact that despite grandiose proclamations of advancement it is by nature primitive. To enter the starting gate in 2025 and die without finishing the race is no progress for the horse whose ancestors stepped onto a battlefield in 1800 and never saw the end of the fight. Modern day horse racing is simply bad medicine.That night he dreamt of horses in a field on a high plain where the spring rains had brought up the grass and the wildflowers out of the ground and the flowers ran all blue and yellow far as the eye could see and in the dream he was among the horses running and in the dream he himself could run with the horses and they coursed the young mares and fillies over the plain where their rich bay and their rich chestnut colors shone in the sun and the young colts ran with their dams and trampled down the flowers in a haze of pollen that hung in the sun like powdered gold and they ran he and the horses out along the high mesas where the ground resounded under their running hooves and they flowed and changed and ran and their manes and tails blew off of them like spume and there was nothing else at all in that high world and they moved all of them in a resonance that was like a music among them and they were none of them afraid neither horse nor colt nor mare and they ran in that resonance which is the world itself and which cannot be spoken but only praised.Cormac McCarthy, All the Pretty HorsesExplore more on these topicsKentucky DerbyHorse racingUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

You switched on for the latest cinematic episode ofPrince Harryfights the fight – not against the Mirror this time, not against Murdoch either, but against those who have stripped him of his security protection – and then the script goes to places that no one expected.Heloseshis legal challenge in the court of appeal over the degree of security he is entitled to on the public purse while in the UK – that was pretty much expected. But then, in the second instalment of Britain’s longest-running potboiler, he exclusivelyopens an anguished heartto the BBC, post the appeal court verdict, and all sorts of dramatic twists ensue.He says he is devastated, he says he wants a reconciliation with the family from which he is so visibly estranged. Of his father he says: “He won’t speak to me because of this security stuff”, adding: “I don’t know how much longer my father has.” He is, in dark jacket and white, open-necked shirt, a sombre, slightly haunted figure. The victim of a “good old-fashioned establishment stitch-up”. Cut to close-up, run the credits.You may take the view that this is why we still have a royal family. Bread and circuses aren’t the TV draw they once were and the House of Windsor, like all good media entertainment, gives thrills, sparks debate – it adds to the national diet of joy and pain.One cannot be too haughty while watching this stuff and commenting on it, when so many of us are in one way or another complicit. We engage because they interest us, or we don’t engage and tell everyone we are not engaging because to do so make us seem studious and interesting. But either way, we are part of it.Still, it is hard to watch Prince Harry emoting to theBBCroyal correspondent on a gleaming white sofa at a location close to his home in Montecito, California, and not wonder what exactly it is we are part of. We watch a weird family behaving ever more weirdly on a circular stage affording a worldwide audience a clear view of all their rivalries, jealousies, faults, quirks and ailments.Today, in particular, we watch a young man, exiled or self-exiled, depending on your view of all that’s gone before, explain why his father won’t speak to him, that he might never get the chance to speak face to face with him because he might die first and why he no longer feels safe in his country of birth. That may all be true and sincerely felt: if so, it’s all wretchedly sad.That might also be the stuff of cynical performance: a dead-cat distraction to move the headlines away from the rejection of his case by the court of appeal. A plotline that sets up the equal and opposite plotline for next week’s barnstorming episode. But either way, it makes for queasy viewing.You will take a view, you may take a side, but who will look away? Not many; not me. Real-life anguish, confected entertainment, the lines blurred so long ago they hardly matter – this show runs because in our various ways, for our many and varied reasons, we want it to and we tune in. We will its continuance. Sometimes it feels like the only functioning democratic mechanism we have left.Hugh Muir is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPrince HarryOpinionMonarchyBBCKing Charles IIIcommentShareReuse this content"

But success comes with more pressure, more scrutiny and the risk of bruising exposureFri 2 May 2025 12.39 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 12.43 EDTShareWhat else would you expect from a byelection? Governments lose and this government is unpopular. To lose by a hair’s breadth – only six votes – is scant comfort in the forever Labour seat of Runcorn and Helsby, while Reform UK’s win of the mayoralty in Tory heartland Greater Lincolnshire is a symbolic blow to Kemi Badenoch. Both parties of the old duopoly have fallen under the wheels of political distrust and discontent.Change! That’s whatLabourpromised during the general election, and in Runcorn I heard that tossed back at Labour canvassers: well, where is it, then? Keir Starmer today pledged to go “further and faster”. Those changes that have been ushered in have been deeply unpopular. Labour’s mayor of Doncaster clung on, against predictions, by damning the winter fuel allowance, disability cuts and employers’ national insurance rise.Labour promises to “listen” after the day’s bad results – but to who, saying what? Nigel Farage is a threat: look at the damage of his 20-year Brexit campaign, and now he has bigger battalions. If any ill-adviser suggests to Labour that “listening” means turning Farage-wards, just examine the untempting pickings on Reform’s policy plate.Its manifestoshows how weirdly unpopulist these populists are: unexplored in a rebellious midterm spasm, most of its proposals will be a gift to Labour. The idea of tax relief for private health insurance was a disaster when the Conservatives tried it in their 2001 manifesto: dallying with core NHS principles touches a killer live rail in British politics. Likewise, offering 20% tax relief on private school fees is a blunder:Labour’s VAT on private school fees has been highly popular. Despite years of BBC appearances wildly unwarranted by his polling, Farage has proposed abolishing the licence fee, something which is unlikely to be a winner. Expect his new councillors to be grilled locally abouthis dismissal of Sendand children’s mental health as “massively” overdiagnosed.His big tax cuts for business may not resonate in hard times – though hisstealth levy on banks would. His renationalising of our lost utilities is a fruitful theme, but Labour may have done more of that and should boast more bravely about taking back steel (and its similar plans for rail) and creating Great British Energy.He (and the Tories) imagine that opposing net zero is their new Brexit, the great new anti-Labour wedge. On the Today programme last week, Farage was initially evasive when asked whether humans cause rising temperatures. Bring it on, Labour replies. The public is resolutely on the other side:YouGov finds that61% support the net zero target, with only 24% against. That made Tony Blair’sbizarre eve-of-poll interventioneven more quixotic when he called phasing out fossil fuels a strategy “doomed to fail”. The kickback from Labour was refreshingly instant: that sharp rebuke should signal an end to traffic with the Tony Blair Institute.Starmer had only just delivered one hismost forceful speeches, doubling down on climate policy. “This government is acting now, with a muscular industrial policy, to seize the opportunities [in low-carbon technology] to boost investment, build new industries, drive UK competitiveness, and unlock export opportunities. That is the change we need. We won’t wait – we will accelerate.” That’s the way to challenge Reform and Conservatives, further and faster.Now use that full-frontal attack on their immigration policies too: yes, smash the gangs and prevent small boats and strangers arriving without permits, as Yvette Cooper strives to, like all governments. But be honest about the need for particular migrants. Treat people as adults. When asked who should be admitted, public opinion is positive about every occupation, not just doctors and engineers: theyare in favourof migrants filling necessary jobs in areas such as hospitality, farming and care work. They back visas for construction workers by 38% to 16% against. On foreign students, the public are 61% in favour, only 27% opposed,according to British Future. Running away from voters instead of discussing immigration is a political mistake, when openness, clarity and explanation calm unreasonable panics. Do the same on a Brexit reset.This was Farage’s night and the Tories’ calamity. These elections were mainly in Toryland, so they took the most ravaging. The political drama is his tug-of-war with the Tories: will they, won’t they build an alliance, under whose leadership? Tactical voting, as in the last election, will drive together Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat supporters to vote against them, our monstrous system unfit for five-party politics.But this may be peak Farage. He will be weighed down increasingly by his Trump contamination, with the US president phenomenally disliked in Britain. Wait for more Trumptastrophes to inflict increasing damage on him. At a general election, how appealing is a British Trump and yet more mayhem? Brexit will age worse with every passing year.Farage, master communicator of ersatz chumminess, is a surprisingly poor tactician. His is a one-tune party, and even as salient an issue as migration doesn’t alone win general elections. Beyond his talent for dressing up a visceral nastiness with a smile, he blunders in ways that will come under more scrutiny now. His councillors will face bruising exposure.Noteworthy byelection and local election results pepper the past. When Shirley Williams won Crosby in 1981, the national polls soared over 50% for her nascent SDP. I remember internal discussions about who would be in the SDP cabinet. After so many flashes fizzling out, these results may be no augury of Farage ascendant.But if he is, then Labour and Tories should consider this: John Curtice today says Reform has reached the tipping point where first-past the-post can aid it. As Labour last year won a shocking 63% of seats on 34% of votes, so could Farage win a majority on puny votes. Electoral reform is now in every party’s interest, and above all, in voters’.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We could ask Labour, but they’re still fast asleepMarina HydeThe local elections results tell us one clear thing: the ‘two main parties’ offer a change that actually changes nothing – and voters know itFri 2 May 2025 07.58 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 21.30 EDTShareIt’s been a funny old decade. Just over 10 years ago, the comedian Russell Brand was lionised in some quarters for appearing on a Question Time panel with Nigel Farage, and producing what was widely, if bafflingly, interpreted as a brilliant zinger about the then Ukip leader. “He is a pound-shop Enoch Powell,” honked Brand, “and we gotta watch him.” Well now. Perhaps it takes someone who needs to be watched to know someone who needs to be watched. Mr Brand returned to the UK this week from the Florida base of his conspiracist Christian media outlet,appearing in courttoday on rape and sexual assault charges. He denies them.Anyway: the local elections, where the big thing that people said could never happen seems to be happening. Farage now leadsReform UK, which even last year used to be bundled in the “other” category by political pollsters – now its standalone poll results frequently top the charts, with the eponymous two parties of The Two-Party System doing not a whole lot better than simply wailing that it isn’t supposed to be this way. In terms of last night’s byelection, Reform has taken Runcorn and Helsby, one of Labour’s safest seats in the general election you might dimly recall it won by a massive landslide 10 months ago.Reform might have nicked it in record-breaking fashion by only six votes, but the word you rightly keep hearing is “seismic”. Speaking of the mineral kingdom, the missing link between that and the vegetable kingdom – former Conservative Andrea Jenkyns – was victorious in the Greater Lincolnshire mayoral election, and is now the most questionably gifted entity ever to hold the position of mayor, including Mayor Humdinger in Paw Patrol and that goat that was once elected somewhere in Texas. She holds a majority of 40,000.The Runcorn byelection may have been forced by the former Labour MP literallypunching one of his constituents, but people’s metaphorical sense of having been mugged by politics-as-usual was surely a big part of Reform’s surge. Keir Starmer didn’t even bother to go to Runcorn during the entire campaign. Hearing repeatedly this morning from the Labour party chair, Ellie Reeves, that “traditionally prime ministers don’t campaign in byelections” felt like just another way of falling back on weird conventions that no one normal has ever heard of, and expecting the old results. The old results are gone. Hearing people talk politician-speak has tipped over from being annoying, passed through being exhausting, and has now become actively enraging.Yet as the Runcorn result was confirmed early this morning,Labourissued a statement that in many ways epitomises the sense that the old guard won’t – or perhaps can’t – see that they are going to have to find completely different ways of talking to people, let alone how to do it. “Voters are still rightly furious with the state of the country after 14 years of failure and clearly expect the government to move faster with the Plan for Change,” it droned robotically. “While Labour has suffered an extremely narrow defeat, the shock is that the Conservative vote has collapsed. Moderate voters are clearly appalled by the talk of a Tory-Reform pact.” Leaving aside the amusingly questionable analysis, who talks like this? People in politics, I suppose. It’s starting to feel incredibly bizarre, in an age which supposedly prizes authenticity over all things, that most political parties are still communicating in a weird, desiccated way that has all the welcoming charm and accessibility of a panic room.Ditto the idea that a series of small precision pivots is the answer to what is happening with Reform. In the wake of the results, and with huge numbers still coming in, Labour figures were already briefing that the government might make little concessions this way or that. But which way? Going right loses you votes to the Lib Dems and Greens. Going left leaches more to Reform – with the same bind holding for theConservatives. And in any case, the people in question quite clearly aren’t voting for tinkering. They are voting for destruction – creative or otherwise – of the old ways, which haven’t worked for them. How on earth do you respond?Not like Kemi Badenoch, is one of various answers on offer. The Tory leader was in seclusion at time of writing, but her party’s co-chair did emerge to explain: “Kemi has said this is a marathon, not a sprint.” I’m sure whoever used to finish fourth to Usain Bolt liked to claim the same. At this rate, the stadium will have been knocked down and redeveloped before Badenoch has a full policy platform, let alone reaches the finish line.As for Reform, a huge amount of tearful wank was expended over the past few years about people “normalising” Farage, by extension suggesting that any voter who had time for his messages couldn’t really be normal. This is what I think of as the “People’s Vote Fallacy”, so-called after the equally wanky second referendum movement that was named in such a way as to suggest that its leadership were unaware either that there had already been a people’s vote, or didn’t really consider those who had won it to be people at all.Even now you have the general secretary of the TUC, Paul Nowak, this week informing people via the pages of this newspaper that Farage is “a political fraud and hypocrite” and a “public school-educated ex-metals trader cosplaying as a champion of the working class”. Paul must know plenty of trade unionists voted for Farage. Is he saying they’re too dumb to see through him, or just conceding that more of the working class might end up drawn to Farage’s movement than his? Across the conventional political spectrum you can find bigwigs lining up to say Farage is appalling and a chancer, apparently without realising what that then makes them. Namely, someone people find less appealing thanthatguy.Whichever way you slice it, we’re living in a time of flux, and though it is unclear what new order is coming down the line, it is increasingly possible to see that the old one has been fractured. There’s a good line in a Martin Amis novel about a man who begins to crave a cigarette even while he is smoking a cigarette, and on initial inspection it might seem like there is something of that to England, where, less than a year after a change election, people are fervently voting for change. But that would presuppose Labour had contrived to effect any sort of change at all – if it ever even had a plan for it. It doesn’t. Instead, politics is beginning to feel ineluctably tidal – like change is happening to this government, not because of it.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Instead, it is time to think, hard.Voting Reform is essentially lashing out, a howl of protest at the state of everything. It deserves an answer, but copying Greater Lincolnshire’s Andrea Jenkyns – who would putmigrants in tentsbecause hotels are too good for them – ain’t it. Mainstream politicians miserably echoing things they don’t believe merely tells Reform voters that Reform was right all along, while guaranteeing Tory extinction in the southern shires and repelling Greens or Lib Dems whose tactical votes Labour needs.Politics in a time of fragmentation is basically the race to build a winning bloc, some stable-ish combination of warring leftwing or rightwing parties, before the other guy. For Labour, that involves doing some things progressives hate (credible action on immigration, endless flag waving) but sticking to its guns on net zero, rebuilding public services, tackling poverty and hopelessness.If this is 2013 all over again – the last time Nigel Faragetriumphed in local elections– in 2015, David Cameron was reelected. Farage is beatable, but not by chucking the baby out with the bathwater.Now it’s clear: Reform is the new party of the rightJohn McTernanFormer political secretary to Tony Blair and current political strategist for BCWTwo-party politics is back. The election results declared so far this morning show that the future of British politics is a fight between two main parties – Labour and Reform. The opinion polls were right: Nigel Farage is the leader of the right in Britain. The humiliating slump in support for the Conservative party puts Kemi Badenoch’s leadership on life support and means that Reform will dictate the terms of any deal between the two parties of the right. In politics you can never argue with momentum – and Farage certainly has it.With support slumping, Labour retained mayoralties inDoncaster, North Tyneside, and the West of England, pushing Reform into second place – demonstrating that Labour’s Rolls-Royce election machine is still the best in class and that Green-leaning progressive voters can be turned out for Labour when it matters.What should be taken from the results? That the electoral contest is now all about change – that was Labour’s slogan last year and is also the message implicit in the name of Farage’s party. But change to what? Reform is clear – being pro-worker and pro-nationalisation, a sort of Labour-lite. That’s a fight Labour can win if it remembers who the party is for.Labour has no connection with voters on an emotional levelCarys AfokoCommunications strategist and co-host of the Over the Top, Under the Radar podcastThere are still many votes to be counted. And, even once they are in, the number of seats being contested this week is too small to tell us anything definitive about the UK’s political future. So far, turnout has been low, and Reform’s surge has mostly harmed the Conservatives. But the results, especially in Runcorn and Lincolnshire, are still a headache for Labour.They should be a sign that their current strategy isn’t working. There will undoubtedly be some in the party who look toMark Carney’s recent victoryin Canada and say the solution is a change of leader. Switch out Keir Starmer for Wes Streeting and all our troubles will be over.They are missing the bigger issue. What Nigel Farage and Reform have is momentum and, more importantly, a coherent story about what is wrong with Britain and what must happen to fix it. Until Labour has a competing story that connects with the public on an emotional level it will continue to flounder. Farage launched his local election campaign riding into a rally on a JCB and talking about potholes. He ended his speech with a five-year plan to get Reform into government. Labour needs to be similarly bold in setting out a vision and aseffective in communicatingit.Voters have lost faith in the old, tired partiesCaroline LucasEnvironmental activist and former Green MPWe are celebrating our gains in counties such as Gloucestershire, Devon and Worcestershire, where we have taken seats from both Labour and the Conservatives. And in areas now dominated by Reform, such as Staffordshire and Durham, it falls to us to show robust and principled opposition.We’re now in an unprecedented era of five-party politics in the UK, yet we’re stuck with first past the post – an electoral system built for a bygone era of two-party dominance. The result is a fundamentally broken relationship between how people vote and who holds power – and, as the outcomes of the byelection in Runcorn and theGreater Lincolnshire mayoraltyhave just shown, the main beneficiaries are the populist Reform, capitalising on public anger and weaponising it against minorities and against our institutions. Whatever the final results today, one thing is certain: if we’re serious about restoring trust in politics, we have to start by replacing our archaic voting system with a fairer alternative.There are particular lessons for Labour. Trying to out-Reform Reform doesn’t work. Instead of lurching to the right, the government urgently needs to rethink its approach. It could start by addressing the genuine concerns of working people by taxing wealth so we can rebuild our creaking public services, and reversing its cruel decisions toremove support from sick and disabled people.As Greens, we understand why people have lost faith in the old, tired parties. As they collapse in popularity, we know we will take votes from both, as we did in the general election, where even under the two-party system we’ve managed to work strategically to break through – often being the only credible alternative to the rise of Reform. And unlike Reform, we have a track record of delivery, having formed part of the ruling administration of over 40 councils, including Bristol city council, wherewe took controllast year. We’ve increased our number of councillors seven years in a row, and we are sure this will be an eighth. We know voters want change, and Greens have that bold and positive vision that stands in contrast to Reform whose politics breed fear and division.Labour should take note of how the Lib Dems have played these electionsMeral Hussein-EceLiberal Democrat peerIt is often said that all politics is local. We have rarely seen such volatility in local council elections, as voters are increasingly motivated by national concerns such as the cost of living.The Liberal Democrats have made significant council seat gains, especially in the south-west of England, building on the 72 MPs elected last July. At the time of writing, it looks as though the Lib Dems have overtaken Labour in terms ofcouncillors electedso far, making the second largest number of net gains.With Reform’s dramatic win of Runcorn and Helsby, it would appear that voting for the party is the new spoiled ballot paper, a protest vote from both former Tory and Labour voters. Reform’s success matters in terms of policy direction, if it means Labour will mimic its policies to win back voters. The Tories are already adopting Reform policies while telling people not to vote for them. The government should take note of how that is working out.Whatever their excuses, this was a dismal result for the ToriesHenry HillDeputy editor of ConservativeHomeThere are bad nights and there are very bad nights, and for the Conservatives last night was the latter.Reform has performed right at the top end of pollsters’ expectations, winning overall control of Staffordshire and Lincolnshire councils from the Tories, as well as chalking up significant wins against Labour, most obviously in the Runcorn and Helsby byelection.Most Conservatives had “priced in” a poor performance. While the party has in the past done well in local elections after leaving office (under William Hague it picked up hundreds of councillors in 1998), the circumstances this time were quite different.Rather than slowly falling apart during a whole parliament, as did the Major government, the last Conservative government fell from grace with extraordinary speed. That meant these elections were last fought at the apex of Boris Johnson’s popularity – and that was never going to be a flattering yardstick.Kemi Badenoch and her team have also been, from the start, making the case that these elections were simplytoo soon to countas a real test of the new leader.But it’s one thing to make these rationalisations to yourself in the abstract, and another not to panic when the real results come in. And Tory MPs have made a habit of panic.Reform should make the most of its success – it won’t lastPeter KellnerFormer president of YouGovNigel Farage should enjoy Reform’s triumphs while he can. This may be as good as it gets. In May 2015, his former party, Ukip, gained control ofThanet district council. Before last night, it was the only time any of his parties won the power to run anything. What pointers does it offer to the months ahead?Ukip’s 10-seat majority in Thanet should have given it four years of power to show what its new brand of politics could achieve. Alas, it turned out, that was very little. Six months later, five of its councillors defected, following internal rows about a local airport. A byelection subsequently restored its majority, but only until another councillor defected, saying Ukip had failed to make “significant change”. The following year, 12 Ukip councillors peeled off to form an independent group. Ukip’s days in charge of Thanet were over. In 2019, it fielded just three candidates. They all lost.Thanet was not the only place where Ukip struggled. In 2017, seven of its 12 councillors in Great Yarmouth defected to the Conservatives – although to be fair, some defections elsewhere went the other way, including two Tory MPs, Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless.Maybe it will all be different this time. After today, Reform will havemany more chancesto show what it does with power. An era of milk, honey and joyful unity – or arsenic, ashes and destructive divisions? We shall see.Explore more on these topicsLocal elections 2025The panelLocal electionsReform UKLabourConservativesGreen partyLiberal DemocratscommentShareReuse this content"

Earlier this year, Beckham, still impressively bronzed, toned and sculpted, was modelling his own line of underwear. Today, he turns 50. It would be fair to say he looks good for it.But how does it feel to be 50? If memory serves – and it doesn’t, really; it was a while ago now – 50 is not so much a landmark age as a whistle stop between 40 and 60. At least, that’s how it seems with hindsight. At 40, there are still big questions to answer – “When do I actually become an adult?” being chief among them. By 50, you begin to understand that adulthood is no longer a desirable goal – you’ve already passed through the era when it would have counted for something.Yes, 50 can be depressing, but it’s not as depressing as turning 60. Take my word for it. Sixty is when you realise that the only way forward is to develop an immunity to embarrassment, because shop workers have started smiling with pained forbearance when you can’t figure out which end of the reader to tap your card against (because they keep changing it, for no reason).Fifty, on the other hand, comes at you like a blessed reprieve: you are just beginning your ascent on the far side of the so-called happiness curve, climbing up from the trough of discontent that typically ensnares people in their 40s. If you treated your 40th birthday as a wake-up call – a time to embark on the new career path, dietary regime or exercise plan, before it was too late – then by 50 you and your life should be in pretty good shape. If you didn’t, then 50 offers you one more chance to change course. It turns out it’s not too late.Boomers, with their knack for making everything all about them, destigmatised ageing as they reached each new milestone (you’re welcome). Thus 60 became the new 40, and by default 50 became the new 30. Except: what 50-year-old would want to be 30 again? Who would want to return to that age of insecurity and ignorance? Not me. I remember that guy, and he was very difficult to work with.David Beckham is modelling in his pants again. Will he not think of his fellow middle-aged men?Read moreIt’s unclear how any of this might affect David Beckham – how wealth and fame and really good abs might distort the arc of the happiness curve. How does 50 feel for someone who was once best known for being young, who made his professional debut at 17, and got his first England cap at 21? Someone who raised questions about whether his maturity could ever keep pace with his talent?One thing we know about David Beckham is that he plays a good long game. I’m not worried about him. But even Beckham might find the prospect of his 50th birthday party – however lavish – depressing. At the time, you think it might be the last fun party you’ll ever attend. Don’t panic – other people you know will have 50th birthdays, and some of them will spend more money than you did.As I said, I don’t remember much about turning 50, or anything about the party my wife threw for me. I only really remember the next morning, when, badly hungover, I got up early and went down to the back garden to find every flat surface covered in cheap Ikea wine glasses, each of them exactly half full of rain. That was as good a metaphor for turning 50 as I was likely to come across, so I promised myself I would never elaborate on it.Tim Dowling writes a regular column for the GuardianExplore more on these topicsDavid BeckhamOpinionAgeingcommentShareReuse this content"

It joined a major US military operation thatstarted in Marchand has involved 45 days of airstrikes.Operation Rough Rideris a demonstration by the Trump administration that it will prosecute a vigorous war that is more intense than under Joe Biden, and has, according to the US,already seenmore than 1,000 targets hit.The RAF operation reportedly targeted a plant manufacturing armed drones used in Houthi attacks on shipping transiting the Red Sea, and demonstrated thatKeir Starmerhas decided to be Donald Trump’s closest military ally.Since shortly after the start of the current war in Gaza, the Houthis have been attacking commercial shipping linked in some way to Israel, with the stated motive of supporting the Palestinians. Traffic through the Suez canal almost halved between 2023 and 2024,according to one analysis. The main US response has been airstrikes, starting under Biden in January 2024, and included five series of airstrikes by the RAF early that year, all approved by Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government.What is happening now is at a higher tempo, but has attracted little media attention. That may now change, an immediate concern being reports ofhigh civilian casualties.These include a US attack earlier this week, whennearly 70 African migrantswere killed when a detention centre was bombed, according to the Houthis.Since this war with the Houthis started, there have been thousands of targets hit, the great majority by US air force and navy units. But the UK’s involvement has been much more than merely symbolic. Six weeks ago, for example, a UK tanker aircraft operating out of RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus supported USAF aircraft during airstrikes thatkilled 53 people, including women and children.I saw illegality and complicity with war crimes. That’s why I quit the UK Foreign Office | Mark SmithRead moreThe Akrotiri base may be specifically linked to the US war against theHouthis, but its significance in the wider Gaza war goes well beyond that – serving as a hub for the US and UK militaries as they support Israel in diverse ways.RAF surveillance aircraft, for example, haveconducted more than 500 flightsover Gaza since the war started. While they are officially concerned with searching for hostages, they tend to be particularly intense when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are engaged in major offensives, and on one occasion a RAF spy plane even likely landed at a base in Israel itself.Separately, US military aircraft have used Akrotiri for multiple functions, with the UK authorities deeply reluctant to provide information, even to members of parliament. Unofficial indications suggest that the potentialmovement of US special forcesinto Israel, as well as military transports taking in armaments, both go via Akrotiri.The RAF and IDF have along and close relationship, with frequent visits of senior personnel each way. In addition, during the current Gaza war, there have been Israeli military transport aircraftlanding at the RAF’s main operating baseat Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.Looking at these and other examples of the close connections between the UK and Israeli militaries, there are significant political consequences. The first concerns the evolution of the war itself, whereIsraelhas come under much greater criticism for the violence of its conduct, the longer the war has lasted.Despite this, it is aided by Trump’s persistent support, which allows Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to act with impunity. Its conduct has already attracted the unwelcome attention of the international court of justice and the international criminal court. Israel has also reduced itself to being a pariah across much of the world, including states where there waspreviously much support.SinceIsrael broke the recent ceasefire, its imposition of a blockade of food, medical supplies, fuel and water into the territory has added even more to the bitter criticisms. Moreover, even in the very unlikely event of an early end to the war, the damage will persist for many years, if not decades.This is where the second political element comes in, especially in Britain with the Starmer government. Among a substantial proportion of the public, especially on the broad political left, support for the Palestinians has become deeply embedded in the political discourse.It is reflected in the numerous demonstrations and meetings in towns and cities, many of them weekly yet scarcely reported in the mainstream media. Added to this are the instances ofdirect action against UK-based companiesproviding Israel with military equipment.Labour’s rapid decline in the polls in recent months is down to many factors, but the Starmer government’s continuing support for Israel, despite its conduct in Gaza, is directly affecting committed long-term supporters on whom it depends. Many of the members who have left the party since last July’s general election did so with Gaza being the last straw.This week’s RAF raid inYemencomes as part of Trump’s enlarged regional war and just as the Netanyahu government, with US support, uses increasingly brutal methods to bring Gaza under control. Just now, Starmer’s government could be using its limited influence to try to rein in Netanyahu. Instead, it is increasing its military support for Trump and getting even more embroiled in a deeply controversial conflict.Paul Rogers is emeritus professor of peace studies at Bradford UniversityDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They also plan to ignore advice that Australian nature is in poor and deteriorating health and strip back already limited funding for environment programs.On the evidence we have, they propose nothing to take their place. The sole climate-related idea on the table is a widely mocked plan to boost coal and gas-fired power for the next two decades and eventually buildtaxpayer-funded nuclear plants.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterThe Coalition optimistically claims two reactors could be in operation by the mid-2030s – an assertion based on a series of heroic assumptions, including that Dutton could pass legislation to lift a ban on nuclear energy in Australia and that reactors could be built faster and cheaper than has been possible in any comparable democracy. It’s a fantasy. Don’t believe me? Listen to the senior Coalition figures who have said so.Party’s climate and energy proposalsDutton’s argument that the country should have a serious discussion about whether nuclear energy should be part of Australia’s zero emissions arsenal might have carried more weight if he were not so determined to kill off all programs designed to set up a future climate response.The Coalition has promised to abolish tax credit programs to support the development of critical minerals, green hydrogen and green aluminium. It wouldcut tax breaks for electric vehicles and scrap a vehicle efficiency standardthat requires auto companies to sell progressively cleaner cars. It would strip $1.7bn funding over the next four years from the Australian renewable energy agency, which provides grant funding for prospective clean technology. It would not back a Labor promise to drive a shift in electrification bysubsidising home batteries.Australian election 2025 voting guide: everything you need to know, including when and where you can vote on the dayRead moreIt would also slow the rollout of large-scale solar and windfarms and batteries, in part by axing the rewiring the nation program to fund new and strengthened electricity transmission connections. It would abolish the Net Zero Economy Agency created to help communities – particularly in areas that are home to fossil fuel industries – adjust to changes ahead.It’s possible some of these changes could be justified – not every government program is well targeted and rolled out. But to plan to dump them all, and offer nothing meaningful in their place, gives the game away.The Coalition claims to want Australia to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but you can’t get there by just building a few nuclear reactors after 2040 – assuming that is even possible. It will be a challenging task, socially, politically and logistically, and demands a holistic plan to drive and harness changing practices across the economy and country.Dutton pretends it will just happen. There is no evidence-based world in which this should be taken seriously.It is not a given that Liberal-National governments have an anti-climate action platform. In NSW, a Coalition government introduced a nation-leading policy tounderwrite and expand renewable energythat passed in 2020 with support from Labor and the Greens and was widely applauded. We can only imagine what might be possible if this cooperation happened nationally.The federal Coalition’s position – backed by some of the country’s biggest media companies – has many side effects. Probably the biggest is that it keeps the centre of national debate away from the serious conversations that need to be had about the future.Labor, still scarred by years of largely baseless scare campaigns suggesting doing anything on climate would wreck the economy, has done little more than stand still on climate at this election. It has released only one policy of note – the 30%subsidy for batteries for households and small businesses. Anthony Albanese also announced that if re-elected he hoped to host a “Pacific Cop” climate summit in Adelaide next year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBut the big questions it will need to grapple with if re-elected have been ignored in campaign debate.Labor plans to set a 2035 emissions reduction target by September. Preliminary advice from the Climate Change Authority, now chaired by former NSW Liberal minister Matt Kean, has suggested a range of 65%-75% below 2005 levels would be achievable.The target’s announcement will be a big moment in setting the course of the economy for the next decade, and will demand new policies to meet it. The debate is likely to also lead to more thorny conversations about the future ofAustralia’s fossil fuel exports, which continue to increase. That these issues were not considered worthy of discussion in four televised leaders’ debates during the campaign is pretty extraordinary, to put it mildly.While it hasn’t said much about it, the Albanese government was working before the election on a net zero plan, sector-by-sector economy decarbonisation plans and a domestically focused national climate risk assessment and an adaptation plan. It is also sitting on a long-finished report assessing the security risks related to the climate crisis.These issues cannot be pushed aside for ever. Depending on where things end up after Saturday, a big part of the push for them to be properly addressed is likely to come from the parliamentary cross bench – the Greens and community-backed independents.Having surprised nearly everyone with its historic surge at the2022 election, famously increasing from 6 to 16 lower house MPs, it’s possible the cross bench doesn’t expand much this time, or even goes backwards. Many of the seats are tight contests.Australia election 2025: interactive map, federal seat explorer and electorates guide – from safe to marginalRead moreBut with theClimate 200 fundraising bodyhaving identified 35 campaigns as worthy of support, including in regional electorates where independents came from nowhere to nearly win last time, there is also a scenario in which a shift away from the established big parties becomes even more entrenched.If that happens, it will mostly be towards people who want more focus on the issue, not less.

Now, she’s wrapping up her hit Netflix serial killer series and entering her detective eraFri 2 May 2025 08.00 EDTShareIn the beginning, Penn Badgley assumed his new co-star in the smash-hit Netflix thriller You was a lot like her character. This, jokes said co-star Charlotte Ritchie, was “somewhat rude. Because it shows he did no research about me.” If he had, Badgley would quickly have deduced that the Londoner was nothing like Kate Galvin, a ruthless British heiress, who – for some godforsaken reason – decides to marry his serial killer protagonist Joe Goldberg. Instead, the 35-year-old has cemented her place in the British comedy firmament with her perky, subtly goofy screen presence and impeccable comic timing, as showcased in beloved comedies from university life opusFresh Meatto the BBC’s ingeniously silly supernatural sitcom Ghosts.At first, Ritchie was nervous about joining You. The drama, thenthree seasonsin, was already a colossal hit, adored for its knowingly ludicrous premise, bizarre twists and Badgley’s virtuoso portrayal of an apparently empathetic femicidal maniac. On set, Ritchie was impressed by Badgley’s ability to segue from “smart self-awareness” to serial killer mode. “His eyes go kind of wide and his face goes totally blank and inside I was like: Oh my God, that’s so horrifying!” she says.She “struggled at the beginning of filming – the classic imposter syndrome of coming into something so big”. It didn’t help that, upon arriving on set, she “really felt like nobody knew who I was or what I’d done”. Thankfully, that didn’t last. “I have to say I was really chuffed because Penn got Covid. That’s not why I was happy. But he started watchingGhostsand he really loved it. And it was so nice to get to share that with him, because Ghosts is so important to me.” (That said, Ritchie admits she still hasn’t seenGossip Girl, the 00s teen drama that made Badgley’s name.)View image in fullscreen‘I discovered a go-getting spark in New York!’ … Ritchie.Photograph: David ReissI’m speaking to Ritchie – who is just as friendly, unassuming and mildly awkward as fans might assume – on the day the fifth and final season of You is released. She has decamped to New York for promo, and is currently in a swish hotel room overlooking Central Park. To celebrate the show’s swansong, Netflix created an immersive version of Mooney’s, the bookstore Joe manages and Kate later buys for him, and whose basement – unbeknown to her – houses a large glass cage used by Joe to entrap his victims. Ritchie didn’t get to meet many actual fans at the event – it was an influencer-heavy crowd – but excitedly recalls encountering some devotees in the wild. She was out getting pancakes when she chanced upon a group of girls discussing You. “It turns out they thought I looked a bit like the girl from the show. And, quite unlike me, I was like: hey, you guys talking about the show? It was so lovely.Actually,” she abruptly puts a lid on such earnest enthusiasm. “One of them hadn’t seen it. I might have ruined their breakfast.”Speculation about the end of You has been rife: would nightmarish “nice guy” Joe get his just deserts or live happily ever after with Kate, who returns to New York with him and his son Henry at the end ofseries four? (Critics, it must be said, weren’t hugely impressed with theeventual answer.) I won’t give away our antihero’s fate, but it’s no spoiler to say that the show closes with a meta comment on the viewers’ complicity in his crimes – after all, we’ve been lapping up the antics of a murderer for years. Ritchie endorses this take, but only to an extent. “The best way to shut down a toxic character – or an attention-seeking psychopath – would be to not pay them attention. But just as you think he could have some redemption, he says: well, I guess [the blame is shared] because you guys love me so much. Heaven forbid he just takes responsibility for his actions, and realises we’re watching because we want to see him punished.”As for the actual denouement, Ritchie has spent the last year keeping stumm. “I didn’t want to ruin it for people. Like when Dumbledore died in Harry Potter and someone put a big banner on the bridge.” She mentions this as if it’s some epochal world event; I have to say I have no idea what she’s on about. “The day after the book came out, someone skim-read it then [made the banner],” she says, still palpably outraged. “I thought: you suck!”View image in fullscreenKiller couple … Ritchie with Penn Badgley in You.Photograph: NetflixAs it happens, Harry Potter was one of the starting blocks for Ritchie’s career. As a schoolgirl, she can be spotted sitting behind Harry and Ron in a Hogwarts classroom inHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire– though she is determined to play down her role as an uncredited extra (“I am student number 4007 and I’m waggling my eyebrows for about five minutes”; when she saw the finished scene she “thought I really overacted and was pretty ashamed”). Ritchie had become enamoured with acting – particularly of the comic variety – as a child: “I remember really clearly making someone’s grandad in the front row laugh at a sketch I did at primary school and thinking that felt great. And I can’t work out if that was an ego boost thing or a control thing.” Was she the funny one among her peers? She makes a face: “All my friends would say nooo,no.”In fact, Ritchie soon set off on a different path, joining classical girl group All Angels, whose first album became the fastest-selling classical debut in UK chart history. Sixth form saw her ricochet between concerts at the Royal Albert Hall and the O2 and lessons. The juxtaposition was surreal: after an evening on stage she would find herself “in double history thinking: What?! Did I imagine that?” She didn’t mention her showbiz escapades to her friends, having “learned at a young age that telling hilarious stories about my acting adventures was only really interesting to my mum”.It sounds like an awful lot for a child to handle, yet it’s only now that Ritchie is “beginning to realise that the pace of life I thought was normal in my teens and my 20s was too much. But at the time I was running on adrenaline and I thought anxiety was a sign of doing really well.” At her selective, “high-pressure” girls’ school, Ritchie was a conscientious student, and unsurprisingly these instincts didn’t leave her at university. She was cast as Fresh Meat’s Oregon – an ordinary girl with an eye-watering determination to appear edgy and cool – in her final year at Bristol. The show was a big deal, but her perfectionist tendencies meant that after a hard day’s filming, Ritchie spent her evenings ploughing through her English dissertation. “Looking back, I do wish I hadn’t worked so hard on it. No one’severasked me what I did or got.” I seize the opportunity. “It was about how the movement of time manifests in language,” she says, baffled by the brain power of her younger self. “I don’t know how I managed to get that together. And I got a 2.1. I was pretty chuffed.”Despite her excellent performance in Fresh Meat – and the excellence of the show in general (it was, after all,SuccessioncreatorJesse Armstrongand his writing partnerSam Bain’s follow-up toPeep Show) – success wasn’t immediate. “I don’t even know if I got one job between series one and two. I’d met other actors who had been going to LA to do a pilot season, and I remember asking my agent, should I? And she was very sweetly like: I don’t know if this is the right time. You’ve done one thing.” To the casual observer, however, it looks as if she has been in high demand ever since, with lead roles in sitcoms Siblings and Dead Pixels, a four-series stint inCall the Midwife, an appearance on Taskmaster and cameos in comedies includingStath Lets Flats(she did an Edinburgh fringe sketch show with creator Jamie Demetriou when they were both students).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ritchie has just starred alongside Alicia Vikander and Elizabeth Olsen in the dystopian fertility dramaThe Assessment. Next, she’s joining Tom Burke and Steve Coogan in Legends, the true story of the UK customs officers who infiltrated drug-dealing gangs in the 1990s.But before all that, she’s entering her detective era thanks to ITV thriller Code of Silence. Written by Catherine Moulton, who recently penned twisty hitThe Stolen Girl, it follows Ritchie’s DS Ashleigh Francis, who enlistsRose Ayling-Ellis’s deaf canteen worker to lip-read on an investigation. Getting to run the gamut of police procedural tropes felt “quite monumental. It was really fun to say things like ‘stand down’ or use a walkie-talkie.” She frowns at her example. “That’s so basic, I can’t believe I said that.” But Ritchie was also keen to prevent her permanently exhausted Francis from becoming a stock character. “There’s details you can put in – I had her eating like a million sweets because she’s never slept enough and she’s had enough coffee. So there’s always a Haribo on the go or some strawberry laces.”If the actor herself is feeling at all worn out, she’s hiding it well. She says she feels reinvigorated – partly thanks to her experiences filming You: New York “ambition and optimism” has rubbed off on her. “I think I discovered a bit of go-getting in me while I was here. I definitely came back to London with a spark.” Does what she’s aiming to go and get stretch beyond her flourishing acting career? “Actually yes, but if I say it then I won’t do it so I’m going to try anddosome of it this year and if we speak again I’ll tell you …” She sighs at her own obfuscation. “That soundssomysterious – basically yes but I haven’t quite worked out what it is …” I am left none the wiser, yet also reassured: her time on slick US sets may have given Ritchie a new lease of life, but the bumbling Britishness that has made her one of our comedy queens clearly dies hard.Code of Silence is on ITV1 on 18 May; You is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsCharlotte RitchieTelevisionDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Despite being on Russia’s ‘wanted’ list, she remains hopeful for the futureFri 2 May 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 12.26 EDTShareTen minutes into our interview, Nadya Tolokonnikova ducks to fetch a piece of paper from the floor and I find myself looking at something unexpected behind her. Next to a double bed, two crucifixes hang on the wall. Given the Siberia-born artist is best known for a performance piece that so offended the head of the Russian Orthodox church that he called it blasphemy, the discovery of such devotional regalia comes as a surprise. It certainly doesn’t suggest “religious hatred”, which is what a Moscow court said in 2012 motivated Tolokonnikova’s groupPussy Riotto perform a “punk prayer” in the city’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, before sentencing her to two years’ imprisonment. Nor does it smack of someone bent on hurting the “religious feelings of believers” – the charge under which Tolokonnikova was sentenced again two years ago, this time in absentia, and put on Russia’s wanted list.Famous for performing in garishly coloured balaclavas, Pussy Riot appeared unmasked in court in 2012 – which turned the photogenic Tolokonnikova into the most globally recognisable face of a wave of protests against the then Russian PMVladimir Putin. But looking at those bedside crosses, and at her new exhibition in Berlin, you wonder if everyone got the wrong end of the stick. Part of the German capital’s gallery weekend, her solo show Wanted at Galerie Nagel Draxler feature not only a replica of her former prison cell and a screening of the Putin’s Ashes performance that led to her wanted status, but also Tolokonnikova’s own paintings of religious icons. She uses tasteful old Slavic calligraphy techniques – while putting the icons in Pussy Riot ski masks.Putin’s Ashes by Pussy Riot.“I don’t have any hatred of the Orthodox church,” says the 35-year-old, who prefers her location not to be disclosed, as she speaks to me over Zoom. “I don’t like the corrupt elements, but it is a part of the heritage our country can actually be proud of.” She pauses. “That was something very difficult to communicate to the judge, who didn’t want to listen.”The Punk Prayer electrified Europe and beyond. Balaclavas appeared inHollywood filmsand on the runway atNew York fashion week. “Progress is not guaranteed / I say Pussy Riot’s what we need”,sang American singer-songwriter Jeffrey Lewis. “Pussy Riot are a reminder that revolution always begins in culture,” the Guardianpronounced. But the revolution never came. Pussy Riot’s protest marked a genuine moment of weakness in Putin’s system, but their boldness may have inadvertently led the world to view Russian society as more courageous and determined than was the case.“I think it’s awesome that you guys romanticised Russian society,” says Tolokonnikova, with a cheerfulness that teeters on sarcasm. “The fact that you saw it as strong may have been a factor in it believing it actually was.”View image in fullscreenPussy Riot performing last year.Photograph: snapshot-photography/F Boillot/REX/ShutterstockThe last time shespoke to the Guardian, Tolokonnikova expressed hope that opposition leader Alexei Navalny could one day become a “worthy successor” to Putin. But Navalny, who supported Pussy Riot’s cause after initially dismissing them as “silly girls”, died in prison in February last year. “Maybe one day we’ll believe in someone as much as I believed in Navalny,” she says. “But not now.”What, amid all these devastating turns, does she find to draw hope from? In her 2018 book Read and Riot: A Pussy Riot Guide to Activism, Tolokonnikova wrote: “Art is capable of giving hope and meaning to those who are desperate.” But looking at her recent artistic output, you have to squint hard to detect much light.The Berlin exhibition is inspired by her reading of the work of the US clinical psychologist and trauma specialist Peter A Levine, who suggests patients close their eyes and revisit their traumas – while trying to relate different bodily experiences to them. So Tolokonnikova chose to build a replica of the isolation cell she was transferred to after going on hunger strike in 2013, leaving the open wards where she spent most of her incarceration. “I was thrilled when I was put in that cell,” she says. “The Russian system of penal colonies still resembles the gulag: people put in barracks without any personal space. So we only could dream about a personal cell.”View image in fullscreenTolokonnikova with her work Punk’s Not Dead Icon, left.Photograph: Philip Cheung/The GuardianAlongside this duplicate cell, other things will bring Tolokonnikova’s time there alive: her prison badge, the pay stubs for the paltry sums she received for her labour, and drawings sent to her by her young daughter. There will also be a print-out of theopen letterin which she announced her hunger strike in protest at the “slavery-like conditions”. It was smuggled out of jail by her ex-husband, the artist and activist Peter Verzilov, and led to an investigation, followed by the conviction of a member of the prison administration. It remains a work of enormous power.“It has been a year since I arrived at Penal Colony No 14 in the Mordovian village of Parts,” she wrote. “As the prisoner saying goes, ‘Those who never did time in Mordovia never did time at all.’ I started hearing about Mordovian prison colonies while I was still being held at Pre-Trial Detention Centre No 6 in Moscow. They have the highest levels of security, the longest workdays, and the most flagrant rights violation. When they send you off to Mordovia, it is as though you’re headed to the scaffold.”But there is an air of cynicism, even bitterness, to some of the new works. Mounted on the gallery walls are DIY “Molotov kits” that look like bottles of perfume. Shining in neon hues that echo Pussy Riot balaclavas, they seem to be making a provocative comment about the commodification of protest culture, something she was such a thrillingly pivotal part of.View image in fullscreenTolokonnikova holds her art work called Resilience: Riot Shield.Photograph: Philip Cheung/The GuardianShe does not hide her disillusionment. “I’m sad,” she says. “Ever since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine started I feel … defeated. I still do what I do. I still believe in the power of art. But these days, I feel like the musician from the movie Titanic, who was playing the violin. He can’t stop the ship from sinking, but he can lift the spirits of people while they are going down.”Talking of commodification, in her book Tolokonnikova insists Pussy Riot “don’t want to live in a world where everyone is for sale and nothing is for the public good”. But in 2021, she started an account on OnlyFans, the online platform where creators offer adult content to paying subscribers. She says that she also posts erotic self-portraits on her Instagram channel, and those are “for the public good”. And the stuff on OnlyFans? “Well, I really enjoy it. It arouses me. And it’s honest work. One needs to eat and pay the bills and pay for the kids’ education and that’s how I do it. Political art is not a good business strategy.”She catches herself and says: “I wouldn’t want this article to be called, ‘Nadya doesn’t have hope any more.’ If I didn’t have hope any more, I wouldn’t keep going, right?” She points to Mediazona, the independent news outlet she set up with Pussy Riot co-founders and the journalist Sergei Smirnov in 2014. Initially focused on Russian prison conditions, it has become one of the most-cited Russian-language media companies since the start of the Ukraine war, tracking Russian military deaths and allegingabuse of Ukrainian PoWs. Its staff recently said it was on the verge of collapse, unable to pull in enough crowdfunding revenue since Visa and Mastercard suspended operations in Russia. “I do still have hope,” she says. “It’s just not revolution. It’s more subtle and it’s more long-term.”Then she gets up to fetch one of those crucifixes and hold it to the camera. Pasted on the cross is a collage of naked women in pornographic poses, a riot of female genitalia. Suddenly the old Tolokonnikova seems not so far away.Wanted is at Galerie Nagel Draxler, Berlin, until 6 June.

Just as inDas Rheingold, which opened here in September 2023, we are seeing events through the conduit of Erda, the ancient Earth Mother, who dreams this world into being as she slowly spins, naked, on a turntable at the front of the stage.It’s no detriment to a singing cast that’s very fine – and in the case ofNatalya Romaniw’s role debut as Sieglinde, outstanding – to say that this Erda, played by the actor Illona Linthwaite, is mesmerising. She’s in every scene. She blesses the incestuous union of Siegmund and Sieglinde, strewing flowers like a figure fromBotticelli’s Spring. And when Fricka enters in a vintage car, all fur-coat and fury, who do you think is her chauffeur? It’s almost as if Kosky is using Erda’s physical presence to add to the network of musical themes used byWagnerto represent characters and ideas.But if Erda is a leitmotif, what does she represent? Perhaps Wotan’s accountability; the world of mortals certainly isn’t flourishing on his watch. And, if Rheingold was Erda’s dream, Die Walküre starts off as her nightmare, with the orchestra creating a terrifying buzz in the prelude as Siegmund scrambles towards Sieglinde’s door.View image in fullscreenStanislas de Barbeyrac as Siegmund, with Romaniw.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianVictoria Behr’s costumes suggest a non-specific here and now, although Siegmund’s blue top and yellow hoodie hint at Ukraine. Rufus Didwiszus’s sets are dark and bleak: a wall of burnt planks for Sieglinde’s house and, later, thefelled World Ash Tree from Rheingold, which with the cast clambering through its holes and tunnels at times resembles a meerkat burrow. The almost feral Valkyries collect charred corpses which disintegrate into ash. Finally, every Walküre needs a good Magic Fire at the end, and this one doesn’t disappoint.Kosky has said that this Ring was inspired by images of the aftermath of bush fires in his native Australia, and the idea of the despoliation of nature is suggested everywhere, without ever becoming a hectoring message. Instead there’s an element of lightness, especially in the moments when we actually see the gods use their powers – the dispatching of Hunding is brilliantly done. This is put into relief by brute force elsewhere, especially from Christopher Maltman’s Wotan, king of the gods, who since Rheingold has acquired a beard, a smugly full head of hair and a magnate’s suit and tie. He, not Hunding, is the one who finishes off Siegmund, impaling him brutally on a shard of his own shattered sword – if you want a job doing, better do it yourself.View image in fullscreenThrillingly done: Christopher Maltman as Wotan and Elisabet Strid as a ‘gleaming’ Brünnhilde.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIf Romaniw’s incisive Sieglinde is the standout – the Welsh-Ukranian soprano is gaining a more magnetic, energised presence on stage with every role – there are formidable performances all round: Stanislas de Barbeyrac’s thoughtful but ardent Siegmund; Elisabet Strid’s gleaming Brünnhilde, her glow dimming only at the end; Marina Prudenskaya’s powerful Fricka; Soloman Howard’s gun-toting cop Hunding, imposing if slightly unfocused of pitch. Maltman’s baritone is full of velvet heft; though the sense of line falters in his quietest lines, the rest are thrillingly done, his voice soaring even when the orchestra seem to be playing at full tilt.This is all part of Pappano’s sleight of hand: the quicksilver control of balance that centres the singers while bringing out layers of glorious orchestral detail. He conducts a performance bristling with tension, and the orchestra plays wonderfully. Once again, he brings them all up on stage to take the applause, each one an essential part of what is shaping up to be a very fine Ring cycle indeed.Until 17 May, and live in cinemas on 14 MayExplore more on these topicsRoyal Opera HouseOperaClassical musicAntonio PappanoreviewsShareReuse this content"

As the play celebrates its 20th anniversary, past performers explain its strange appealAnya RyanFri 2 May 2025 08.00 EDTShareThe standard routine in theatre goes something like this: an actor is cast in a play; they read, learn and rehearse it; and then, at last, they perform it to an audience, who will hopefully soak up their hard work. But forTim Crouch, one of the industry’s chief experimenters, this exercise began to feel reductive. “A lot of actor training is about holding focus within the stage and putting the audience into a receiving role,” says Crouch. “I used to go to pubs and bitch about it.”An Oak Tree– his 2005 play that is now seen as a landmark work – was born directly from these frustrations. The script, which is written to be performed by Crouch and a new actor each night, celebrates its changeability. “It is a finished piece, but it contains an unfinished element,” Crouch says. An Oak Tree’s story concerns a meeting between two men: a father who has lost his 12-year-old daughter in a car crash (played by the actor), and the person behind the wheel (played by Crouch). The one basic requirement is that the actor arrives at the theatre oblivious. They must have never seen the play, nor read the script, and be willing to stand on stage with no idea what will happen over the course of the evening. Frances McDormand, Peter Dinklage, Mike Myers and David Harewood are some of the many names to have played Crouch’s unwitting castmate over the years.One of the play’s early performers wasToby Jones, who “rocked up” at the Brighton festival run of the show in 2006. “Tim said you don’t need to know anything; come on stage, it will all become clear,” Jones laughs. Part of the appeal for him was the opportunity to “go on a journey with Tim” and lean into the unexpected. “In a way, it is about submission of control … it is very moving; there’s quite a lot to take in”.Susan Wokoma, who performed in An Oak Tree at Rada in London in 2018, was similarly excited by the play’s uncharted territory. “When I started acting as a kid, there was so much ensemble work, and it was about trust,” she says. “Then you become an actor, and there is absolutely zero risk.” After An Oak Tree finished, Wokoma “missed it immediately because I had to go back to what we’ve decided theatre is. I felt proud that I was part of it – you’re part of the largest company ever”.View image in fullscreenDavid Harewood.Photograph: Tim CrouchNow, 20 years after its conception, Crouch is preparing to celebrate its anniversary with a three-week run at London’sYoung Vic. Actors including David Tennant, Jessie Buckley, Meera Syal and Mark Gatiss are all due to take the second role in Crouch’s ever-evolving drama. As the one constant, Crouch has now performed An Oak Tree 380 times at theatres all across the globe. He keeps a list on his laptop of actors who have joined the play’s ever-growing company. His play, he says, “is like a lizard; it loses its tail and regrows it”.Crouch started his career in the theatre company Public Parts and trained as an actor at the University of Bristol and the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. He branched out into writing with his debut My Arm, a play that uses objects from the audience to a tell a story about a man who holds his arm above his head for 30 years. “I was an unhappy actor and didn’t know what the fuck I was doing,” he says, “[and] I wrote My Arm just for myself”. But the play was a success, and from it grew An Oak Tree. “I wanted to effectively keep doing what I was doing with My Arm – to use an actor’s projection to turn a human into another human.”It was quite unsettling, but Tim has written it so you’re constantly being reassured that however you’re doing it is rightToby JonesNowadays Crouch is considered a master of form. His plays challenge the traditional expectations of theatre. But it’s surprising to learn that An Oak Tree’s narrative came before its structure, with Crouch writing a story about two men meeting up after the death of one of their children. Inspired by a sculpture by Michael Craig Martin, which labels what is clearly a glass of water as an oak tree, the father in the play turns a nearby oak tree into his daughter.In 2005, Crouch, alongside his now-longtime collaborator Andy Smith, wrote a play that “aligned both” form and story. Originally, Crouch wanted the father to be played by a non-actor. “But then it expanded into using a different actor every time,” he says. “The story is about a man who is lost, played by an actor who is lost”. In rehearsals, Smith took the role of the unknowing actor/father. “Kind of like Men in Black, Andy would erase his memory of the previous day’s work,” he says. “He would note me on my tone, clarity, and how enabling my instructions were.” The second character is still called Andy in the published playscript of An Oak Tree.View image in fullscreenRandom factor … Tim Crouch.Photograph: Alex BrennerEventually, Crouch started to “bring in friends” to see how they’d react. “We’d talk to them afterwards and go: ‘How was that for you? Was there anything that was unclear? Where did you feel overwhelmed?’” he says. After two preview runs in Germany, An Oak Tree opened at the now defunct Nightingale theatre in Brighton with Deborah Asante playing the role of the father.Putting the second actor at ease is hugely important to Crouch. He meets them an hour before the show to prepare them for what to expect. “I start by saying they can’t get it wrong, and they can’t get it right,” he says.Taking part in Crouch’s “formal game” was a liberating experience for Jones. “It was quite unsettling, but Tim has written it so you’re constantly being reassured that however you’re doing it, it’s right,” he says. “I remember coming off and thinking the play was just a beautiful idea.” Since then, Jones has encouraged any actor considering signing up for An Oak Tree to do it. “I tell them they’ll be absolutely fine”.Michelle Terry, the actor and artistic director of Shakespeare’s Globe in London, who is on the cast list for the forthcoming Young Vic run, admits that she’s been a fan of Crouch’s work “for ever” and lists off some of her favourite plays that he has written, includingI, Malvolio, I Cinna (The Poet), and Truth’s a Dog Must to Kennel in quick succession. “I think anyone who loves theatre and works in theatre just thinks he’s the best,” she says.The rules of An Oak Tree are followed closely by the actors. Also due to appear at the Young Vic is Game of ThronesactorIndira Varma, who has avoided talking to anyone who has been in the play before. “We’re not allowed,” she laughs. “How do you prepare for something you don’t know anything about? I think I’m just going to go with the flow.”An Oak Tree review – making magic from how we see the worldRead more“It must be exciting for the audience,” she says, “watching someone potentially make a twat of themselves but also maybe succeed.” The only thing that worries Terry is that the script’s font might be too small to read; “otherwise, it is just a beautiful offer to go and just be there”.Now big-name actors queue to perform in An Oak Tree,a play that began its life on the fringes. How does this feel for Crouch, whose work is created in antithesis to the mainstream theatre world where Hollywood Oscar winners dominate? “I would very happily play to university theatres for ever,” says Crouch. “But I think the play is more than that. It has something to say about the bigger structures that operate in theatres.”Clearly, Crouch’s “imperfect” play appeals to the masses. “It took me a long time to have the confidence to call myself a playwright,” he admits. And yet Crouch has new ideas bubbling to the surface. He wants to write more work for children: his twist on A Midsummer Night’s Dream, I, Peaseblossom, is on at the RSC in May. But, never once in 20 years has he been bored by An Oak Tree. “It keeps my brain alive and alert,” he says. “Until theatre changes profoundly, I will keep doing it.”An Oak Tree is at the Young Vic, London, Tuesday to 24May.Explore more on these topicsStageActingYoung VicTim CrouchToby JonesIndira VarmaMichelle TerryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While we talked, the instrument sat beside us, like a temporarily silent twin. A few weeks before, though, I’d heard it sing in the Barbican, London, as he swept through Shostakovich’s first cello concerto with the Czech Philharmonic,the piece with which he won BBC Young Musiciannine years ago.It is hard to believe Kanneh-Mason is still only 26: he is touring with some of the best orchestras and conductors in the world, has an MBE, is a visiting professor at the Royal Academy of Music, and, for the two billion people who watched, is the young cellist who played atthe Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s wedding.He is also the most celebrated young Black musician in Britain, famously one of seven talented musical siblings, and was a hugely popular performer at the Last Night of BBC Proms in 2023. But when he appeared onDesert Island Discslast year, he was asked if he thought Rule, Britannia! ought to be part of the festival finale. Quietly, but without hesitation, Kanneh-Mason said: “No.”In his debut book,The Power of Music, he recounts what happened next: “My truthful and understated remark … was greeted with an uproarious wave of censure and horror against me in the media, and an unguarded uprising of racist bile on social media.”View image in fullscreen‘If there are things I am struggling with, practising and playing are always helpful.’ Kanneh-Mason at the Barbican, London, April 2025.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianHe had stumbled on an “ice-hard determination”, he writes – the book is a mix of autobiography and musical manifesto – to preserve a place for a deeply troubling song. Its “vigour and intent were born in Britain’s burgeoning slave trade and at the height of its thundering imperialism”, he writes.His remark let loose a “volcano of racism”. On social media people called for him to be “tagged, flogged and deported” and to “keep [his] n***er mouth shut”. He finds it, he tells me now, “very scary and sad, how angry and aggressive people can be about attacking groups of people”. The tidal wave of hate, he says, was “disproportionate to the intensity of the comment I made. It just came from the heart. I didn’t want to attack anyone with it.”All that, directed towards this gentle, unconfrontational young man. How did he and his family cope, I ask. “I spoke to lots of other musicians who reached out,” he says. “I find practising and playing always helpful. If there are things I am struggling with, that’s the one place I can always be. Exploring something wonderful, beautiful and interesting.” Since we spoke, thePromsprogramme for 2025 has been announced. He is not performing, for the first time since 2017 (pure coincidence, say the BBC and his agent).In The Power of Music, he writes about playing in a way that is so grounded, joyous and straightforward that anyone who has had the good fortune to make music with others – choir, school band, amateur chamber group – will feel his words resonating. In his telling, his upbringing was less of a hothouse environment than one in which music was as much part of life as eating or playing football. He writes of the “energetic conversation and teasing battle” of performing duo sonatas with his eldest sibling, pianist Isata, as if music-making was an extension of the babble round the dinner table. He now flat-shares in London with his brother, violinist Braimah, and their friend Plínio Fernandes, a guitarist – he likes to come home to a busy, sociable household, he says.Practice wasn’t lonely, even though it was done alone, because they were all doing it. “It wasn’t some big project,” he says of the family’s musicianship. “My parents love music, and they loved learning instruments as children, and so they wanted us to also do that. It became clear very quickly that Isata was very into it and enjoyed it, and then the rest of us kind of followed on from that.” He adds: “My parents also like the idea of learning something that you can do endlessly. You can constantly practise and explore and get more from music. And that’s such a universe to give a child.”And yet, they were often the only Black children in the room, or concert hall, or masterclass. It could cut both ways, Kanneh-Mason tells me: at times, it made him “very determined to therefore be on that stage”; at other times it made him feel that he wasn’t sure he could. “But my family, and particularly my parents, were very helpful, either talking to us very honestly or shielding us, depending on what was appropriate,” he says. In The Power of Music, he writes: “The dominant image of a classical musician when I grew up did not look like me. It was difficult to find a projection of who I might be if I became a professional cellist, but the people around me simply refused to admit this was a barrier.” Now, his presence helps to change that for others, and he is actively involved in sharing what he has achieved with a younger generation (when we speak, he is about to travel to Antigua, where he and his siblings support a youth music project, and he has justwritten a children’s bookabout an orchestra).It wasn’t just the family home where music was fostered. I was surprised to learn from the book how important his Nottingham state school was to his and his siblings’ musical formation – after all, he was in London having lessons at the Royal Academy of Music’s Saturday school from a young age. But, he tells me, the school was full of music. He loved playing instruments he wasn’t so advanced on – bass guitar and trumpet – in bands and for shows, and spent time “being part of a bigger musical community, and just sharing ideas … Without that I certainly wouldn’t be the musician I am.”View image in fullscreen‘I wouldn’t be the musician I am without being part of a musical community … sharing ideas’.

He donated his £3,000 prize money from his BBC Young Musician award to keep the school’s cello lessons going. “It’s completely different now, if I’m honest,” he says. He still has one sister at the school, and visited a couple of years ago. “Everything is reduced. It’s really sad to see. It is unrecognisable. And … it’s very difficult, I think, for it to come back.” He passionately argues the case for the arts being available to everyone but, of Arts Council England’s recent policy decisions, he writes: “The idea ofspreading funding outside Londonis laudable if it leads to extra money” but “ransacking excellence at the centre” seems to “go directly against the arts”.Despite this, Kanneh-Mason is, he tells me, “optimistic – just because I am an optimistic person”. Luckily, he says, he has tons of energy. There is so much to do, so much to learn. He relishes the fact that music is mutable, changing, liquid in his hands; the Elgar concerto, for example, is “never fixed in me … a restless, churning, growing thing”. He loves to draw and paint, he says, and takes a sketchbook with him on tour, using it “when other people would take out a book”. But when a drawing is done, it’s done, he says. Music is different. “I like the process of building something that you can’t see and you can’t preserve. And so, you have to constantly keep going further, further.” It is an act of love, of love that lasts a lifetime, and of joy.The Power of Music by Sheku Kanneh-Mason (Penguin Books Ltd, £16.99).

Previtali makes no attempt to emulate Leonardo’s style. In fact this north Italian artist paints in a crisp, realistic way that’s the opposite of Leonardesque.

The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team.

GTA V was itself delayed several times before its eventual arrival in September 2013.Little has been revealed about GTA VI since the release ofa teaser video in December 2023. The open-world crime thriller is set to take place in the fictional Vice City, GTA’s version of Miami, and its home state of Leonida. The story is expected to follow veteran criminal Lucia as she embarks on an ambitious heist with her male partner.No other information on the GTA VI delay has been given. However, Rockstar’s parent company Take-Two is due to report its financial results on 15 May, when questions from journalists and shareholders will no doubt dominate the session.Explore more on these topicsGamesGrand Theft AutonewsShareReuse this content"

The programme for Gregory Doran’s revival of Nikolai Gogol’s The Government Inspector (1836) includes a letter from a Ukrainian academic bemoaning Putin’s attempts to claim Gogol as Russian, although the Kremlin dictator could not sit with any comfort through a play about the stupidity of rulers.Nor, though, could Donald Trump or most leaders. In a show premiered, deliberately or not, on local election day in England (May Day in Russia), Doran strongly brings out how power can be a confidence trick in which both sides consent. The citizens of a provincial Russian town submit to the authority of a penniless nincompoop because guilt at their corruption has led them to think they deserve him. But Khlestakov, who they falsely believe to be their governmental nemesis, finds, as unsuitable overlords often do, that he enjoys control. In our context, the play can also be seen quietly to question whether the reflex sending of inspectors – into schools, hospitals, prisons – is distraction rather than action.However, even Doran’s signature swiftness, each speech pursuing the last, can’t overcome the original’s blunt structure. It has a setup of exemplary economy – the opening line announcing “a government inspector is on the way” – but the subsequent misunderstandings are linear with no twists. And, of the corrupt town officials, only the Postmaster (brightly played by Reuben Johnson) behaves badly in a way that impacts the narrative. If only more were made of the Head of Schools, the Chief of Police or the Charity Commissioner, given their modern significance. Unfortunately, Phil Porter’s adaptation always favours lighter jokes, such as anyone speaking a long Russian patronymic being blessed for sneezing.Khlestakov is an unusual central role in that the character is only on stage for the middle three of the five acts. That means the actor must satisfy anticipation with his entrance and leave a tangible gap after exiting. Achieving both, Tom Rosenthal brings the easy stage command of a practised standup to a performance of energetic inflections and physicality that suggests a route to Shakespearean and Restoration comedy clowns. Miltos Yerolemou and Paul Rider double-act nicely as Bobchinsky and Dobchinsky, landowners as interchangeable as Rosencrantz and Tweedledee.But, for all the efforts of the director and cast, it made me want to see two later, darker plays that knowingly used Gogol: JB Priestley’s An Inspector Calls and Dario Fo’s Accidental Death of an Anarchist. We now demand tougher inspection of government.AtChichester Festival theatreuntil 24 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Nikolai GogolGregory DoranPolitical theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Her language is rich with “a broth of sweat” that brings middens – dunghills – and sweeter smells to life. Men’s power to conduct legalised persecution of women through accusations of sorcery is never far from the surface: “The church will pay a killing / for a witch.” These are poems cast as beautiful, intricate spells, reminding us there is more to life than we can hope to explain: “Perhaps we are all waiting / for the watcher in the dark, / attending to the glow / of that private thing, the soul.”View image in fullscreenDwellby Simon Armitage (Faber, £10)The poet laureate uses the conceit of where animals live, their setts, hives and warrens, to ruminate on how other species can thrive in the face of human domination. Armitage’s tone is delightful. A squirrel in her drey is living “a non-stop stop-motion life”. Rather beautifully, “every hare / is a broken heart / with legs”. Best of all are the Tripadvisor-style reviews in Insect Hotel: “Dark and dingy. Had to ask a glow-worm to show me to my room.” These are poems full of a winning, pleasurable charm.View image in fullscreenNature Matters: Vital Poems from the Global Majority, edited by Mona Arshi & Karen McCarthy Woolf (Faber, £14.99)Nature Matters considers nature poetry through the writing of poets of colour: “Hardly a radical idea, although … in the UK it is novel,” as Arshi and McCarthy Woolf say in their introduction. A capacious definition of “nature” means you’re as likely to read poems about slavery as the sea, a reminder that the environment is inherently political. There’s also plenty of straightforward beauty (such as in Vidyan Ravinthiran’s Autumn: “fallen yellow leaves now oftener / flare red. Embers. Blown-up chilli flakes”). As someone who has never felt at home with traditional nature poetry, this “new counterkingdom” (in Ishion Hutchinson’s phrase) of an anthology is a revelation.View image in fullscreenLodeby Gillian Allnutt (Bloodaxe, £12)Allnutt’s 10th collection is divided into three parts, tracing memories of her early life after the second world war, then through into lockdown, before reaching back into a pre-industrial landscape that reminds us “We are momentary, dust. // We are neither first nor last.” There are some indelible images in the poems, such as “the world is tracing-paper / thin … a secret / poste restante address”. More than this, Allnutt suggests there is a space beyond time that we can sometimes glimpse, and perhaps even gain comfort from, “involved in the recitation of our own / the told and the untold pain”.View image in fullscreenSilk Workby Imogen Cassels (Prototype, £12.99)“God is an Italian; likes kitsch / and geometry.” A former Foyle young poet of the year, Cassels’s debut conjures a world where lemons glow with awe, and furniture blushes. Reminiscent of Holly Pester, her language fizzes with invention. Everything is off-kilter, teetering on the edge of nonsense, yet the poems resolve into an oblique clarity: “I hope something / exquisite happens to you: / a compound fracture, / ordinary sympathy”. There may be too much opacity and diffidence here for everyone’s tastes, but it’s a pleasure to see the familiar through Cassels’s eyes, as she renders it tender and absurd.View image in fullscreenA History of Western Musicby August Kleinzahler (Carcanet, £12.99)Thirty-five years in the making, this collection brings together the veteran US poet’s numerous meditations on the power of music, and the effects it has on listeners, “still so transported / by the tapestry of sound – hypnotised”. Kleinzahler eavesdrops on assignations, secret nights out, even trips to the supermarket, showing how Elvis, Frank Sinatra, Whitney Houston and Mahler, among many others, are closer to guardian angels. John Coltrane “enjoys sitting with Aug and keeping him company, nothing odd about that”. These poems are glorious riffs on how to live, and live well.Rishi Dastidar’s A Hobby of Mine is published by Broken Sleep.Explore more on these topicsBooksPoetry roundupPoetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

But this show’s glorification of the guillotine proves he had a shallow, adolescent mindJonathan JonesFri 2 May 2025 06.19 EDTLast modified on Fri 2 May 2025 06.29 EDTShareWe all respect a classicist. So it’s hard not to be impressed by Ian Hamilton Finlay’s learned citing of the Aeneid, Book X, on a stone column in this exhibition marking the centenary of his birth. The poet, artist and creator ofLittle Sparta– his renowned art garden – revived the neo-classical style at a time when artists were more likely to quote Warhol than Virgil. He appeals to anyone who’s sick of illiterate pop culture – a defiantly archaic figure who made no apology for his erudition.Unfortunately, under the marble veneer, Finlay was an idiot. He flirted – more than flirted, claim some critics – with Nazi imagery, apparently fascinated by Panzer tanks and the SS logo. His fans insist it was all very nuanced but the Little Sparta website acknowledges “letters in which Finlay had made ‘anti-semitic’ remarks”. (Their quote marks on antisemitic, not mine.)View image in fullscreenBizarre and brutal … Republic, 1995.Photograph: © The Estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay Courtesy the Artist’s Estate and Victoria MiroThere are no Nazi images in this exhibition but Finlay’s interest in extremism and violence is unleashed in a series of bizarre and brutal conceptual artworks about the French Revolution. Marshall McLuhan’s maxim “the medium is the message” is incised on a panel of black slate. At first this looks like a witty transmutation of pop communication theory into engraved stone, but then you see the drawn outline of a guillotine blade: the “medium” Finlay’s celebrating is the slaughter of the Terror during the French Revolution, when first monarchs and aristocrats, then revolutionaries themselves, were decapitated in a bloody production line.This is even more emphatic in a gnarled wooden reproduction of the block where a victim’s neck was held in place for the descending blade. It is inscribed “Le Revolution est un bloc” (“The Revolution is a bloc”) – a quote from the politician Georges Clemenceau in 1891, meaning the French Revolution had to be taken as a whole. Finlay, in a visual pun, changes its meaning: the Revolution requires bloodshed, he enthusiastically declares. To the block with them all. What adolescent stuff.Candles on stools commemorate characters from the French Revolution including Robespierre, architect of the Terror. Marble reliefs pay homage to the revolutionary neo-classical artist Jacques-Louis David and his propaganda masterpiece The Death of Marat, a portrait of the revolutionary leader assassinated in his bath.You may agree with Finlay that the Terror was a necessary purging, or an inevitable backlash, to reactionary attacks on the Revolution. The meaning of the French Revolution is still passionately debated, its history still being written. At least Finlay cares about history, a defender might say. So no, I’m not offended by his love of the guillotine. I am just saddened by the shallowness of an artist who, in his latter years, fumed in his garden about the need to wipe out the filthy aristocratic pigs instead of making art with any kind of universal human content. Superficiality is Finlay’s real sin. Artfully concealed behind the apparent weightiness of classical plinths and columns, his take on life lacks seriousness or depth. Someone who makes “provocative” Nazi references without apparently knowing what he meant by them is a fool not an intellectual.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the late 1980s Finlay was commissioned to create a sculpture garden at Versailles for the bicentenary of the French Revolution, but stories in the French press about his use of the SS logo, his correspondence with Hitler’s architect Albert Speer and the revelation of his apparently antisemitic remarks in letters led to him losing this prestigious job.These artworks about the French Revolution were created in the 1990s in the wake of this humiliation. Perhaps his daft celebration of the guillotine is a longing for revenge. It certainly proves Versailles dodged a bullet, for these works are as crass as they are dry. They are not the art of a deep thinker or true poet.Why does he get in these knots of pseudo-erudition instead of addressing profound themes? Looking at his classical works you might be reminded of the French artist Nicolas Poussin. But in Poussin’s most famous painting, Et in Arcadia Ego, shepherds puzzle over an inscription on a stone monument that translates as “I too am in Arcadia”, or maybe “I was also in Arcadia”. Latin is a richly terse language, the interpretation varies, but however you read it, this refers to death. There is death, even in Arcadia. It is universal.Finlay completely lacks the sobriety and truth of Poussin. We all die, by the guillotine or some other way. Rhetorically raving about the glories of Jacobin violence is the opposite of the melancholy insights of great art. On this evidence, Finlay’s works won’t last another century.Ian Hamilton Finlay: Fragments is atVictoria Miro Gallery, London, until 24 May.Explore more on these topicsSculptureArtExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

An acrid, earthy scent drifts through the Norwegian experimentalist’s ninth album as she recalls childhood memories and beloved pets, and retreads the stages of past performances. On vampy lead single To Be a Rose, with restless drum machine and jazzy brass, Hval transforms a rose stem before embellishing further: “This is every cigarette my mother ever smoked.”View image in fullscreenJenny Hval: Iris Silver Mist.Photograph: © Charlie SelvigSurreal, dreamlike logic permeates Iris Silver Mist, named after a fragrance by French perfumer Maurice Roucel. When the pandemic stopped live music, Hval became interested in how a scent – like a song – can evoke a vivid memory or hint towards something long forgotten. Some of her new tracks do both: I Want to Start at the Beginning opens with Hval marking our location in a burger joint’s car park, but the rest dissolves into staticky synth, indiscernible voices and a drone that sounds like a sunrise.Many songs cycle through feverish visions of the stage, some with beery audiences and “couples kissing by the exit door”, others silent yet full of possibility. Hval fantasises about a “stage without a show” on The Artist Is Absent; the teasingly short track’s rolling breakbeats and looming bass create the record’s most kinetic, sensuous moment. (Anticipating her listeners’ needs, Hval has also released a hypnotic extended cut – fittingly generous for an album that celebrates listening so profoundly.) Iris Silver Mist shows music to be as transient as smoke, and yet an enduringly personal portal to memory, selfhood, the present and the dead.Explore more on these topicsJenny HvalExperimental musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Crunch time is approaching for Deborah’s show, but can she and Ava keep their game faces on for long enough to make it work?Phil HarrisonAustin9.30pm, BBC OneAustin has always wanted to meet “Doctor Who’s best companion” Billie Piper, so naturally he drags dad Julian on the Billie Piper Magical Mystery Tour in a taxi. And in a meta move, Piper gamely turns up playing herself.

She stars as Rachel, a single teacher for whom time is running out to have a child. Then she falls for divorcee Ali (Roschdy Zem), who has a four-year-old daughter Leila (Callie Ferreira-Goncalves). An affectionate relationship develops with the girl but Rachel is painfully aware that she will always be “an extra”. The tantalising taste of parental love when the biological mother is still around gives this wonderful film a bittersweet pull.Simon WardellExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Alicia Vikander’s Virginia isn’t just there to ask them intrusive questions; day two starts with her having a tantrum as if she were a toddler. In Fleur Fortune’s slipperypsychological drama, the couple’s attempt at parental role play – while never really knowing if Virginia is being herself or not – turns into a tense game of manipulation, even exploitation. Vikander is the film’s chief delight as the murkily motivated visitor, but Olsen and Patel give as good as they get.Thursday 8 May, Prime VideoThe Dark KnightView image in fullscreenCaptivating … Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/AlamyBatman is an unusual comic-book hero in that he works best in the shadow of the villain. And in the second of Christopher Nolan’sterrific Gotham trilogy(the other two bookend it over the bank holiday weekend) there are few bigger shadows than Heath Ledger’s Joker. He is a magnetic, mischievous presence opposite Christian Bale’s po-faced vigilante, quick with a quip or a spot of pencil-based violence. And in this dark morality play, even Aaron Eckhart’s noble DA Harvey Dent must compromise his principles to get justice.Sunday 4 May, 9pm, ITV2PlaytimeView image in fullscreenFun and games … Jacques Tati in Playtime.Photograph: Specta Films/AllstarIt took him three years to shoot and led to his bankruptcy, but Jacques Tati’s1967 filmrepresents the high point of his comedic style – physical, satirical and mostly wordless. It’s set in an ultra-modern Parisian quartier of gleaming steel, glass and traffic that so befuddles Tati’s visiting Monsieur Hulot he immediately gets lost. Overwhelmingly detailed, there’s always something interesting going on in the background of the identikit offices and doll’s house-like flats – culminating in a glorious set piece in a half-finished restaurant.Saturday 3 May, 3.35pm, Talking Pictures TVRaging BullView image in fullscreenBrutal and beautiful … Robert De Niro in Raging Bull.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyRobert De Niro solidified his reputation as the premier method actor of his generation with the Oscar-winning role of boxer Jake LaMotta in Martin Scorsese’s1980 biopic. It’s a brutal but beautiful vision of a single-minded man deformed by jealousy, with De Niro piling on the muscle, then the pounds, as Jake’s career rises and falls. Joe Pesci is superb as his exasperated brother/manager Joey, while Cathy Moriarty gets all the sympathy as Jake’s wife, Vickie, who receives the brunt of his violent tendencies – world-beating in the ring, disastrous out of it.Monday 5 May, 10.30pm, BBC Twoskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Felicity Jones is wonderfully affecting as teenage innocent Nelly, who catches the eye of the celebrated author (Fiennes) and – in an uneasy mix of attraction and financial imperative – becomes his lover. A fascinating look at the star wattage of Dickens, but also the women who trailed silently in his wake.Thursday 8 May, 10.10pm, BBC FourThe Living Dead at Manchester MorgueView image in fullscreenZombie horror … The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue.Photograph: RGR Collection/AlamyThis joyously tacky 1974 Spanish/Italian film is a rare instance of the continental zombie horror genre popping up in Britain. Filmed in the Peak District, though it’s pretending to be the Lakes, Jorge Grau’s chiller has corpses coming back to life thanks to a ministry of agriculture bug-killing ultrasonic radiation experiment. There’s a pleasing clash of cultures amid the shuffling undead attacks, as young folk Edna (Cristina Galbó) and George (Ray Lovelock) fight prejudice from Arthur Kennedy’s dismissive old Irish copper as well as the flesh-eating hordes.Friday 9 May, 10.10pm, Talking Pictures TVFrankView image in fullscreenAn offbeat joy … Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Fassbender and Domhnall Gleeson in Frank.Photograph: AllstarThe irony of making the pleasing-on-the-eye Michael Fassbender wear a papier-mache head for most of the film is only one of the joys of this offbeat drama. Lenny Abrahamson’scomic taleof musical integrity is inspired by the life of Chris Sievey and his character Frank Sidebottom. Domhnall Gleeson’s pianist Jon joins the charismatic singer’s avant garde psych-prog group (to the disgust of Maggie Gyllenhaal’s synth player Clara) and tries to nudge them towards popularity. But there’s a darkness behind Frank’s mask that lends the caper a more serious face.Friday 9 May, 2am, Film4Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe seven best films to watch on TV this weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s essentially an oddball love letter to the octopus – with its powers of transformation, bizarre mating habits and general air of underwater alien strangeness. But the series soon transcends its ostensible subject matter and becomes an exploration of some of the people who have devoted their lives to the celebration, study and preservation of these charismatic creatures. These include environmentalists, scientists ... and 30 Rock star Tracy Morgan, who is charmingly and volubly obsessed with them.Prime Video, from Thursday 8 MayLong Way HomeView image in fullscreenOn the road … Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman in Long Way Home.Photograph: Apple TV+/PABikes revving and dad-rock blaring,Ewan McGregorandCharley Boormanembrace their inner Partridge as they return for another grand tour. This time, they’re exploring northern Europe – once the tortuous and overlong process of selecting and equipping their bikes has taken place. It’s a slightly gauche middle-aged male fantasy, albeit given extra poignancy by the serious accident in which Boorman was involved in 2016, and the care with which McGregor helps him along on his first major expedition since. While the travel element is pretty basic, it’s a cheerful portrait of male friendship.Apple TV+, from Friday 9 MayStar Wars: Tales of the UnderworldView image in fullscreenMay the 4th be with you … Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld.Photograph: DisneyMay the 4th be with you and all that: following the release ofAndor, this spring also sees another six-episode anthology delving deep into the criminal underground of theStar Warsuniverse.

Its origins are obscure but its destination became tragically clear: in 2015, Crittenton was sent to prison for the murder of mother of four Jullian Jones.

Tucked away on a sidestreet near the port, the menu is short and the atmosphere relaxed. The young owners, Nicolas and Hugo, are best friends and their passion for fresh seafood, especially sea urchins and oysters, simply radiates. If you’re after fancy, go to one of the exclusive beach clubs dotted along the coastline. If you want fresh, vibrant and delicious platters of seafood served with charm and glasses of ice-cold white wine, come here.Melanie ClarksonThe perfect country bistro in BeaujolaisView image in fullscreenThe countryside near Saint-Amour-Bellevue.Photograph: Connect Images/AlamyJoséphine à Table, in the pretty village of Saint-Amour-Bellevue in Beaujolais, is the little country bistro you were always hoping to find in rural France. Hearty portions of rusticcuisinepaysanneare the order of the day, or you could push the boat out and splurge on a sophisticated chicken invinjaunesauce with morels. And don’t forget to wash your meal down with a bottle of the local wine – there are plenty of cuvées to choose from on the extensive list, all priced unbelievably reasonably. A set main course and dessert is €24.Santé.Natasha HughesMenu magnifique, MarseilleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: CharlotteRipaille (onInstagram) – a bistro on Rue de Lorette just north of the Old Port – was the unexpected gem of our time in Marseille. Tucked down a street awash with the city’s characteristic street art, diners sit at snug Formica tables drinking delicious natural wines. There’s a soft glow and the hum of a local crowd having a good time. We had everything off the chalkboard menu between four. Highlights were radicchio with stilton, pear and hazelnuts; scallops in smoked lemon; grilled dorade with almond sauce; and desserts generous on the cream. The staff were brilliant: cool yet attentive.CharlottePork sausage and pike parfait, ParisA visit toLes Mauvais Garçonsoff the Rue de Rivoli in the Marais would be worth it for the name, which it shares with the street it’s on, but more so for its Lyonnais fare. After regaling ourselves with pork sausage in a sublime brioche, we moved on to the more serious work of enjoying the pike dumpling in an exotic lobster bisque. You can complete your trip down south by indulging in a fondant au chocolat that would make Baudelaire himself feel decadent. The excellent service belies the restaurant’s name.PatriciaAmazing value in BrittanyView image in fullscreenQuiberon in Brittany.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyPort-Haliguen is a quaint fishing village close to the beautiful town of Quiberon in Brittany. Here we foundLa Base, a bistro overlooking the harbour. The chef lets ingredients shine with minimal fuss, such as the freshest sardines to start, then a perfectly cooked medium rare côte de boeuf for two, while the chocolate mousse is velvety smooth and comforting. The impressive house red is served at only €4 a glass and bottles at about €20. The idyllic setting, precise cooking and amazing value made this a real highlight of the holiday.James AllisonLobster ravioli in the DordogneLa Récréationin the beautiful Lot department village ofLes Arquesjust south of the Dordogne is a fabulous restaurant. It is housed in what was once the village school and has plenty of outdoor seating for the summer months. The food is sublime and simply never disappoints. Lobster ravioli in a coral sauce and croustillants de Saint-Jacques are delicious signature dishes, but the experienced chefs are innovative and the menu changes frequently. The village itself is associated with the renowned 20th-century sculptor and painterOssip Zadkineand attracts artists. La Récréation is a very popular restaurant, which must be booked in advance and is wholly deserving of its reputation locally.LesleyProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

The owner was so welcoming and a great host. They were very accommodating when our group of eight arrived for lunch and were happy to shuffle tables so we could all sit together. Our children enjoyed the cheese and beef galettes with a lovely salad. The adults enjoyed a split galette, which included wild mushroom, spices and cheese on one half and garlic, aubergine and cheese on the other – it tasted fantastic. All were homemade and used local ingredients. A very tasty cider accompanied the food. The homemade cheesecake was just delicious. All at a reasonable price.Stefanie AshallPick your poissonnerie, Dinard, BrittanyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mick GeorgeLe Pic à Bulot(The Whelk Pick) in Dinard is the perfect place for a seafood platter. In the Saint-Énogat neighbourhood, the restaurant serves fresh fish and seafood from its ownpoissonnerienext door. We visited in early April, sat on the terrace, well wrapped up, and shared an iced platter of prawns, langoustines, whelks, oysters and, in a blast from the past for me, winkles. All helped on by a bottle of head-turning Pouilly-Fuissé (it was our wedding anniversary). It’s definitely worth a detour if you’re visiting Mont Saint-Michel or arrived at Saint-Malo, and is reasonable with set menus starting at €15.Mick GeorgeMarket cooking with a heart, BordeauxIn the gritty Capucins market quarter, Au Bistrot delivers straightforward French comfort food for hungry market shoppers. Chef Jacques In’On cooks whatever looks best on the stalls that morning in a small open kitchen, while the host, François Pervillé, pours affordable bottles from an all‑Bordeaux list. My lunch: slow beef bourguignon, deep and savoury, plus a creamy garlic‑laced potato dauphinoise. The room is tiled and the staff are relaxed and quietly efficient. Menus change daily but rarely break €25. Decent wine by the glass costs €4. Book ahead or queue. Outdoor tables spill on to pavement when the sun shines.PamelaWinning tip: A humble gem in Boulogne, Pas-de-CalaisView image in fullscreenA dish at Le Chatillon in BoulogneNestled in the industrial fishing port in Boulogne-sur-Mer isLe Chatillon. Business hours of 5.30am-4.30pm make it a staple breakfast location for fishers. Nevertheless, the average family on an average budget can eat well at this humble gem of a place, served by friendly, efficient and professional staff, and that feels like the definition of hospitality. Theboulonnaiseplate – smoked salmon, fillet of herring, smoked mackerel and toast – is a great place to start, and fillet of boneless turbot with triple cooked fries, while simple, was like nothing I’ve tasted before or since.Ruth KingView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsFrance holidaysReaders' travel tipsFood and drinkTop 10sEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ll never forget the day one of them made me a carrot cake; he couldn’t quite understand the confusion on my face when he presented bright orange slices of cake topped with chocolate frosting. It was, of course, delicious, and arguably more of an actual carrot cake than the spiced version I’m used to.Brazilian carrot cakeThe carrots are blended with oil until smooth, giving the batter its signature colour. Traditionally, this is finished with abrigadeiro-style topping, but I’ve gone with ganache for ease.Prep10 minCook1 hr 15 min, plus coolingServes12280g carrots, washed and roughly chopped180ml neutral oil,plus extra for greasing170g caster sugar80g light brown sugar3 large eggs285g plain flour3 tsp baking powder¼ tsp saltFor the topping60g milk chocolate60g dark chocolate160ml double creamA pinch of saltChocolatesprinkles(optional)Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and grease and line a 20cm square cake tin.Put the carrots, oil and both sugars in a blender and blitz until very smooth. Add the eggs and give the mix a quick pulse to combine.In a large bowl, mix the flour, baking powder and salt. Pour in the wet carrot mixture and stir gently until fully combined with no pockets of flour hiding at the bottom. Pour the batter into the prepared tin, then bake for 45-55 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Remove and leave to cool completely while you prepare the topping.Finely chop the chocolate and put it in a heatproof bowl. In a small pan, heat the cream and a pinch of salt until steaming, then pour this over the chopped chocolate and leave it to sit for 30 seconds. Stir until smooth, then leave the ganache to thicken to a soft, spreadable consistency (you can speed this up by putting the mix in the fridge). Spoon this on to the cake, and spread it out evenly. Serve decorated with chocolate sprinkles, if you like.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotFoodBakingChocolateVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

It’s all finished off with one of my go-to dressings: Tesco Finest Greek yoghurt whipped up with nutty tahini and lots of green herbs.Prep15 minCook45 minServes4750g Tesco Finest Jersey Royals,halved3 tbsp Tesco Finest Sicilian extra virgin olive oil,plus extra for drizzling200g Tesco Finest Jubileeasparagus100g bulgar wheat100g Tesco Finest barrel-aged feta25g toasted flaked almondsFor the dressing1⁄2head garlic,roasted with the Jersey Royals150g Tesco Finest Greek yoghurt2 tbsp tahiniHandful parsleyHandful mint,plus extra to serve1⁄2lemon,juicedSuggested wine pairingTesco Finest Western Australia chardonnayShopping buttonView image in fullscreenHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.
