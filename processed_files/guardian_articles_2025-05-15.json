They know that having healthy stockpiles of all basic needs pays off in case of natural disasters, electricity outages, or even the more basic reality of precarious employment. From food and water, to blankets, batteries and romance paperbacks – their basements bulge with the just-in-case.As part of ourArmageddon complexseries on people preparing for end times, here are the stories of three preppers who were grateful they had made provisions.Morana Revel: living in a car in Kentucky during the 2009 ice stormI was raised off-grid. We didn’t have a lot of money. When we would travel, we would live out of the car. My mother always had Thermoses of water in the car, and lunchboxes filled with sandwiches. We’d sleep, there, too, on the backseat of a Ford Pinto. If we wanted entertainment, we’d sit up and watch the traffic go by on the side of the road. That’s how I first learned about prepping.‘It’s Disneyland for preppers’: why apocalypse-minded shoppers go to CostcoRead moreThis upbringing was a useful primer for 2009, when my husband and I were moving into a trailer inKentuckywhen a huge ice storm hit. It went all the way from Kansas to Tennessee and West Virginia, but Kentucky was hit the hardest. About 500,000 residences lost power for up to a week. We weren’t really moved in yet, so we couldn’t stay in our new mobile home and the storm was so bad that all the heavy trees around it were creaking. It didn’t feel safe. Plus the natural gas had been cut off, so there was no way to keep it warm.First we tried to stay with a friend. But then we heard that my husband’s computer repair business was being vandalized by looters. So we set up in the car and parked out in front of the store, shotgun and all, in case the looters returned.My husband was diabetic so I was very worried about his health. But our 1986 Toyota Camry had plenty of supplies: gallons of water, Mylar emergency blankets I’d gotten from Walmart, and plenty of romance novels for me to read. I put pillows on the floorboards and towels in the front windows for insulation.I had to constantly keep an eye on the temperature with a digital thermometer I’d bought. My husband had neuropathy in his feet, so he could lose them if they got too cold. I used a kitchen timer set to 30-minute intervals to turn the car on to heat us up for a bit. I had to be careful running the engine too much. I had a battery-powered CO monitor. A lot of the people who died in Kentucky in that storm didn’t actually die from cold. They died because they were running generators and inhaling too much carbon monoxide. I was an experienced car camper, so I knew that could be a risk.If you’ve lived through a disaster, you know how easy it is for things to fall apartWe had food stored in the trunk to keep it refrigerated, and then when we wanted to eat, we’d heat it up on the car’s engine.Occasionally we’d go down the street to get a bit more gas, or back to the trailer to feed our cats – they were Maine coons, so they were furry enough to enjoy the cold. We weren’t. When we needed to stretch our legs, we’d get out and walk around my husband’s store. Word got out that we were there monitoring it, which I think kept the looters away.I made to sure to bring my knitting needles to prevent boredom. I managed to knit a shawl and some slippers to help keep warm. I was working on a pair of socks, but I ran out of yarn.We ended up living in the car for the five days. Just a few supplies and some knowhow allowed us to survive the ice storm.At one point, the police came by the Camry, trying to get us to move to a shelter. But I showed them our blankets and my carbon monoxide monitor and our whole set-up and they let us keep camping in the car. I think they thought we were better off there than in a shelter.Prepping list: emergency blankets, carbon monoxide monitor, romance novelsAdriaan: holed up by Hurricane Irma in 2017I was living in Sint Maarten, a Dutch territory in the Caribbean, during Hurricane Irma in 2017. It was rated a category five hurricane. That’s only because there is no category six. We all knew it was coming.On the island, infrastructure isn’t always reliable. If ships can’t come in, you can’t get food. And electricity is not always available. So even in day-to-day life you learn to stock up and prepare. I was prepared for no running water, no electricity and supply chain issues. But this was totally different.View image in fullscreenThis photo provided by the Dutch defense ministry shows storm damage in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, in Sint Maarten, on 6 September 2017.Photograph: Gerben van Es/APThe military was evacuating people from the island. They had an “air bridge”, where they used big cargo planes to transport residents. The roof of the airport terminal itself had been blown off. There was a triage system. Unfortunately, my wife and I were not eligible to leave, because we still had a roof over our head. If you were honest and said your home was still intact, you weren’t going anywhere.The hurricane itself only lasted about 12 hours. But those winds were the strongest I had ever seen. We were living in a house on the side of a mountain, and I remember worrying that the whole building was just going to slide down the mountain. There was a hole in our front door, and water was just pouring through it, like it was coming out of a faucet. And that was three hoursbeforethe actual hurricane hit. The roof of our wooden porch ended up under my car. Later, when things settled down, I found a piece of it a few kilometres away. There were many moments during the storm where all I could think was: “OK, this needs to stop now.”My wife and I spent the bulk of the storm in a little room inside our house with no windows, it was like a bunker. I had stored a bunch of tinned food but, to be honest, I’d been a little lazy about it. It was mostly tins of mixed vegetables and some bread in a freezer. It was not a very diverse menu. I got pretty hungry. I remember seeing a cricket on the ground, and thinking: “I should eat it.” I had to stop myself. It was almost as if instinct was taking over.The most important tool through all this was my radio. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of a battery powered or hand-cranked radio. The first time I got a station, after about three days, they were just playing I Will Survive on repeat. That was weird. But then I was able to pick up emergency dispatch signals, which gave me some sense of what was going on. I also had a solar charger, which was really important. It allowed me to charge my phone. After the storm settled, I began walking around the island with a big blue notebook, collecting information from people and passing it on. I pretty much became the town herald!Read more fromThe Armageddon complexseriesIs the Cybertruck really apocalypse-proof?Lefty preppers are taking a different approach to doomsdayThe rise of end times fascismIn the aftermath, there was no public order. Electricity was still down across the island. Gas stations had been blown away. Supermarkets were closed for two weeks. Around 80% of the police force was homeless. There was a rumour going around that the military police had been attacked and all their automatic weapons had been stolen by gangs. I heard gunshots ringing out.I was hoping that after the storm, everyone in Sint Maarten would feel a greater sense of community. That was not the case. Everyone had a short fuse. People were quick to anger. We’d all been through this traumatic event. The whole country had issues with handling post-traumatic stress. If you’ve lived through a disaster, you know how easy it is for things to fall apart.Prepping list: a wind-up radio, tinned food, frozen breadChris White: tropical cyclones and unexpected unemployment in Brisbane, AustraliaI grew up in Japan. My parents always told me you need an extra week’s supply of food and water on hand in case of emergencies. I’m not sure if it’s actually a law, but it’s definitely part of the culture. My wife is from North Queensland, in Australia and it was the same thing there. They’d have cyclones so you have supplies on hand in case the power grid goes down for a week. For both of us, that’s always been part of what you do.In 2011, we got hit by Tropical Cyclone Tasha, which led to almost two months of rain, and flooding. They called it a “once-in-a-century” storm. But these once-in-a-century events keep happening. I think we’ve had three of them since then.View image in fullscreenPeople line up for service at a corner store in Byron Bay on the day that Cyclone Alfred made landfall on 8 March 2025.Photograph: David Maurice Smith/The GuardianCyclone Alfred hit us in March of this year. So we’ve just started restocking our supplies. We probably have about 10 days’ worth of food. It’s sort of a constant here. We were always prepared. During the last flood, a friend asked: “Are you guys not panicking?” I said: “No.” We had everything we need. When these floods happen, other people are out in the shops stripping the shelves. All we’ve ever had to leave the house for is beer.But there are other benefits to prepping for these sorts of disasters. When my wife and I were both young in Australia, we were casual employees. It’s a kind of very precarious employment. You can just get sacked, and not have any recourse. We were getting by on very few work shifts. And we didn’t have a lot of money. So when we didn’t have any shifts, we always had a lot of food: tinned beans, pasta sauce, microwavable rice. Until you run out of money, you don’t appreciate how difficult it is to get food and get by.It’s one thing I don’t think many people think about when they think about prepping. A lot of the people you encounter online, especially from America, feel like they’re prepping for nuclear war or total civilization collapse. More often you’re prepping for leaner periods, making sure you can get by without secure employment.Prepping list: pasta sauce, microwavable rice, bottled waterExplore more on these topicsNatural disastersThe Armageddon complexNetherlandsExtreme weatherKentuckyHurricanesTropical Cyclone AlfredfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What was a career highlight?Nicens_boiWhen I was 60 the thought of touring when I was 70 was anathema and the thought of touring at 90 seemed dreadful! The hardest part is sitting in the car. We’re gonna be away six weeks and I’m a walking hospital case. I have meds, a step stool so I can put on compression stockings, and arthritis in both hands. My family treat me like glass, but as soon as I get on stage all these things melt away. I can only tour because I have my crew – my sons Neill and Calum, my daughter-in-law Kerry Harvey-Piper and an excellent sound engineer, Stefan Care. Or rather, they’re not my crew, I’m their singer. I don’t think in terms of career highlights because I could yet muck it up.View image in fullscreenPeggy with her sons Neill and Calum.Photograph: Vicki SharpWhat’s it like being the subject of one the greatest love songs ever written [The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]?neetoneetoIn my memoir First Time Ever I devote an entire chapter to it! I was estranged fromEwan MacColl, who had been pursuing me when I came to England. It was a very passionate encounter, but I fled back to America because a married man with a five-year-old son he adored wasn’t my ideal. It turned out that both he and his wife had been unfaithful during their marriage, which made it a bit better later on. They are both gone now, and so are their issues.When Ewan sang it to me over the phone I thought it was a nice love song, but I didn’t connect it with him and me because he was infatuated with me, and while I got to love him, I wasn’t “in love”. I felt exposed when I sang “the first time ever I lay with you”, because I was singing it as if I was him. Our first night together was disastrous! The second was what the first should have been. Then after I fell “in love” with my second life partner, Irene Pyper-Scott, I started to sing it as Ewan must have felt it.View image in fullscreen‘Our first night together was disastrous!’ … Peggy Seeger with Ewan MacColl.Photograph: Brian Shuel/RedfernsIt’s been covered by over a thousand singers and Ewan and I hated most of them. We had a section of our record collection devoted to them called “the chamber of horrors”. When it became a huge hit for Roberta Flack I didn’t like the way she sang it, but I’ve come to like it a lot. A digital composer called Broadcaster has done it as a dance track, using my vocals, which is on my Bandcamp. If you listen to it as a song, it’s the worst version ever, but as a dance track, it’s wonderful.Did you watch [Bob Dylan biopic]A Complete Unknown? If yes, what did you think? If no, why not?ThankYouJohnI haven’t had time to see it yet but I want to after the tour. I met Bob Dylan when he was Robert Zimmerman, a student. I remember him very clearly because the event organiser said: “You know that little fellow who followed you around with his briefcase? He’s Bob Dylan.” At that point I said, “Who’s Bob Dylan?”, but more power to him. He’s like me in that he hasn’t got a “good” voice but he’s got a character voice and he created the character Bob Dylan out of Robert Zimmerman. It makes me wonder if I created myself, because I’m much more of an entertainer now than I was when I was just a singer of folk songs. I do little jokes and monologues and all kinds of things I never would’ve done as the Peggy Seeger of 1962.Your songI’m Gonna Be an Engineerbuoyed me up through training as the one woman amid11 men on my electronic engineering training courseand the one female engineer working with 100 male engineers. Was there a particular woman’s story which inspired you to write it?LMCollisFirst, I didn’t want to be an engineer. I was downstairs doing the accounts and Ewan said, “Peg, we need a woman’s song.” I probably said, “Fuck off, I’m doing the accounts!” I was very angry because he never did the accounts, but afterwards I sat and wrote that song literally in an hour or two. I’d just been to Corby and seen a young woman my age working on a turret lathe, hence the mention in the lyrics. So many women have sung that song but you can’t shorten it. The first part is the woman declaring what she wants to do and the second part is the system telling her, “You can’t do that because you’re a girl.” It lasts about five minutes, but was ahead of its time.Do you think folk music still has the power to engender social change? Did it ever?RobinCYou can’t write a folk song – a folk song becomes one. And they have helped to engender change because the community felt they spoke for them. Most of what people call “folk” now is just singer-songwriter stuff. The closest I come to folk on my new album is Sit Down, written in the 1930s by Maurice Sugar about people downing tools. I remade the song for now, because if all the key workers at the bottom of the economic pile just withdrew their labour, things would change. The other song of mine that’s on its way to becoming a folk song is The Ballad of Springhill, about Springhill mines in Nova Scotia. Everyone up there knows it and very few of them know who wrote it [in 1958, while watching a live broadcast of the mining disaster], but it’s an absolute honour that it’s been taken up by the community it was written about.View image in fullscreenSeeger performing in London circa early 1960s.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesAny plans to rush back to America now it’s “under new management”?LowerColonNot for all the tea in China. I swore allegiance to the Queen in 1959. I’m a British subject although I did move back to America between 1996 and 2010. It’s a fantastic country and has some amazing people in it, doing unbelievably brave things which we don’t see on the news, like the takeover of town hall meetings by Democrats in Republican states. The Republicans are being heckled so badly! Bernie Sanders and AOC [Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez] are amazing people, and they’re doing what I was talking about doing in music – not accepting what was being pumped into us – but Trump has so much power.Do you see any prospects of a new folk revival within this digital world dominated by Spotify?Even if the likes of Trump, Musk and Farage must surely encourage a strong protest movement?Brian DowsettWell, I can say what I would like to see, but I’m not sure it will happen. Climate change is going to cull us as a species. There won’t be any big bands and we won’t have any producers of guitar strings, so we’re going to have to rely on our own voices and make instruments out of whatever we can find. But we’ll always need music that expresses the hopes and dreams of the community.What is your best memory of your brother,Pete Seeger?SheerContentOh, I have so many. When we were little kids, he would come down to visit and he would’ve been 19 or 20, and he’d have his long-necked banjo and I’d stand on his feet while he stamped them. When I decided I was gonna live in England he sent me songs, asking, “Do you know this?” I remember being sat singing with him in New York two or three years before he died. Pete was wonderful and I love what he did with his life: getting people to sing. He’s responsible almost single-handedly for the American revival of folk music.View image in fullscreenPeggy’s brother Pete Seeger … ‘I love what he did with his life.’Photograph: Tennessee State Archives via APYour mother,Ruth Crawford Seeger, has become increasingly recognised as the composer of some of the most remarkable music of the first half of the 20th century. Growing up, were you aware of the significance of her work?kramskoiI didn’t even know about her work when I was growing up. My father never talked about it. She never talked about it. I found out about it in my 30s and Judith Tick asked me to read her wonderful biography before it went to press. I was angry that I hadn’t been told that this wonderful woman had all this music. I think my father kept it from me. He was a composer, her teacher, her professor, and I think he was jealous. I wouldn’t be the musician I am without her teaching. So now I do anything I can to push her music forward.How old were you when you mastered the guitar and what are you most proud of in your folk career?Otis, aged 10.That’s a good question, Otis. I never mastered the guitar – my sons are better players than I am – but folk music didn’t ask very much of me. I took pride in learning songs. I was a guitar accompanist rather than a solos person. I played with my father when I was seven or eight and the main thing I would say is learn something really well before you perform it for anybody else. Don’t necessarily feel you have to be that good, just play and enjoy the sound of this wonderful instrument, and once you learn the normal tuning try open tuning. I’ve also recorded some albums that are not as good as they should be, so don’t record anything until someone else – not your family – tells you it’s good. I’m not “proud” of anything, but I feel I’ve done my best.If you had to spend eternity listening to just one singer, who would it be?chymistI don’t believe in heaven or hell, but if I did, it would be hell to listen to just one singer for ever. You’d fall asleep. So if I can sleep through eternity, give me Paul Simon.Peggy Seeger’s final album Teleology is out now. Her Final Farewell tour continues until 28 June.

The very next day, the Tories screamed: “Hold my beer. You ain’t seen nothing yet.” They seem to look on the prime minister’s description as a challenge. One to which they are determined to rise.Forget Ukraine and Gaza. Forget the growth and immigration figures. Come Thursday morning, the most pressing question on the minds of the shadow paymaster general, Richard Holden, and other Conservative MPs was their outrage that Downing Street would not be flying the Middlesex flag on Friday to mark Middlesex Day.Never mind that Middlesex barely exists any more. Never mind that almost no one but a few supporters of Middlesex county cricket club could even recognise the Middlesex flag. Never mind that only about two people can even see the Downing Street flagpole, let alone care what flag it is flying. This was a major snub to the Middlesex regiment and its part in the Battle of Albuera during the peninsula war. A date that was on everyone’s mind. Clearly.“Keir Starmer would rather hoist the white flag of surrender,” thundered the increasingly unhinged Holden. Not a day goes by when he does not thank his stars for the defeat of Napoleon. Yet another foreigner trying to subjugate the plucky Brits. Just like the EU. Give me strength. This was a stunt so ludicrous it was beneath even Reform. The Tories sometimes wonder why they are no longer taken seriously by most of the country. They need wonder no more.While theConservativeswere having their very public psychiatric breakdown, Starmer was otherwise engaged on the latest round of his “island of strangers” immigration tour. If it’s Thursday, it must be Tirana, where he was off to meet the 6ft 7in Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, for a bilateral meeting and a press conference. The difference in height between the two men was marked. Keir looked as if he was standing in a hole and was struggling to see over the lectern.Starmer trip labelled an ‘embarrassment’ as Albania rules out asylum seeker dealRead moreThis was the first time a UK prime minister had visited Albania and Rama was keen to express his gratitude. It was an honour, he said, and he was looking forward to ever closer ties between the two countries. Though maybe not quite as close as Keir would have liked, because Edi was keen to point out that Albania was not open to being used as a returns processing hub for other countries’ unwanted asylum seekers and illegal immigrants.The relationship with Italy was a one-off, Rama said. One forged out of a special relationship between the two countries. A geographical and emotional intensity. He was too polite to mention that the deal had also stalled in the Italian courts. No point in upsetting anyone. So his ties with Giorgia Meloni were like a marriage. And he wasn’t looking for any one-night stands with the Brits. Or anyone else, for that matter.This seemed to come as a bit of a surprise to Starmer. The simultaneous translation feed faded in and out and he tapped his earpiece to make sure he had heard correctly. Unfortunately for him, he had. Most members of the media had been led to believe that one of the objectives of this first trip to Albania was to secure the outlines of a deal for a returns hub. This was all part of the government’s immigration express, after all. Now everything was rather more confused. Surely the UK prime minister hadn’t come to Albania a day ahead of the European Political Community summit just for a schmooze and to express solidarity over Ukraine?It rather looked as though Keir had done just that. Sounding rather more keen about returns hubs than he ever had in opposition – he’s desperate to offload immigrants somewhere – Starmer went into waffle mode. He was talking to other countries about returns hubs. Just not Albania. That had never been on his list. Oh no. Though he couldn’t say exactly which countries he had in mind. But fingers crossed and all that.Rama looked as if he was beginning to enjoy himself. This was all going a lot better than expected. Now he turned up the heat. Yes, there had been a high point of 12,000 Albanians arriving illegally in the UK via small boats in 2022. But thanks to cooperation between the two countries that figure had been cut by 95%. So there were hardly any Albanians making the trip these days. So there was no problem. Only, there was for Keir. He hadn’t come to Tirana to praise the efforts of the previous government in cutting illegal migration. But that was rather what he was forced to do. Though not in quite so many words. It had all been a lucky coincidence.The presser ended with an Albanian journalist demanding an apology from the Brits for our politicians’ negative portrayal of Albanians as all criminals. Edi came to the rescue. It had only been some – viz Suella Braverman – he observed. And she and the Tories had got their comeuppance at the ballot box last July. So no hard feelings. Keir smiled gratefully.Edi continued. Surely now was the time to celebrate the 100,000 Albanians who had legally settled in the UK and who paid their taxes and had integrated into society. Keir smiled less gratefully. A successful immigration story was not on the government’s news grid. He was in Albania to talk about Britain’s squalid history of immigration in the last 14 years. The incalculable damage that foreigners had done to the country. Having to be nice wasn’t part of the script. He headed off to lunch. You win some, you lose some. Perhaps no one had been watching.Having a rather better day was Rachel Reeves. It’s been one long run of bad news for the chancellor since last July, but on Thursday she learned thatgrowth had risenunexpectedly by 0.7% in the first quarter of the year. So she was out and about, telling anyone who would listen. Fastest-growing economy in the G7. Everything was fine. Top of the world, Ma. One in the eye for the Tories and Reform for talking the country down. Rachel should enjoy it while it lasts. With the imposition of tariffs, the next quarter is unlikely to look so rosy.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe politics sketchLabourImmigration and asylumConservativesRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

Putting up a big “no foreigners welcome” sign, threatening toannex your neighbour, and throwing visitors to your country into detention forminor visa infractions, however? Such actions are expensive. The United States is on track to lose $12.5bn (£9.4bn) in international travel spending this year, according to a study published on Tuesday by the World Travel and Tourism Council.If the Trump administration is concerned that its aggressive rhetoric is costing tourist dollars, it’s not showing it. During a recent press conference about the 2026 Fifa World Cup, which will be jointly hosted by the US, Mexico and Canada, vice president JD Vance joked about deporting football fans who outstay their welcome. “We’ll have visitors from close to 100 countries. We want them to come…” Vance said. “But when the time is up, they’ll have to go home, otherwise they’ll have to talk to [Homeland Security] secretary Noem.” That’s Kristi Noem, the woman whoshot her own dog. Not someone you want to talk to when she’s in a bad mood.Judging by the drop-off in visitors, many people have decided that a trip to the US just isn’t worth the risk right now. As a green card holder – and someone with family in the UK who have been thoroughly put off coming to visit the US – this is a question I’ve been wrestling with for the past few months. So, for somewhat selfish reasons, I spoke to a number of immigration lawyers and civil rights experts to try to figure out the new rules, across different demographics, for travelling to and from Trump’s America.View image in fullscreenBeware of ideological expression …Photograph: Posed by models; AzmanL/Getty ImagesFirst, though: the big picture. It is hard to quantify exactly how much things have changed at the border since the start of Trump’s second term. There have been plenty of scary stories in the news but that might not reflect a policy shift – it could just mean the media is paying more attention to the subject. Murali Bashyam, an immigration lawyer based in North Carolina, believes that while “there are more issues at the port-of-entry than before”, fears of being detained “are overblown to some extent”.Other immigration lawyers are more worried. Camille Mackler, executive director of a legal service provider collaborative called Immigrant Arc, stresses: “Things have fundamentally shifted – although whether that shift is happening systematically at the airport level or on an individual officer level is harder to say.” But, she says, there seems to be a clear trend: “The Trump administration wants to increase deportation numbers, and they’re going after any case they can. Enforcement has become much more aggressive.”One executive order lays the groundwork to deport or deny entry to foreigners based on their political and cultural viewsAccording to Golnaz Fakhimi, legal director of Muslim Advocates, one of the biggest shifts is “the targeting of non-citizens based on viewpoints and ideology”. There are two executive orders that set the stage for this targeting:EO 14161Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats, and EO 14188, Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism. The first EOlays the groundworkto deport or deny entry to foreigners based on their political and cultural views. The second uses a broad definition of antisemitism that includes criticism of Israel’s policies or government.Since Trump passed those orders, says Fakhimi, “there’s been a lot of rhetoric reinforcing those policies and we’ve seen actual instances of what looks like viewpoint-based scrutiny. All of this points to a kind of risk that non-citizens – including lawful permanent residents – should be aware of, especially when it comes to ideological expression.”View image in fullscreenPro-Palestinian protesters outside the Foreign Office in London this month.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockCriticism of the Israeli government or support for Palestinian rights seems to be at the “forefront of what’s being targeted” now, says Fakhimi. “But many of us worry that the scrutiny won’t stay limited to those viewpoints. It may already be expanding. There was one case reported in the media involving a French researcher who was denied entry, possibly because of content on their phone that was critical of the US president. Inside the US, we’ve also seen targeting of immigrant-rights activists –Jeanette Vizguerrain Colorado for example.”Kseniia Petrova, a Russian-born researcher at Harvard Medical School who has been detained since February, may have been targeted because of her political views. “So it’s important for non-citizens to be clear-eyed about what viewpoints they’ve publicly expressed – especially online – when considering the risks of international travel.”View image in fullscreenGetting the message (clockwise from top left): Russian researcher Kseniia Petrova is in ICE detention; lawyer Amir Makled was interrogated; immigration activist Jeanette Vizguerra was ‘targeted’, and YouTuber Hasan Piker was held and questioned.Composite: Polina Pugacheva via AP; Hall Makled PC; Hyoung Chang/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images; Lev Radin/Everett Collection/AlamyIt’s also prudent to assume that your social media activity has been examined. “Social media identifiers are now required on some visa applications,” says Sophia Cope, senior staff attorney on the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s civil liberties team. “We’ve heard anecdotal reports of agents referencing social media during questioning.”It is not only non-citizens who should be worried. Hasan Piker, a left-wing YouTuber and US citizen, was recently heldand questioned for hoursby US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in Chicago after returning from France. In a video, Piker says the agents seemed to know who he was and asked about his political beliefs, including repeated questions about his views of Hamas. A CBP official called the suggestion that Piker was targeted for his political views “baseless”.View image in fullscreenPolice arrive at a protest against ICE’s detention of activist Jeanette Vizguerra in Aurora, Colorado, in March.Photograph: RJ Sangosti/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post/Denver Post/Getty ImagesAmir Makled, a Lebanese-American lawyer representing one of the University of Michigan pro-Palestine campus protesters, was recently stopped at Detroit Metro airport and interrogated by a tactical terrorism response team agent. Makled has said the agents knew exactly who he was; his phone was searched and they asked about his contacts. Eventually, he was allowed to go home.The Makled case was very troubling, says Cope, because it suggests targeting based on political association. “CBP denied this, but during the inspection, they asked to see his contact list. That implies they weren’t interested in him, but in who he knew. That’s outrageous. We litigated a case on this for four years – unfortunately, the courts didn’t rule in our favour – but we learned that CBP believes it has the authority to search devices not just when the traveller is a suspect, but also to gather intelligence on someone else the traveller may be connected to … It’s a form of dragnet intelligence gathering.”After your flight lands on US soil and before you clear customs, you are in something of a no man’s land in relation to civil rightsWhen it comes to intelligence gathering at the border, officials have carte blanche (you will definitely want to delete your nudes). After your international flight lands on US soil and before you clear customs, you are in something of a no man’s land in relation to civil rights. “The normal fourth amendment requirement of a warrant or individualised suspicion doesn’t apply,” saysNate Freed Wessler, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. Some states offer slightly more protection than others, however. In the ninth circuit, which covers the western US, the rules are “most protective”, says Wessler. “For a manual search (where an agent is just scrolling through your phone), no individual suspicion is needed, but the search must be for digital contraband – like classified documents.“For a forensic search, where they plug your phone into a device to extract and analyse the entire contents, there must be reasonable suspicion that the phone contains digital contraband. And if the purpose is anything else, like gathering intelligence or helping another domestic agency, then a warrant would be required.”For most of the country, however, it’s anything goes. “The only minimal protection CBP has in their policy is distinguishing between manual and forensic searches. For a forensic search, they say they need reasonable suspicion, but they don’t define what that means. For a manual search, there are no guardrails. They argue it’s less invasive, but that’s just not true. They can still do keyword searches and spend hours combing through your device.”View image in fullscreen‘Put your phone in flight mode before you travel to understand what is stored on the cloud and what is local.’Photograph: Posed by model; Focus Pixel Art/Getty ImagesThey don’t have access toeverythingon your phone, however. Customs and Border Protection policy requires agents to put devices in flight mode before searching, to avoid accessing cloud data. It’s not a bad idea to put your phone in flight mode before you travel to understand what is stored on the cloud and what is local.What if you refuse to give your passcode to officers or say you don’t consent to a search? Consequences differ depending on your immigration status. If you’re a green card holder or citizen they can still take your phone. “They can’t compel you to give your passcode, but they can seize the phone and send it to a forensic lab, where it might sit for weeks or months while they try to break into it,” says Wessler. “For visa holders, it’s trickier. If you refuse to unlock your phone, they may just deny you entry, claiming you’re not cooperating in assessing admissibility.” And in the very worst scenario they might throw you into a detention centre before sending you home.Searches, to be clear, are still very rare. “Claims that CBP is searching more electronic media due to the administration change are false,” CBP assistant commissioner of public affairs Hilton Beckham said in a statement last month. “CBP’s search numbers are consistent with increases since 2021, and less than 0.01% of travellers have their devices searched … Allegations that political beliefs trigger inspections or removals are baseless and irresponsible.”If you’re worried these allegations aren’t quite as baseless as CBP insists, Wessler says: “The safest approach is not to travel with data you wouldn’t want the US government to access.”Let’s say you’re a British citizen who has been outspoken, on social media and elsewhere, about your pro-Palestinian or anti-Trump views. Would it be a foolish idea to travel to the US right now? “I wouldn’t say ‘don’t come,’ but I’d say evaluate your risk and risk tolerance,” says Wessler. “The government is being extremely aggressive with students and activists, and there’s always a chance a border agent might act on something they find politically disagreeable. Most travellers are still fine – but the risk is real and well above zero.” So, basically, nothing is very clear? Pretty much, says Wessler. “The law is a complete mess, and people’s options are a complete mess. People just have to make a risk assessment based on extremely imperfect information.”The first step in making that risk assessment is to thoroughly understand the rules for the specific visa you’ll be travelling on or your immigration status. “TheForeign Affairs Manualis a great resource,” says immigration lawyer Tahmina Watson. “It’s what consular officers use, and it’s publicly accessible. It lays out what officers are looking for, visa by visa. We’re now advising clients more than ever to understand the B1/B2 visa rules. B1 is for business, B2 for tourism. When CBP asks why you’re here, they’re listening for key phrases – ‘I’m visiting my grandmother,’ ‘I’m going to Disneyland,’ etc. The manual also talks about proof of ties to your home country – job, house, bills. That stuff matters.”A US citizen had married a green card holder. The  couple were returning from their honeymoon when he was detained. He had a conviction from when he was 18 – more than 30 years beforeHaving any sort of criminal record or contact with the criminal legal system is a major part of a risk assessment. “I just spoke with a US citizen who had married a green card holder,” says Watson. “They were returning from their honeymoon when he was detained. He had a conviction from when he was 18, served his time, and had travelled internationally for more than 30 years since without issue. But this time, he was detained, and it will be very difficult to get him out.”If you’re a green card holder with a criminal record, Watson strongly advises against leaving the country. “Not until you’ve spoken with a lawyer. Even a long-ago conviction can result in detention now.” If you’ve ever overstayed a visa, even for a day, you should also speak to a lawyer before travelling.I was a British tourist trying to leave America. Then I was detained, shackled and sent to an immigration detention centreRead moreStudents have their own set of issues to look for. “For students or others with campus affiliations, we’d want to know if there’s been any scrutiny or disciplinary action at the university level,” says Fakhimi. “Another factor is whether any third parties have tried to spotlight or mischaracterise your views to attract federal attention. Groups likeBetar US, for example, have devoted resources to building lists of political protesters they want deported.”And then, of course, you’ve got to think about any public statements you’ve made and whether you can or should delete them. “For some, minimising the visibility of their views might feel like the right way to reduce risk,” says Fakhimi. “For others, staying publicly vocal and visible with their beliefs might feel too important to compromise. It’s really about what trade-offs someone is willing to make, and what decision they can live with.”One thing that sustains Fakhimi, she says, is how many people are unwilling to censor themselves for their safety. “I’ve been incredibly moved and inspired by the courage of non-citizens – people with precarious status, even undocumented – who continue to speak out on a range of injustices. They see these issues as interconnected, and despite the risks, they’re standing firm.” Sometimes, staying true to your beliefs is more important than a trip to Disney World.This article was corrected on 15 May.

The report by UKActive, the trade body that represents most of Britain’s fitness operators, found that 11.5 million people aged 16 and over belong to a gym in the UK – a new high.The findings, it adds, indicate “a shift in societal priorities toward health and wellbeing“ and suggest that “for younger people, gym membership is essential”.Research published by the credit rating service Intuit Credit Karma found that nearly three in 10 (27%) people aged between 18 and 24 consider gym membership to be a necessity.Meanwhile, gen Zers are increasingly ditching alcohol in favour of soft drinks, opting for “sober socialising”, partly for health reasons but also down to cost, according to research byMintel.These were certainly themes coming through from people who responded to an online callout.Louis spends £38 a month on his gym membership and another £30 a month on his climbing club, but says that compares more than favourably with the cost of socialising.“Being at the gym with friends takes away the distraction of alcohol and going out for me.“Even an expensive gym membership costs less for a month than a single night out, making memories that I’ll have forgotten in the morning. That’s why I’ve ditched them and replaced them with the gym.”View image in fullscreenNiyi at his gymPhotograph: Niyi/Guardian CommunityThis view is echoed by Niyi, 25, who has been going to the gym since he was 15.“I’m fascinated by the fact that we as gen Z may be the fittest generation yet due to gym habits,” he says.Niyi sees his daily gym-going as “a form of therapy”, a sentiment that came up repeatedly from many who got in touch with the Guardian.Like Louis, Niyi also regards it as a social space where he can meet new people and “make connections”.“I believe you can learn something from anyone at the gym, and I love interacting with people to network and talk,” he says. “My social habits these days emit from the gym – most of my friends are interested in fitness in some form.”Niyi, who lives in Westminster, London, and is a regional project lead at a human rights charity, spends £100 a month on his gym membershipand also pays £80 a month for his boxing club. But he is comfortable with this outlay.“I think it is worth it when you see it in terms of an investment in yourphysical and mental health, making me fitter and the best I can be,” he says.He enjoys the gym so much that he has even developed it into a side hustle, working as a personal trainer, teaching in-person and online sessions in his spare time.Niyi and Louis are also big fans of the sauna, saying it is a hotbed of lively conversation. “People go there to relax, and it’s surprisingly easy to chat,” says Niyi. “I’ve made some of my best connections there.”Louis adds: “It’s brilliant, It’s such a sociable place. I’ve had some great conversations and met people from all walks of life. It’s hilarious when you think about it: you’re in a hot, steamy room full of half-naked people, yet it’s so natural to have a chat.”Like Niyi, Erin loved her gym’s fitness classes so much she decided she wanted to teach them.View image in fullscreenErin says the gym is the focus of her social life.Photograph: Erin/Guardian CommunityShe goes to the gym at least four times a weekand teaches two weekly fitness classes alongside her main job as an editorial assistant at a publisher.The gym, she says, is also the focus of her social life. “I go there instead of going out,” says Erin, 25, who lives in Cambridge. “The group exercises have a lovely social atmosphere.”Her gym membership is usually £30 a month, but she pays a little less – a staff discount perk.View image in fullscreenErin with her some of her gym friends at a flashmob event for Parkinson’s UK ((from left Tina, Beckie, Natalie, Erin, Liv and Mairead).Photograph: Erin/Guardian Community“I think the gym almost has a hidden social aspect,” she says. “It’s not explicitly social, and that takes the pressure off. There are no awkward silences as you are getting on with the class. Equally, you can speak to someone if you want to.”She also cherishes the opportunity to meet a cross-section of people.“I don’t have any kids and I live with just my flatmate,” she says. “So I’m not sure where else in my day-to-day life I would meet grandmothers and people’s mums.”Explore more on these topicsHealthFitnessYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the time, she didn’t have children of her own, and she was sure that if she ever did, her life as a parent would remain separate from her art. “It still felt hard enough to be taken seriously as a woman artist,” she says, “without adding in this other thing, let alone making it the subject of your work.” She smiles wryly and raises her eyebrows.We’re speaking ahead of her largest museum show to date – an exhibition at the Hepworth Wakefield titled Mothering. Now 43, Walker has built a dazzlingly successful career as a figurative painter, and is the mother of two small children. Ever since she was a student, first at Glasgow School ofArt, then at the Royal College of Art in London, from where she graduated in 2009, she’s been closely observing women. Rendered on intimate panels and breathtakingly big cinematic canvases, her subjects have ranged from bakers and beauticians to tailors and housekeepers – and, lately, the constellation of mostly female workers providing support during childbirth and early-years care.View image in fullscreenIntimate moment … First Nappy Change by Walker.Photograph: Peter Mallet/© Caroline Walker. Courtesy the artist; Stephen Friedman Gallery, GRIMM and Ingleby GalleryWalker began painting all-things parenthood when she became a mother for the first time in 2019. She was already in touch with London’s University College Hospital about the prospect of doing a residency before she got pregnant, and during her appointments there she decided to focus on the maternity wing. The paintings in the Birth Reflections series are awash with cobalt blue – medical scrubs, disposable gloves and hairnets – yet within the coolly sterile setting is a warm sense of dedication. It’s there on a sonographer’s face, strained as she picks out details from a grainy black-and-white image on a screen, and in a midwife’s fingertips, softly pressing a stethoscope to a tiny baby’s chest. It’s there in the anxious glance across the operating theatre of a mother newly stitched up after a caesarean section, and in the concentrated poses of the eight uniformed strangers attending to her and her baby.I didn’t anticipate that I would be repeatedly mining my children for subject matter“I was still slightly reticent about how it was going to be received,” Walker says of this newfound interest. “That it would be seen as less interesting or a bit of a cliche: ‘Oh, she had a baby and now she’s going to make a load of paintings about that.’But I tried not to limit myself, just to let things develop, and now it seems very understandable to me that artists would respond to this life event through their work because it’s such a big shift in identity and daily life.”Birth Reflections is one of four series included in the show. Another, Lisa,explores what happens when a new mother brings a baby home. Following her sister-in-law over four months, starting when she’s heavily pregnant, these knowing paintings show what Walker describes as “a more subjective view on the transition into motherhood and the domestic space in which so much of this time is spent”. Padding around in pyjamas; groggily breastfeeding in bed in the middle of the night; lounging on the sofa while the baby sleeps on you, vacantly watching television in the middle of the day.Meanwhile, Walker’s work has become more autobiographical. The earliest painting on display features her daughter, Daphne, as a toddler, glimpsed through the window of the family’s old flat in London in 2021. “It was the first time I’d painted her, and the first time I’d used my own life as a direct subject. It was supposed to be for sale, but I felt I had to hang on to it.” She laughs. “I didn’t anticipate then that I would be repeatedly mining my children for subject matter.”View image in fullscreenGlimpsed through the window … Daphne.Photograph: Peter Mallett/© Caroline Walker. Courtesy the artist; Stephen Friedman Gallery, GRIMM and Ingleby GalleryDaphne, who’s now five and apparently delights in seeing herself in paint, appears throughout the exhibition. We see her bobbing about in a swimming lesson with yellow armbands and froggy legs, and sitting at the kitchen table with Walker’s mother, Janet, and a cuddly hermit crab. And playing around at nursery, initially in London and more recently in Scotland, where Walker and her family have been living since summer 2022. The title of the show is borrowed from something a member of staff at Little Bugs, an outdoor nursery, said about “mothering” being part of their training.“A lot of the time, I’ve been looking in on a subject as an outsider,” says Walker, who begins by spending time with women and photographing their days. Being behind the camera at her daughter’s nursery was different: “I was paying for another woman to look after my child, so that I could make my work, which in this case was portraying that woman looking after my child. There was a complicated relationship of financial exchange going on that made me think about how we value different forms of labour.”Throughout her career, Walker has taken small acts of unseen and under-appreciated work – plumping pillowcases, scrubbing sinks, buffing and shaping nails – and depicted them in oil paint on an epic scale traditionally reserved for history paintings. She does so by paying attention to paraphernalia as much as people. In this show’s case, sterilised plastic bottles and breast pumps, half-finished drinks collecting on a table, fresh flowers still in their paper packaging, babygrows sprouting from a wardrobe like weeds.

Courtesy the artist; Stephen Friedman Gallery, GRIMM, and Ingleby Gallery“When I was at home with Daphne, I remember looking around the house and finding it really claustrophobic, just the stuff everywhere,” she says. “There was condensation continuously running down the walls from all these things drying because we suddenly had so much washing.” She decided that this was what being a new mother looked like, and that she wanted to make paintings of it. “Because it is a mess, but it’s also visually interesting. It tells a story, and it’s very specific to that moment.”A rare self-portrait shows Walker with her then six-week-old son, Laurie. She was about to put him down in his cot when she paused in front of a mirror and asked her husband to take a photograph of the two of them. Walker’s reflection meets us with an exhausted gaze. “I was so tired, and not having the best time, and it felt interminable.” She drifts off and smiles. “Now every time I look at that painting it takes me back to what it felt like to hold this tiny little body and have these tiny little hands on my shoulder.”Walker and her family live in a converted farmstead on the fringes of Dunfermline, half an hour from Edinburgh, surrounded by fields of bleating lambs. Her parents are a 10-minute drive away, in the house where she grew up; she doesn’t come from an artistic family, but she liked to draw from an early age, mostly women and the world around them. She has a small studio at home, and a larger one is in the works. “It’s a different setup to living in London, of course, but actually workwise it’s pretty good,” she says. “The way I work is different now. It’s bitty, but there are lots of bits, and overall I probably end up with the same amount of time I had before, or I use my time better.”View image in fullscreen‘Those early years are so intense’ … Morning at Little Bugs.Photograph: Peter Mallett/© Caroline Walker. Courtesy the artist; Stephen Friedman Gallery, GRIMM and Ingleby GalleryWill mothering still be her subject in a decade’s time? “I suppose these early years are so intense that it’s natural they would bubble up into the work, but my relationship with my children and the intensity of my involvement will obviously change,” she says. For now, though, being a mother and an artist are one and the same. “My work and my life have become completely entwined.”Caroline Walker: Mothering is at Hepworth Wakefield from 17 May to 27 October, and at Pallant House Gallery in Chichester from 22 November to 10 May 2026. The exhibition is accompanied by an illustrated monograph of the same title, to be published by Lund Humphries in September.Explore more on these topicsArtWomen (Society)Women (Life and style)Parents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the disclosure provoked fury as the company has saidits finances are “hair raising”and that it had come “very close to running out of money entirely” last year.Thames is in a desperate race to raise funds andpersuade the water regulator to let it off hundreds of millions of pounds of finesor risk being renationalised.Government sources said these bonuses could be banned as soon as next month, and any paid for the last financial year, between April 2024 and April 2025, could be clawed back. The environment secretary,Steve Reed, said “the days of profiting from failure are over”.It emerged this week that Thames was planning to use part of a £3bn emergency loan, which was meant to stabilise its finances and save it from collapse, to pay bonuses for senior executives.View image in fullscreenThames’s chair, Sir Adrian Montague, told MPs on the environment, food and rural affairs committee, that senior managers were its ‘most precious resource’.Photograph: House of Commons/PAThames’s chair, Sir Adrian Montague, told MPs on the environment, food and rural affairs (Efra) committee on Tuesday that the first of these bonuses would be up to 50% of their salary, arguing senior managers are its “most precious resource”.The bonuses could be the first to be blocked under Reed’s water (special measures) bill, which gives the regulator Ofwat powers to ban financial rewards for executives presiding over a failing company. Thames Water could be classed as such, as it is presiding overrecord sewage spills,heavily laden with debt and on the brink of financial collapse.Reed said: “Water companies got away with dumping a tidal wave of sewage into our river while pocketing millions pounds of bonuses.“That ends now. The government will ban the payment of unfair bonuses for polluting water bosses. The days of profiting from failure are over.”Chris Weston, Thames’s chief executive, was paid a bonus of £195,000 for three months of work after he joined the company in January 2024, giving him a total package of £2.3m. However, this bonus is unlikely to be affected by Reed’s clampdown.Weston defended his pay to MPs, claiming: “I joined Thames because it matters to society. Within the first three months I did make a difference.”Weston’s bonus could amount to as much as 156% of his pay, compared with 3% to 6% for frontline workers, he said.Montague told MPs that some senior executives would be given “50% of salary, very substantial bonuses” from the £3bn loan, which was advanced by lenders including Aberdeen and Insight Investment as well as hedge funds and other investors in distressed companies such as Elliott and Silver Point.Montague said: “We have a bonus scheme to protect our most precious resource, which is the senior management team.” He said the bonuses would be paid in three stages, “in completion of the first restructuring plan, another one at the end of the second restructuring plan and then a large amount right at the end of the process”.The £3bn creditor loan, which waschallenged in court by rival bondholders, comes with a 9.75% interest rate, plus fees. Montague claimed the bonuses were “insisted” upon by the lenders. “We need this team to stay until the completion of the transaction,” he said, adding the bonuses linked to the £3bn loan “will be funded by the lenders” and not customers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last yeara record £9.1m in bonuses was paid out to water executives.Helena Dollimore, an Efra committee member and Labour MP for Hastings, Rye and the villages, said: “Thames Water’s evidence at the select committee was damning, and another reminder of the dire state of the water industry. Vital infrastructure work was delayed, pipes left to crumble, all while the water bosses were rewarded with huge bonuses.“We’ve hauled in the water bosses one by one and the story of failure is always the same. Water bosses should not continue to be rewarded for failure, so I am pleased to hear decisive action is finally being taken.”Last year, Thames Water oversaw a 40% increase in pollution incidents, but £770,000 was still paid out in performance bonuses.Customers’ billsrose this year after the company was given permission to lift them by 35%. Thames wishes to raise these further to 59% and has an appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority under way, though this has been deferred while it attempts to get its finances in order.Thames is in a desperate race to find a buyer willing to inject cash as it teeters on the brink of temporary nationalisation. The company, which has 16 million customers and 8,000 employees,recently came withindays of running out of money and is labouring under £20bn of debt.The US private equity firm KKR, whichhopes to acquire a £4bn stake, is the last option for Thames as it scrambles to find a buyer by the end of June. Thames and KKR are trying to persuade Ofwat, the industry regulator, to grant leniency on fines and penalties.Ofwat had said it would prefer two companies to be in the final phase of checks before a bid was picked, MPs said. However, should that takeover fail, the heavily indebted utility could collapse into state hands via the special administration regime.Thames Water customers, as well as those of other companies, arefacing hosepipe bans this summerunless there is significant rainfall soon. Reservoir levels are at less than 85% on average across the UK and they are usually full at this time of year. No reservoirs have been built in England for more than 30 years, which leaves the country particularly vulnerable to drought. Water companies including Thames have been criticised for a lack of investment in crucial infrastructure to secure the UK’s water supply.A Thames Water spokesperson said: “Thames Water is progressing a complex turnaround and restructuring process so we can deliver better results for our customers and the environment and seek a long-term solution to our financial resilience. It is critical that the business retains the people best placed to deliver the improved outcomes our stakeholders rightly expect.”Explore more on these topicsThames WaterSteve ReedWater industryExecutive pay and bonusesPollutionWaternewsShareReuse this content"

He wrote in the Times: “The bottom line is that taxes will have to go up.”Labour has faced calls from trade unions and leftwing MPs totarget wealthy individuals with higher taxesamid tight constraints on the public finances, as the chancellor prepares to deliver next month’s spending review.According to the NAO report, billions of pounds in additional revenue could be collected from wealthy individuals. It said the annual “compliance yield” from well-off taxpayers – the revenue HMRC collects after chasing for non-payment – more than doubled from £2.2bn in the 2019-20 financial year to £5.2bn in 2023-24.However, it said this rise was more than £1bn greater than the “wealthy tax gap” estimated by HMRC, which, it said, “raises the possibility that underlying levels of non-compliance among the wealthy population could be greater than previously thought”.HMRC calculated the tax gap for wealthy individuals – the difference between the amount of money it estimates it is owed and how much is collected – at £1.9bn for the financial year ending in March 2023.Highlighting the scope for a further crackdown, the NAO said the super-rich had faced far fewer penalties for non-compliance in recent years.HMRC issued 456 penalties worth £5.8m to wealthy taxpayers in the financial year ending in March 2024, a decline of more than 75% from 2,153 penalties in 2018-19, totalling £16.2m.Labour announced a number oftax increases targeted at wealthier individuals in the autumn budget, including replacing the non-dom tax regime, increasing capital gains tax, and charging VAT on private school fees.Critics on the free-market right argue the changes have triggered an exodus of millionaires from Britain, but those on Labour’s left say the government could go further instead of targeting welfare cuts at the poorest in society.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, ministers provided additional funding for the tax office in the autumn budget, including provision to tackle wealthy offshore non-compliance and fraud.Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said:“HMRC deserves credit for greatly increasing the additional tax revenue its compliance work has brought in from wealthy taxpayers, however this may indicate that levels of non-compliance are higher than previously estimated.“HMRC should also seek to provide greater transparency to give greater confidence to the public that all taxpayers contribute their fair share.”A spokesperson for HMRC said: “It’s our duty to ensure everyone pays the right tax under the law, regardless of wealth or status. The government is delivering the most ambitious ever package to close the tax gap and bring in an extra £7.5bn for public services per year by 2029-30.”Explore more on these topicsTax avoidanceTax and spendingEconomic policyRachel ReevesLabourIncome taxTaxnewsShareReuse this content"

They added that the planned changes “threaten to affect the most vulnerable” and a pause would give them “more time to seek appropriate professional advice” while allowing the government time to consider other options.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, caused uproar among much of the farming sector in October whenshe announced plans in her budgetto bring farms and other agricultural property into inheritance tax rules, in order to raise money for public services and close a tax loophole exploited by some wealthy landowners.Ending a decades-long exemption for farms, Reeves’s plansto make inheritors pay 20%of the value of agricultural and business property above £1m havesparked large-scale protestsin recent months and led to ministers’ speechesbeing drowned out by tractor horns.MPs on the cross-party Efra committee have raised concerns that the changes announced in the budget were made without adequate consultation, impact assessment or assessment of affordability, with a risk of producing unintended consequences.View image in fullscreenHundreds of tractors at a protest in Whitehall in February.Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/ShutterstockWhile broadly supportive of the government’s inheritance tax changes, the committee is calling on ministers to consult on their proposals toavoid hurting small family farms.Alistair Carmichael, the chair of the Efra committee and a Liberal Democrat MP, criticised the way the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs had communicated with farmers, particularly thesudden closure of a key post-Brexit subsidy scheme, the sustainable farming incentive.“The way in which the government has behaved over recent months has clearly negatively affected the confidence and wellbeing of farmers,” Carmichael said.“We have seen that Defra’s communications with farmers have been poor, with confusing and sometimes contradictory messaging. There has been a lack of adequate consultation. Policies affecting farmers have been announced without due consideration or explanation of their impact or their rationale.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One was a fire at the prime minister’s family home in north-west London, which he now lets out to his sister-in-law, the Guardian understands. The blaze was reported to police by firefighters in the early hours of Monday.Police said damage was caused to the property’s entrance but nobody was hurt.A car that Starmer had sold to a neighbour last year was set alight four days earlier on the same street.On 11 May, firefighters dealt with a small fire at the front door of a house where the PM is understood to have lived in the 1990s, before it was converted into flats.One person was helped to safety by firefighters wearing breathing apparatus, the London fire brigade said.Lavrynovych is due to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 16 May.Explore more on these topicsUK newsCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The estate agent John D Wood & Co said it was seeing “a number of politically motivated relocations – Americans who are seeking greater stability abroad”.But if the growing interest in the UK in part reflects a desire to escape the US president, some may be surprised to see thatScotlandhas replaced London as the most popular location to inquire about.Trump has strong links to Scotland: his mother was born just a few miles from Stornoway, on the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis; he owns Trump International Scotland, a golf resort in Aberdeenshire; and he has previously declared: “I think I do feel Scottish.”Edinburgh is the most popular destination in Rightmove’s 2025 top 10, pushing London’s Westminster into second place. Glasgow, meanwhile, has risen to fourth place, just behind Camden in third and overtaking London’s Kensington and Chelsea. Other areas of Scotland in the top 10 include Highland, Argyll and Bute and Fife.The Cotswolds has long been popular with well-off Americans: it has been named “the Hamptons of England”, and the former chatshow star Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, are among those to move there recently. But it was notable in its absence from the 2025 top 10.Some of this US interest may be from people who see the UK predominantly as a investment opportunity. Rightmove – Britain’s biggest property website – said its data included people inquiring about moving to the UK from the US as well as those wanting a second home or buy to let property.Rightmove said that over the past 10 years, London had received the biggest proportion of US inquiries, but that at the start of 2025 it switched to Scotland, “potentially due to its lower price point”.Colleen Babcock, Rightmove’s property expert, said some of the knock-on effects of Trump’s tariff announcements and the economic uncertainty globally were starting to be felt in the UK property market.“Whether it’s because the UK is seen as a more stable investment opportunity, or whether some buyers are considering a permanent move across the Atlantic, we’re seeing an increase in inquiries from the US,” she said.Glynn Gibb, a regional director at John D Wood & Co, said the agent had seen a steady rise in inquiries from US buyers interested in “prime” central London.“London’s culture and global connectivity make it an ideal springboard to Europe and beyond. Many are basing themselves here temporarily – often staying with friends – while they work out how long they plan to stay. We expect activity to build in the coming months – spring and early summer are typically busy – as more buyers make lifestyle and financial decisions shaped by the political climate in the US,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPropertyReal estateRightmoveEdinburghScotlandTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

They included Azeem Rafiq, who told the report that nothing could prepare him for theabuse he receivedafter speaking out about racism at Yorkshire County Cricket Club.‘There’s a dark side’: 1500m star Georgia Hunter Bell calls for online abuse to stopRead more“The impact of this experience on me as a human being and on my mental health has damaged my life to such an extent, I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to quantify it,” he said. “People would post on social media that I was a ‘Dirty P-word’; that I should ‘Fuck off back to Pakistan’ and that ‘All Muslims are bombers’. The abuse left me feeling incredibly paranoid, at times, and often made me question my sanity.”Meanwhile, the former rugby referee Wayne Barnes said that while he could cope with abuse suggesting that he should be hanged, and images of him as an effigy being attacked, it was a different story when it wasdirected at his wife. “What made it worse was the direct impact over time on my family,” he said. “Misogynistic language aimed at my wife because of her association with me, including comments like ‘You fucking bitch! You slut! Tell your husband he’s shit’ and, at times, threats of sexual violence.”The report also spoke to sport stars, who said abuse had the potential to affect their performance, as well as presenters who said they often self-censored because of online hate.View image in fullscreenKick It Out’s Sanjay Bhandari criticised social media ecosystems that ‘amplified’ abuse.Photograph: Paul Currie/ShutterstockThe Kick It Out chair, Sanjay Bhandari, said the report showed that abuse of people in sport had become “normalised”. “The impact of online abuse is undeniable, and the rise in discriminatory social media reports to Kick It Out last season shows it’s getting worse,” he said. “This isn’t about a few hateful comments. It’s about a culture of abuse that has become normalised. It’s about a social media ecosystem that too often enables and amplifies abuse.

But the Commons speaker, Linsday Hoyle, granted more time for the debate, meaning the only votes will be on specific amendments.These will nonetheless be closely watched for any signs of shifting sentiment among MPs. Opponents of the bill have talked up the idea that a number of supporters have since changed their minds, but only a handful of MPs have said this publicly.In her letter, Rantzen sought to assuage opponents’ worries, for example that the measure could be used against people with disabilities, which she said was not true. “This is a strong, safe, carefully considered bill, guided by Kim Leadbeater and her excellent committee,” she wrote.She went on: “All we terminally ill adults ask of you, our MPs, is to remember how much suffering our current messy, cruel criminal law creates. How many lonely painful deaths. How many suicides. How many agonising memories have been created by it.“Please vote for this crucial reform, as so many other countries have, not for me, and for those like me who are running rapidly out of time, but for future generations to have the right, if necessary, not to shorten their lives, but to shorten their deaths.”Rantzen’s letter accused some opponents to the bill of doing so because of “undeclared personal religious beliefs which mean no precautions would satisfy them”, a charge which has angered MPs.The MPs’ letter is signed by three former doctors – Neil Shastri-Hurst (Conservative), Simon Opher and Peter Prinsley (both Labour) – and a former nurse, Kevin McKenna (Labour).They criticised what they called the “misleading” idea that medical professionals tended to oppose assisted dying, saying surveys had shown, at worst, mixed sentiments.They wrote: “In our experience, most healthcare professionals understand that the current law is not working. It criminalises compassion and forces dying people into situations no civilised healthcare system should accept: unbearable pain, unmitigated suffering, or the traumatic decision to end their lives overseas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As parliamentarians, we cannot defend it now.”Underthe timetableset out by Hoyle, two sets of the amendments agreed in the committee stage will be voted on, first on Friday and then on 13 June.Among the votes on Friday will be amendments intended to tighten up the bill, for example adding a further check on applications for assisted dying, and ensuring doctors and others are able to opt out of involvement in the process.While the next vote on the future of the bill itself is not until 20 June, Friday’s votes will be keenly watched for any changes in support. The Conservative MP George Freeman, who backed the second reading in November, has since said he will vote no, and there area handful of othersunderstood to be changing their minds.Leadbeater insistedon Thursday that there had been no major drop in support. “There might be some move in either direction but certainly not a huge amount of movement,” she told LBC radio.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingEsther RantzenHealth policyHealthDeath and dyingnewsShareReuse this content"

The scheme implied the possible permanent displacement of many or all of the territory’s 2.3 million people and triggered global outrage.In Qatar, on the third day of his Middle East tour, Trump said: “I have concepts forGazathat I think are very good: make it a freedom zone, let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone. I’d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone.”Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, rejected the idea, saying: “Gaza is an integral part of Palestinian land – it is not real estate for sale on the open market.“We remain firmly committed to our land and our national cause, and we are prepared to make every sacrifice to preserve our homeland and secure our people’s future.”There had been widespread hope that Trump’s regional visit could lead to a new pause in hostilities or a renewal of humanitarian aid to Gaza, where a tight Israeli blockade is now in its third month.Instead, the raids and bombardment over the past 48 hours have raised levels of violence in Gaza higher than for several weeks, with the death toll coming close to what was seen during the first days of Israel’s renewed offensive in Gaza after a fragile ceasefire collapsed in March.Some officials in Gaza put the number killed by Israeli attacks on Thursday as high as 120.Map of GazaAnalysts said the omission of Israel from Trump’s itinerary was a significant blow to the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and evidence oftension between the two leaders. The US president visited Saudi Arabia, then Qatar and arrived in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.Netanyahu, who leads the most rightwing government in Israel’s history, vowed earlier in the week to push ahead with an expanded offensive in Gaza to achieve Israel’s stated war aims of “crushing” Hamas and freeing the 58 hostages it is holding.Hamas seized 251 hostages in its October 2023 attack on Israel, during which its militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians.Israel’s subsequent offensive has killed at least 52,928 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza’s health ministry, which the UN considers reliable.The number of casualties reported over the past 48 hours –about 160– has not been confirmed independently. Israeli officials have said many of the recent strikes targeted senior Hamas commanders and accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, a charge the militant Islamist organisation denies.On Thursday, Palestinians commemorated the “Nakba”, or catastrophe, of 1948, in which about 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homeland after the creation of Israel.“What we are experiencing now is even worse than the Nakba of 1948,” Ahmed Hamad, a Palestinian in Gaza City who has been displaced several times, told Reuters.“The truth is, we live in a constant state of violence and displacement. Wherever we go, we face attacks. Death surrounds us everywhere.”View image in fullscreenPeople clamour for donated food at a community kitchen in Jabaliya.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APPressure on Israel to ease its blockade of Gaza is mounting. Stocks offood and fuel are almost exhausted. Nearly half a million Palestinians are facing possible starvation, while 1 million others can barely get enough food, according to findings from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, an international authority on the severity of hunger crises.Human Rights Watch said on Thursday that Israel’s blockade “has transcended military tactics to become a tool of extermination”.The global campaign group also criticised “plans to squeeze Gaza’s 2 million people into an even tinier area while making the rest of the land uninhabitable”.Israel, which claims the blockade is necessary to stop Hamas looting and selling aid to fund its military and other operations, has put forward a plan to distribute humanitarian assistance from a series of hubs in Gaza run by private contractors and protected by Israeli troops.Vetted representatives of families would be allowed to pick up monthly food packages from six hubs in southern Gaza.The US-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been established to manage the scheme, announced on Wednesday that it would begin operating by the end of the month and that it had asked Israel to lift its blockade.Israel has not commented on the statement.Aid officials in Gaza, including from the UN, have described the scheme as unworkable, inadequate, dangerous and potentially unlawful, and Gulf states that were approached for funding havereportedly refused to back the plan.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, acknowledged the criticism of the plan and said Washington was “open to an alternative if someone has a better one”.There was also violence in the occupied West Bank on Thursday. The Israeli military said a hunt was under way after a woman who was nine months pregnant and on her way to the delivery room was killed when a suspected Palestinian gunman opened fire on her car.Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Hamas’s armed wing, praised the attack as “heroic” in a video statement but did not admit responsibility.Palestinian officials said five people were killed in a raid by the Israeli army in the northern village of Tammun. Israeli military officials said the operation had targeted buildings suspected of being used to plan terror attacks.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Lights out, Dallas!As avian numbers plunge, activists demand action to save birds from crashing into high-rise blocksByOliver MilmanandAliya UteuovaThu 15 May 2025 12.37 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 13.09 EDTShareThe wren’s legs were tucked delicately underneath its diminutive body, slumped on its side as if asleep. If it wasn’t lying on the bare concrete of a Texas street, there would be few clues that it had endured a crunching, violent death.The bird had flown headfirst into the Bank of America building, a 72-storey modernist skyscraper in the heart of Dallas. Its corpse was catalogued by volunteers who seek to document the toll of birds that strike the glass, metal and concrete structures festooned with bewildering lights that form the skylines of our cities.It’sestimatedthat around a billion birds die across the US each year in this way, one of the leading drivers of an alarming slump in numbers. For the dozen volunteers gathered before dawn to scour downtown for newly dead birds on a balmy May morning, each of these losses is a solemn one.“If you let it sink in too much about what you’re doing every morning, it wears you out, it can be pretty bleak,” says Tim Brys, a community engagement manager at the Perot Museum of Nature and Science and regular bird surveyor for theLights Out, Texas!campaign. “It’s horrible to think these birds have flown all the way across the Gulf of Mexico only to fly into the first glass building.”The buildings of Dallas, along with those of other Texan cities, are particularly lethal obstacles because they sit on the central flyway, a major migratory route taken by birds as they traverse North and South America. It’s thought as many as one in three birds migrating through the US each spring pass through Texas.Map of migratory birds that fly over Texas.“That is a lot of birds,” says Brys. The Lights Out surveys take morning counts three times a week during the peak spring migration season – last year 295 mortalities were recorded. Volunteers have collected and tagged more than 100 species since 2020, including sparrows, doves, warblers, ovenbirds and more unusual finds such as a lazuli bunting or woodcocks, which are normally found in swamps.But there is no way to fully count such deaths, Brys admits, because birds are so regularly thumping into office towers, homes, power lines and,to a lesser degreedespite some claims, wind turbines. The losses compound – each killed songbird might make up to six nests a season, with as many as six eggs in each nest. “So the loss of one bird is 340 or so birds within a two-year span,” Brys says.For birds travelling from darker forests or grasslands, the sudden dazzle of lights and walls of glass found in cities can be a death trap. On maps charting US light pollution, Dallas is a burning beacon, sloshing light up and out of its buildings into the skies rather than focusing it on where it is needed. Most birds are nocturnal migrants, hardwired to navigate by the moon and stars, and the artificial replacements to these wayfinders, plus the reflections in glass, particularly of nearby trees that birds would aim for, cause many to become disoriented and crash into buildings.“We had a security guard tell us that the birds run into the glass because they are effing stupid,” says Brys. “And I said ‘well, imagine trying to run through a mirror maze at 35mph, how far do you think you would get?’ If we had never even seen glass before, how many people do you think would’ve walked into a glass door or window?”Satellite map of the state of Texas at night-time.Light pollution has been present since the lightbulb was invented but it’s only in the past 20 years that glaring, intrusive light has started to routinely obscure the stars and imperil birds flying at night, according to Teznie Pugh, superintendent of the University of Texas’s McDonald Observatory. “It’s become a major concern,” Pugh says. “Each generation, we are basically halving the number of stars you’re able to see at night.”Globally, light pollution has increased by about 10% a year since 2011, a studyreleased in 2023 found. But there has been some progress through a rethink of excess lighting, which is often costly as well as harmful, and the advance of bird-friendly glass, which incorporates dots or stripes to warn birds of an impending obstacle.Cities such as Houston and New York have vowed to lessen bird strikes, with the latteralteringits annual 9/11 tribute, in which twin shafts of light are thrown towards the heavens, by switching off the lights for a short period if more than 1,000 birds are trapped, befuddled, in its beams.Chicago’s McCormick Place, the largest convention centre in North America, became notorious when 1,000 birdsslammed into itone night in 2023. “That building is a real killer,” says Adriaan Dokter, an ecologist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. But the centre has since installed bird-safe glass, cutting the amount of crashes by about 90% last year.View image in fullscreenReunion Tower in Dallas (pictured here in 2017) now voluntarily dims its lights during peak spring migration season.Photograph: Purestock/AlamyIn Dallas, Reunion Tower, a landmark that resembles a giant golf ball on a stick, has dimmed its lights during peak spring migration season and activists are piling pressure on the city’s convention centre to take action too. The sprawling building has plenty of darkened glass at bird-flying height, unhelpfully situated near stands of trees. The centre is undergoing a renovation and the Lights Out volunteers are agitating for it to install bird-safe glass.“Nobody wants to be the building that kills tonnes of birds and a lot of times it a simple solution such as to turn off your lights or use a curtain,” says Mei Ling Liu, a Lights Out organiser at theTexas Conservation Alliance.Progress is complicated by ingrained habits of construction and lighting, exacerbated by LED lights, which are worse for birds and insects but are cheaper and more efficient. Bird-friendly glass also costs more than standard versions. “It’s a challenge,” adds Liu. “When it comes to light pollution, it’s not a single building issue, it’s an entire city. And Dallas is still very bright.”As Dallas starts to emerge from its slumber, the hi-vis wearing volunteers continue to find birds on their circuit. A warbler is discovered thrashing on the ground at the foot of a hotel – it is placed into a brown bag to be sent to a rehabilitation centre. A young, dead grackle isn’t so lucky, nor is another bird, a splattered warbler, that Liu has to pick up with tongs and shake because it is covered in ants.In all, 12 dead birds are recovered, placed in bags, logged and put into a freezer at thePerot museum, which installed bird-safe glass after some windows were smashed amid Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.Bird migration peaks at night-timeView image in fullscreenMap of the US showing the intensity of nocturnal bird migration.Composite: Adriaan Dokter, BirdCast, Cornell Lab of OrnithologyA sort of silent spring has enveloped avians, with three billion fewer birds in North Americathan there were in the 1970s, a loss that researchers have called “staggering”. Around a third of US bird speciesare in need to critical conservation action, with numbers plummeting fastest in placeswhere they are most abundant. “That the declines are steepest in these stronghold areas is really striking and remarkable,” says Dokter. “We are seeing birds disappear at a rate that, ecologically speaking, is super fast.”Thebald eagleand theCalifornia condormay have been saved from the brink of extinction but, more broadly, the days are marked by fewer birds now. Passenger pigeons, once so numerous they blotted out the sun while flying overhead, are completely wiped out.Our world has fewer songs, less colour and a dwindling sense of wonder as a result. A toxic tangle of reasons are behind this feathered crisis – habitat loss, chemical use and the climate crisis among them – but the one that appears most solvable is the tragedy of birds crashing into buildings.“The nice thing about this problem is that it’s within our reach to change quickly, it’s not like climate change or plastic pollution,” said Dokter. “Bird-safe designs of windows are the future and more and more cities are realising issues with lighting. We can all influence this, even in our own homes. We can tackle this problem.”Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesBirdsnewsShareReuse this content"

And does it work?We find out if this fitness supplement can be used to build muscle mass, decrease fatigue and improve mental healthAdrienne MateiThu 15 May 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 12.02 EDTShareCreatine has long been popular among athletes. Olympianstout it, fitness influencersexperiment with it, and Patrick Schwarzenegger’s gym bro character in The White Lotus added it to his famousshake.It’s primarily considered afitnesssupplement, but doctors are increasingly curious about its potential longevity andmental healthbenefits.But is creatine really useful, and are there any downsides? Here’s what experts say.What is creatine?Creatine is a compound the body naturally makes in the liver, kidneys and pancreas. We can also get it from animal proteins like red meat, fish and chicken. It acts as a quick fuel source for muscles, helping regenerate adenosine triphosphate, or ATP – a molecule cells use for energy.“If we keep it super simple, the body has three sorts of energy systems,” says Dr Imtiaz Desai, a Sydney, Australia-based exercise physiologist.Creatine helps power short-duration, high-intensity activities like sprinting or lifting, and also those requiring moderately sustained energy, like tennis or hockey. But it doesn’t do much for prolonged, slow-burn energy like the kind you need to run a marathon.If you’re doing resistance training, it helps muscles work harder for a little longer. “It should enable you to do a few more repetitions at the same weight,” says Desai.Most people don’t need creatine supplements for general health – the body makes enough, aside from in rare and seriouscasesof genetic creatine deficiency disorder. Nonetheless, the fitness-minded often take it to optimize their workouts.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Synthetic creatine comes in different formulations, but creatine monohydrate is the most studied, with the strongest evidence for efficacy. It’s widely available, often sold as a flavorless, grainy white powder, and affordable: dosages vary based on personal goals, but a typical daily serving of five grams might cost about 50 cents (38p).Is creatine safe?In healthy adults, creatine is considered safe even forlong-termuse – it’s one of the mostresearchedsupplements available.While the UK regulates dietary supplements, in the US, the Food and Drug Administration does not vet the accuracy of supplement contents, so it’s possible for products to be contaminated with other substances or contain less creatine than advertised. Products with theNSF sealare more reliable, as they have been tested by a third-party regulator.Do you feel proud when you succeed – or just relieved?Read moreCreatine is known to cause minor side-effects like bloating or stomach pain. These can be more pronounced in people taking higher doses, such as 25 or 30 grams a day, in a dubious practice known as “loading”.“There’s no need for a loading phase,” says Dr Avinish Reddy, a Los Angeles-based physician with a longevity-focused practice.Higher doses of creatine create more waste for the kidneys to filter, so people with kidney issues should check with a doctor before starting the supplement, says Reddy. Recently, creatine “loading” was linked toacute kidney injuryin a 17-year-old boy.It’s best to take creatine mixed into a liquid, like juice, water or a smoothie, as opposed to “dry-scooping”, an influencer stunt in which people eat straight creatine. This methodrisks powder inhalation and choking, along with worse GI effects.Does creatine actually help build muscle?The short answer: not as much as the hype suggests.Desai led a 12-weekstudy, published this March, in which two groups of people began a weight-lifting regimen. One group used creatine, the other did not. There was no meaningful difference in results: people in both groups gained approximately two kilograms of lean body mass on average.In the short term, creatine draws water into muscles, which can cause a couple of pounds of temporary weight gain and make muscles look more full. “There’s a short-term change in body-water content,” says Desai, who posits that paststudiesthat found small benefits with creatine supplementation may have overestimated creatine’s relationship with muscle growth by not accounting for this water retention.Desai says it’s possible that longer studies might provide more information about creatine’s muscle-building benefits over time. It is also possible that creatine may indirectly boost muscle growth by allowing people to train harder. “If you’re able to do more repetitions, then over time, we would expect you to see an added benefit,” Desai says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It can help with resistance training and post-workoutrecoveryby activating satellite cells, which repair muscle fibers after injury caused by use.Vegetarians and vegans who supplement with creatine may also see greater improvements in their workouts and energy levels, since their diets contain less natural creatine.However, researchers estimate that about 20%-30% of people are “non-responders” to creatine due to physiological factors like genetics.Can creatine support mental health?Researchersare exploring whether creatine may help ease depression symptoms bysupportingbrain energy, memory, attention and information processing speed, and promotingdopamine and serotoninproduction.Dr David Puder, Florida-based psychiatrist and host of the Psychiatry & Psychotherapy podcast, sees creatine as a promising tool in treating depression. It is not necessarily a standalone solution, but can be part of a broader, physician-led approach to treating depression, along with therapy and optimizing diet, exercise and sleep.“Studies to date have shown that creatine seems to amplify the speed at which people recover [from depression] by a little bit,” says Puder. “Not a lot, but a measurable improvement,” he says, particularly in clinical trials pairing creatine with medications such as Lexapro or cognitive behavioral therapy.It may be that creatine’s exercise-boosting effects also support mental health. “Exercise improves the ability to come out of depression,” says Puder, so better workouts “may allow for an independent improvement in depression beyond what the creatine is doing in the brain”.While creatine may help alleviate the mental fatigue that comes with depression, Puder says that in people with bipolar disorder, there is some risk of it contributing to hypomania. If you are interested in starting creatine, you should talk to your doctor beforehand.Is creatine safe for young people?While creatine itself is generally safe for adults, most medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics,recommend againstcreatine use for those under 18 due to unknown long-term effects. However, there are no age restrictions on who can buy creatine, and a 2024reviewfound 26% of adolescent boys said they had taken creatine at some point.The University of Toronto researcher Dr Kyle Ganson also cautions that creatine use by teens can be part of a broader pattern.Ganson recentlystudieda cohort of 912 teenagers and young adults. He found that those who used creatine, particularly young men and boys, were more likely to develop muscle dysmorphia – an obsessive drive for size and muscularity that can lead to psychological fallout.“It’s not causal,” says Ganson. “Just because you take creatine, you’re not going to develop a mental health condition.” But it may be a sign that a young person is becoming overly focused on body image.Ganson urges parents to exercise “respectful curiosity” about their child’s goals with the supplement, and to talk to a doctor or dietitian, especially if their child’s focus on physical appearance seems to be disrupting other areas of their life.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyFitnessNutritionHealthMental healthHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Hurry Up Tomorrow, a celluloid roman-à-clef pegged to hissixth studio album, the Grammy-winning multi-hyphenate puzzles through the consequences of hooking up with a deranged groupie who forces him to reckon with his rock star flings. But it’s viewers who will probably be feeling rueful over nearly two hours lost in the end.Though technically a thriller, Tomorrow takes inspiration from a real-life moment of weakness: the Weeknd – born Abel Tesfaye – losing his voice while filmingThe IdolTV series in between a global stadium tour. As with most of his artistic efforts, the Weeknd makes the job of distinguishing his sincere reflections from his satirical self-observations impossibly hard on audiences and smirks when they don’t get the joke. Recall hisdizzying Super Bowl half-time showandface-bandage stunthe pulled to promote the After Hours album.The Weeknd: Hurry Up Tomorrow review – a record that will floor you … and drive you up the wallRead moreTomorrow marks the Weeknd’s third try at making a film based on an album, but the first to run at feature length. It also reunites him with Trey Edward Shults, who directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with the Weeknd and The Idol creator Reza Fahim. Like The Idol, Tomorrow wallows in the glamour of fame, drugs and sex – highs the Weeknd chases to keep him pushing through a combustible breakup of his own making. Throughout, the Weeknd’s vocal cords bear the brunt of the stress and pop on him, quite audibly, as he’s serenading a full house. Scared and desperate, he shrinks from the spotlight and makes a break for it – only to run into Anima (Jenna Ortega), a reveler he connected with mid-spiral.This is no chance encounter. Anima is an unstable person with nothing to lose who we first meet setting fire to Abel’s childhood home. She doesn’t tell him that when the Weeknd bumps into her as he’s lamming it from his own concert; she only gives him a safe, easy escape. After an inconspicuous night on the town, a welcome release from their urgent problems, the two strangers repair to a luxury hotel suite to share more music and heartfelt emotions before falling into bed. When the Weeknd gets too relaxed and tells Anima “don’t leave me,” the words come back to bite when he tries to reprise his rock star life the next morning. A blindside hit to the head sends the Weeknd down a fevered journey into the pit of his psyche, and the torture doesn’t end when he comes to.Amid the shocks and spasms, Tomorrow remains easy enough on the eyes. It was shot on 35mm film, which makes wide shots of Canadian Rockies and SoCal vistas really pop.The Weeknddominates on screen, but you would struggle to take your eyes off him anyway; he oozes Michael Jackson-level energy, down to the ersatz Thriller jacket. When he and Ortega are in frame, their chemistry shines through. It’s just too bad their connection is spoiled on a film that unspools like one long music video – the essence of the Weeknd’s other short films.Hallow Road review – Rosamund Pike and Matthew Rhys race to rescue daughter in cracking thrillerRead moreTomorrow can’t rush past its lack of clarity, both visually and in the storytelling. The payoffs should hit harder, but the film’s insistence on tarrying in the space between the characters’ sober and sick minds make for muddled set-ups. Gallingly, the film wastes time on Abel’s profligate drug and alcohol addiction that would’ve been better off handed over toBarry Keoghan, who plays Abel’s best friend and manager for a shockingly low amount of screen time. Shults is adept at relating mood through his work, but his reliance on kaleidoscopic transitions overflows here as well. And yet, you might excuse that auteur’s reflex if the film hadn’t cleared a runway for Anima to play armchair critic and offer up her pointed analysis of the Weeknd’s hit songs. Suffice to say, those scenes are more torturous than the actual torture that takes place in the foreground.The album-cum-feature film is a twofer that has been tried before. But Tomorrow breaks from the tradition that Purple Rain andThe Wallestablished. Ultimately, it’s little more than an emo rocker imagining what it would be like if he turned to his unhinged stalker for therapy – and thinking that makes him more evolved than the cavalier sonic rebels of yore. A well-constructed film could have really underscored the irony in that. But Tomorrow is too murky, meandering and self-indulgent an inside joke for audiences to remember it for more than its smirking moments. In time the Weeknd may come to regret this too, a missed opportunity.Hurry Up Tomorrow is out in US and UK cinemas on 16 MayExplore more on these topicsThrillersThe WeekndBarry KeoghanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, they sat on their parents’ knees or in their parents’ arms, waving American flags. Many of them seemed confused about what, exactly, was even happening.But these kids were in the midst of making history: their families were among the first to take advantage ofDonald Trump’sFebruary executive order granting white South Africans refugee status in the United States, on the grounds that Afrikaner landowners – who make up just 7% of South Africa’s population yet, decades after the end of apartheid, control about half of its land – are facing persecution. While the doors to the US refugee program have been slammed shut to virtually everyone else,these Afrikaners showed up in the US earlier this week, their refugee status promising a path to US citizenship.Days later, theTrump administrationtook a far narrower view of who deserves access to the American polity. On Thursday morning, a lawyer for the Trump administrationargued in front of the US supreme courtthat the 14th amendment does not guarantee citizenship to the American-born children of “illegal aliens” – a view contradicted by more than a century of legal precedent.This split screen raises a vital question: is theTrump administrationreally interested in helping children and families flourish – or only the “right” families?Over the last several months, the Trump administration’s policies on immigration, families, and children have been pockmarked by all kinds of contradictions. Theadministration is reportedly considering numerous policies toconvince people to have more children, such as “baby bonuses” of $5,000 or medals for mothers who have six or more kids. The Department of Transportation has issued a memo directing the agency to “give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average”. And JD Vance has proclaimed: “I want more babies in the United States of America.”These moves are, in part, fueled by the growingpower of the pronatalism movement, which believes that the declining birthrate in the US is an existential threat to its workforce and its future.Why, then, does the government want to exclude anestimated 150,000 babiesborn every year?“It’s hard to look at any of these policies and not believe that they’re created for the purpose of satisfying a political base that was promised some sort of notions of recreating a nostalgia for a white Christian nationalist nation,” said P Deep Gulasekaram, a professor of immigration law at the University of Colorado Law School.If the fate of the US workforce is really of concern,experts sayimmigration could help grow it – but the Trump administration has taken a hardline stance against immigrants from the Global South and their children. The administration has not only reportedly turned the refugee agency responsible for caring for children who arrive in the US aloneinto an arm of Ice, but also slashedfundingfor legal representation of children in immigration proceedings. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are trying to block parents who lack Social Security Numbers – such as undocumented people – frombenefiting from the child tax credit, even in cases where their children are US citizens.The Trump administration has also unveiled new screening protocols that make it far more difficult for undocumented people to “sponsor”, or take custody of, children who enter the US alone. Just last week, the National Center for Youth Law and the legal advocacy group Democracy Forward sued the Trump administration over the changes, which they say have forced kids to languish in government custody. Between December 2024 and March 2025, kids went from spending an average of two months in government custody tospending an average of six.“This administration has compromised the basic health and safety of immigrant children in egregious ways,” Neha Desai, managing director of children’s human rights and dignity at the National Center for Youth Law, said in an email.In March, KFF, a charity that conducts health policy research,conducted focus groupsof Hispanic adults who are undocumented or likely living with someone who is undocumented. Many spoke of the effect that the Trump administration’s policies are having on their families and kids.“I have a six-year-old child. Honestly, I’m afraid to take him to the park, and he asks me, ‘Mom, why don’t we go to the park?’” one 49-year-old Costa Rican immigrant woman told KFF. “How do I tell him? I’m scared.”“Even the children worry. ‘Mom, did you get home safely?’ They’re already thinking that something is going to happen to us on the street,” added a 54-year-old Colombian immigrant woman. “So that also makes me very nervous, knowing that there might come a time when they could be left here alone.”The supreme court arguments on Thursday centered not on the constitutionality of birthright citizenship, but on the legality of lower court orders in the case. Still, some ofthe justices expressed concerns about what the casecould mean for children.Eliminating birthright citizenship, Justice Elena Kagan suggested, could render children stateless. The high court needed a way to act fast,she said.If the justices believe that a court order is wrong, she asked, “why should we permit those countless others to be subject to what we think is an unlawful executive action?”Both the historical and legal record make clear thatthe 14th Amendment encapsulates birthright citizenship, Gulasekaram said. But, he said, predicting the supreme court’s moves is a “fool’s errand”.“There’s really no way of getting around the the conclusion that this is a call to some form of racial threat and racial solidarity as a way of shoring up support from a particular part of the of the of the Trump base,” Gulasekaram said. “Citizenship and the acquisition of citizenship has always been racially motivated in the United States.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS immigrationParents and parentingChildcareSouth AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

He embraces Leonardo DiCaprio, turns to the mic and lets fly: celebrating the event as a haven for art, democratic, inclusive and therefore a threat to autocrats and fascists. His speech is fiery and combative, but the adoring response leaves him shaken: he has to blink and regroup. At one point, I think, he might have even welled up. “Yeah, I got sentimental,” he admits the next morning. “How could I not be?”We’re upstairs at the Cannes Palais desFestivals, with the windows thrown open and sunlight on the walls. The hosts rush to provide him with a hot cup of coffee and then – when he leaves that untouched – swoop back to furnish him with another. His voice is still hoarse from the night before and risks being drowned out by the cheering masses outside. Tom Cruise, it transpires, has just appeared on the terrace. “Different type of actor,” De Niro says ruefully. “Mission: Impossible, that’s a franchise. But I understand that. I’ve done franchises myself.”Robert De Niro attacks Trump in Cannes speech: ‘This isn’t just America’s problem’Read moreThe man’s bulging CV bears him out. He’s been in Meet the Parents and its sequels, and Analyze This and That. You might say The Godfather Part II is part of a franchise of sorts. And yet when we think of De Niro’s key roles, we’re more likely to picture himbehind a taxi-cab wheel, orwielding a baseball batas bullish Al Capone, or bounding on stage aswheedling Rupert Pupkin. These, one assumes, are the roles that Cannes loves him for, and his relationship with the festival is now in its sixth decade. De Niro has starred in two Palme d’Or winners (1976’s Taxi Driver and 1986’s The Mission) and was last at the festival withKillers of the Flower Moontwo years ago. But he’s now made so many movies that they all start to blur. “Midnight Run,” he says vaguely. “That was a fun one to make.”Cannes, he explains, is especially important at the moment. The situation in the US is so parlous, it feels like an overseas antidote, a return to core principles. The man hatesDonald Trumpand mourns the America he once knew. He says: “We have to stop what’s going on, it’s insane. We can’t have apathy and silence. You have to speak up and risk being harassed.”View image in fullscreenDe Niro as Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyFor years he has beenone of Trump’s most vocal critics. Quite likely he risks some level of harassment himself. De Niro is a giant, rich as Midas (estimated wealth: upwards of $500m) and therefore should be well insulated. Except that Trump is vindictive and likes whipping up his supporters. So he’d be forgiven for occasionally fearing for his own safety.“Yeah, you always think about it, of course,” he says. “But I’m too old for all that. The man is a bully and you can’t let bullies win. If a bully comes for your lunch money on Monday, he’s going to ask for more on Tuesday. You have to stand up. And I wouldn’t want to look at myself if I didn’t.” He frowns. “I look at people like [secretary of state Marco] Rubio. I see him sitting by when they [Trump and JD Vance] beat up Zelenskyy, after all the times that he has defended Ukraine in the past. And I think, what the hell does he tell his kids about that? It won’t be forgotten,” he says grimly. “Historically, this will not be forgotten.”Robert De Niro: ‘I’d like to punch Donald Trump in the face’GuardianAs it happens, he and I lastspoke only recently and the interview hit the buffers. De Niro was promoting a Netflix series and journalists were forbidden from asking any “political questions”. He remembers the encounter and readily shrugs it off. But the situation is complex and requires careful handling. He understands the concerns of the big studios back home.Most people in the industry share his views, he suspects. Whether they choose to speak out is a whole other matter. “So I don’t think it’s true that the industry isn’t behind me. But they’re part of a big business. They have to worry about the wrath of Trump and make their decisions on that basis. Do I succumb or do I say no? There are some universities that have already said no. There are some legal firms that have said no. And that’s important because it inspires other people. It gives people strength and inspires them to fight.”View image in fullscreenLeonardo DiCaprio presenting De Niro with his honorary Palme d’Or.Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/ReutersThe way he sees it, this form of dogged, decent resistance predates Trump. Eventually, God willing, it might prove his undoing. “Because that’s what America is all about. Look at the westerns – it’s all right there. The bad guys come into town and take over and what does the sheriff do? He stands up. That’s in all our movies.”The honorary Palme d’Or is a rarity at the festival. It’s a lifetime achievement award in all but name; an excuse for him to sit back and take stock and bask in his own greatness. But this notion alarms and he brushes it to one side. “I still don’t see myself as great,” he scoffs. “When you go home and talk to your significant other, believe me, you’re not great.”He had wanted to act since the age of 10, he explains. Probably it’s all he ever wanted to do. He remembers going with his dad to a 42nd Street cinema to watch a Jean Cocteau movie, probably La Belle et la Bête (Beauty and the Beast, 1946), and having the sense of the world opening up all around. His dad was an artist and his mother was, too, but he needed to find his own mode of expression. So he immersed himself in his roles to the point where he became unrecognisable, flitting like a chameleon from one film to the next while keeping his true self tightly under wraps. “With every other actor, I know what they’d be like in real life,” Billy Bob Thornton once said. “But with Bob De Niro I have absolutely no idea.”View image in fullscreenWith Charles Grodin in Midnight Run.Photograph: Universal Pictures/AllstarThe cover of the Cannes daily programme shows him in the role of Taxi Driver’s Travis Bickle. It’s a blast from the past: he’s skinny, mohawked and bare-chested. The actor dutifully chuckles when I hold up the image, but it also seems to leave him just a little nonplussed. He turns 82 in August, deep into the third act of his life. He could be peering at a photo of a dead distant cousin.It’s funny getting old, De Niro says. It’s a whole new adventure and takes some getting used to. “Things change, that’s for sure. If you’re walking down a couple of stairs you get people coming to help you. I’ve realised now I’m older that people look at me a little different. But I’m old, it could be worse. I feel pretty good. I’m in control of myself physically. I hope that can last for ever.” He shrugs and half smiles. “But I know that it won’t.”Explore more on these topicsRobert De NiroCannes film festivalDonald TrumpFestivalsTaxi DriverKillers of the Flower MoonThe Godfather IIinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The movie takes its cue from the horrifying real-life cases of gilets-jaunes protesters in France’s 2019 demonstrations who suffered near fatal injuries due tothe police’s trigger-happy use of the LBD gun: thelanceur de balle de défenseor “flash ball” gun which (deafeningly) fires vicious rubber bullets.Stéphanie, played by Léa Drucker, is a conscientious police officer in the IGPN, the Inspection Générale de la Police Nationale, effectively the Internal Affairs bureau, investigating horrific head injuries suffered by a teen protester, which could only be caused by the cops’ flash-ball weapons. She is divorced from a cop, Jérémy (Stanislas Merhar) who along with his new girlfriend – also in the police – is gloweringly resentful of what he sees as her bureau’s disloyal undermining of the police, and the way she is questioning the corners they (supposedly) have to cut to keep France safe, especially after theBataclan attacks.Stéphanie’s life becomes even more complicated when she realises that the injured boy is from her provincial homevtown, Saint-Dizier – exactly the kind of place where people feel left behind by the Macron elite – and when she goes back there to visit her mum, she is in danger of running into the boy’s own stricken mother (Sandra Colombo). The secret connection energises Stéphanie, she gets tougher and more persistent in her quest to find the guilty cop and put him away – but the awful truth is that now she is cutting her own corners and might get investigated herself.The film is on its most solid ground when it painstakingly – almost in the narrative equivalent of real time – takes us through the process of locating the cop culprits by finding CCTV footage from the site of the attack on the teenagers and then agonisingly slowly finding other videos from cameras nearby, tracking the culprits’ route until the offending officers can be identified. This succession of coolly forensic images are juxtaposed with the kind of real smartphone demo footage that is now commonplace and which gets errant police officers prosecuted.Stéphanie and her colleagues are convinced that cameras like this might be found in a luxury hotel whose rear entrance faces the crime scene – and this is to bring her into contact with a possible eyewitness: a hotel room cleaner, Alicia, played by Guslagie Malaga (best known for Alice Diop’s courtroom drama Saint Omer). Moll gives Stéphanie a rather stagey and melodramatic one-on-one scene with Alicia as she begs her to help, but Alicia says that putting her head over the parapet to criticise the cops will only get her into trouble – and if the injured teen wasn’t white, Stéphanie and her colleagues wouldn’t care anyway. It’s a bit overwrought and redundant, especially as Alicia’s evidence is in fact a smartphone video that can be simply made available to the police without Alicia needing to go on the record at all.In the end, the issue of Stéphanie’s tribal conflicts of loyalty – between Paris and small town, between the cops and their liberal critics – doesn’t lead anywhere very challenging, and this film is nowhere near as complex as, say, Moll’s award-winning psychological drama Harry, He’s Here to Help from 2000, a big Cannes success in its day, but it’s high-minded, valuable work.Dossier 137 screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsCrime filmsGilets jaunes protestsFranceCannes film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

She offers the sage life advice to “say yes to every opportunity because you never know what it will lead to. Have a positive mental attitude and have everything in moderation.” When she was born in 1909, the average life expectancy of a British female was 52 years – becoming a centenarian was a remote prospect.Today, according to the United Nations, centenarians are the fastest growing age group. By 1950, there were an estimated 14,000 whilst today there are nearly 750,000, projected to reach nearly 4 million by 2054. Medical advances, increases in the standard of living and improvements in public health have transformed the human condition. The American Academy of Actuaries estimates that one in six Americans born today will live to be 100. That is about the same as in the UK, where the Office for National Statistics suggests that the majority of babies can expect to live into their early 90s.Does the prospect of living that long excite you, or is it a source of dread? Do you look forward to decades of extra time or does living to 100 sound more like a threat? Plainly, there are reasons why we worry about living for so long. What’s the point of living beyond 80 if your savings have run out, the care homes are full, and you end up feeling lonely, bored and irrelevant?For most of human history, such fears were irrelevant. Only a minority could expect to become old. Now, with global life expectancy exceeding 70 years, it is a majority. Just as we debate adapting and adjusting to AI and the climate crisis, we need similar conversations regarding our newly extended length of life. Having got the majority to live to be old, we now have to focus on changing how we age to make life not just longer but healthier, productive and engaged for longer. Few things are as important for us individually and collectively.Today, there is too large a gap between average lifespan and healthspan. The number of years we are likely to live has increased more than the number of years we are likely to remain healthy. Reducing this gap is critical for seizing the advantages of longer lives.The good news is that there is much you can do. About 80% of how we age is driven by our behaviours and environment. It may sound tiresomely familiar, but there’s no substitute for eating and sleeping well, exercising more and following your doctor’s advice. While that advice is being given a scientific upgrade, what has really changed is your incentive to follow it now you can expect to become old.Do we ever stop feeling anxious, angry or sad about relationships? Not if my older friends are any guide | Emma BeddingtonRead moreLuckily though, we don’t have to rely solely on self-discipline.Ageingwell is becoming an industry, and we can expect support from technological and scientific progress and shifts in government policy. Currently it is the extreme longevity-inspired lifestyles of billionaires that grab the headlines, along with a long wake of over-promoted but under-tested supplements and treatments. But your own future is more likely to be impacted by broad-based shifts in our health system.Currently these systems focus on intervening when a disease becomes so noticeable that it adversely affects your health. When it comes to ageing-related illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or dementia, that is a recipe for keeping us alive but not necessarily healthier for longer.Instead, the focus needs to be on exploiting the potential of modern prevention techniques, utilising the power of AI and big data. Whether it’s tracking your genetics to identify the diseases you are most at risk from; monitoring changes in your body’s biomarkers for early signs of disease; or accelerating drug innovation and repurposing, future innovations await.Another stride forward will arise with further progress in understanding the biology of ageing – the processes that slowly diminish the physical components of our bodies. The prize is huge because slowing these down would substantially reduce the gap between healthspan and lifespan.The mere notion of treatments that could delay ageing-related diseases is revealing of how humanity is entering a radical new era. We tend to think of ageing as “natural” and immutable, but that reflects our relatively recent progress in reducing the threat from diseases such as smallpox, cholera, tuberculosis and plague. For most of history, these diseases were considered “natural” and were the main reason so few lived into old age. That explains why, in the 17th century, Montaigne considered dying of old age a “rare death” and “less natural than the others”. Now that the main cause of death and illness is ageing-related diseases, scientific attention is turning to tackle this next frontier.The result is increasing resources invested in “geroscience”. Throughout history, there have always been those who claim to have discovered the secret of youth, but slowly the topic is being drawn into the mainstream scientific community. Progress is also being made in the lab such that manipulating the age of cells and extending the lives of an increasing range of animals is now routine.But there is another problem we have to tackle – how to pay for those extra years?None of this implies you’ll be popping magic anti-ageing pills anytime soon, and it certainly doesn’t mean you can start dreaming of immortality. What it does mean, though, is that the younger you are, the more likely it is that you will benefit from treatments that help you age better. Exactly how far that takes us will depend upon the relative strength of human ingenuity and human biology, but it opens up a future which changes in fundamental ways what a human life looks like.But there is another problem we have to tackle – how to pay for those extra years? If more of us live until 100, state pensions in their current form will collapse. Absent an AI-induced surge in productivity, living longer requires working longer if we are to maintain our standard of living. That is why governments worldwide are increasing retirement age. Once more we are back to the unpalatable consequences of living for longer.But seizing the advantages of a longer life needs more profound adaptation than simply raising the retirement age. We need changes that help us work for longer, not just force us to do so.We need to create a new, more flexible structure of work and leisure. Career shifts and transitions will need to become more frequent as we change jobs and occupations to prolong our working life, take time out to reskill or improve our health, care for family, and shift between full-time, part-time or no-time work.What do young people really think about us oldies? I asked a few | Adrian ChilesRead moreThis restructuring of the life course reveals that the true benefit of longer lives is more time and being able to structure the life course differently. We tend to think of longer lives as bringing time at the end of life, but the healthier we make those additional years, the more time we have over our whole lives. The 20th century saw growing life expectancy leading to more years of leisure after retirement. The longer careers of the 21st century will be about taking more of that leisure this side of retirement.This leads us to perhaps the hardest change of all: seeing a longer life as an opportunity and overcoming deeply engrained ageist assumptions. Currently, we underestimate the capacity of older people and the promise of our own later years.David Bowie, a man who knew a thing or two about transitions, described ageing as “an extraordinary process whereby you become the person you always should have been”. If we can make life not just longer, but healthier, productive and engaged for longer, what’s not to like?For most of human history, only a minority of the young and middle-aged became old. The result is that we underinvest in our later years and fail to provide the required support that a long healthy, productive and engaged life requires. Given how many of us alive can expect to become 80, have a shot at 90, and might even make it to 100, that is a problem which demands change.There is much to be done. The malleability of ageing shows up dramatically in growing health inequality. Changing how we age requires major shifts in social norms and institutions. But that is the thing about long lives: they witness much change. When Ethel Caterham was born, compulsory schooling finished at age 12, the concepts of teenagers and a mid-life crisis didn’t exist, women didn’t have the vote, and the United Kingdom had only just introduced a state pension age and the first vaccine against TB. The years ahead will see equally substantive shifts in how we live as we respond to longevity. Caterham didn’t expect to live to 100 and her life advice is insightful. But the centenarians of tomorrow have to invest more in preparing for that future and go beyond just thinking positively. We need collectively to create a longevity society.The Longevity Imperative by Andrew J. Scott (John Murray Press, £12.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

My son was failed in similar ways, but for the brilliance of some medical staff who refuse to believe a stroke is the endBySheila HaleThu 15 May 2025 00.00 EDTShareOn the night before the accident, John and I and our son Jay, who was then 26, lingered in the garden drinking wine and enjoying the mid-summer scent of jasmine and lilies. We talked about the Manet exhibition we had just seen at the National Gallery. We probably talked about how the end of the cold war might affect the chances of Bill Clinton winning the presidential election against George HW Bush in November. I know what John thought about that. I only wish I could recall his words.The next morning, 30 July 1992, John got up before me as he always did. In the kitchen I found the contents of the dishwasher – knives, forks, spoons, plates, mugs – jumbled together on the table. This was odd because unloading the dishwasher was the one domestic ritual he willingly performed. It would be years before I learned the reason. At the time I put it down to absent-mindedness. It was a month since he had delivered a book to the publisher and he was already preoccupied by the next one, about art in the European Renaissance. Before I had time to be annoyed, I heard a crash from his study at the top of the house. I ran upstairs and found him lying on the floor next to his desk. He looked up at me with the radiant, witless smile of a baby. And he said: “Da walls.”The ambulance took us to the local hospital where they said that my husband had had cerebral accident – a stroke. The cause was probably years of uncontrolled high blood pressure, about which no doctor had warned him. They said he needed rest and reassurance. Unfortunately, because of the so-called efficiency savings introduced by John Major’s government, there was a shortage of beds and of nurses in all London hospitals. I was so grateful when they found a bed for him in a geriatric ward later in the day that I didn’t at first notice how filthy it was and how hot. The floor was covered in urine, blood and dust balls. (Later I brought in a mop to clean around John’s bed.) The plateglass window could not be opened: to prevent suicides, a passing nurse told me.It was a week before I managed to track down the doctor whose name was printed on a grimy card at the head of John’s bed. The doctor informed me that my husband’s case was hopeless. He would never walk again and must never be allowed to try to stand because the hospital insurance wouldn’t cover a fall. Physiotherapy, which the doctor considered “about as useful as peanut butter”, was out of the question.You learn fast in an emergency. John had had an ischaemic stroke, which is a blockage in one of the arteries that carries blood to the brain, resulting in the death of brain tissue. It was in his left brain, which controls the right limbs and, in most people, the processing of language. About 75% of people will survive a first stroke. But it is essential to get them up and standing as soon as possible, and paralysed limbs should be moved to prevent the muscles from seizing up permanently. Visiting family and friends were happy to help, moving John’s arms and legs while they sat with him.John greeted everyone with those two meaningless syllables,da walls.He also used the same sounds to ask them questions about themselves: “Walls? Da walls?” He chatted away in his usual sociable manner with his fellow patients, and even charmed the few overworked nurses. The rise and fall, the rhythms and pitch of his voice were so normal that those of us who knew him well understood at least the gist of what he was not saying.Since he could read, we assumed he could also write; he was after alla writer.We gave him a piece of paper and a ballpoint pen, which he seized in his good left hand, and, on the top left corner of the page he wrote the letter “f” and then gave up. John had what is called expressive aphasia. Although he could tell that we didn’t understand him, it felt to him as though he was translating his thoughts as effectively and comprehensibly as ever into words. I was only one of the many people who had a recurring dream that John had suddenly started to talk normally. As one friend said, it was as if he were under a magic spell and, like all magic spells, it would be lifted as suddenly as it came on.The neurologists and clinicians who specialise in stroke talk a lot about pathways. There are the pathways of neurons and synapses that are interrupted by a clot or haemorrhage, pathways from the onset of symptoms to hospital. Although the consequences of a stroke do not necessarily get worse over time, the pathway to recovery is problematic, as I was to discover. My own pathway towards an understanding of what stroke is and does, and how it can be addressed, began in that unclean geriatric ward where the doctor condemned his stroke patients to live diminished lives.My concern at the time was to escape from that hospital to a place that would help my husband. The Wolfson neurorehabilitation centre at Atkinson Morley hospital in Wimbledon, which had an excellent reputation for stroke rehabilitation, did not admit patients over 65 on the NHS. They would, however, accept John privately – at a price that would have meant selling our house. With some difficulty, I found a bed in a hospital at the other end of London. It was at least clean. And although there was no physiotherapy available, the nurses, immediately on John’s arrival, got him up on his feet and limping, with their support, up and down the ward. All too soon they informed me that they would have to discharge him.Then I found that John’s service in the second world war entitled him to a place in the Royal Star & Garter for Disabled Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen. A large and handsome building, overlooking the Thames from the brow of Richmond Hill, it had been purpose built for the care and rehabilitation of servicemen and women disabled in the first world war. (It has now, perhaps inevitably, been converted into luxury flats.) It was staffed by neurophysiotherapists, occupational therapists and a speech therapist. The physios worked on restoring not just movement of the affected limbs but movement that was as normal as possible. The physios walked him through parallel bars, guiding his bad leg into a correct position with their hands, running their hands up his spine to remind him to stand up straight. They got him to put his full weight on one leg while swinging the other. They made him do squats, holding his limp arm stretched forward with his good one.View image in fullscreenSheila and John Hale.Photograph: Sheila HaleWhen John came home at Easter after six months of intensive physiotherapy, he was able to dress himself and care for his personal needs. He was still limping but he was so much stronger that he walked around the house without a stick and climbed the stairs to his study. He was, however, liable to trip and fall because he had no control over his right foot. Then I heard, only by chance, that a rigid brace fitted on his foot underneath the shoe would solve that problem. Now he began to take himself on ever longer walks around the neighbourhood, chatting in those meaningless syllables with the neighbours, making new friends in the pub. We travelled, to Italy and farther afield.Six months after the stroke, John’s vocabulary had not changed, and I was determined to find out how he might recover his use of language. The speech therapist at the Star & Garter had quickly given up on John: “You will never again have a conversation with your husband.” Her patronising pronouncement filled me with an energising rage that set me on a new pathway: to find out as much as I could about aphasia, and to prove her wrong about John’s case. My instinct as a journalist was to seek out expert specialists in the field; and I was not surprised to discover that the more experienced they were, the less likely they were to make predictions about John’s, or anyone else’s, chances of recovery. The people who know most about the way the brain works know that it is terra incognita.View image in fullscreenJohn Hale in Venice, February 1992.Photograph: Sarah QuillI found two speech therapists, Jane Marshall and Eirian Jones. Watching them work with John taught me so much about language, and what the loss of it tells us about normal language, that I began to plan a book about the condition (which is better known as dysphasia, rather than aphasia, because it is rare that all the elements of language are lost). I will mention here only one of Jones’s many discoveries about John’s particular case because it explains the mystery of the way he unloaded the dishwasher on the morning of his stroke. Jones’s theory was that John had lost the ability to “disambiguate” the various different contents of the dishwasher. And in the same way he could no longer unravel the elements of a sentence. So although John could write individual words, matching the correct word to a picture or filling in the missing word in a story, he had, as Jones put it, no idea of what a sentence was.On 13 September 1998, six years after the stroke, there was a stupendous breakthrough. John indicated to me that he wanted to write a thank you note to a friend who had given us lunch in his office. He got out one of his correspondence cards headed Professor Sir John Hale, and on it he wrote: “Dear David”. I said, Fine, now what is the expression of gratitude you need? John wrote: “Thanks you for lunch.” I said: Do you want to say where? John wrote: “in your office”. When? “On Thursday.” Then he wrote without prompting: “I have”. And I stupidly said, now you need either a verb or a noun. But he wrote “certainly” and laughed and finished the letter by himself: “been in luck! Yours ever, John.”I telephoned Eirian with the news. She was pleased but reminded me that it wasn’t quite the breakthrough I had initially thought – I had, in fact, guided John.I went to the US to research my book on dysphasia. Back home I told John about all the people I had interviewed, one of them being Alfonso Caramazza, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at Harvard. On 9 August 1999, I went out shopping. When I returned I found on John’s desk a scrap of paper on which he had written:Dear Caramagne,I will thanks you for agreeing to advice Sheila to carre on.With best,John HaleNext to the draft was one of his correspondence cards on which he had written (note the style, one professor to another):Dear Caramazza,I will thank you for agreeing to advise Sheila to carry on.With best,John HaleNobody was with him. Nobody prompted or guided him or even suggested he write to Caramazza, about whom I hadn’t spoken for over a month.I will never know how much more John would have written, because on the morning of 12 August he died peacefully in his sleep next to me in bed.My book, The Man Who Lost His Language, was published in 2003. For the third edition in 2006, the publisher asked for a new chapter about any recent changes in stroke care. All my contacts led me straight to one man: Dr Tony Rudd, consultant stroke physician at St Thomas’ hospital in central London. Rudd was better known in medical and government circles as “Dr Stroke” for his tireless campaigning to get the message across that stroke, like heart attack, is both a medical emergency and a treatable illness.I asked him what changes he had seen in the 14 years since John’s stroke. “There has been more progress with stroke than with any other illness,” he said. “But we started from nothing. And there are still black holes.” The failure to treat stroke properly from day one continued to be a massive waste of public money. Without treatment, the survivors will be a burden on the NHS and the welfare budget. It is not only they who will remain helpless and unproductive. Their carers, usually unpaid younger relatives, will also be unable to work.But lassitude was giving way to excitement with the development of techniques which restore the flow of blood to the brain (known as reperfusion), in time to limit much of the damage caused by ischaemic stroke. Rudd had begun a programme of injecting suitable patients with a clot-busting drug. The technique, thrombolysis, is by no means suitable for every stroke. And because brain cells die in their millions during a stroke, treatment should be delivered as soon as possible, preferably within four hours. Thrombolysis was first used in the UK in the 1990s. Rudd’s hospital was the first that was equipped to deliver it to all suitable patients.A cheerful young Scottish nurse told me that whereas stroke used to be “the dead end of nursing”, the opportunity to give quality care to people who might otherwise have died or been permanently disabled was so rewarding that she had decided to devote her career to caring for stroke patients.I went away that day daring to hope that stroke treatment, which was underserved by an underfunded, over-bureaucratised health system, might receive the attention it deserved. In 2010, following recommendations by Lord Ara Darzi, eight specialised services for stroke treatment, known as Hyper Acute Stroke Units, were established across London. Six years later, St George’s hospital in Tooting, south London, was the first of them to perform thrombectomy, which mechanically removes clots too big to respond to clot-busting drugs. This continues to be the most effective procedure and allows almost half of those treated to return to their normal life within 90 days.At 11:10am on Sunday 21 November 2021 I had a telephone call from my daughter-in-law Amanda. My son Jay, who was then 55, had fallen out of bed earlier that morning. Amanda knew it was a stroke because Jay had inherited his father’s high blood pressure, along with his insouciance about his health. She rang 999 only to be told that there would be no ambulance for four hours. A kind neighbour who is, as it happened, a doctor drove them through red lights to the nearest stroke unit. Amanda was informed that Jay was not a suitable candidate for reperfusion because the stroke had happened in his sleep and they couldn’t therefore determine whether too much time had elapsed for treatment to be effective. This was incorrect. Since Jay went to sleep at 11pm and reached the unit by 4:30am he was in good time. No doubt the hospital was overwhelmed by Covid. What happened afterwards, however, was less forgivable; nor, alas, is it an isolated case.View image in fullscreenJay Hale.Photograph: Sheila HaleJay was given a bed in a dedicated stroke ward. It was immaculately clean. (The lesson of the MRSA epidemics in dirty wards had been learned.) His was a right-brain stroke paralysing his left arm and leg and affecting his left field of vision, but sparing his language. The consultants who visited him in the ward predicted, presumably on the evidence of a brain scan, that he was unlikely to walk again. Although Jay was fully conscious and able to speak normally, the consultants also informed him that he would never work again. He must under no circumstances be permitted to stand up without the help of physiotherapists, who were scarce and clocked off at 4pm. The hospital insurance wouldn’t cover a fall and private physiotherapy was not permitted.Without the support of his family and many friends Jay might well have given in to the despair that afflicts so many stroke survivors. He couldn’t believe what had happened to him. But he was also determined to prove that the doctors were mistaken.Unlike his father all those years ago, Jay was allowed small doses of physio and occupational therapy every now and then. When they had time, the physios put him on a reclining static bicycle which he enjoyed because he had always been a keen cyclist, and which encouraged him to move the bad leg by pumping with the good one. After a few weeks, he charmed two of the physios into helping him to stand up and take a step, then two steps, then walk the length of the ward.When Jay was discharged after four months in hospital he mostly used a wheelchair, although he was able to walk around the house with a four-legged stick. He had been warned by the hospital that he must never, ever rely on a single stick.Amanda enrolled him in a private rehabilitation practice in west London run by a renowned physiotherapist named Richard Sealy. Sealy asked Jay what he wanted most to achieve, and when Jay said he wanted to walk without a stick Sealy said: “Well then do it.” Jay took a few steps. In 25 years of practice Sealey has treated 4,000 patients, including the journalist Andrew Marr after his stroke. Over the next 18 months, I watched this charming and dedicated man and his team of neurophysios and occupational therapists working with Jay to reconnect the pathways between the motor cortex of his right brain with his left leg and arm.First, they got him to walk chest forward and head up – with, and then without, a stick. They tried to play football as a way of encouraging an instinct to kick. He tried to put weight and balance on his bad leg and kicking with the good one; or, and this was much harder, balance on the good leg and kick with the bad one. He did one-legged squats. He used a pilates reformer and walked on a treadmill. They timed him as he walked as fast as he could around the building, each time beating his previous record. In an attempt to wake up his left hand and arm they clasped the hand around his precious phone, hoping to trigger the instinctive grasp to stop it dropping. They tried video games played with his left hand.By no means everybody could afford Sealy’s fees (£110 for 45 minutes). Sealy regrets leaving the NHS, where he was trained and which he says still provides the best training for physiotherapists in the world. If there is a shortage of neurotherapists in the NHS, he said, the reason they leave is less about pay than about the long hours of intensive therapy they are not allowed to provide.I remain haunted by the people who miss out on precious rehab. Each one of1.3 million stroke survivorsin the UK has a story. Last year there were111,137 stroke admissions to NHS hospitals, a rise of 28% in 10 years, and thisfigure is expected to risedramatically. Meanwhile, 39% of stroke patients are abandoned by the NHS after six months. A third remain too disabled to work, many because they believed, or had no choice but to believe, the doctors who wrote off their chances of recovery. The population of stroke survivors is as big as that of a large city, and it’s getting bigger. More than half are left with a disability and about a third are unable to live independently.Nor, as many young people like to imagine, is stroke a faraway illness that happens in the never-never land of old age. A quarter of people who experience strokes are under the age of 65. And in the past 10 years there has been a 55% increase in strokes among people, like my son Jay, in their 50s, which is the highest increase among any age group. The reasons may be bad diet – ultra processed food and especially sugary drinks, which are as dangerous as smoking – and uncontrolled blood pressure. The poorest members of society suffer strokes seven years earlier than the better off. Some are small strokes. They may recover spontaneously in a few weeks but even small strokes may be warnings of worse to come. Many will have lost the use of an arm and a leg, a field of vision, the production or comprehension of language. They might suffer from apraxia, an inability to sequence movements in the order it requires to perform everyday tasks. Some will find it difficult to recognise what they see, touch, hear or taste, an impairment of sensory processing known as agnosia. Visual agnosia was made famous by Oliver Sacks in his classic bookThe Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. Others will suffer from anosognosia, a denial of their own symptoms. Every stroke is different and every brain has been conditioned by a unique set of experiences.'Is anybody in there?' Life on the inside as a locked-in patientRead moreThere is no humane sense in withholding the treatments that would allow them to return to independent lives. For those who need an economic justification, a 10-year study published in 2016 and led by Prof Lynne Turner-Stokes at King’s College hospital has demonstrated that intensive therapy for all neurological illnesses saves the cost of long term care and improves the rate of productivity. This is why the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice) now recommends a minimum of three hours of intensive therapy at least five days a week. Yet at present, most NHS stroke units provide two or three hours of physiotherapy a week, with a six-month time-limit. Nick Ward, consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queen Square, London, an ardent defender of rehabilitation after stroke, described this as “a homeopathic dose, not worth the cost”.Why does the UK waste lives and taxpayers’ money by condemning stroke survivors to dependent, unproductive lives? Three and a half years after his stroke, my son is a living example of what can be achieved by physiotherapy, and why it is so important that more people have access to it. The hole in his brain is much bigger than it would have been if he had been treated on arrival at the stroke unit, instead of being told he was not eligible. Nevertheless, thanks to intensive neurophysiotherapy, Jay now climbs up and down two flights of stairs to their bedroom at the top of the house. He dresses and washes himself, walks around the house without a stick, around London with only a single stick, gets on and off buses and trains. He has returned to teaching mathematics, five days a week, at the school where he worked before the stroke. He swims at the local gym, where he has taught the personal trainer some of the techniques of neurophysiotherapy. Not only does he lead an independent and productive life, he is still, three and a half years post-stroke, getting better.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readStrokePhysiotherapistsNeuroscienceHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Do you really need to ask?Arwa MahdawiThe birthday of Donald Trump’s granddaughter has been forced upon my consciousness because an awful lot of people are being weird about itThu 15 May 2025 10.51 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 12.42 EDTShareKai Trump, the president’s granddaughter and the eldest ofDonald TrumpJr’s five children, has just turned 18. To be clear, I do not have a list of Trump family birthdays on my fridge. But it has been forced upon my consciousness because an awful lot of people in Trumpworld are being weird about it.Fox News, for example, decided to post both anInstagrammessage (which got more than 87,000 likes) and atweetwishing Kai a very happy 18th birthday. Which is a little odd considering that the high school student is not a public figure. Kai, who has a large social media following, did briefly speak at the Republican national convention last year and has posted support for her grandfather, but that doesn’t seem to justify a birthday announcement by a major media network.Especially, by the way, asFox Newsdoesn’t appear to have been so excited about Barron Trump when he turned 18. (Although it did put up an Instagram post on Barron’s 19th birthday, with a quote from Donald calling him a “a very smart guy”.) It’s almost – and bear with me here – as if they have some sort of weird interest in the fact that a teenage girl has turned 18.Am I accusing the folk at Fox News of being a bunch of creeps? Absolutely not! I’d never do that. Although if you look at the reactions to the Fox News posts or the comments attached to a New York Post Page Six piece about Kai’s birthday, there are plenty of people out there who should be on some sort of watchlist or registry. Particularly the people who have read far too much into the fact that Kairecently posted a TikTok videoof her and three friends dancing to Promiscuous by Nelly Furtado and Timbaland with the caption: “last day being 17″.Maga also seems to adopt different values, depending on what sort of family they’re looking atWhile things have moved on somewhat, there’s also a very depressing history of media figures counting down to young girls turning the age of consent. Look at British singer Charlotte Church, who got a record deal as an opera singer when she was just 12. There was amedia frenzyin 2002 when she turned 16 (the age of consent in England). On her birthday, Chris Moyles, a BBC radio DJ who was 28 at the time, publicly announced he wanted to“lead her through the forest of sexuality now she had reached 16”. Making this disgusting comment didn’t ruin Moyles’s career, by the way. Just like 38-year-old Jerry Seinfeld datinga 17-year-old high schoolerhasn’t hurt the billionaire comedian’s career at all either.Harry Potter star Emma Watson has also talked about being sexualized by the media when she was a teenager.Watson has saidthe paparazzi even took photos up her skirt, and published them in an English tabloid, the moment she turned 18 and it was “legal”.It was asimilar storywith twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who have been on TV since they were tiny. In 2004 numerous websites started counting down to their 18th birthday including the “Olsen Twin Jailbait Countdown Clock” run by radio shock jocks Lex Staley and Terry Jaymes. The New York Post also crowed about the twins being “legal”.More recently, in 2018, a radio host called Patrick Connor called Olympic athlete Chloe Kim, then just 17 years old, a “little hot piece of ass”. Conner then referenced Wooderson, a character in the film Dazed and Confused who pursues high school girls. “Her 18th birthday is 23 April, and the countdown is on baby, ’cause I got my Wooderson going,” said Connor. “‘That’s what I like about them high school girls.’” In a sign that some progress has made when it comes to mainstream misogyny, Connor was forced to apologize for the remark and fired.Since we live in litigious times I would like to reiterate, once again, that while some people (not me!) have accused Fox News of being creepy about Kai, I’m sure they meant nothing sinister by their post. After all, unlike depraved liberals, the Maga crowd are an extremely wholesome bunch who live and die for family values.I will concede, however, that it is sometimes hard to wrap one’s head around the Maga definition of “family values”. The president, for example, is alegally defined sexual predatorwho has also been accused, by Miles Taylor, a staffer in Trump’s first administration, of sexualizing his oldest daughter Ivanka.In a bookpublished in 2023, Taylor writes: “[Trump] said he talked about Ivanka Trump’s breasts, her backside, and what it might be like to have sex with her, remarks that once led [former chief of staff] John Kelly to remind the president that Ivanka was his daughter.”Why is Trump so fixated on toys for little girls? | Moira DoneganRead moreFormer Fox News star Tucker Carlson also seems to have a strange definition of family values. I’m sorry to remind you of this if you’ve wiped it from your memory but last year Carlson made an extraordinary (even by Maga standards) speech at a Trump rally in which he likened the now president to an angry fatherspanking his daughter.“I’m not going to lie. It’s going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me,” Carlson said. “And you earned this. You’re getting a vigorous spanking because you’ve been a bad girl. You’re only going to get better when you take responsibility for what you did. It has to be this way.’” The crowd then erupted into chants of “Daddy Don”!Maga also seems to adopt different values, depending on what sort of family they’re looking at. Conservative influencers were vileabout Ella Emhoff, Kamala Harris’s stepdaughter, when Harris was running for president. Newsweek senior editor Josh Hammer wrote: “Doug Emhoff’s daughter is like something out of a horror film,” for example. Podcast hostBenny Johnsonalso called Emhoff and her father “creepy” for having their arms around each other in a video. The right seems eager to scrutinize the family of politicians when they don’t agree with their politics. Theywent on the warpath,however, when a former NBCUniversal executive joked about Barron being “fair game” (meaning that it was OK for the press to criticize him) when he turned 18.Anyway, happy birthday to Kai Trump. At 18 she is still very young – but it would seem like it’s the Maga adults who have the real growing up to do.Explore more on these topicsRepublicansOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsFox NewsWomencommentShareReuse this content"

Not so, says Kim Leadbeater and her campaigners. Some so-called switchers who abstained last time were always known as opponents. MPs who gave her bill a 55 majority on the first vote are standing firm, she says, as the debate returns to parliament on Friday.It’s a well worn tactic to pretend the tide is moving your way to sway any nervous MPs in wobbly seats. They should note the hefty majority of voters supporting the right to die for decades. British social attitudes firstpolled in 1983found 77% of people in favour, a number that has been solid ever since. Keir Starmer’sreiterated supporttoday may stiffen some of his MPs’ sinews.The religious lobby, powerful, well financed and secretive, puts up every objection except its main one: only God decides the time of our entrances and exits. But that doesn’t swing the public in an atheistic country where 53% of peoplehave no religion, believing in neither God nor life after death. Out of step with the changing views of the country, there are 26 bishops fighting for God when the bill is in the Lords.MPs need to turn up tomorrow instead of their usual return to constituencies on Fridays: staying to vote on a private member’s bill with no party whip requires devotion to the cause. They should think on this: what they do in parliament will mostly be forgotten, gone with the wind, but this fundamental freedom will be a lasting legacy. In the great reforming government of Harold Wilson, most MPs were preoccupied with balance of payments and devaluation crises, and theprices and incomes board’s struggles with inflation. Great liberalising monuments of that era were side-issue private members’ bills to many MPs then, though capital punishment and theatre censorship abolished, abortion legalised, and race, homosexuality and divorce laws reformed, made history. Blair’s government left civil partnerships and a ban on public smoking. (Same-sex marriage as an add-on from the Conservatives.) Another totem for current MPs will be decriminalising abortion, following a shocking increase in women prosecuted for self-administered abortions: the jury refused to convictNicola Packerlast week, after a brutally exposing case.This parliament looks ready to make assisted dying a good legacy: goodness knows it needs one.Scotland, Jersey and the Isle of Man all voted for it. The Royal College of GPs just voted by 61% to abandon its opposition and become neutral. (The BBC’s unofficial GP surveyshowed a splitwithin the profession.) The Royal College of Psychiatrists lobs innine last-minute objections, including one that frankly questions its rationality, warning “terminal illness is a risk factor for suicide”. Well, yes! That’s what it’s about! Its membership survey wasevenly split.Some 120 amendments are put up. Leadbeater has replaced the need for a judge’s signature with a stricter panel of experts, including a lawyer, social worker and psychiatrist, after two independent doctors attest a patient is sane and within six months of death, with 14 days to reconsider. Meg Hillier, always an anti, wants doctors gagged from mentioning assisted dying, creating a legal minefield to deter doctors from offering help. The amendment has been opposed by the BMA. My own mother, dying painfully of cancer despite the best palliative care, said wryly to her GP: “Where’s Harold Shipman when you want him?” He laughed kindly, but could do nothing more to ease her death, his every ampule counted: doctors fear being reported.The most unfair argument is the “slippery slope towards death on demand” that Shabana Mahmood warns against, though this bill has tougher safeguards than any of the jurisdictions allowing assisted dying: rules can’t “slide” without another act of parliament. Palliative care organisations, traditionally dominated by the religious, claim their services always prevent suffering: not so, as they must know. Right-to-die laws have catalysed better palliative care elsewhere, and following the assisted dying debate the governmentincreased fundingfor hospices.At political extremes,Diane Abbott and Edward Leigh writethat “the only adequate safeguard is to keep the current law unchanged”. But where are the safeguards against extreme suffering in death?Take the radically different experiences of death from motor neurone disease (MND) in two families I spoke to. Karen’s husband was a very fit postman in Devon when diagnosed. “We knew what was coming and he didn’t want to reach the stage of [rugby star]Rob Burrow, being carried about. He asked my permission to kill himself if it got too bad. I didn’t want that, but I understood.” He had reached the point where he couldn’t feed or bath himself when one evening he plunged headlong downstairs and died within days. She knows this was deliberate: “He had searched for ways to die.” But it was a terrible, painful death, utterly shocking for her and the family.Contrast that with Claire, whose 76-year-old brother in Australia also had MND, knowing his inevitable horrible end. Australia’s right-to-die law freed him to tell his family when to fly out from England, as he put everything in good order, arranged his funeral and wrote letters. By then he couldn’t speak. “It was a very good death,” Claire says, calm and peaceful, as she and her sister held his hand as the doctor gave him pentobarbital to swallow. That doctor gave evidence in the Commons about how well Australian law works.Denying everyone’s right to escape a torturing death is not the “safe” option. TheInescapable Truth, a report written by palliative care clinicians, reports, “Some will retch at the stench of their own body rotting. Some will vomit their own faeces. Some will suffocate, slowly, inexorably, over several days.” On any day their figures show an average of 17 people are dying these bad deaths: it could be you or me.Set these certain deaths, happening somewhere today, against the faint risk someone may choose to shorten their last few months of life to avoid being a burden on family or on the NHS. To me, these are perfectly good reasons. Many don’t want to leave families with miserable memories of their last months of suffering. But what I think or you think is beside the point. Everyone has an absolute right over their own body and its fate.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

White papers in future will have the tang of JB Priestley and farm subsidies the fizz of Jilly Cooper.Yes Minister’s Sir Humphrey Appleby will be a Master of Foxhounds. Like all Sir Keir Starmer’s actions just now, it should be worth a few votes.First, there is nothing new in the plan. Every government makes these token gestures of bureaucratic dispersal. Starmer is merely scaling back Rishi Sunak’s plan as chancellor in 2020, when he proposedmoving 22,000 civil servantsout of London by 2030. He even proposed that400 of his own Treasury staffwould move to Darlington, where a “hub” would be built to console them. They were parodied as exiles to some distant corner of empire, wondering what they had done wrong.There was no rhyme or reason to Darlington. It was hardly a hotbed of public finance innovation. The town just happened to be adjacent to the chancellor’s Yorkshire constituency. The new “Treasury hub” has just been given planning permission in the town and Darlington’s central market is being tipped as a good place for the exiles to lunch.The Blair andCamerongovernments also moved thousands of civil servants out of London, chiefly to outposts in Manchester and Birmingham. Big cities at least have some suitable academic and professional infrastructure. But gesture locations seldom work. The 1980s siting of an HMRC office in the new town of Cumbernauld, its biggest anywhere,ended in 2022with its closure and move to Glasgow. When the Blair government in 2006 moved the Office for National Statistics to Gwent, where schoolchildren have to learn Welsh,90% of the staff refused to relocate.The reality is that80% of British civil servantsare already based outside London – which seems not unreasonable – while the numbers in the capital continue to grow. The biggest peacetime boost to bureaucracy was Brexit. Boris Johnson’s hard Brexit has reportedly needed almost as many extra regulators –30,000– as are needed to administer the entire EU in Brussels.Where they work does not really matter. Moving civil servants around the country will do nothing to address the centralisation of democracy that is being entrenched by Labour’s plans.The fact is that capital cities are centres of power and power breeds bureaucracy. No one can guess how many officials will be needed to runAngela Rayner’s employment lawsand rental housing regulations. It must be thousands.Then last December, Raynerpublished a white paperon devolution that offered a clue. It saw its early manifestation in this month’s so-called metro mayoral elections. Introducing the new mayors, Rayner implied she was devolving power from the centre. She was not. Local councils may be close to fiscal destitutionif not bankruptcy. Rayner was not addressing any of that. She was introducing what is clearly an extension of the Treasury’s favourite form of local government. It is called central government.Metro mayors were invented by the Cameron government as regional governors to “coordinate” the ambitions of local cities and counties, chiefly concerned with transport and business development. They run no local servicesand answer to no elected assembly, but merely chair meetings of subordinate council leaders. Their election reflects no local affection or loyalty, as mayors should do. They are identified, George Orwell style, by compass points, such as West England, East Midlands, the North East. When such regional government was offered to the north-east by Blair’s John Prescott in 2000, it wasoverwhelmingly rejectedin a referendum.Rayner wisely did not care for a referendum this time. She did not even have the nerve to call the mayors governors – the normal name for the ruler of a region. The metro mayors seem likely to go the way of elections toNHS foundation trustsand police commissioners, relics of Westminster’s pretend local democracy.Starmer and Rayner regard elected local councils as in effect agencies of Whitehall. This applies to everything from taxation powers to school curriculums to pothole repairs. The final centralisation is the proposedremoval of planning controlover rural development, housing supply and high street protection. Such powers have long been crucial in giving local people a degree of control over the future of their communities. This must be a central right of local democracy.View image in fullscreenThe deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan and the mayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin, pose for a selfie with regional mayors in Leeds.Photograph: Phil Noble/PARayner’s new regions are clear agencies of this centralisation. They will have no taxation powers but will depend on her and function as her local arm. They may be able to overrule or “call in” subordinate council decisions. Most significantly, they are to be staffed through a “secondment scheme” with central government. They will be allocated central civil servants “in strategic authority officer roles including senior positions”. Rayner says the mayors are to be “hardwired into the way government works”. The link to Starmer decentralising Whitehall could hardly be more blatant. He is “recentralising” local government.It really does not matter where civil servants work. It matters who they are working for and to whom they are accountable. The United Kingdom is widely regarded as having themost centralised governmentof any western democracy, a fact not conducive to efficient administration. It is hardly a secret that the present Whitehall is dysfunctional.Starmer disagrees. He is curbing any lingering relics of British local democracy in a flurry of cliches about growth, enterprise and nimbyism. He has set up a new framework of Whitehall control to secure the precise opposite of devolution. Goodness only knows how many more civil servants that will require.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Still, it’s more money for himThu 15 May 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 12.24 EDTShareMark Zuckerberg has gone on a promotional tour to talk up the potential of AI in human relationships. I know; listening to Zuck on friendship is a bit like taking business advice fromBernie Madoffor lessons in sportsmanship fromTonya Harding. But at recent tech conferences and on podcasts, Zuck has been saying he hasseen the futureand it’s one in which the world’s “loneliness epidemic” is alleviated by people finding friendship with “a system that knows them well and that kind of understands them in the way that their feed algorithms do”. In essence, we’ll be friends with AI, instead of people. The missing air quotes around “knows” and “understands” is a distinction we can assume Zuck neither knows nor understands.This push by the 41-year-old tech leader would be less startling if it weren’t for the fact that semi-regularly online now you can find people writing about their relationships with their AI therapist or chatbot and insisting that if it’s real to them, then it’s real, period. The chatbot is, they will argue, “actively” listening to them. On apodcast with Dwarkesh Patellast month Zuck envisaged a near-future in which “you’ll be scrolling through your feed, and there will be content that maybe looks like a Reel to start, but you can talk to it, or interact with it and it talks back”. The average American, he said, has fewer than three friends but needs more. Hey presto, a ready solution.The problem, obviously, isn’t that chatting to a bot gives the illusion of intimacy, but that, in Zuckerberg’s universe, it is indistinguishable from real intimacy, an equivalent and equally meaningful version of human-to-human contact. If that makes no sense, suggests Zuck, then either the meaning of words has to change or we have to come up with new words: “Over time,” says Zuckerberg, as more and more people turn to AI friends, “we’ll find the vocabulary as a society to be able to articulate why that is valuable”.My hunch is that this vocab Zuckerberg is hoping to evolve won’t be the English equivalent of one of those compound German words with the power to articulate, in a single term, the “value” of a chatbot as “something that might look superficially like intimacy and might even satisfy the intimacy requirements of someone who neither understands nor values human interaction, but is in fact as lacking in the single requirement for the definition of ‘intimacy’ to stand – consciousness – as a blow-up doll from the 1970s”.Instead, what Zuck seems to mean is that we’ll just relax the existing meanings of words such as “human”, “understanding”, “knowing” and “relationship” to encompass the AI product he happens to be selling. After all, this is just an extension of the argument he made in 2006 when he first sold us on Facebook: namely, that online or computerised interaction is as good as if not better than the real thing.The sheer wrongness of this argument is so stark that it puts anyone who gives it more than a moment’s thought in the weird position of having to define units of reality as basic as “person”. To extend Zuckerberg’s logic: a book can make you feel less alone and that feeling can be real. Which doesn’t mean that your relationship with the author is genuine, intimate or reciprocated in anything like the way a relationship with your friends is.Must we list the ways? Given Zuckerberg’s easy rejection of basic norms, I guess we must. Human friends are conscious and responsive in unpredictable ways that increases our own sense of self in relation to them. More practically, human friends can introduce us to other humans, one of whom we might date, marry, be offered a job by, or add to our store of existing friends who nourish us and make us laugh. Perhaps mercifully, AI friends can’t make us go camping or force us to organise their hen night. But that is because our relationship with an AI friend is not a relationship at all, and when we talk to them, we’re alone in the room.A worse issue than fraudulence, apart from the horrible possibility that already lonely people – particularly young men – will be sold this kind of “intimacy” as an answer to their problems and discourage them from seeking out other people, is that any interaction with AI is by necessity commercial in nature. Perhaps that’s simply where we are, now. If you want real, searing, soul-level engagement then find someone who looks at you the way an AI chatbot looks at your data.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMark ZuckerbergOpinionArtificial intelligence (AI)MetaFacebookFriendshipSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

This could be Starmer’s most damaging mistake yetThu 15 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 07.13 EDTShareThe precedent is uncanny, and the failure to learn from it downright mystifying. Keir Starmer is rushing gladly towards the catastrophe Boris Johnson inflicted on himself in 2020. Had he set out to stymie Labour’s chances of re-election, he couldn’t be doing it better.In 2020,Johnson promised“a whole new planning system” for England, which, he claimed, would promote “economic growth”. He said he wanted to see 300,000 new homes built every year. He sought to “build, build, build”, butfalsely claimedthat his plans werethwarted by newts, which he used as shorthand for environmental protections. He would sweep these protections away.At first, the response was muted. Those of us who sought to explain the problems with his proposals were ignored or dismissed. But we could sense a slow wave of fury gathering, as people began to realise that what remained of our green and pleasant land would be handed on a platter to ruthless corporations.In June 2021, in a byelection in the most Tory of Tory constituencies, Chesham and Amersham, the Conservatives suffered a massiveelectoral shock, losing to the Lib Dems. A large part of the reason, asTory MPs conceded, was anger over Johnson’s proposed assault on the planning system.In parliament the following week, the then shadow environment secretary, Steve Reed,argued thatthe unpopularity of the Tory proposals “is not because voters are nimbys, as ministers rather offensively like to brand them, but because residents rightly want and deserve a say over how their own neighbourhoods are developed”. Why,he asked, “would the government do something so desperately unpopular with their own voters, let alone with all the rest of voters?”The problem with getting homes built, he argued, “is not the planning process; it is developers who do not build the homes once they have consent”. While nine out of 10 planning applications are approved, “over 1.1 million homes that received consent in the past decade have still not been built”. The reason, he explained, is “land banking. That is where a developer gets approval for an application to build new homes, but instead of building, waits for land values to rise so they can sell it on without having laid a single brick.” Therewas, andremains, plenty ofevidencefor this contention.The Toriesfrantically backtracked, cancelling the proposals that had ignited public rage. But their spell had been broken – they no longer looked impregnable. Now Reed is the environment secretary, and presiding over the government’splanning and infrastructure bill, which will strip away protections for wildlife, habitats, parks and playing fields, deregulate the planning system and roll back our democratic rights. The bill, the government claims, will promote economic growth and enable 300,000 new homes to be built every year.View image in fullscreenThe environment secretary, Steve Reed, at Thames Rowing Club in Putney, London, 5 September 2024.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAKeir Starmer says he wants to “build, baby, build”. He has justified the billby insistingthat newts and bats are impeding development, though this remains as untrue as it was when Johnson said it. The governmenthas admittedthere’s almost no evidence that nature protections are blocking development. Starmer has branded people who want a say over how their neighbourhoods are developed as “time-wasting nimbys”, “blockers” and “zealots”.When I first wrote about the bill’s threat towildlife and green places, Reed’s deputy, Mary Creagh, the minister for nature, denounced my article as “deeply misleading”. She offered no evidence.Two days after her letter was published, the government’s green watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection, issuedits own analysis, which was very similar to the case I made: the bill “would have the effect of reducing the level of environmental protection … the provisions are a regression”. This was hardly surprising: a vast range ofecologists, governmentadvisersand leadingbarristershad already come to thesame conclusion. I have asked Creagh for an apology, but have received no reply.Partly in response to my article, Reed’s department held a press conference, the purpose of which was to tell everyone they had got it wrong. The Guardian’s brilliant reporter Helena Horton asked about a provision in the bill that allows developers to trash local habitats, parks and playing fields, as long as they pay to create alternative provision somewhere else. Doesn’t this mean that people will be deprived of access to nature and green spaces, as the new provision wouldn’t even need to be in the same county? “That is not the intention of the bill,” she was told. But, she persisted, it’s theeffectof the bill? The officialadmittedthat it is. It doesn’t matter what a government’s “intentions” are: what counts is what the legislation says.Anyway, its intentions couldn’t be clearer. Starmer and Rachel Reeves say they want to “clear out”, “kick down”, “tear down” and “sweep away” planning and nature laws. The violence of the language tells us all we need to know.There’s only one problem with Labour’s immigration plans: they’re completely untethered from reality | Jonathan PortesRead moreJust as my “deeply misleading” article was going to press, the governmentannouncedan amendment to the bill, shutting down consultation on majorinfrastructure projectsat the crucial pre-application stage. This brings it even more closely into line with Johnson’s 2020 disaster.In seeking to justify the amendment, the government cited the support of alobby groupcalled Britain Remade. It turns out to be run by formerspecialadvisersto Johnson and Liz Truss, and the formerhead of researchat the Adam Smith Institute, a highly opaqueneoliberal junktank. It calls itself “an independent grassroots organisation”, which always sets off my alarm bells. Especially when it also tells us “Britain Remade is not currently able to accept grassroots funding”.I asked Britain Remade how it can call itself a “grassroots” organisation, who funds it, what its budget is, whether it has a board and who sits on it. It sent me a rambling answer addressing only one of these questions: “All of our current funders are listed online.” But its website names only two, while stating it receives “grants from a range of organisations”. I asked another three times, but have heard no more. It’s not just that similar groups swirled around Johnson. In some cases, these are the same people.The bill may make no difference to Labour’s electoral prospects, as Starmer, betraying one hope after another, simultaneously detoxifying Reform UK andtoxifying the Labour party, is likely already to have torpedoed them. But if it hasn’t happened yet, this could be the final rupture.

While there were negotiations involving the Americans this week in Qatar over therelease of hostages, Israel also saw fit to conduct a devastating assassination attempt on Hamas’s leader, Mohammed Sinwar, followed by intensive airstrikes across the strip. While Sinwar’s fate has not yet been confirmed, it is telling that this all took place while the US president was in the region: it reveals how unserious the Israeli government is about ending the war.The truth is that if the war is resumed in earnest, it will be unsurprising because, earlier this month, the Israeli security cabinet unanimously approved a plan toexpand its military offensive in the Gaza Strip(with the caveat of waiting until the US president’s Middle East trip was over). The new Israeli military plan, agreed under immense pressure by the most extreme rightwing members of the coalition, goes beyond “defeating Hamas” and expresses little interest in the fate of the remaining hostages. Instead, it aims toindefinitely occupy the entire territory.While Netanyahu tries to sugarcoat the true intentions of the next phase of the war with security reasoning and false humanitarian arguments that Gaza’s population will be moved“for its protection”, the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a rightwing messianic settler, gave the game away. Smotrich suggested that within half a year, the population of Gaza would be confined to just a narrow swath of land, with the remainder of the territory“totally destroyed”; as a result, they will be “looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places”. In other words, the plan is forced displacement.In the past when these political elements were on the margins of Israeli society and politics, calls of this nature, which amount to war crimes, could be dismissed as no more than far-right demagoguery. This is no longer the case when those who represent these abhorrent ideas occupy key positions in the cabinet. Worse, the Israeli prime minister is totally dependent on them to remain in power until the next election – and thereby also enable him to do his best to derail his corruption trial, especially as it is reaching the enormously unpleasant stage where he will be cross-examined by the prosecution.Netanyahu is giving the ultra-right what they want because he can’t afford a fresh general election (which most Israelis crave), let alone the prospect of an independent commission of inquiry into the colossal failure to avert the 7 October Hamas massacre. More than two-thirds of Israelisprioritise securing a deal with Hamasthat would see the return of the hostages over continuing the war, while opinion polls suggest that should a general election be held today the coalition parties would be sent to the opposition benches. Hence, he feels compelled to stick with the coalition he has, and cave into their demands, destructive and criminal as they are.View image in fullscreenPalestinians inspect the rubble of a family’s home destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in Khan Younis, 15 May 2025.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APThe price of Netanyahu’s desperation to hold on to power at any cost is paid first and foremost by the Palestinians. But it is also being paid by his own people. Israel has already been blocking the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza for weeks, and aid organisations are constantly warning of starvation, lack of medical help, especially as hospitals are being bombed, and diminishing access to clean water and sanitation. The former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert described the situation this week as “totally intolerable, unacceptable, unbearable and unforgivable. It should be stopped right away.”It is for the international community to rise to the challenge of ensuring that Israel will not translate the recent cabinet’s decision to expand the war into a new reality. The Israel Defense Forces have already mobilised tens of thousands of soldiers prepared to enter into a devastated Gaza, with its traumatised population. If the international community won’t make use of its levers of influence to prevent the return of a full-scale war – and if Trump decides not to flex his muscles, as he did on the eve of his inauguration – it will be complicit in further bloodshed, displacement and dispossession of the Palestinians in Gaza. Possibly on an even worse scale than before.Yossi Mekelberg is professor of international relations and associate fellow of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham HouseExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

We have collectively taught thousands of classes on human rights law, international law and government repression. We have defended death row prisoners in Malawi, documented forced labor in Brazil, helped women seeking gender equality in Burma, chronicled the struggle of the Sahrawi people for self-determination in Western Sahara, and advocated on behalf of families of disappeared immigrants in the United States. As human rights defenders, our job is to expose government abuses of power where we find them. And that includes Israel.It has never been easy for scholars in the United States to publicly criticize Israel. Now, anyone who does so risks professional suicide. TheTrump administrationdeliberately conflates criticism of the government of Israel with antisemitism and has pressured universities to discipline students and fire faculty who express concern over the slaughter of Palestinians. This has chilled speech on our campuses and is a direct assault on academic freedom. It is also an attempt to stamp out all opposition to US foreign policy with respect to Israel.Israel has now killed more than52,000 Palestiniansin itsattack on Gaza, an estimated15,000 of whom are children. In 2024, we co-authored areportconcluding that Israel’s actions met the international definition of genocide. On Thursday, we issued a second report finding that Israel has also engaged in acts of apartheid against the Palestinian population.While most people associate apartheid with South Africa, thedefinition of apartheid– considered a crime against humanity – encompasses inhuman acts of racial subjugation and systematic oppression anywhere in the world. We concluded that Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, which includes masskilling,arbitrary detention,torture, and the imposition of a legal regime that providesfar less due processthan that provided to Israelis living in the same territory,meets the legal thresholdof apartheid as defined by the 1973 United Nations International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid.Israel is annihilating Palestinian children. Amer Rabea was one of them | Ahmad IbsaisRead moreWe are not the first to reach this conclusion. Last year, theinternational court of justicedetermined that Israel is violating the international prohibition on racial segregation and apartheid, whileAmnesty International,Human Rights Watch, and Israel’s leading human rights organization,B’Tselem, have each independently found Israel’s laws and policies meet the legal definition of apartheid. Our report details the findings of these groups as well as the dozens of others that indicate there is global consensus that Israel is responsible for this crime against humanity. Additionally, we highlight the obligations of the international community, the Trump administration, and universities, including the ones where we are based, not to bolster Israel’s illegal actions.The significance of Israel’s apartheid has been overshadowed by its genocidal assault on Gaza. But the two are inextricably linked. The same racial hatred fuels apartheid as much as it does genocide. When Benjamin Netanyahucharacterizesthe war on Gaza as a “struggle between the children of light and the children of darkness, between humanity and the law of the jungle”, the Israeli prime minister is playing to age-old racist tropes. When the then defense minister, Yoav Gallant,callsPalestinians “human animals”, he is dehumanizing them to desensitize us.We recognize that our reports will invite criticism and debate. We welcome it. Universities in general, and law schools in particular, have always encouraged critical engagement as a way of testing the validity of ideas. But if the Trump administration has its way, this topic will be off limits entirely.By publishing this op-ed, we expose ourselves to harassment and risk losing our jobs.

Given everything we know about global heating, and the law obliging the UK to reach net zero by 2050, it is disturbing that even the basics of promoting energy security and efficiency continue to be questioned.But that is the situation Britain faces, as the government lays the ground for a housebuilding spree that it hopes will last for the rest of this parliament (as planning is devolved, the target of 1.5m new homes is for England only). Much of the blame for this discouraging state of affairs lies with the Tories, who delayed progress towards sustainability by scrapping environmental rules, leading to a disgraceful proliferation of new developments where the houses do not even have solar panels on the roofs.Ministers have confirmed that solar panels are likely to feature in their future homes standard for England. But questions remain about how prescriptive the new rules will be. Construction firms must be obliged to install enough panels to meet a home’s energy needs to ensure that they do so. Battery storage should also be included, as this reduces dependence on the grid. High insulation standards would help to reduce energy demand andkeep bills down.However, it is the government’s policy on domestic heating that is arguably the area of greatest concern. Important though it is, ramping up renewable power can only ever be one side of the green energy story. Fossil fuels must also be phased out. But the recent abandonment of green pledges, including aproposed ban on wood-burning stovesin new homes, coupled with the cavalier approach to nature taken in the planning bill, has left campaigners worried that on heating, too, ministers will cave in to housebuilders’ demands by allowing them to fit gas boilers.This would be as economically shortsighted as it is environmentally destructive. Other European countries are already miles ahead of the UK on installations, and heat pump manufacture has the potential to be an important source of green jobs. Labour has alreadyabandoned a policy of phasing out gas boilers by 2035, despite the Climate Change Committee – which advises the government – having strongly criticised the refusal to move decisively away from gas heating. Heat pumps in new houses should be seen as a bare minimum. Industry would adapt more readily, bringing prices down, if the government sent clearer messages.The danger, as with the planning reforms that set the scene, is that builders call the shots. This highly concentrated industry was acrucial source of donationsto the Tory party and remains very powerful, since ministers have no other means of delivering their pledges.But while construction firms want to keep costs low and maximise profits, these ought not to be MPs’ priorities. Retrofitting heat pumps and insulation costs far more than installing them in the first place. Rare habitats such aschalk streamscannot simply be moved or replaced. Elected politicians must insist on this longer-term perspective. Building new homes is important, but nature and the UK’s climate goals must not be demolished in the process.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The power of inherited and unearned wealth in the France of 2025, she argues, replicates the social injustices found in Honoré de Balzac’s 19th-century chronicles of ambition and despair. As in the 1820s, she writes, “Who now could buy a place in Paris relying only on their wage and without family help? With the resurgence of inherited wealth, a gulf between what work allows and inheritance allows has also returned.”The problem is a sadly familiar one across Europe, and the sameobservationcould be made of Britain, Germany or Italy. The economist Thomas Piketty haslaid barethe extent to which booming stock markets and property prices have turbocharged asset wealth in western liberal democracies, at the expense of those reliant solely on a wage. Since the 1980s, regressive tax changes have empowered the wealthy to keep more of their money and pass more of it on to their sons and daughters. In advanced economies, the amount of inherited wealth has more or less doubled as a proportion of GDP, compared with the middle of the last century.The collapse of trust in politics can, in part, be attributed to this emergence of a two-tier society that offers only limited opportunities to the assetless young and undermines the basis of the social contract. France is at the sharp end of this loss of faith. On Wednesday evening, during a marathon primetime television interrogation, Emmanuel Macron wasaccusedof having become a “president for the rentier class”. Mr Macron, who made the reduction of taxes on wealth a priority of his first term, batted away the question with airy talk of promoting equal opportunities.Yet as the French president refuses to contemplate a more redistributive approach, his unpopular prime minister, François Bayrou, is seeking backing for an austerity budget that would impose €40bn in spending cuts. This, Mr Bayrou has blithelystated, “will demand efforts from everybody, and given its scale, it cannot succeed unless the French people support it”. Across the Rhine in Germany, the new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is pushing a similar message of collective sacrifice. Germans, Mr Merzsaidthis week, must “work more, and above all more efficiently” to get a stagnating economy back on track.Prof Plouviez’s work is the latest to highlight why such exhortations to solidarity and hard work ring so hollow for so many. As populist parties surf on social discontent, governments are shamelesslyechoingtheir rhetoric and approach towards immigration. But confronting the manner in which a self-reproducing wealth divide is corroding social bonds and undermining a politics of the common good remains taboo. Presidentialelectionsin Romania and Poland this weekend are likely to showcase voters’ deepening disillusionment with the political mainstream, and the continuing rise of the far right.As Balzac was writing the final volumes of hisLa Comédie Humainein the 1840s, the future British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli publishedSybil, his fictional indictment of the great wealth divide in Victorian England. Two centuries on, facing a darkening political horizon, Europe’s current crop of leaders could usefully dust down a copy and learn from its insights before it is too late.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

At 35, the Polish goalkeeperhad been convinced to come out of retirementfor one last job, and what a job it was, a season he hadn’t even expected to play ending with a league and cup double after a 2-0 win at rivals Espanyol.He was joined at Barcelona by a stellar cast, a whole new generation that includesa kid 17 years and three months his junior– a teenager at the other end of a career that might yet be one of the best there has ever been.Raphinha, the man who almost left, leads Barcelona to verge of dream title | Sid LoweRead moreSzczesny had made two vital first-half saves whenBarcelonawere exposed against Espanyol, their city rivals, on a night when they knew a win would secure the title and anything less would leave them having to fight on, maybe even in a position where it could slip from them. And then, as the second half began, Lamine Yamal, who could be the best player in the world already, ensured it would not when he delivered a moment of class and quality that no one else could. Which is just what he does, with startling regularity and remarkable ease.He delivered the victory, too. The run and the shot he produced on 53 minutes was so good, so like Lamine, sohisnow, the ball bent into the top corner of the net to provide the perfect conclusion to an almost perfect campaign. Barcelona had not had their best night but were set on course for a victory over Espanyol that crowned them champions, Fermín López adding the second in the 95th minute. Another grand moment had belonged to the boy with braces on his teeth, a teenager taking the lead.When Barcelonawere knocked out of Europe, Lamine had vowed he would never give up until they won the Champions League. He also said he had told his mum that opportunity would come every year. For now, they had to win the leagueto go with the Copa del Rey, expectations wildly exceeded. So in theclásico, he curled in the goal that pulled them level again,setting them up for a 4-3 winthat left them one victory from the title. And now, four days later, he set them up for that too. With a little help from the whole gang, down to the latest arrival, the teammate who is older than his dad.If Barcelona hadn’t won here there would still have been two more chances to take the title, but there could be nothing better than doing it first time and in a derby too. Espanyol’s coach, Manolo González, insisted that all he cared about was the victory that would guarantee his team’s survival, but for the fans it was different. Yes, they wanted to avoid relegation, but if they could put one over their rivals, keep the bus at the depot, then so much the better.View image in fullscreenFérmin López slots in Barcelona’s second goal to confirm the title.Photograph: Joan Monfort/APThey definitely didn’t want to go through the experience of two years ago, and nor did anyone else: in May 2023, when Barcelona won the league here, hundreds of fans ran on to the pitch and chased the visitors’ players down the tunnel. Espanyol couldn’t avoid seeing their rivals win at their home, but at the end of this meeting, Barça headed down the tunnel to celebrate instead. They had earned it.Espanyol had started well, the first chance coming their way when Urko González dashed clean through and put the ball wide. Yet in those early minutes attention had been drawn instead to reports of an incident outside in which a white car had apparently run over fans that had been surrounding it, accelerating through a crowd. There had been panic, ambulances were at the scene. Videos circulated and, at one point, the Espanyol fans behind Joan García’s goal had called for the game to be stopped, shouting that people had been hurt or worse.The referee came over then, an announcement was made over the PA saying that the situation was under control, and the game continued, but some fans in the first rows vacated their seats. Catalan police said that there had been no serious injuries.Back on the pitch, the ball was Barcelona’s – with 80% possession in the first half – but it was slow and little really came from it. Espanyol were happy to wait for the chance to run, a plan that was justified by the fact that, when they did, they found their way into the space beyond the Barcelona back four. Szczesny made his second decisive save, this time from Javi Puado as he was set free after a quarter of an hour. He had to be out fast to deny him again 10 minutes later as he chased Unai Expósito’s ball.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It wouldn’t the next time. Just before the break, Robert Lewandowski fired wide. And then soon after, when Lamine had another chance, he again stepped inside from the right, accelerated past two men and reproduced what is becoming a copyright of his, an outrageous shot flying in a perfect arc into the net right by the far post.Everyone knew what he was going to do, but knowing it and stopping it are very different things, as so many defenders and goalkeepers have found and many more surely will. Standing there before the few visiting supporters high in the corner, Lamine Yamal opened his arms wide. He had put Barcelona within touching distance.A superb stop by Szczesny from Roberto Fernández kept them there, as did the control they exercised through midfield where Pedri and Frenkie De Jong dominated. They were aided by a red card for Leandro Cabrera, sent off when he hit out at Lamine Yamal.The teenager was determined to keep them there, a lesson learnt perhaps from the defeat to Inter. When he escaped on 92 minutes, he carried to the corner instead of shooting. But the next time he got it, he slipped in a clever pass and Férmin López did go for goal, a clean, crisp shot settling in the net. It was over. The derby was won and the title was theirs: the kid, the old man and the whole brilliant gang of them.Explore more on these topicsBarcelonaLa LigaReal MadridEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Godden scrambled the only goal over the two legs after 171 minutes of attritional football to secure a Wembley date against Leyton Orient on 25 May. The Charlton manager, Nathan Jones, sank to his knees as fans invaded the pitch in emotional scenes after the final whistle.Lloyd Jones had earlier missed a golden chance for Charlton, while Kayne Ramsay made two stunning blocks to denyWycombe. But Lloyd Jones made amends by setting up Godden to fire Charlton to within one match of a return to the Championship, five years after they were relegated.Hull sack head coach Rubén Sellés despite avoiding dropRead moreWycombe’s preparation was not ideal as Franco Ravizzoli was thrust into the starting lineup for the first time since January after their regular goalkeeper, Will Norris, was ruled out through injury. The Argentinian got off to a nervy start when he just about held a low effort from the Charlton captain, Greg Docherty.Thefirst leg had been a cagey goalless draw, and Charlton also started the second slowly in front of a raucous, sellout crowd at the Valley. But they gradually got on the front foot with Godden reaching the byline and pulling the ball back, although Tyreece Campbell was unable to get the vital touch.Charlton should have taken the lead seven minutes before half-time but for an awful miss from Lloyd Jones. It came from another cross from Godden, which the defender met three yards out, in front of goal, and somehow headed wide.Moments after the break Ravizzoli made a fine save at his near post to keep out Alex Gilbert’s close-range volley. But Wycombe remained dangerous on the break with their top scorer, Richard Kone – who was lucky to be playing after escaping a red card in the first leg for a nasty foul on Ramsay – their main threat.View image in fullscreenJubilant Charlton Athletic fans invaded the pitch to celebrate their victory.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAKone, named League One player and young player of the season, had a run at the Charlton defender Macaulay Gillesphey, muscled past him and lashed a shot into the side-netting.

Ruud, however, was not cheering the completion of a successful set or even a singular, spectacular point; he was commemorating sarcastically the very first game he had won.It was the only thing Ruud had to cheer all night asJannik Sinnerpieced together a remarkable statement performance under the lights in Rome, underlining his enduring status as the best player in the world by completely demolishing Ruud, the sixth seed, 6-0, 6-1 to reach the semi-finals of the Italian Open.Alcaraz dismisses Draper in straight sets to ease into Italian Open semi-finalRead moreThis victory marks the first time that Sinner has ever reached the last four at the biggest tournament in his home country and he is now two wins away from what would be a remarkable title on his return from a three-month anti-doping suspension. He will face Tommy Paul, the 11th seed, on Friday for a place in the final.“It was a great performance,” Sinner said. “Very happy about that. But things can change quickly, no? Every day is different. Tomorrow is a different opponent. We play again in the night. But still it’s a different matchup. I always try to prepare myself in the best possible way.”While most players would spend their rest day before a big match maintaining a low profile and conserving energy, Sinner was almost as busy on Wednesday. He started the day by meeting Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican, giving the newly elected pontiff a tennis racket, and he ended the night as a guest at Bologna’s win over Milan in the Coppa Italia final, which was held at the Stadio Olimpico on the other side of the vast Foro Italico grounds.“Amazing, honestly,” Sinner said on his meeting with the pope. “I never experienced something like this. I was very honoured. I didn’t know exactly really what to say, no? It was a very emotional thing also with my parents there. It was very nice. It was something I will never forget, that’s for sure.”Ruud represented Sinner’s first top-10 opponent of his return and as the Madrid Open champion he was the most in-form player in the draw, but his recent title did not make a difference. “It’s as near as perfect that I witnessed, at least as a player playing someone, so I’ve just got to give it to him,” Ruud said.Sinner’s level was stratospheric from the very first point. He opened the match by absolutely thumping the ball. While Sinner’s backhand, the stroke that comes most naturally to him, has been excellent from the beginning of the tournament, here he could also do whatever he wanted on the court with his forehand. The sheer force and weight of his forehand, and the ease with which he redirected his two-handed backhand down the line at will, completely overwhelmed Ruud.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner’s two-handed backhand was a fearsome weapon against Casper Ruud.Photograph: Aleksandra Szmigiel/Reuters“There’s a kind of saying that you have that when someone plays that well, it feels like you have two forehands, one from the forehand side and another forehand from the backhand side,” Ruud said. “In his case, it’s almost like two backhands because his backhand is also so good. It was just like playing a wall that shoots 100mph balls at you all the time.”This was a complete performance. Sinner returned stupendously well and demonstrated his growing variety with some well-measured, delicate touches alongside his brutal power. The few times Ruud was in control of the points, Sinner effortlessly shifted his defence into attack. By 3-0, 30-30 in the opening set, Sinner had allowed Ruud one single point and the Norwegian ended the set with two service points. One incredible set would have been impressive enough, but Sinner refused to let up until the end.“It doesn’t feel so bad,” Ruud said. “Honestly, I think it was more fun than anything, even though I lost love and one, it’s like you just look at the guy and say: ‘Wow, this is kind of next-level shit.’ Excuse my language. I don’t know what else to say. It was almost fun to witness at the same time. Of course, I wish it was a closer match. I wish I could have given the people, the fans, a longer or closer match. But I think that I was there ready to play, he was just even readier.”Sinner’s victory rounded off another incredible 24 hours for Italian tennis after Lorenzo Musetti, the eighth seed, defeated the second seed, Alexander Zverev, to join Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals. In the women’s draw the sixth seed, Jasmine Paolini, became the first Italian woman to reach the final in Rome since Sara Errani in 2014 with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Peyton Stearns.Explore more on these topicsTennisJannik SinnernewsShareReuse this content"

Villa’s director of football operations, Damian Vidagany, said shifting the game from Sunday to Friday was “clear prejudice” against the club and Villa objected to Spurs’s request for it to be moved to aid their preparations for Wednesday’s Europa League final. Villa were also privately perplexed at Bournemouth’s game with Manchester City being rearranged for Tuesday, after Saturday’s FA Cup final, which is guaranteed to have implications on whether eighth place qualifies for the Europa Conference League. The flipside to all of this is Villa can get on the front foot, kicking off 45 minutes before Chelsea entertain Manchester United and two days before Nottingham Forest head to West Ham and Arsenal host Newcastle. Victory for Villa could hoist them as high as fourth before a final-day trip to Old Trafford and, psychologically, that could prove a knockout blow.Ben FisherAston Villa v Tottenham,Premier League, Friday 7.30pm (all times BST)2Maresca turns to teenager GeorgeNicolas Jackson’sridiculous red card against Newcastleleaves Enzo Maresca with a problem in attack. Chelsea have lost their main striker to suspension for the rest of the league season and need to adjust when they host Manchester United. Options are thin on the ground. Christopher Nkunku is unwanted and has been unavailable in recent weeks, the inexperienced Marc Guiu is returning from a hamstring injury and Jadon Sancho is ineligible against his parent club. Sancho would not have played up front but having him available would have meant there was an experienced alternative on the flanks should Maresca have repeated a solution from previous times of need and moved Pedro Neto into a central role. As it is Chelsea will probably have to place their trust in the exciting teenager Tyrique George.Jacob SteinbergChelsea vManchester United, Premier League, Friday 8.15pmView image in fullscreenTyrique George holds off a challenge from Djurgården’s Jacob Une during the Conference League semi-finals.Photograph: Petter Arvidson/BILDBYRÅN/Shutterstock3Cup win could turn City’s season aroundPep Guardiola has been a manager humbled this season owing to a troubled Manchester City campaign ruptured by injury and a loss of the pattern and spirit that propelled them to a record fourth consecutive title in 2023-24. To claim the third FA Cup of his generation-defining tenure would be a fillip, then, before the last push to secure Champions League qualification, next month’s Club World Cup and a summer of plotting to ensure next year is no repeat. City’s players were completely deflated when walking through the mixed zone at Wembley afterlosing last May’s Cup final to Manchester United: one more reason to avoid a repeat against Crystal Palace on Saturday.Jamie JacksonCrystal Palace vManchester City, FA Cup final, Saturday4.30pm4Eze eyes up glorious prize for PalaceEberechi Eze has said he could not be in better form as Crystal Palace return to Wembley to face Manchester City in the FA Cup final, with the England forward having scored five times in his last four games in all competitions. “It has been a weird season for me,” he said. “I am gradually getting some rhythm and playing how I want to be playing, helping the team as much as I can. It is a good time right now.” Everything seems to have clicked for Eze since scoring his first international goal at the end of Marchagainst Latviaand he will be relishing the opportunity to lead Palace to a first major trophy. With City and Arsenal thought to be among the clubs interested in signing him this summer, it might be his last chance.Ed AaronsView image in fullscreenEberechi Eze is mobbed by his teammates after his goal against Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final.Photograph: AFP/Getty Images5Time for a Goodison goodbyeAt the age of 133 Goodison Park has unexpectedly regained its status as a gamechanging stadium thanks to The Friedkin Group’s decision to make it thepermanent home for Everton Women. Tuesday’s timely announcement may soften the emotional hammer blow when it lands on Sunday but in many respects it changes little. This really is it for one of the most storied grounds in English football as Everton’s men prepare to play their 2,791st and final competitive game at L4 4EL. And so to Jack Sharp, William Ralph “Dixie” Dean, Tommy Lawton, TG Jones, Ted Sagar, Joe Mercer, Dave Hickson, Tommy Eglington, Bobby Collins, Brian Labone, Gordon West, Alex Young, Roy Vernon, Jimmy Gabriel, Ray Wilson, Alan Ball, Howard Kendall, Andy King and Kevin Campbell, along with all the ghosts in the Goodison stands whose favourite spot you still look for (Lower Gwladys Street, behind the second exit in from the church), the time has come to say goodbye.Andy HunterEverton vSouthampton, Premier League, Sunday 12pm6Leaky Forest make do without MurilloNottingham Forest’s defensive foundations are starting to creak. Their challenge for Champions League qualification has been built on a solid core but they have become leaky of late. They are conceding sloppy goals and are not the same without Murillo, who is out with a hamstring injury. Morato has come in for his fellow Brazilian and needs to step up when Forest visit West Ham.

His qualities have been evident since joining, originally on loan, from Freiburg in January 2023. There have been 65 Premier League appearances since then but 31 have come as a substitute and he completed 90 minutes only twice in his first two years with the club. An adductor injury last season limited his opportunities, with Schade missing 28 games and returning late in the campaign to make cameos. He has been playing catchup with his fitness and it took until the final day of November for his first league goals to come this season, a hat-trick against Leicester. Finally, Schade seems fully up to speed with four goals in his past three appearances to help Brentford’s push for European qualification. As the futures of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa become the focus of the gossipmongers, Brentford can feel confident they already possess someone who can alleviate the pain caused by any departures.Will UnwinBrentford vFulham, Premier League, Sunday 3pm8Vardy sendoff to be one for the agesThe saddest of dead rubbers will take place in Leicester on Sunday … or so you might think. This is the battle for 18th. The two teams are level on points, with 22, going into the final two matches of the season. The higher a team finishes, the more prize money they get. Despite the obvious failings of the two sides there will be something of a carnival atmosphere in the East Midlands, as Leicester say goodbye to Jamie Vardy, who is set for hisfarewell at the King Power Stadiumafter 13 years. There will be tributes galore for the man who spearheaded theirhistoric Premier League title. Vardy deserves everything he receives, with a pre-match ceremony planned and an insistence supporters wait behind after full time for further celebration of the 38-year-old. It has been a dreadful season for Leicester fans but at least, by waving off their hero, they might be able to leave one final game with a smile.WULeicester v Ipswich, Premier League, Sunday 3pm9The return of Havertz for ArsenalWhen Kai Havertz attempted to block a shot during Arsenal’s training camp in Dubai back in February andtore a hamstring, the Germany striker had already scored nine Premier League goals and was on course to surpass his mark of 13 from the previous campaign. Three months on, he remains the club’s top scorer in the league and could return against Newcastle on Sunday after resuming full training this week. With all the talk about Arsenal’s need to sign a new striker in the summer, it is easy to forget that Havertz matched Robin van Persie’s record of scoring in seven games in a row at the Emirates Stadium this season. The 25-year-old should at least get the chance to reach double figures in the Premier League for only the second time if he features this week or on the final day against Southampton.EAArsenal v Newcastle, Premier League, Sunday 4.30pmView image in fullscreenKai Havertz is ready for a return to action.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC10Hürzeler’s high hopes for next stepDo not expect too many arrivals at Brighton this summer if Fabian Hürzeler gets his way. Having been the highest net spenders in Europe when the German was appointed almost 12 months ago, it is fair to say that some of the new signings have struggled to make an impact on the south coast. Brajan Gruda finally scored his first Premier League goal of the season against Wolves last week as Brighton kept alive their hopes of qualifying for Europe, while Georginio Rutter and Yankuba Minteh have also contributed. But Hürzeler has high hopes that Ferdi Kadioglu, Matt O’Riley and Mats Wieffer can also prove their worth in the long run. “They came here with injury, problems with the intensity, maybe problems with the culture. They all also will take the next step,” said the Brighton manager earlier this week. “You need a stable environment where they can grow.”EABrighton vLiverpool, Premier League, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3646832Arsenal3633683Newcastle3623664Man City3624655Chelsea3619636Aston Villa367637Nottm Forest3612628Brentford3610559Brighton3635510AFC Bournemouth36125311Fulham3615112Crystal Palace36-24913Everton36-54214Wolverhampton36-134115West Ham36-174016Man Utd36-113917Tottenham Hotspur3643818Ipswich36-422219Leicester36-472220Southampton36-5712Explore more on these topicsFootballTen things to look out for this weekendPremier LeagueFA CupAston VillaTottenham HotspurChelseaManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After Dobey, who knocked Littler out to reach the final, lost his throw again in the sixth leg, he then missed two more darts at a double in the next as Aspinall came back to land double 10.Aspinall’s victory leaves him four points clear in fourth spot, eliminating Dobey, while Michael van Gerwen would need to win the final night in Sheffield to overhaul him.Untameable darts crowds tell us about the future of sport – and maybe society too | Jonathan LiewRead more“I felt very confident coming into tonight, I bottled it last week but tonight is a new night,” Aspinall said. “I’ve not played amazing tonight, but I have been composed. I’ve not celebrated, I’ve stayed in the moment and my finishing has been bang on.”Littler had earlier fought back to beat the world No 1, Luke Humphries, in their quarter-final to make sure of top seeding in London. Dobey, though, then produced another impressive display to lead the world champion 3-1 and 4-2 in their semi-final. While Littler again produced a late rally to force a last-leg decider, he missed double six for the match, leaving Dobey to take out 32.Littler’s 6-3 quarter-final comeback win over Humphries was a high quality affair. Humphries had ended his 10-week wait for a Premier League nightly victory by edging out Littler in a last-leg decider in Leeds, and opened up in fine style with an early break to lead 2-0 then 3-1. Littler, though, came roaring back to win five legs on the bounce, finishing with a match average of almost 116 while Humphries hit nine maximums in defeat, averaging 110.Price had produced a nine-dart finish in his quarter-final defeat to Bunting. Welshman Price, already secure of a playoff spot, landed the perfect leg to reduce the deficit to 5-4. It was a second nine-dart finish for Price in this year’s tournament, which has one more nightly event in Sheffield before the playoffs at London’s O2on 29 May. Having lost his opening eight games, former Masters champion Bunting was already out of contention to progress, but closed out a 6-4 victory over Price to make it through to the semi-finals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Super League’s most successful club have such immense standards given their historical triumphs that any blip is treated with severe and harsh criticism.Arguably nobody knows that better than Paul Wellens. One of the Saints’ greatest-ever players’ position as head coach has come under immense pressure in recent weeks after scraping into the playoffs last year and underwhelming again in the early stages of this year – so much so, speculation is already brewing about potential replacements.Women’s Super League is light years behind Australia but kicks off with hopeRead moreNobody is suggesting that this victory over a beaten-up and confidence-sapped Catalans suddenly hints the Saints are suddenly bona fide title contenders. But it was perhaps the manner of it which will act as the catalyst for their season. Defeat here would have been unthinkable forSt Helens, victory the bare minimum.This squad is approaching the end of a glittering era, with Alex Walmsley and Jonny Lomax, the heartbeat of the side who won four Grand Finals in succession between 2019 and 2022, reaching the end. But for 80 minutes here, it felt like the good old days as Saints faced an opponent with weaknesses and ruthlessly put them to the sword.And the biggest positive of them all here? The latest talent to emerge from their prestigious production line. Wellens’ biggest problem this year has been finding an attacking spine that can deliver – but there can be no doubting that teenage half-back George Whitby is now categorically part of that moving forwards.Whitby was sublime here, scoring a wonderful hat-trick but also performing with a level of maturity and composure that belied his years. “He’s got the potential to go to the top of the game and I’ve every confidence he’ll do that,” Wellens said. “I think a lot of people are going to enjoy watching him.”Whitby’s first two tries bookended an impressive first half from Saints. In between that, Deon Cross and Walmsley both crossed and perhaps the only criticism at the break, with the hosts 24-0 ahead, was merely how many more points Wellens’ men had left out on the field, with a number of chances going to ground.But even at that early stage, you felt as though that would be more than enough, and so it proved against a Dragons side without numerous senior players, but also whose season is quickly unravelling. They could end the weekend ninth, and the pressure may be starting to mount on Super League’s longest-serving coach, Steve McNamara.His side could have no complaints here, with this the first time they conceded 40 or more in a game since 2022. High-profile St Helens recruit Tristan Sailor has been one of the central points of criticism so far this season, having underperformed in a number of positions since joining from Brisbane.But he looked settled on the wing here, with his break setting up Whitby’s first try before scoring one of his own shortly after the restart. That was then followed up by a wonderful flying finish from Lewis Murphy to make it 34-0.However, it was fitting that the final word went to Whitby, who capitalised upon a sensational offload from Walmsley to go in under the posts and score his first senior hat-trick.It would be wise not to put too much pressure on his young shoulders so soon, but you suspect if Wellens and Saints can turn this around and force their way into the title mix this year, their latest scrum cap-adorning sensation will have had a major say in it.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueSt HelensCatalans DragonsRugby leaguematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Andrew Flintoff was perched on the pavilion balcony, while Mark Wood, trying his hand at coaching during his latest injury layoff, patrolled the boundary’s edge with a smile.Out in the middle there were also runs for Josh de Caires, son of Mike Atherton, who compiled a fluent 79 from 93 balls on a green-tinged pitch. De Caires is a player in the modern mould charting his own course but some of the old man’s mannerisms were there to see. Mercifully, the lower back appears to be much less creaky.Jamie Smith: ‘To win an away Ashes would be every England cricketer’s dream’Read moreBut more noteworthy than the Professional County Club Select XI – a team of fresh-faced rookies led by De Caires, coached by Flintoff, and with selector Luke Wright in attendance – was the identity of their opponents. Zimbabwe have arrived for a one-off, four-day Test match against England that gets under way at Trent Bridge next Thursday, their first appearance on these shores for 22 years.Much has changed since a series chiefly remembered for Jimmy Anderson, peroxide highlights in his hair, bursting out of the traps with five wickets on his debut at Lord’s. Tour games have largely gone the way of the Nokia 3310 (the must-have mobile phone back then, kids) and Zimbabwe have slipped from feisty overachievers, a team laced with a good deal of quality, to the unofficial second tier of Test cricket.Indeed, after the Test next week (a warmup for England before the five-Test visit of India) Zimbabwe stick around to play South Africa in a four-day game at Arundel. That third and final game on tour is preparation for the Proteas ahead of their World Test Championship final against Australia at Lord’s next month – a competition that Zimbabwe, along with Afghanistan and Ireland, are currently excluded from.View image in fullscreenCaptain Josh de Caires top scored for the Professional County Club Select XI against Zimbabwe at Grace Road.Photograph: UK Sports Pics Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Live News.Still, truncated though it is – a far cry from 2003, when they played two Tests and took part in an ODI tri-series along with South Africa – this tour is a welcome development. And in something of a first, the England and WalesCricketBoard is also paying the visitors a tour fee in lieu of a reciprocal trip not sitting in the future tours programme.This apparent benevolence is in part driven by the England and Wales Cricket Board’s broadcast deal with Sky, which is predicated on delivering six Test matches every season; in the years that bring India or Australia for their usual five-match series, an early summer opponent is still needed. Ireland fulfilled this role before the 2023 Ashes, now it is Zimbabwe’s turn.But while a schedule-filler, it would not have come about had relations between the ECB and Zimbabwe Cricket not thawed considerably in recent times, nor had the green light not come from the British government. After the dark days of Robert Mugabe’s brutal regime, and a period of considerable turmoil for cricket in Zimbabwe in which corruption was alleged to be rife, relative stability has returned to the country.How Zimbabwe will fare in Nottingham next week is tricky to call, with their diet of Test cricket so skinny in recent years. There are just 108 caps spread among their 15-man squad (Joe Root, by comparison, has racked up 152 on his own). As the county kids cut loose to post 330 all out inside 72 overs, including half-centuries from tailenders Sebastian Morgan and Jafer Chohan, it did not augur massively well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Blessing Muzarabani, a towering 6ft 6in quick who claimed nine wickets in Sylhet, could pose some problems for England on the right surface – much as New Zealand’s similarly giant Will O’Rourke did during their last outing.As well Muzarabani, who nicked off De Caires with a sharp delivery that climbed, there is Sikandar Raza, the Pakistani-born all-rounder who has been a world-class performer in the white-ball formats.Experience comes from Sean Williams and skipper Craig Ervine, both 39, while Gary Ballance, though retired after a brief return to the country of his birth, is sharing local knowledge as their batting consultant.This short tour may serve to warm up their opponents in the main but for Zimbabwe, out in the cold for more than two decades, there is sunshine breaking through.Explore more on these topicsZimbabwe Cricket TeamEngland cricket teamCricketLeicestershirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It shows we are in a really great place at the moment.“He has shown from the beginning the respect he has for this club and this team.

This year we couldn’t and I take the responsibility for that. Hopefully next year we’ll be in a better position but having this exciting news and this great investment in the women’s team will help for sure.”The Chelsea manager also feels that someone with Ohanian’s financial and political weight backing women’s football and Chelsea will help in recruitment. “It’s really important,” she said. “When I have players on my phone, trying to recruit them, I always make sure I talk about what we want to do on the pitch, but I spend as much time talking about them as a person because it’s really important when you are going to spend so much time together.

Scans play a crucial role in telling doctors if a patient has cancer or a broken bone, for example.The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR), which collated the figures from doctors across the UK, said the £216m given to private firms in 2024 was “a false economy” which it blamed on the NHS’s failure to recruit enough specialists to read all the scans patients have in its hospitals.The college said the growing outsourcing of scan analysis risked creating “a vicious cycle” in which NHS radiology services were increasingly weakened and its doctors drawn to private work.Dr Katharine Halliday, the RCR’s president, said: “The current sticking plaster approach to managing excess demand in radiology is unsustainable and certainly isn’t working for patients, who face agonising waits for answers about their health.“It is a false economy to be spending over £200m of NHS funds outsourcing radiology work to private companies, and evidence of our failure to train and retain the amount of NHS radiologists we need.”RCR figures show the NHS across the four home nations had 4,923 consultant radiologists in 2023, 1,962 fewer than the 6,467 it believes are needed – a 30% shortfall.The college’s latest annual census of radiology services found that the amount NHS trusts and health boards have paid to private firms rose dramatically from £108m in 2019 to £174m in 2023 and then by another 24% to last year’s £216m.David Rowland, the director of the Centre for Health and the Public Interest thinktank, which tracks NHS privatisation, said the NHS’s increasingoutsourcing of the reporting of scanswas helping to fuel a boom in private diagnostic services, the total value of which experts say is £10.7bn.He said: “The increasing reliance of the NHS on private diagnostic services has only occurred because the NHS has been defunded over the last decade and there hasn’t been sufficient investment in capital infrastructure, such as new scanners.“Relying on private finance to fill that gap is both more costly and risks hollowing out NHS [radiology] departments, as has happened in many other areas of outsourced care.”As a consequence the health service had fewer opportunities to train new radiologists, which endangered the long-term viability of its own radiology services, he added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The next morning, her boyfriend woke to her gasping for air and called 911. Emory University hospital determined she had blood clots in her brain and she was declared brain dead.Newkirk said Smith was now 21 weeks pregnant. Removing breathing tubes and other life-saving devices would probably kill the fetus.Northside did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Emory Healthcare said it could not comment on an individual case because of privacy rules, but released a statement saying it “uses consensus from clinical experts, medical literature, and legal guidance to support our providers as they make individualized treatment recommendations in compliance with Georgia’s abortion laws and all other applicable laws. Our top priorities continue to be the safety and wellbeing of the patients we serve.”Tracking abortion laws across the United StatesRead moreSmith’s family says Emory doctors have told them they are not allowed to stop or remove the devices that are keeping her breathing because state law bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected in the fetus – generally around six weeks into pregnancy.The law was adopted in 2019 but not enforced until after Roe v Wade was overturned in the 2022 Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, opening the door to state abortion bans. Twelvestates are enforcing banson abortion at all stages of pregnancy and three others have bans such as Georgia’s that kick in after about six weeks.Like the others, Georgia’s ban includes an exception if an abortion is necessary to maintain the woman’s life.Smith’s family, including her five-year-old son, still visit her in the hospital.Newkirk told WXIA that doctors told the family that the fetus has fluid on the brain and that they are concerned about his health.“She’s pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” Newkirk said. She has not said whether the family wants Smith removed from life support.Monica Simpson, the executive director ofSisterSong, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging Georgia’s abortion law, said the situation was problematic.“Her family deserved the right to have decision-making power about her medical decisions,” Simpson said in a statement. “Instead, they have endured over 90 days of retraumatization, expensive medical costs, and the cruelty of being unable to resolve and move toward healing.”Explore more on these topicsGeorgiaAbortionRoe v WadeUS healthcareHealthWomenAtlantanewsShareReuse this content"

Doctors said he was thriving, but would need careful monitoring for life.Dr Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a senior physician on the team, said the breakthrough was made possible by “years and years of progress” in gene editing. “While KJ is just one patient, we hope he is the first of many to benefit,” she said.KJ was born with severe CPS1 deficiency, a condition that affects only one in 1.3 million people. Those affected lack a liver enzyme that converts ammonia, from the natural breakdown of proteins in the body, into urea so it can be excreted in urine. This causes a build-up of ammonia that can damage the liver and other organs, such as the brain.While some patients receive liver transplants for CPS1 deficiency, babies with severe disease can have suffered damage by the time they are big enough to operate on.Writing in theNew England Journal of Medicine, the doctors described the painstaking process of identifying the specific mutations behind KJ’s disorder, designing a gene-editing therapy to correct them, and testing the treatment and fatty nanoparticles needed to carry it into the liver. The therapy uses a powerful procedure calledbase editingwhich can rewrite the DNA code one letter at a time.KJ spent his first few months of life in hospital on a restrictive diet, but since his treatment doctors have been able to increase the amount of protein in his food and use less medication to remove nitrogen from his body. Details were presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy annual meeting in New Orleans.The medical team said longer follow-up was needed to see how well the therapy worked, but early signs were encouraging.“The promise of gene therapy that we’ve heard about for decades is coming to fruition, and it’s going to utterly transform the way we approach medicine,” said Prof Kiran Musunuru at the University of Pennsylvania.Dr Miguel Ángel Moreno-Mateos, a geneticist at Pablo de Olavide University in Seville, said: “Although this has been a very specific approach, partly motivated by the devastating nature of the disease, it represents a milestone that demonstrates these therapies are now a reality. As the article reports, the patient will be monitored for a long time to ensure his wellbeing and determine whether additional doses are needed to further improve the symptoms of the disease.”Explore more on these topicsGene editingGeneticsMedical researchHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

These include name-like “signature” whistles, as well as “non-signature” whistles – sounds that make up about 50% of the animals’ calls but are poorly understood.In their latest work, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, the team identified at least 20 different types of non-signature whistle that are produced by multiple dolphins, finding two types were each shared by at least 25 individuals.When the researchers played these two sounds back to dolphins they found one triggered avoidance in the animals, suggesting it could be an alarm signal, while the other triggered a range of responses, suggesting it could be a sound made by dolphins when they encounter something unexpected.Sayigh said the win was a surprise, adding: “I really didn’t expect it, so I am beyond thrilled. It is such an honour.”The judging panel was led by Yossi Yovel, professor of zoology at Tel Aviv University, whose own team has previously used machine-learning algorithms tounpick the meaning of squeaksmade by bats as they argue.“We were mostly impressed by the long term, huge dataset that was created, and we’re sure that it will lead to many more new and interesting results,” said Yovel, adding the judges were also impressed by team’s use of non-invasive technology to record the animals’ calls, and the use of drones and speakers to demonstrate the dolphins’ responses in the field.Yovel added the judges hoped the prize would aid the application of AI to the data to reveal even more impressive results.Jonathan Birch, aprofessor of philosophy at London School of Economics and one of the judges, said the main thing stopping humans from cracking the code of animal communication was a lack of data.“Think of the trillion words needed to train a large language model like ChatGPT. We don’t have anything like this for other animals,” he said.“That’s why we need programs like the Sarasota Dolphin Research Program, which has built up an extraordinary library of dolphin whistles over 40 years. The cumulative result of all that work is that Laela Sayigh and her team can now use deep learning to analyse the whistles and perhaps, one day, crack the code.”Yovel said about 20 teams entered this year’s competition, resulting in four finalists. Besides Sayigh and Tyack’s team, these included teams working on understanding communication innightingales,cuttlefish, andmarmosets. He added the 202-26 prize was now open for applications.As well as an annual award of $100,000, there is also a grand prize up for grabs totalling either $10m in investment or $500,000 in cash. To win that, researchers must develop an algorithm to allow an animal to “communicate independently without recognising that it is communicating with humans” – something Jeremy Coller suggested might be achieved within the next five years.The challenge is inspired by theTuring testfor AI, whereby humans must be unable to tell whether they are conversing with a computer or a real person for the system to be deemed successful.Robert Seyfarth, emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, who was not involved with the prize, welcomed the win. “These are outstanding scientists, doing work that has revolutionised our understanding of dolphin communication and cognition. This is well-deserved recognition,” he said.Clara Mancini, professor of animal-computer interaction at the Open University, said the dolphin work showed technology’s potential to advance our understanding of animal communication, possibly one day even enabling people to communicate with them on their own terms.“I think one of the main benefits of these advances is that they could finally demonstrate that animals’ communication systems can be just as sophisticated and effective for use in the environments in which their users have evolved, as human language is for our species,” she said.“However, on the journey towards interspecies communication, I would suggest, we need to remain mindful that deciphering a language is not the same as understanding the experience of language users and that, as well as curiosity, the challenge requires humility and respect for the unique knowledge and worldview that each species possesses.”Explore more on these topicsAnimalsAnimal behaviourArtificial intelligence (AI)BiologynewsShareReuse this content"

The city’s high school sports team is still known as the Bombers, with a logo that consists of the letter R set with a mushroom cloud.Richland lies just 30 miles from the Hanford nuclear site, a sprawling plant that produced the plutonium for America’s atomic weapons during the second world war – and later the bomb dropped over Nagasaki. Over the decades, thousands of people in the Tri-Cities area of southern Washington worked at the plant, which shuttered in 1989.But a dark legacy of Hanford still lingers here: vast amounts of highly radioactive waste nobody is quite sure what to do with.View image in fullscreenThe Hanford plutonium site in south-eastern Washington state.Photograph: Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesResidents have long spearheaded an operation to deal with 56m gallons of nuclear waste left behind in dozens of underground tanks – a cleanup that is expected to cost half a trillion dollars and may not be completed until 2100. The government has called it “one of the largest and most expensive environmental cleanup projects worldwide”.In recent weeks, what has already been a costly and painstakingly slow process has come under renewed scrutiny, following an exodus of experts from the Department of Energy (DoE) that is overseeing the cleanup being executed by thousands of contract workers.Nuclear waste ravaged their land. The Yakama Nation is on a quest to rescue itRead moreAccordingtolocalmedia, several dozen staff, who reportedly include managers, scientists and safety experts, have taken early retirement or been fired as part of a broader government reduction overseen by Elon Musk and his “department of government efficiency”. The government has refused to provide a specific figure for how many people involved with cleanup efforts have left. The top DoE manager at the Hanford site, Brian Vance, who had many years of experience,resigned at the end of Marchwithout giving a reason.The changes have thrown the communities around the Hanford plant into limbo. And while the Department of Energy has said that only six staff have been fired, and reiterated its commitment to the cleanup, that hasn’t managed to assuage locals’ concerns.Those raising the alarm include politicians from both parties, environmental activists, and Indigenous communitieswho have historically owned the landon which the 560 sq mile (1,450 sq km) site sits.The US senator for Washington Patty Murray said workers were already understaffed, and that cutting further positions was “reckless”.“There is nothing ‘efficient’ about indiscriminately firing thousands upon thousands of workers in red and blue states whose work is badly needed,” the Democrat said.Dan Newhouse, the local Republican congressman is similarly concerned. “A strong, well trained federal workforce is essential,” he wrote in a weekly newsletter to constituents.Concerns have also been raised by some over the difficulty former workers face in making medical compensation claims to the government for everything from cancer to acute pulmonary disease linked to their time at the plant.Taken together, there is fresh anxiety in a community, where many are still living with the health and environmental effects of Hanford.Richland, part of the Tri-Cities, was obtained by the army in 1943to house workers engaged in top-secret efforts to produce plutonium used in the world’s first nuclear explosion – the-so-called “Trinity” device tested near Los Alamos, New Mexico, in 1945. Though the city was returned to the public a decade later, it can still feel like a company town.To get anywhere near what is known as Hanford’s B-reactor, the world’s first full-scale plutonium production reactor, you need to sign up for an official tour. Yet a view of its grey, single tower, looming from the hillside, can be seen from state route 24, close to the Columbia River.View image in fullscreenA sign near Richland, Washington. Locals are concerned about how staffing losses will affect the cleanup.Photograph: Elaine Thompson/APThose expressing concern about the federal government downsizing include local Indigenous groups who historically owned the land where the site is located and were pushed off it by the government. The Hanford plant area contains the location of several sacred sites, among them Gable Mountain, which were used for ceremonies, and the area of Rattlesnake Mountain, or Lalíik, which has for centuries been used to hunt elk.The site is also located close to the Yakama Indian Reservation, home to 11,000 people, and the tribe has long pushed to be central to decisions about the cleanup and what it is eventually used for. The tribe recently signed a deal to carry out their first elk hunt in the area for seven decades.“One of the biggest fears is that without proper manpower, there might not be a very good crew for the cleanup of the property,” says Gerald Lewis, chairman of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. “Without this cleanup, that’s been happening for a number of years, we’re afraid of a nuclear mishap.”Dr Elizabeth McClure, a health data specialist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, is currently conducting research in the communities around Hanford. She says there is a history of government-led cover-ups over the years at the site, including what is known as “the Green Run”, the intentional release of 8,000 so-called curies of iodine-1 into the atmosphere in 1949.By comparison, the leak of radioactive material at the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 involved just a dozen. The Green Run was only acknowledged by the government in 1986. It later emerged that so-called “downwinders”, suffered higher rates of cancer and harm to their lymphatic system.Map of nuclear wasteShe says Indigenous communities, and other marginalised groups, are often not included in research into the broader impact of places such as Hanford.“In public health, we’re doing work to improve the wellbeing of the public,” she says. “If you aren’t getting the insights and feedback of who’s being harmed, you’re not going to be able to make improvements.”Also monitoring developments is Hanford Challenge, an environmental group that has highlighted – among other issues – the estimated million gallons of radioactive waste already leaked into the soil because several dozen storage tanks are cracked.A plan to send 2,000 gallons of waste for treatment in Utah or Texas was put on hold after protests from communities on the route, including the city of Spokane and the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Nikolas Peterson, a spokesperson for Hanford Challenge, is concerned about job losses and how it will impact a cleanup operation that is taking place far away from the public eye.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

While the contractor workforce performs the bulk of the cleanup work, DoE staff play a critical role in setting priorities, ensuring compliance and maintaining transparency with the public,” he said.“A diminished federal presence could slow decision-making, weaken oversight and reduce opportunities for meaningful engagement with stakeholders.”For former plant workers like Larry White, the legacy of Hanford is complex.White says he loved the camaraderie of the job, sucked up the hour-long commute, and didn’t grumble when he was required to put on protective gear that made the temperature soar.View image in fullscreenFormer Hanford worker Larry White (left) and his son Doug.Photograph: Andrew BuncombeBut the job left him with lingering scars. White developed skin cancer and a progressive lung disease that has made it painful to breathe. Even now, as the 83-year-old makes out medical compensation claims, he is not one to complain, even though it hurts to breathe.“I was treated good while I was there. They took care of us,” says White, who owns and helps farm seven acres in Yakima, a town some 45 miles from Hanford.Since 2000, the government has paid out at least $2.2bn to former Hanford employees, representing 13,000 people. White is being helped by his son, Doug White, a consultant, community activist and part-time farmer who ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for Newhouse’s seat in 2022.His son admits he is struggling with the paperwork required to process the claim and is struggling to get help. He says it is essential officials are transparent.“I’m finding it extremely complicated, unintelligible and opaque,” says White. “It’s a struggle. It’s an absolute struggle.”Another former staff member, Richard Badalamente, spent 22 years working as a behavioral scientist at the DoE’s National Laboratory, originally part of the Hanford site. Today he’s a campaigner for environmental and other causes.View image in fullscreenAn employee works in the control room of the N reactor at the Hanford site, circa 1985.Photograph: Roger Ressmeyer/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesBadalamente, 88, says the concerns triggered by news about a reduction in staff symbolise the peculiar relationship between the Hanford community and its history.“The concern is twofold,” he says. He says the economic “fuel” for the region comes from the massive operation that may not be completed for 75 years.He adds: “The concern is the Trump administration will not support a robust cleanup.”It appears many of the recent departures have come as part through voluntary redundancy, or delayed resignation program (DRP), that have been used in other government departments to trim numbers.The DoE said by email it would not provide a number for how many employees had opted for early retirement. It said all requests “were subject to approval, and certain public safety, national security, law enforcement, or other essential employees may not be approved for participation”.It also would not say how staff had been selected. It confirmed Vance’s deputy, Brian Stickney, was among those who had taken early retirement. Vance did not respond to inquiries from the Guardian.Asked about the impact on the cleanup, the spokesperson said: “The DoE is committed to meeting cleanup responsibilities at Hanford safely and effectively while delivering on President Trump’s mission to increase innovation across the federal government and promote greater efficiency and accountability.”In a note to staff, he said: “Hanford’s cleanup mission is one of the most complex and challenging in the world, and the progress we have made is nothing short of remarkable.”How swiftly that progress now goes remains to be seen. Back at the visitors’ museum in Richland, near the black-and-white photos of Ronald Reagans’s 1956 morale-boosting visit to Hanford, a 15-minute informational film highlights in plain, unemotional language the scale of the “unintended consequences and legacies of the Manhattan Project”.Solving these complex environmental problems, the film says, will rely on the same “drive, dedication, human ingenuity and political will” put into building the bomb.Explore more on these topicsWashington stateNuclear wasteWest CoastWasteNuclear powerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After their rediscovery in 1948, their numbers are now at about 500, growing at about 8% a year.The tuatara are commonly referred to as a “living fossil” and are the sole survivor of the ancient reptile order Sphenodontia, which walked the Earth with dinosaurs 225m years ago.They can reproduce past the age of 100 and live up to 200 years, making them one of the longest-living creatures. They are considered “at risk” and survive primarily on a small number of offshore, predator-free islands.Takahē and tuatara only coexist in two locations: Tiritiri Matangi and Zealandia, an urban eco-sanctuary in Wellington.Fisentzidis said the footage was a “neat snapshot” of how these species may have interacted in the past.“It also shows what’s possible … if we really start to rally together to bring more of our native wildlife back.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandWildlifeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They’ve made obscene profits while millions suffer the consequences. It’s only right that those most responsible for the crisis fund the urgent climate action needed, both at home and abroad.”The move comes amid growing concerns over anet zero backlash, partly fuelled by Reform UK, which had record success in local elections and is riding high in political opinion polls. Reform has repeatedly taken aim at net zero policies, claiming that they are paid for by people on lower incomes.Reform’s success hasled to questions over how to pay for the shift to a low-carbon economy. Keir Starmer, speaking in parliament on Wednesday, accused Reform of being “anti-jobs, anti-growth, anti-business and anti-investment”.The bill, formally known as the climate finance fund (fossil fuels and pollution) bill, has almost no chance of becoming law, but is aimed at kickstarting a campaign inside and outside parliament to gather support for measures tomake polluters pay.Polling by More in Common, commissioned by the campaign group Global Witness, indicates that such a campaign could have resonance with voters, including those intending to vote for Reform. It found that two-thirds of UK adults were worried about increasing damages from extreme weather and other effects of the climate crisis, such as sea level rise and crop failure, and that a majority of people who said they would vote Reform if a general election were held tomorrow thought that oil and gas companies should be held responsible for repairing the damage caused by global heating.Seven in 10 Reform-leaning voters supported higher taxes on oil and gas companies and other high-emitting businesses.Flossie Boyd, a senior campaigner at Global Witness, said: “Despite Reform leaders’ vocal opposition to climate action, the poll reveals that most Reform-leaning voters are worried about climate change, and a huge proportion want to see the firms and individuals most responsible for it taxed more.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Animals would scatter and flee, with armadillos, deer, snakes and lizards darting across the ground in search of a new home.The forests of the Gran Chaco were also Rojas’s home. He and his family, members of Argentina’s Indigenous Qom community, lived a nomadic lifestyle in the forest, relying on the woodlands and rivers for shelter and food, relocating about every 20 days to allow the land to regenerate and recover.View image in fullscreenArgentina’s Gran Chaco forest is home to more than 3,400 plant species.Photograph: Hernan Perez Aguirre/GreenpeaceThe Gran Chaco is an expanse of arid woodland that stretches across the northernmost regions of Argentina and into Brazil,Paraguayand Bolivia. It is also the centre of rampant deforestation, driven predominantly by cattle ranching, logging and agriculture, especially the soya industry.“The Chaco is in danger of extinction. We are witnessing an ecocide,” says Rojas. “This has to stop now because otherwise, there won’t be anything left. Nobody is doing anything – not the state nor the justice system; only the Indigenous communities. This directly affects our daily reality and our needs to survive.”A new report published todayby the international environmental and human rights organisation Global Witness shows that the Spanish bankSantander, the 14th largest in the worldand a familiar presence on the British high street, has been indirectly funding deforestation activities in the Gran Chaco, an ecosystem sprawling across Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay.The company Santander has invested in,the Argentinian agribusiness group Cresud, also operates in the region through the Brazilian company BrasilAgro, of which it owns 34.2% of the shares.Global Witness says: “The company [Cresud] has deforested over 170,000 hectares [420,000 acres] in South America since the turn of the century, an area more than three times larger than Madrid.”View image in fullscreenMuch of the cleared land in Argentina has been converted to farmland for growing soya and raising livestock.Photograph: Terra/Modis/NasaKnown to local Argentinians as the “Impenetrable Chaco”, the area has an Indigenous population of5.6 million people spread across the four countries. It is also one of South America’s largest ecosystems and one of the region’s last climate-critical forests, home to more than 3,400 plant species and nearly 900 bird, mammal, reptile and amphibian species.Looking at its policies, Santander does not appear to be a very prudent organisationOla Janus, BankTrackThe report asserts thatSantanderhas “co-arranged”, along with “multiple Argentinean and international banks”, a total of $1.3bn (£980m) of financing for Cresud since 2011.“The total of $1.3bn was jointly underwritten by Santander with multiple Argentinean and international banks, with Santander frequently taking the role of a lead underwriter,” the report says. “Santander co-led banking groups have helped underwrite over three-quarters of the bonds issued by the company since 2011, and the bank has provided over $50m in loans to Cresud directly.”Santander’s financing of Cresud took place despite the bank introducing adeforestation limitation policyin 2018 and committing to a goal ofnet-zero emissions in its portfolio by 2050. “Since the policy was first published, Santander has been a co-underwriter of $850m of debt for Cresud,” says the report.According to Global Witness, “Santander is a lead or principal underwriter for 35 of the 47 bonds issued by the company since 2002, and consortia co-lead by the bank accounts for over 90% of the total dollar value of bonds issued by the company.”View image in fullscreenFields in Salta province, Argentina. The amount of cultivated land in the country grew by nearly a third between 2001 and 2022.Photograph: GreenpeacePart of the funding backed by Santander would have been used to buy and deforest land across the Chaco region via a “real estate model”, according to Global Witness.Santander, one of theEU’s five largest banks by assets, is also the bloc’s leading lender to “forest-risk” companies. In 2024, it provided more than$600m (£452m) in financingto firms linked to beef, palm oil, soya and other agricultural supply chains that are significant drivers of deforestation.‘The forests are going up in flames – so is the rule of law’: Argentina’s climate of fearRead moreCharlie Hammans, author of the Global Witness report, says: “The business model is finding areas to develop, purchasing them cheaply, clearing them and then selling them on. The Chaco is deemed non-productive land to be converted into productive land, as opposed to a vital ecosystem and also home to vast amounts ofIndigenous peoplesto be defended.”Global Witness asked Santander if its financing of Cresud breached the bank’s policies. In response, Santander says its “practice is not to comment on information relating to clients or specific transactions”.A Santander spokesperson also described the allegations in the report as “containing imprecision and potential information regarding our policies that is not accurate”, but did not provide specific evidence to support that statement.View image in fullscreenThe land is often cleared to make way for livestock.Photograph: Leandro Herrera/GreenpeaceJanus, head of the banks and nature campaign at the financial monitoring campaign organisation BankTrack, says: “Looking at its policies, Santander does not appear to be a very prudent organisation. There’s a lot of space for improvement in making those policies stringent.“To truly stop these issues, we need a fundamental transformation in how the financial sector operates because it’s still neocolonial.”Neither Santander nor Cresud responded to the Guardian’s requests for comment.In recent decades, the Gran Chaco has become an agricultural hub and driver of the regional economy. Cultivation of soya beans has expanded, with a 30% increase of the area under production in Argentina between 2001 and 2022, while Paraguay saw a 15-fold rise from 2012 to 2022, according to theWorld Economic Forum.Livestock production has also increased, especially in Paraguay, where67.4% of beef exportsoriginate from the Gran Chaco. In Argentina, the region is home to33% of the country’s cattle.Clearing of forests across the Chaco linked to such agricultural expansion has left the region morevulnerable to the climate crisis, worsening theeffects of droughts, floods, heatwaves and forest fires. Argentina suffered $2.67bn inexport lossesdue to drought in 2022.View image in fullscreenForest clearance has left the region more vulnerable to the effects of droughts, flooding and fires.Photograph: Osvaldo Tesoro/GreenpeaceAccording to Global Witness data, most of the deforested land – more than 100,000 hectares (250,000 acres) – is in Argentina, where deforestation has long scarred the northern provinces of Formosa, Santiago del Estero, Salta and Chaco, where companies such as Cresud operate.In the past 25 years, Greenpeace Argentina calculates that approximately 8m hectares of native forest land have been lost in the country, withalmost 80% of that deforestation occurring in Argentina’s Gran Chaco.The expansion of the logging industry means not only the plundering of resources but also of our languagesIndigenous Wichí leader“In the last few decades, the Gran Chaco is probably one of the most deforested areas on the planet,” says Hernán Giardini, coordinator of Greenpeace Argentina’s forest campaigns.He notes that, besides the loss of biodiversity, local communities are also affected. “Indigenous people are often the ones who suffer the most from the impact. They may be reduced to a limited space where their way of hunting, gathering and fishing becomes unviable.”View image in fullscreenThe way of life of local communities has been severely affected by deforestation in Argentina.Photograph: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty ImagesCommunities inthe Argentinian Chaco have complained repeatedlyabout feeling excluded from the consultation required for agrobusinesses to obtain land.‘A cemetery of trees’: vast green expanses turned to dust as loggers plunder South America’s Gran ChacoRead moreInternational law recognises the right of Indigenous peoples and local communitiesto reject projects that affect their way of life. Any such projects require their free, prior and informed consent to proceed.“The expansion of the logging industry means not only the plundering of resources but also of our languages. They are trying to wipe us off the map,” says a Wichí leader from Formosa province, speaking anonymously.The leader adds: “We have the obligation, passed down from our grandparents, to always take care of and defend our land and to convey its importance. We are more than ready and committed to defending our land, languages and customs.”Hammans says unchecked deforestation and the financing of companies linked to it are caused by the “lack of international scrutiny, outdated laws that are poorly enforced – if ever, lack of resourcing for the ministries that carry out the checks, as well as governments that stand completely behind the agricultural industries”.View image in fullscreenMost of the deforestation in Argentina has been in the Gran Chaco region.Photograph: Nicolás Villalobos/Greenpeace/The GuardianAt the current pace of deforestation, Paraguay’s Gran Chaco region could completely vanish by 2080, Global Witness calculates.Giardini and Hammans stress that Cresud and similar companies operate within the bounds of legality and blame feeble and outdated policies for fostering a climate that allows such practices to flourish.“The environmental regulations regarding what these companies can do should be radically revised to determine whether any clearance going forward is viable. I really don’t think it is,” Hammans says. “The system is broken fundamentally, and to see real change, we need real regulation.”Explore more on these topicsDeforestationSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanBanco SantanderParaguayIndigenous peoplesAmericasArgentinafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Starmer jetted off and now the Albanian prime minister has made clear that there will be no UK return hubs in Albania. So, what was the point of this entire visit?”British officials had hoped to establish return hubs in the western Balkans, with Albania previously seen as a potential partner.Starmer told GB News that officials had begun formal negotiations with potential host countries but he refused to reveal which ones.“What now we want to do and are having discussions of, talks of, is return hubs, which is where someone has been through the system in the UK, they need to be returned and we have to make sure they’re returned effectively, and we’ll do that, if we can, through return hubs,” he said.If established, the return hubs will be used to process asylum seekers who have lost their paperwork or who are considered to be trying to frustrate their deportation.Downing Street confirmed the plan but gave few other details. Starmer’s official spokesperson said: “We are having formal discussions with partners across Europe on the prospects of collaborating on return hubs. Return hubs are targeted at failed asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal routes to remain in the UK but are currently here, costing millions of taxpayers.”He said the aim was to focus on asylum seekers whose legal routes had ended but were using “stalling tactics”, which he said included saying they had lost their documentation, or who were starting a family.Removing people to their home countries was difficult under such circumstances, the spokesperson said, but there were fewer legal obstacles to taking them to a third country where the processing could continue.Rama said he would not try to establish a deal with the UK because he was already engaged in a similar process with Italy. “We have been asked by several countries if we were open to it and we said no, because we are loyal to the marriage with Italy and the rest is just love,” Rama said.Italy has two detention centres in Albania to process refused asylum seekers, with 40 people having been sent to the centres so far despite a number of legal challenges.Starmer’s spokesperson rejected the idea that Rama’s remarks had been a surprise, saying the PM and his officials knew beforehand that Albania had no interest in hosting a UK return hub.Asked if it was peculiar to make such an announcement in Albania, when the country was not part of the plans, he rejected this: “The prime minister was making a visit in relation to illegal migration. I think it is entirely relevant.”Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “Threatening to detain people in countries they’ve never set foot in causes fear and panic, leading to low rates of compliance. The government’s approach to returns must be based on evidence if it’s going to work and it is clear that the most effective returns systems are not punitive but orderly and humane.”This week the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats passed 12,000 for the year to date, putting 2025 on course to be a record year for such crossings.In March, the EU announced it had approved of member states pursuing the approach of return hubs. The Netherlands is in negotiations with Uganda about such a possibility.The UN refugee agency has also endorsed the idea of return hubs, which is significant given that the UN intervened against the Conservative government’s Rwanda scheme, which led to it being ruled unlawful.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumLabourKeir StarmerAlbaniaForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

He is also charged with an offence contrary to the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and three counts of fraud by false representation.Rahman appeared before Southend magistrates court on Thursday and was remanded in custody until a plea hearing at Basildon crown court on 9 June.The second man has been conditionally bailed until July.Insp Steve Parry, of the Basildon neighbourhood policing team, said: “This has been an extremely intensive investigation – to have secured such significant charges within 36 hours of making an arrest is a real testament to the unwavering commitment of the officers here in Basildon.“The public sentiment surrounding this investigation is not lost on us and I would continue to urge the public to be responsible when discussing this, both online and in person. We are also acutely aware there will be a number of people, potentially across the UK, who may have questions on the current situation or information which they want us to know about.“We have now set up a dedicated public portal through which we would ask for people to make contact.”He said the investigation was likely to be complex and potentially far-reaching.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

But what it offers the creative industries and UK AI companies is a clear timeline, and a mechanism by which licensing and not stealing can become the norm.”Owen Meredith, chief executive of the News Media Association, said: “This new amendment removes any potential direct spending implications for enforcement – which was the Commons’ objection to the previous drafting – and would ensure copyright owners receive clear, relevant, accurate and accessible information about how their work is accessed and used, but gives the government flexibility over exactly how this is achieved.“The entire creative industries, the voting public, and multiple parliamentary reports and debates have given a clear view to the government that action now to ensure rights holders are better equipped to enforce the existing law, with the proportionate application of transparency, is a progressive way forward. It’s time to act, not just ‘listen’.”InWednesday’s debate, the data protection minister, Chris Bryant, told MPs that although he recognised that for many in the creative industries this “feels like an apocalyptic moment”, he did not think the transparency amendment delivered the required solutions, and he argued that changes needed to be completed “in the round and not just piecemeal”. He added that the sooner the data bill was passed, the quicker he would be able to make progress on updating copyright law.The government’s copyright proposals are the subject of a consultation due to report back this year, but opponents of the plans have used the data bill as a vehicle for registering their disapproval.The main government proposal is to let AI firms use copyright-protected work to build their models without permission unless the copyright holders opt out – a solution that critics say is unworkable.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Intellectual propertyBeeban KidronHouse of LordsnewsShareReuse this content"

But by nightfall there was little sign that any last-minute summit involving the US president was in the works.Zelenskyy and Putin have each been manoeuvring to position themselves favourably in front of Trump, who has grown increasingly impatient with the slow pace of the talks, with each leader casting the other as the main obstacle to progress.Zelenskyy said: “I believe the most important thing for Ukraine is to remain constructive and reasonable. That’s why we’re sending a delegation led by the defence ministry – so that no one can claim Ukraine is responsible for derailing the talks.”0:54Ukraine breakthrough depends on meeting between Trump and Putin, says Rubio – videoZelenskyy had travelled to Ankara with a team of his closest aides on Thursday, while Russia’s mid-level delegation, led by Vladimir Medinsky, an ultra-conservative, landed earlier in the day in Istanbul, where hundreds of journalists camped out for hours awaiting without success the start of the talks.Throughout the conference in Ankara, Zelenskyy sought to frame Russia’s choice of delegation as a sign to Trump that Moscow was not approaching the talks in good faith. He told reporters that the Russian delegation that arrived in Istanbul did not include “anyone who actually makes decisions”, accusing Moscow of not making efforts to end the war seriously.“I feel disrespected by Russia. No meeting time, no agenda, no high-level delegation – this is a personal disrespect … [to] Erdoğan, to Trump,” Zelenskyy said. “We can’t be running around the world looking for Putin,” he added when asked whether the Russian president was avoiding a direct meeting with him.But there is little evidence so far that Trump is receptive to Zelenskyy’s plea, with the US leader on Thursday refusing to criticise the Russian delegation.Any hopes of a serious breakthrough appear to have been dashed by Putin’s decision not to send his two most senior diplomats, Yuri Ushakov and Sergei Lavrov, and instead delegate the talks tolower-ranking aides.Observers say that by appointing Medinsky, a former culture minister, to lead the delegation, Putin is signalling he has little interest in genuine compromise and remains committed to the same objectives he pursued in 2022: stripping Ukraine of its sovereignty and military capability.View image in fullscreenVladimir Medinsky, second left, and colleagues in Istanbul.Photograph: Vladimir Soldatkin/ReutersMedinsky, who also led the failed peace talks in March 2022, held a hastily arranged press conference at the Russian consulate in Istanbul. He described the current negotiations as a continuation of those earlier talks, which included sweeping demands such as limiting Ukraine’s armed forces and blocking it from rebuilding with western support. Kyiv has repeatedly rejected those terms as unacceptable.Medinsky also echoed a well-worn Kremlin talking point, saying Russia aimed to address the “root causes” of the war – a phrase frequently used by Putin to justify the invasion.Boris Bondarev, a former senior Russian diplomat who resigned after Russia’s full invasion of Ukraine, said: “Putin clearly doesn’t want any genuine peace talks, nor any ceasefire, unless it’s entirely on his terms.”Bondarev said Putin had proposed the talks in Turkey with the aim of convincing Trump he was committed to peace, while he remained intent on continuing the fighting on the ground.With Russian forces making slow but steady progress on the battlefield, Putin – seemingly confident that Russia can outlast Ukraine – is refusing to halt the fighting before securing major concessions from Kyiv and the west.Even before Moscow and Kyiv meet in Istanbul, Zelenskyy and Ukraine’s European allies were urging the US to impose new sanctions if the sides fail to agree on a ceasefire.“If there is no ceasefire, no bilateral meetings, we are asking for sanctions to end the war more quickly,” Zelenskyy said. “We want a strong package of sanctions against Russia from the US, European countries – there must be pressure from the global south.“Trump’s position is to put pressure on both sides. I believe that we were put under more pressure,” Zelenskyy said, adding that Ukraine had “step by step demonstrated a willingness for negotiations”.He said: “You have to pressurise the side that does not want to end the war.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinUS foreign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Other red flags include overly nosy small talk with locals, a short, military-style haircut, or tourists who do not know the terrain but have an unusual amount of outdoor survival equipment such as specialised medical kits, maps or radios.MIDD, one of Latvia’s three security agencies, said such giveaways could help citizens ferret out agents casing “critical infrastructure and military facilities” for sabotage, plotting targeted killings or fomenting unrest.It said Russian operatives had upped their game in recent years, with training in chameleon-like disguises that made them harder to detect. “The Ukrainian experience shows that Russian special services are able to adapt to the environment and circumstances in which reconnaissance-saboteur groups are used,” MIDD said. “Their members may not visually correspond to the classic reconnaissance-saboteur profile.”The agents could be part of groups lingering near sensitive sites, posing as humanitarian workers or sleeping in remote areas without showing any interest in nature, the agency added.However, the security service cautioned ordinary citizens against vigilante actions on suspected Russian agents, stressing that police and the military were best equipped to take over when suspicion arose.Latvia’s public broadcaster reported that state security had issuedsimilar but less detailed spy-spotting tips for the public to report suspicious activitytwo years ago, after Russia’s full-scale invasion ofUkraine.As tensions with the west have soared, EU and Nato member states have been on high alert for Russian sabotageamid a wave of cyber-attacks, arson and undersea cable damage blamed on Moscow.The Kremlin has denied the allegations.On Wednesday, German federal prosecutors said three Ukrainian nationals had been arrestedon suspicion of plotting parcel bomb attacks in Germanyon behalf the Russian state.Last July, European security agencies were alarmed bythree separate explosionsin packages sent from Lithuania which detonated in Birmingham, in the UK; Leipzig, in Germany; and near Warsaw, in Poland.

From Lucian Freud and Celia Paul to Lubaina Himid and Claudette Johnson, this cracking show provides absorbing insightsEliza GoodpastureThu 15 May 2025 10.53 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 10.55 EDTShareStanding in front of Frank Auerbach’s quietly harrowing charcoal portrait of Leon Kossoff and Kossoff’s own heavily textured, dour portrait of Auerbach, I felt as if I was caught between the gazes of the two artists. Caught in the balance of their stares, seeing the way each sees the other, I was both implicated and invisible.Moments like these are the most intimate and affecting in Pallant House’s new exhibition of portraits of artists by artists. When a portrait of one artist by another is hung beside their portrait of the other, we find ourselves caught between them. There are many pairs of lovers featured, including Matthew Smith and his mistress Vera Cunningham orLucian Freudand Celia Paul, as well as works by friends such as Auerbach and Kossoff or Nina Hamnett and Roger Fry. In some cases, such as the two paintings by Smith and Cunningham, it’s easy to see how the two artists influenced each other as they found a shared visual language of heavy, impressionistic brushstrokes and a dark, jewel-like palette. In others, the aesthetic distinctness is what draws you in.View image in fullscreenNina Hamnett by Roger Fry.Photograph: University of Leeds Art CollectionThere are also delightful little moments in which multiple paintings of the same artist are hung together, all painted by different people. The exhibition moves chronologically from the turn of the 20th century to the present, and there is a series of portraits of Walter Sickert at the start of the exhibition by three different women in his life: his friends Sylvia Gosse and Nina Hamnett, and one of his wives, Thérèse Lessore. Each portrays him entirely differently: Gosse shows him standing in profile, his middle-aged potbelly declaring his prosperity; Hamnett shows only his face, gazing directly at her from under the brim of his black hat; Lessore shows him from the back, the profile of his face hardly legible. The complexity of trying to convey a likeness in a portrait is profoundly evident when confronted with a group like this. If these women who knew Sickert so well each paint him so differently, what was he really like? Perhaps only via many representations can the real man begin to emerge.Moving from the bohemian London of early 20th century through pre-war modernism and eventually to pop art, the London School, the YBAs, and up to the present, this exhibition makes a compelling case for a story of British modern art that is communal and collaborative. The interlocking circles of portraits that emerge make it obvious that the avant garde movements that evolved in and out of existence throughout 20th-century Britain were as social as they were professional. Walking through the galleries feels like drifting through a cocktail party, going from group to group of interesting, chatty friends – much like the scene of a Slade tea party painted by Seóirse Macantisionnaigh.There is rivalry and darkness here, too – husband and wife John Bratby and Jean Cooke’s portraits of each other are hung on either side of a doorway, which neatly emphasises the antagonism between them. Sickert’s portrait of unhappily married couple Roald Kristian and Nina Hamnett oozes with their apathy for each other, and Cedric Morris’s remarkably unflattering portrait ofBarbara Hepworthcan readily be read as a document of his dislike for her.View image in fullscreenLines of influence … Bridget Riley by Lubaina Himid.Photograph: richierobs@mac.com/Courtesy of Lubaina Himid, Hollybush Gardens, London and Greene Naftali, New York © Lubaina Himid, Photo: Gavin RenshawThe exhibition is the last in Pallant House’s ambitious trilogy of exhibitions on modern British art – exploring first still life, then landscape and now portraits. There are moments when the exhibition feels like it belongs at the National Portrait Gallery, as it can feel it is tracing celebrity rather than aesthetic exchange. But for the most part, it triumphs in crafting a cohesive story of visual, and literal, conversations between artists on the canvas. I wanted it to be bigger, and kept thinking of artists who I felt were missing, which is a sign of how effective the curatorial construct is: it welcomes a way of considering the history of art via relationships, which is inherently expansive. There are always more artists to include.The contemporary section of the show is the biggest and most broad. It includes portraits of real-life friends, including a wonderful group of three iconic works by the artists Chantal Joffe and Ishbel Myerscough, who have been painting portraits of themselves together since their student days in Glasgow. It also includes portraits exploring relationships between artists of the present with those of the past. Gillian Wearing’s photograph of herself as Georgia O’Keeffe, for example, or Caroline Coon’s reimagined painting of the pop artist Pauline Boty, widen the notion of a relationship to include transhistorical, imagined but still intimate relationships between artists through time.The exhibition has a circular route, so it both opens and closes with Lubaina Himid’s painted wooden figures of female artists from the past and present, including Élisabeth Vigée-le Brun, Frida Kahlo,Bridget Riley(represented entirely by stripes), and Himid’s real-life friend, Claudette Johnson. The life-sized women are a fitting encapsulation of the exhibition’s ethos: that artists see each other with profound depth, and that art itself is born out of intimacy and influence.Seeing Each Other: Portraits of Artists is at Pallant House Gallery, Chichester,17 May to 2 NovemberExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtFrank AuerbachLucian FreudBarbara HepworthChantal JoffeGillian WearingreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Vanishing (1993)Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) obsesses over the fate of his missing girlfriend in George Sluizer’s American remake of his own 1988 Franco-Dutch psychochiller. Is it as devastating as the original? Absolutely not! But Jeff Bridges has never been creepier, and at least the dumb Hollywood ending won’t give you nightmares.19. Funny Games (2007)In case we sickos didn’t get the message in 1997, Austrian gloom-meister Michael Haneke recycles his brutally efficient home invasion diatribe shot-for-shot, but this time in English. Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet play polite young men who knock on Naomi Watts’ door and ask to borrow eggs. What happens next will harsh your vibe.18. Dinner for Schmucks (2010)Steve Carell plays Barry Speck, whose passion is building dead mice dioramas, making him the perfect stooge for a dinner party where rich scumbags mock eccentric losers. Hollywood sweetens an acidic French farce, Le Dîner de Cons (1998), and bungles its subplots, but compensations include Carell going full-on nerd and Jemaine Clement as a pretentious artist.17. Oldboy (2013)View image in fullscreenHalf-baked … Josh Brolin in Old Boy (2013).Photograph: Universal Pictures/AllstarYou can’t fault Josh Brolin’s commitment to his role as an alcoholic advertising executive trying to discover why he was held prisoner for 20 years in Spike Lee’s Americanisation of Park Chan-wook’s baroque revenge thriller. But an uneasy mix of neo-noir realism and South Korean stylisation makes it feel like a half-baked copy of the 2003 masterpiece.16. Speak No Evil (2024)Those who prefer their horror grim should stick with the 2002 Danish-Dutch original. James Watkins’ do-over, in which an American family goes to stay with the friendly Britons they met on holiday, is more conventional, but also more fun, with James McAvoy attaining peak psycho as a host testing the limits of his guests’ good manners. That damnable stuffed rabbit appears in both versions.15. The Birdcage (1996)If you must film an American version of a hit French farce, you might as well get Elaine May to write the dialogue, as Mike Nichols does here. Gay couple Armand and Albert (Robin Williams and Nathan Lane) try to pass as straight when their son’s fiancee’s parents come to dinner. Chucklesome complications include Gene Hackman, bless him, dressed in drag.14. The Grudge (2004)Takashi Shimizu directs the US remake of his own haunted house franchise, but keeps it in Tokyo, with American actors imported to play cannon fodder for Greasy-Haired Ghost and Small Boy Who Makes Mewing Noises. The story is confusing, which somehow makes the scary bits (the lift! Oh good grief, the bedclothes!) even scarier.13. Unfaithful (2002)Claude Chabrol’s La Femme Infidèle (1969) gets the Hollywood treatment from Adrian Lyne, with unexpectedly classy results. Diane Lane is wonderful as an unhappy housewife who embarks on an affair, while her husband (Richard Gere) finds murdering her lover more therapeutic than any amount of marriage counselling.12. Vanilla Sky (2001)View image in fullscreenFrom Madrid to Manhattan … Penélope Cruz and Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarTom Cruise plays a New York yuppie whose reality starts to fragment after a car crash. Writer and director Cameron Crowe transposes Alejandro Amenábar’s lower budgeted brain teaser from Madrid to Manhattan; Penélope Cruz plays the girlfriend in both versions. Crowe is no Amenábar, alas, but he does have a bigger star, and more pop music.11. Insomnia (2002)From Ripley to Ragnarok: Cate Blanchett’s 20 best film performances – ranked!Read moreChristopher Nolan’s remake of a 1997 Norwegian thriller will seem perfectly acceptable to anyone who hasn’t seen the tauter, more claustrophobic original. Al Pacino plays a Los Angeles detective summoned north to investigate a murder in Alaska, where constant daylight and lack of sleep lead to a fatal error. Robin Williams, in one of his three creepy performances that same year, plays the killer.10. Sweet Charity (1960)Bob Fosse made his screen directing debut with the film of the Broadway show based on Federico Fellini’s Nights of Cabiria (1957). Shirley MacLaine plays the ever-hopeful taxi dancer with a talent for picking the wrong guy. It flopped, but nowadays we can only gaze in awe at impeccably choreographed musical numbers such as the Rich Man’s Frug.9. True Lies (1994)James Cameron pumps testosterone and money into what began as a modest French action-comedy, La Totale! (1991). Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Harry Tasker, a superspy whose wife thinks he’s a boring salesman. Cameron distracts you from the film’s mean-spirited elements by blowing up half the Florida Keys.8. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2011)View image in fullscreenSlicker … Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.Photograph: Baldur Bragason/Sony Pictures/AllstarDavid Fincher’s adaptation of Stieg Larsson’s bestseller is slicker than its 2009 Swedish predecessor, is set to a terrific Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross score, and features fake Swedish accents from everyone except Daniel Craig and Stellan Skarsgård. What it doesn’t have is the 2009 film’s Noomi Rapace, the definitive Lisbeth Salander.7. The Departed (2006)Martin Scorsese finally won an Oscar for his remake of the cracking Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002). Leonardo DiCaprio plays a cop in deep cover with the Boston mafia, Matt Damon a mobster who has infiltrated the police. It’s a lot baggier than its prototype, and further knocked off balance by Jack Nicholson’s untrammelled scenery chewing as mob boss Frank Costello.6. Let Me In (2010)Matt Reeves does a decent job of Americanising Tomas Alfredson’s vampire masterpiece, with the Swedish housing estate replaced by Reagan-era New Mexico, where a bullied 12-year-old schoolboy befriends the mysterious girl next door. Reeves tends to spell out what might be better left implicit, but comes into his own in some added action sequences.5. The Ring (2002)View image in fullscreenNerve-racking … Samara Morgan in Gore Verbinkski’s remake of The Ring.Photograph: Dreamworks/AllstarWhile most American J-horror remakes dilute their originals, Gore Verbinski’s reworking of Hideo Nakata’s Ring (1998) whips up an entirely different but no less nerve-racking ambience, making full use of a bigger budget, Pacific Northwest locations and Naomi Watts as the journalist investigating a viral death curse spread by VHS.4. Wrath of Man (2021)Though not as lean and mean as Le Convoyeur (2004), its French progenitor, Guy Ritchie’s revenge thriller does its own thing, ties an initially simple narrative into convoluted knots, and unleashes Jason Statham on a hardboiled cast playing armoured truck guards. All this without any of the laddishness that mars some of Ritchie’s other work, making this his most satisfying film in years.3. Quick Change (1990)Bill Murray co-directs as well as stars in this nifty remake of Hold-Up (1985), a French Canadian action comedy starring Jean-Paul Belmondo. Murray is at his sardonic best as Grimm, a bankrobber disguised as a clown. The robbery is easy; the hard part is trying to get out of town with the loot. Whereas the original gets bogged down in car chases, Murray’s remake keeps it tense and funny to the end.2. Sorcerer (1977)William Friedkin said his adaptation of Georges Arnaud’s novel was not a remake, but since it had already been filmed by Henri-Georges Clouzot as The Wages of Fear (1953), let’s call it one anyway. Either way, this action-thriller about four expat losers driving dynamite-laden trucks across rugged Latin American terrain is now almost as much of a classic as its antecedent, enhanced by Tangerine Dream’s haunting score and Roy Scheider’s demonstrating the ultimate thousand-yard stare.1. The Magnificent Seven (1960)View image in fullscreenSamurai to saddle … (from second left) Yul Brynner, Horst Buchholz and Steve McQueen in The Magnificent Seven.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyAkira Kurosawa’s samurai movies were already heavily influenced by the western genre, so it wasn’t hard for Hollywood to convert Seven Samurai (1954) back into a bona fide oater. Yul Brynner plays gunslinger Chris, who persuades six mercenaries to protect a Mexican village from bandits, then spends the rest of the film trying not to get upstaged by Steve McQueen, James Coburn and an Elmer Bernstein score that makes you break out in goose pimples. One of the best remakes ever.Explore more on these topicsFilmRankedSpike LeeOldboyThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (US)The DepartedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But beneath the razor sharp jokes is a schmaltzy show that tugs at the heartstringsRachel AroestiThu 15 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 04.30 EDTShareIn the pandemic, Benito Skinner became internet famous for his camply unhinged impressions of celebrities, reality stars and LA types: his roster includes a devil-worshipping Kris Jenner, Billie Eilish at the beach and a twitching, gurgling Timothée Chalamet. By then, the comedian had been uploading videos for years. A clip from 2019 titled Live Footage of Me in the Closet sees Skinner comb his fringe forward, don an Abercrombie tee and travel back to the late 00s to resurrect his teenage self, a boy denying his love for Gossip Girl while repeatedly insisting he’s “not gay” until the screen erupts into a manic collage of Lady Gaga dance routines, Google results for “daniel radcliffe equus naked” and the iTunes page for Glee: The Music, Volume 1.Six years on, Skinner is reprising the role. Overcompensating, an eight-part Prime Video comedy drama, begins with a similarly unconvincing claim. “Hey, what’s up everybody. I’m Benny, I love pussy,” our hero tells his reflection, an assertion undermined by flashbacks of furtive childhood rewinds of George of the Jungle, plus more recent footage of him leaning back in disgust from his beautiful prom date. The show goes on to fictionalise Skinner’s first year at university, a time spent desperately trying to convince himself and others that he was totallynot gay.There is, however, one big difference between Skinner’s social media oeuvre and his first proper TV project. Online, the 31-year-old is the sole comedic engine: trussed-up, gurning, a master of mischievous parody. Here, however, he plays it almost entirely straight – in both senses. Benny was a popular football player in high school, plus homecoming king and valedictorian, as his new bestie, the unconventionally cool Carmen (Wally Baram), guesses. He is wholesome, absurdly handsome and incredibly nice; an instant campus heart-throb. His secret desires mean he is also meticulously repressed: the only glimpse of the madcap streak that sent Skinner viral comes during a cringeworthy dorm party scene. Faced with a trio of dudes singing along to Like a G6, a drunken Benny decides to showcase his own rapping talents with an energetic rendition of Nicki Minaj’s Super Bass (Overcompensating is not a period piece – Instagram Stories exists – but the music choices are very nostalgic).View image in fullscreenGetting high off their own virility … Overcompensating.Photograph: Jackie Brown/PrimeLuckily, there are others able to take up the comic mantle. The first is Carmen’s breathlessly problematic but strangely lovable roomie Hailee, a walking TMI who mimes sex acts between bouts of hysteria. She is played flawlessly by the actor who goes mononymously by Holmes (best known for playing the Daisy May Cooper character in the US adaptation of This Country). Then there’s Peter, the high-status boyfriend of Benny’s sister and fellow student Grace (Mary Beth Barone), who is determined to take “Bento” under his wing. The White Lotus’s Adam DiMarco does an exceptional job of infusing this heinous wannabe alpha with humanity while squeezing every drop of hilarity from his ludicrous vernacular of “yee”s and “nah”s. At one point, Peter and his pals get so high off their own virility that they explode into an orgy of roaring, chest-thumping and shirt-ripping – a pastiche of frat bro masculinity that is quite exquisite.Overcompensating is also expert at the incidental joke: Benny’s perennially nude roommate sleeping soundly in his bed while pre-drinks rage around him, the pal of Peter’s who announces that he needs the toilet seconds into any social encounter, the film class where everyone loves The Godfather. Less entertaining is the subplot involving a pre-Brat Charli xcx concert (she and Skinner are close friends; the pop star’s music also plays throughout).Yet despite such japes, the show’s dominant tone ends up being one of heartfelt sincerity. Benny’s attempts at personal growth – ditching the laddy social life of his youth, trying to wriggle out of the business degree his dad (Kyle MacLachlan) pushed him into and meeting new friends – are spiked with knockabout humour, but at its core this is a very earnest and, at points, schmaltzily American show about embracing your true self. The combination of Benny’s sexuality-based struggles and Carmen’s attempts to grapple with grief (her elder brother died the year before) means the ratio of laughs to sentimental musings occasionally feel out of whack – but there is still much to enjoy. Just don’t come to Overcompensating expecting wall-to-wall comedy; this is a thoroughly charming show with a very sensitive soul.Overcompensating is on Prime Video nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not for her, the album that represents the soundtrack to a film that hasn’t been made yet, or a sci-fi-influenced cosmic opera, or a globe-spanning travelogue inspired by the peripatetic lifestyle of a DJ. Her acclaimed 2019 debut album was calledTangerine, a title she chose because she “really like[s] fruit”. A journalist who gamely attempted to press further, inquiring about the images conjured in her mind while creating the music, was told: “Moments on the dancefloor.”View image in fullscreenShanti Celeste: RomanceTangerine featured ambient interludes and the sound of Celeste playing the kalimba in the living room of her father’s home in Chile (she moved to the UK with her mother as a child). But its signature sound was the author’s own, in which the subtlety and depth of classic US house productions by Moodymann, Masters at Work and Mood II Swing was melded with a giddy, rave-y euphoria and rhythms that proceeded at pacy tempos more common to techno. Called upon to come up with a term to describe it, she offered the admirably prosaic “fast house”. There’s something very telling about the fact that her career – first as a DJ, then a club promoter, record label boss and ultimately an artist – flourished after she quit university, irked that tutors on her illustration course kept asking her what her work meant: “I wouldn’t be able to explain it. I just wanted to paint.”Whether you view all this as a failure of imagination or an admirably unpretentious approach to a genre of music never much improved by grandiose statements of intent is up to you. Either way, it hasn’t impeded Celeste’s progress, nor is it something she’s sought to change. Six years on – a lengthy gap, punctuated by a handful of singles and a string of remixes forOrbital,CaribouandRuf Dug, among others – her straightforwardness is still much in evidence. Tangerine’s follow-up is called Romance, the reasons for which are swiftly apparent: “This is a romance – take heed, because I’m lost without you,” runs one lyric. “I’m thinking about you more than ever,” offers another.Shanti Celeste: Thinking About You – videoThat said, the presence of lyrics indicates that it’s a noticeably different album from its predecessor. The influence of revered US dance producers remains – the bassline of Note to Self could have fallen off a vintage Chicago house track – but only three of its tracks feature four-to-the-floor beats. For the most part, Romance proceeds at a far more leisurely pace: its key rhythmic sound isn’t an insistent kick drum, but the clatter of percussion vaguely evocative of Celeste’s Latin American roots, proceeding as unhurried as an R&B slow jam. More striking still are the vocals. An intermittent feature of her releases since the early 2010s, here they’re front and centre throughout. Her music has always been marked by a strong melodic sense, but the tunes are noticeably brighter, their pop-leaning qualities accentuated by the airiness of her voice. Even the house-fuelled Unwind, or Thinking About You, on which the vocals are a little more smeared, feel less obviously focused on the dancefloor than on melody, as if they’re waiting for a club-leaning remix.Regardless of the beat behind them, the results are disarmingly charming. Too drowsy and blurred to function as straightforward pop-R&B – the songs largely eschew verses and choruses in favour of a more scattered, mood-building approach – and too obviously sunlit to soundtrack the curtains-drawn post-club comedown, a lot of Romance exists in an appealing space of its own. Light As a Feather or Note to Self are more interested in circling back on themselves than going anywhere, but that scarcely seems to matter: they’re pretty inviting, the atmosphere languid and hazy with warmth. The poppiest thing here, Softie, is tempered by intermittent bursts of dubby echo that overwhelm the vocal, the next phrase drowned out by the aftershocks of its predecessor: it’s a small touch, but it’s also evidence of an artist interested in doing what they want.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Darkness on the Edge of Town purrs along, almost grooving; The Promised Land is as potent as it is poignant.Bruce Springsteen says Trump is running ‘rogue government’ and ‘siding with dictators’Read moreThere is an inescapable feeling of loss that permeates the evening, with Springsteen mourning the corroded spirit and erased freedoms of the country he loves so dearly.However, as political and polemical as much of it is – there are multiple speeches – it’s not all doom and gloom. Springsteen sings the line “hard times come and hard times go” in Wrecking Ball with such seething intensity it feels like a mantra.The final stretch is bursting with joy though and its emphatic run exists as a symbol of love over hate and the power of unity over division, as ground-shaking, lung-busting versions of Badlands, Thunder Road, Born to Run and Dancing in the Dark ring out.But the choice to finish on a fiery yet emotional version of Bob Dylan’s Chimes of Freedom hits home a clear message tonight.And despite the hurt and despair that underpins much of it, there are few artists able to pluck hope from the darkest depths of the US, with such elegance and beauty, quite like Bruce Springsteen.Explore more on these topicsBruce SpringsteenPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Even singers who never studied with the great baritone acknowledge his influence, but for Benjamin Appl the link was much more direct: after attending a masterclass that Fischer-Dieskau gave in Austria in 2009,Appl became Fischer-Dieskau’s final pupil, working with him up to his death three years later.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Appl and James Baillieu: For Dieter: Hommage à Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.Photograph: Alpha ClassicsThe centenary tribute that Appl has put together to his teacher with pianist James Baillieu is thoughtful and handsomely produced. The disc of 32 songs is well chosen to reflect every stage in Fischer-Dieskau’s life, from his childhood, through his years as a soldier and prisoner of war during the second world war, the steady upward curve of his career through the 1950s and 60s, to the eminence of his later years. . Packaged within a lavishly illustrated hardback book, it also includes some of the works that were composed specially for him. Schubert is predictably well represented in the sequence, Schumann, Brahms and Wolf unexpectedly rather less so, and Richard Strauss not all, though there are songs by Eisler and Bruno Walter, and by Fischer-Dieskau’s father Albert and brother Klaus. Without ever aping his famous mentor, Appl’s performances have the same attention to detail, both verbal and musical, though his tone sometimes takes on a hard, rather acid edge; it’s a worthy, heartfelt tribute and Fischer-Dieskau’s legions of fans won’t hesitate.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

It included three of the piano sonatas alongside a selection of miniatures that ranged right across Scriabin’s composing career, and, for his 25th release on the label, Sudbin has returned to the same composer and the same programming scheme. Though it’s the very late, intensely compressed poem Vers la Flamme from 1914 that provides the album’s title, it’s the two sonatas here, the fourth and the 10th, that provide the weight and focus, with a selection of smaller-scale pieces – selections of preludes from Scriabin’s Op 11 and Op 16, and études from Op 8 and Op 42, as well as the B minor Fantasie Op 28. The disc plots out the creative journey that Scriabin made, from its Chopinesque beginnings in the preludes, to the rarefied world of his final works, in which he forged his own utterly original brand of modernism.View image in fullscreenYevgeny Sudbin: Scriabin: Vers La Flamme.Sudbin’s mastery of every technical challenge that Scriabin’s piano writing throws up is hugely impressive, the colours he finds in the music always beguiling. But sometimes he does seem temperamentally more comfortable with the earlier pieces rather than the more acerbic later style. His treatment of the preludes, each one a tiny Romantic jewel, is exquisite, the account of the two-movement fourth sonata teasingly elusive, and though he builds tension remorselessly through Vers la Flamme and negotiates the thickets of trills in the 10th sonata with wonderful clarity, neither work quite reaches the extreme levels of expression that other pianists have found. On disc, at least, no pianist has come closer to conveying that intensity than Vladimir Horowitz, whose Scriabin recordings remain unequalled, let alone surpassed; Sudbin humanises this music where Horowitz makes it forbidding and alien.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

You wish, Helen Oyeyemi might say, holding up her new novel, which features a protagonist split seven ways, one self for each day of the week, and no two ever in full agreement.Oyeyemi made her debut in 2005 withThe Icarus Girl,the story of eight-year-old Jessamy, troubled and imaginative daughter of a Nigerian mother and British father, whose mysterious playmate, a girl named TillyTilly, is possibly her own destructive alter ego. A New New Me may at first glance seem like a thematic cousin; tonally, however, it belongs with Oyeyemi’s more recent works: playful, self-aware tales that revel in the hijinks of storytelling.The action, set over a week, takes place in Prague, where Oyeyemi has lived since 2013. Unlike her 2024 novel,Parasol Against the Axe, it doesn’t feature narration by the storied city itself, but by the seven versions of 40-year-old Polish-born Kinga Sikora, AKA Kingas A-G. Each seemingly pursuing an agenda unbeknown to the others, they take turns steering their shared existence, conferring through a communal notebook. How has this come to be? Well, OG Kinga bailed on them, after leaving them in charge for what was only meant to be a temporary arrangement. It’s now 2024, more than a decade since anyone last saw her.The denouement is so gloriously absurd, you can’t help but salute Oyeyemi’s knack for artful nonsenseWhat’s the book about? As ever with Oyeyemi, it’s hard to say, and perhaps entirely beside the point. At times you get the sense its author has happily surrendered control of her material, letting it run whichever way it pleases, trusting the narrative to stumble upon meaning along the way. I’d describe this riddling, befuddling but always very funny novel as a fable about self-mythology: how we build ourselves up through the stories we tell, only to trip over them, or have to rewrite them later. A comedy about the masks we wear, if you will, as well as an existential mystery: is it ever possible to know which among our inner selves act in our favour and which do not? Oh, and there’s a man tied up in the Kingas’ apartment. Who is he? How did he get there? Which of the Kingas might have taken him in, and why? So, then, a mystery both existentialandliteral.The first Kinga we meet is Monday Kinga, Kinga-A, “squad leader” and tone-setter for the week. A matchmaker facilitating “partnerships” for employees at a bank, she’s convinced she knows what is best for everyone, and comes off as overbearing and self-centred. Her biggest offence? According to Kinga-B, quarantining in France with their brother Benek for three full weeks during lockdown without consulting them (“She ripped our conscious hours away first and apologised afterwards”). Kinga-A claims not to know the tied-up man, accuses Kinga-G of secret Sunday church visits, and chastises everyone for their lifestyle choices. She also thinks there’s one restless Kinga among them who might bring about their downfall.Done with Kinga-A’s condescension and main-character delusions (“As far as she’s concerned, we’re Kinga-A and Her Backing Dancers”), Kinga-B has decided to strike – no going to work, no laundry – and is rallying the rest of the Kingas to do the same on their own respective days. The rest of the week, courtesy of Kingas C to G, unfolds in a thicket of delightfully random stories and encounters, laced with clues and red herrings. Egos collide, old wounds break open, the lies and recriminations pile up, and mutual suspicion keeps at bay any semblance of an answer as to the enigma of the man in the house. Along the way, we learn that Kinga-C has secretly cosied up with him, that OG Kinga might be wanting to make a full-time comeback, and that the seven Kingas may have been suppressing her messages as well as jazzing up “the actual course of events with things that didn’t happen”. We also discover that their psychotherapist has permanently cut off contact.The denouement, when it finally comes, is so gloriously absurd, you can’t help but salute Oyeyemi’s knack for artful nonsense. She is a gleefully unapologetic trickster; whether you adore this novel or chuck it across the room may come down to how much mischief for the sake of mischief you can handle. My bet is you’ll finish it, as I did, feeling bemused but also perversely entertained, and grateful for the ride.A New New Me by Helen Oyeyemi is published by Faber (£16.99).

As the author, Mark Whitaker, puts it, his book tells “the story of the story of Malcolm, the story that really made him the figure he is today, even more so than what he accomplished while he was living.“So it was the story as told by Alex Haley inThe Autobiography of Malcolm X. It was the story as told by Spike Lee in the movie,Malcolm X. It was the story as told by his biographers. It was the story that is told in hip-hop, and in Anthony Davis’s opera,X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X. And it changes over time. Each of those stories is a little bit different.”Whitaker has told many stories himself. Now 67, a CBS contributor, he was editor of Newsweek, Washington bureau chief for NBC and a managing editor for CNN. His new book is his fifth. As well as a work of cultural history, it is a true-crime thriller, tracing the story ofwho really killed Malcolmat the Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights, and how two menwrongly imprisonedwere finallycleared.The book grew from two others:Smoketown: The Untold Story of the Other Black Renaissance andSaying it Loud: 1966 – the Year Black Power Challenged the Civil Rights Movement. Smoketown, about “the legacy of Black Pittsburgh … ended in the early 60s”, but Whitaker “had done all this reporting about … Black America in general in the civil rights era, and so I wanted to pick up that thread. I decided to write about the birth of Black Power, specifically in 1966. A lot of people would say, ‘Oh, so you’ll be writing about Malcolm X.’ And initially my response was, ‘No, he was assassinated in 1965.’ But the further I went, the more I realized he loomed over all of it.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Simon & Schuster“’66 was the year the Autobiography was released in paperback and really became a bestseller. Meanwhile, he was in the heads of all of the major figures.Stokely Carmichaelat the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee; Huey Newton, Bobby Seale and Eldridge Cleaver,founding the Black Panthers; Ron Karenga, who had this sort ofBlack nationalist movement in LAand was the founder of Kwanzaa; the first proponents of Black studies on white campuses. All of them drew their inspiration from Malcolm X.”As a teen, Whitaker read the Autobiography. It told him Malcolm’s story, from brutal youth to street hustling, prison, conversion, and his rise in sharp contrast to Martin Luther King Jr, the voice of nonviolent action. Whitaker knew about the split with the Nation of Islam and its founder, Elijah Muhammad, that precipitated Malcolm’s killing. In 1992, WhitakercoveredSpike Lee’s movie for Newsweek. In 2020, for the Washington Post, hereviewedThe Dead Are Arising, a major biography by Les and Tamara Payne that followedMalcolm X: A Life of Reinventionby Manning Marable, which won a Pulitzer Prize.Seeking to publish in Malcolm’s centennial year, Whitaker had to work quickly. But if “life as a journalist trained me to do anything, it trained me to meet a deadline”.“Obviously there have been aspects of this that have been written about,” he added. But though he doesn’t “want to be immodest” he doesn’t think “anybody’s really put it together in the way that I have”.Malcolm’s story has often been told.“Each one of those stories is a little bit different,” Whitaker said. “And sometimes they’re at odds. If you read the biographies and what was written about them, each one was trying to kind of revise and correct the story. So a lot of people think that Alex Haley, though it was he who kind of brought Malcolm to life for the reader, [produced] a sanitized version. Alex Haley was a moderate Republican, and he sort of massaged the narrative to emphasize Malcolm’s evolution in the last year and leave the reader with the impression that he was really sort of gravitating in the direction of becoming more of a mainstream, conventional civil rights leader.“Marable was trying to correct that and paint Malcolm as someone who remained radical, to focus less on his change of heart towards white people, and more on his Pan-Africanist ambitions, on his global travels. Then Les Payne comes along … [he] had been sitting on all of this exclusive reporting for decades, and so it’s less of a correction about Malcolm’s politics, and more adding heavily reported detail on key episodes in his life.View image in fullscreenMalcolm X speaking at a rally in 1963.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive“I wasn’t taking sides. I was trying to show that one of the things that’s fascinating about Malcolm is that he has had all these different interpreters, and I argue in the introduction that ultimately they’re not mutually exclusive, that one of the things that’s fascinating about Malcolm is that almost at any point in his evolution, he represented many different things. He seems like a radical. He seems like a conservative. He’s a traditionalist. He’s a modernist.”Whitaker considers how such influence extended to sports, to athletes including the boxer Muhammad Ali and the sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who raised their fists at the Mexico Olympics in 1968. More surprisingly,Clarence Thomas, the second Black justice on the supreme court, a reactionary conservative, has long cited Malcolm’s example.“There are people who are appalled that Thomas would claim any kind of kinship,” Whitaker said. “But I think there are two aspects of Malcolm’s message that spoke to Clarence Thomas. One was sort of ‘self-help’, support for Black-owned businesses and so forth. But the other was skepticism about integration.“And although it is true that Malcolm, afterhe went to Mecca[in 1964] and he saw white Muslims and so forth, came back and said, ‘I no longer think that all white people are devils,’ and certainly he had sort of [white] friends – I don’t know to what degree you could really call Peter Goldman and Helen Dudar, or Mike Wallace or Bill Kunstler friends, but they were certainly people he felt comfortable enough with – I think he remained skeptical, and to my mind rightly so, of just how prepared America really was to become truly integrated.”Goldman and Dudar, a married couple, were journalists, Goldman the author ofThe Death and Life of Malcolm X, an influential study from 1973. Mike Wallace was a CBS TV host whointerviewedMalcolm. Kunstler was acivil rights lawyer.Whitaker continued: “I think another reason that Malcolm has continued to resonate over the decades is that just on a purely analytical level, I think his analysis of race relations in America has turned out to be … more prophetic than King’s. Sixty years later, we’re not that much further toward King’s dream. I think obviously the workplace has become more integrated, in movies and TV and so forth [too], but in terms of where Americans live, neighborhoods, famously, where they worship, if they do worship, the progress has been much less than I think a lot of people thought it would be by this point – and now we’re in the midst of yet another backlash against all the progress that’s been made.”The Trump administration is attacking the teaching of Black history. It’s hard to imagine Whitaker’s book, or any other on Malcolm X, studied atWest Pointor Annapolis any time soon.“None of that would have surprisedMalcolm X,” Whitaker said. “So … there are people who just refuse to accept that Clarence Thomas invokes Malcolm X in good faith, but I don’t. I actually think that at least in Thomas’s mind, he does very much see that part of Malcolm’s message as one that aligns with his thinking.”View image in fullscreenMartin Luther King Jr and Malcolm X meet in March 1964.Photograph: Photograph by Marion S. Trikosko for U.S. News & World Report magazine, Library of Congress Prints and Photographs DivisionWhitaker had no choice but to think along multiple lines.“Just by studying Malcolm’s influence, you get a sort of a cultural history of Black America and of America over 60 years,” he said. “You find out about the Black Arts Movement, you learn a little bit about Hollywood, you find out about the free jazz movement, you find out about the birth of hip-hop … I’m sort of a jazz guy myself. So it was fun to become more knowledgeable.”Asked about the notion that Malcolm and King can be seen in a jazz frame, Malcolm as Miles Davis, edgy and cool, King as John Coltrane, spiritual and high-flown, Whitaker said: “That was Anthony Davis, what he said about how he thought of Malcolm’s voice in writing the opera,”a production revivedafter 2020, the summer of George Floyd and Black Lives Matter.As Whitaker worked, another dual vision loomed large: Peniel Joseph’sThe Sword and the Shield, which posits Malcolm as the sword and Martin as the shield of Black Americans striving for justice. Such contrasts will forever be drawn. Whitaker makes his own.“There’s a lot of discussion today about what kind of communication works politically, with the transition to social media, podcasting and so forth. People are saying politicians who are effective are the ones who speak in a more direct way, in a more conversational way, and with more humor. That was all Malcolm. King is still very impressive, when you go back and you listen to his speeches, but he always sounds like he’s talking to you from a pulpit. Malcolm always had this incredibly direct conversation, very powerful, and that’s why he was so great.“He went around and talked on college campuses and engaged in panels and debates on TV and on radio, and it still feels very contemporary. King’s voice, as important and majestic as it was, feels like an artifact of history. Malcolm … yougo on YouTubeand you listen to his speeches, but even more so his interviews, and it feels like he could be talking today.”The Afterlife of Malcolm X isout nowExplore more on these topicsBooksMalcolm XHistory booksBlack US cultureBlack power movementCivil rights movementRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately his came with cow’s milk and, because his need for vegan alternatives is apparently greater than his wife Sarah’s, he asked her to swap. Before Sarah had the chance to reply, the woman serving their drinks intervened, observing sensibly: “She might not want that one.” Buxton retorted with exaggerated gruffness: “She’s my wife, so she’ll have what she’s given!”The comedian, radio and TV presenter recalls what happened next. Passengers shook their heads and looked at Sarah with pity and concern. Sarah sank mortified into her seat. The incident, Buxton writes, made him look “even more like the kind of controlling monster I had just parodied. But maybe,” he reflects, “a husband who makes a joke that lands so badly and embarrasses his wife as I just hadisa kind of monster. On the other hand, perhaps I’m right and everyone else is wrong.”I was all set to hate this book, with its stupid, chummy title redolent ofRussell Brand’s bestsellerMy Booky Wook, and its cover emblazoned with Buxton’s mug in the manner now customary for celebrity memoirs. But much of it consists of Buxton parading his failures – jokes that misfire, TV pranks that end in a Brixton shop with someone threatening to punch him, and the author’s abiding fear he’s a talentless impostor – all endearingly contrary to the self-aggrandising Trumpian zeitgeist. True, Buxton rambles. There’s a very long section on the ideas he pitched to Channel 4 that were cruelly denied. One such proposal was a sitcom in which David Bowie’s characters – the laughing gnome, Ziggy Stardust, Major Tom, the junkie Pierrot and so on – shared a flat. Buxton notes that in 2006 Bowie made an advertisement forVittel mineral waterwhich, he muses, bears a remarkable likeness to his failed pitch. Did Bowie nick his idea? It seems unlikely but, now the thin white duke is dead, we may never know for sure.There are also too many passages about him hanging out with musical heroes Radiohead and Travis. More entertainingly, he and Joe Cornish, fellow host of TV and radio’s The Adam and Joe Show, get menaced by a drunken Mark E Smith (late frontman of The Fall) who marches the pair to a cashpoint to get the £200 they promised him in order to appear in one of their daft skits.The book is padded out with a spreadsheet of arguments he’s had with long-suffering Sarah. For example: “Subject of Argument: Wife leaving dirty plates and coffee mugs by the sink to clean later. Buckles’ point [Buxton calls himself Buckles throughout. Just accept it]: ‘I always think it’s better to clean as you go.’ Sarah’s response? ‘I always think it’s better to fuck while you off.’ Sarah 1, Buckles 0.”Oddly, these digressions are mostly charming. And a letter to his mother, who died during Covid, at the end of the book, had me welling up. “Thanks,” he writes, “for lending me your makeup and showing me how to apply it, not only when I was afflicted by volcanic eruptions of bad skin as a teenager but also when I just wanted to look more intense and interesting.”That I was charmed at all is more surprising since Buxton is not relatable. He went to Windlesham House School where he met mockney herbert and future film director Guy Ritchie and to Westminster where he was contemporaneous with future posh TV prankster Louis Theroux. He found his calling at Cheltenham Art School where he made silly films for his degree that, cannily, he parlayed into the TV shows with which he and fellow Westminster alum, Cornish (AKA Cornballs) made their name in the 90s and noughties. They dressed up, pranked shoppers, satirised crap telly like Richard and Judy, painstakingly made a little model of the doomed ship for their parody Toytanic – as if they were Peter Pans with Blue Peter badges.Buxton is now in his 50s and his line of work, so far as I can tell, consists of asking infantile questions of celebrities and seeing if they will play nice or be dicks. He once asked Paul Weller, live on Radio 2: “Does anyone ever say to you, ‘Paul Weller, Weller, Weller. Oooh! Tell me more! Tell me more!” To which the glum musician replied: “Was that supposed to be funny?”I found Buxton’s self-deprecation endearing right up to the point that I realised he’s probably getting a huge advance for offloading his insecurities. And yet, he has written a celebrity memoir that does something extraordinary: it manages to be worth reading. Though I suspect not everyone – the modfather among them – will agree.I Love You, Byeee: Rambles on DIY TV, Rockstars, Kids and Mums by Adam Buxton is published by Mudlark (£22).

Patter-song master Richard Suart is The Learned Judge – who eventually gets the girl, jilted bride Angelina (soprano Kira Kaplan) – and company favourite Jamie MacDougall is on his best camp form as the Defendant, Edwin. Kally Lloyd-Jones gives the Bridesmaids, led by Amy J Payne, some laugh-out-loud geriatric cheerleader choreography to complement their outrageous frocks, and the jurors’ diverse costuming runs the gamut from lab coat and dress kilt to TV-am sweater and perm.

His score also owes debts toSondheimand John Adams and plays with its heritage stylishly in Laura Attridge’s production.Hession and librettist Emma Jenkins have been nurtured through short pieces for Scottish Opera’s small-scale touring and A Matter of Misconduct! is a sophisticated extension of those projects, with baritone Ross Cumming as ambitious politician Roger Penistone (fnar, fnar) and mezzo Chloe Harris his wife, Cherry, a would-be wellness guru (or “Poundshop Paltrow”).There are gags aplenty at the expense of politicians in Westminster and Holyrood, and possibly the first operatic rhyming of both “vaginal dryness” and “clitoral stimulator”, but this pacy piece also finds room for some stratospheric coloratura from Kaplan as sassy lawyer Sylvia Lawless, and a lovely duet for the rather unlovely central couple.

Mozart was the only music performed throughout Glyndebourne’s first four seasons, and he is still the composer with whom Britain’s first and best-known “country house” opera festival is most associated.It was on a very different composer, however, that the gaze of the festival’s founder, John Christie, was initially trained. Christie was a Germanophile and obsessed with the work of Richard Wagner. “He was always hankering to do Parsifal at Glyndebourne as an Easter festival,”recalled his son, Sir George, who ran the Sussex festival after John’s death, until his own son,Gus, took over in turn at the start of the millennium. “He was only shut up by my mother.”Ninety-one years after the festival’s founding, John Christie will finally get his wish as Wagner’s “stage consecration play” (as the composer himself designated it) isperformed at Glyndebourne for the first time. But if it had been left up to Wagner’s widow, Cosima, neither Glyndebourne nor indeed any other theatre would ever have been allowed anywhere near Parsifal, her husband’s final masterpiece.Cosima came from a glittering artistic lineage: her father was Franz Liszt, her mother the celebrated writer Marie d’Agoult. When Cosima and Wagner began their scandalous affair, producing three children out of wedlock, she was married to Hans von Bülow, one of Germany’s leading conductors. She outlived her second husband by almost half a century (he was 24 years her senior), dying just four years before Christie and his wife Audrey Mildmay first welcomed the public to their new theatre on their Sussex estate.Wagner himself died in Venice in February 1883, barely six months after the triumphant premiere of Parsifal, the only one of his 13 operas conceived with an understanding of how the innovative auditorium and orchestral pit of his festival theatre in Bayreuth would actually function.View image in fullscreenA stage consecration play: Parsifal (Daniel Johansson) with the Glyndebourne Chorus in rehearsal for the festival’s new production.Photograph: © Glyndebourne Productions Ltd. Photo: Richard Hubert SmithCosima’s grief initially took the form of paralysis: friends literally had to prise her away from her husband’s corpse. But she soon applied herself with extraordinary tenacity to ensuring that the Bayreuth festival, inaugurated seven years earlier with the first performances of Wagner’s four-part Ring cycle, would remain under the family’s control. She planned to act as regent until the couple’s only son – the auspiciously named Siegfried, just 13 when his father died – was old enough to take charge. Securing Bayreuth’s future required political dexterity: Cosima deftly cultivated Bavarian rulers and German kaisers, emphasising the festival’s importance to kingdom and empire alike.The Ring and Parsifal were the only works that Wagner himself ever saw in Bayreuth. Cosima broadened the repertoire to include Tristan und Isolde and Die Meistersinger. But Parsifal remained by far the festival’s most frequently performed work: of the 194 festival performances between Wagner’s death and 1900, 91 were of Parsifal. Ironically, given the composer’s well-deserved reputation for antisemitism, the only conductor to make a real success of his final work wasHermann Levi, a rabbi’s son who weathered abuse from Cosima and her coterie of antisemites to return for festival after festival.Cosima was acutely aware of Bayreuth’s unique selling point: Parsifal was the only work that could be seen solely at the festival. This was what Wagner had always intended: “There alone may Parsifal be presented, now and always,” he wrote to King Ludwig II of Bavaria. He was horrified to think that his Knights of the Grail, their wounded king (Amfortas), the sorcerer who threatens them (Klingsor) and the knight who redeems them (Parsifal) might be represented “in any other theatre as a mere amusement for its audience”.View image in fullscreenMatthias Goerne (Amfortas) in a 2020 staging of Parsifal at Théatre du Capitole, Toulouse, France.Photograph: AKSARAN/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesFor his family, Wagner’s decree carried an absolute and everlasting moral force. In the eyes of the rest of the world, it had no legal standing. Wagner’s music would fall out of copyright in 1913, meaning that opera houses across the world would be able to mount Parsifal – and indeed any of his works – without seeking the family’s permission or paying any royalties.If Cosima wanted to prevent Parsifal from entering the public domain, she needed to be decisive. In 1901, when the Reichstag debated extending copyright from 30 to 50 years from an author or composer’s death, Cosima lobbied vigorously. She wrote to every parliamentarian, extolling Wagner’s legacy to the German nation but the proposal was rejected.Two years later, in 1903, Cosima received a devastating blow when the incoming director of the MetropolitanOpera, Heinrich Conried, launched his tenure in spectacular style by announcing a production of Parsifal. She was outraged – but legally powerless. The US had not signed the Berne copyright convention, meaning that the restrictions on Wagner performances that still applied in most of Europe did not bind the Met, and Siegfried had carelessly sanctioned a miniature score from which copyists made perfectly legal handwritten parts. The production was a sensation, but, for Cosima, it desecrated her husband’s most sacred work.As 1913 approached, Cosima’s acolytes made one final push to promote a special law – Lex Parsifal, as it was dubbed – to protect the family’s rights in perpetuity. Resigned to the rest of Wagner’s works entering the public domain, the family sought instead to secure for Parsifal an unprecedented legal status: performances would remain forbidden anywhere other than Bayreuth, in recognition of the unique cultural legacy Wagner had bestowed on Germany and the world with his final work.The instigator of this final and somewhat desperate move was Houston Stewart Chamberlain, English-born author of infamous racist tracts and son-in-law of Cosima, who enlisted supporters including Richard Strauss and Hans Pfitzner. Their plan foundered, but a decade later, on his first visit to Wahnfried, the Wagner home in Bayreuth, Adolf Hitler undertook that “if I should ever succeed in exerting any influence on Germany’s destiny, I will see that Parsifal is given back to Bayreuth”. Despite his notorious intimacy with Siegfried Wagner’s widow, Winifred, and sons Wieland and Wolfgang, his promise was not kept.Cosima’s efforts were motivated not just by financial considerations, but also by a sincere if misplaced desire to preserve what she perceived as Parsifal’s unique character. In a letter to Kaiser Wilhelm II, she likened the work to a sacred relic unveiled to pilgrims only on a few special occasions. The productions she supervised retained every detail of Wagner’s increasingly dated staging and movement directions; critics began to describe Bayreuth as a mausoleum.Cosima’s work cast a long shadow over subsequent interpretations. The tendency to treat Parsifal more like a religious ceremony than a piece of theatre endured well beyond her death. Even in 2020, Roger Scruton defended the convention of refraining from applause after Act I on the grounds that “it shows the incorporation into the Eucharist of a real sacrificial victim”. Many recent productions, however, have distanced the audience from the ceremonies depicted. Ruth Berghaus’s 1982 centenary production for Frankfurt characterised the Grail community as decaying and misogynistic. Stefan Herheim’s 2008 Bayreuth Parsifal linked its story to the festival’s history and that of 20th-century Germany, staging the action in Wahnfried.View image in fullscreenThe force their delusions on others: the 2017 premiere of Avner Dorman’s Wahnfried in Badisches Staatstheater, Karlsruhe.Photograph: (PR)The conjunction of Parsifal and Glyndebourne is a fascinating prospect. A relatively small theatre can present it as an intimate human drama rather than a monumental, ceremonial work. In a view resonating intriguingly with current debates,director Jetske Mijnssen interpretsits characters as vulnerable human beings, describing Amfortas as unable to die and Parsifal as someone who can give him “the gift of dying”. Even without Bayreuth’s unique covered pit, meanwhile, Parsifal’s sumptuous score – described by that ambivalent Wagnerian Claude Debussy as “one of the loveliest monuments of sound ever raised to the serene glory of music” – will surely be heard to great advantage in Glyndebourne’s famously warm acoustic.Ten days after Glyndebourne’s Parsifal opens, Cosima herself will appear on the stage of another of Britain’s leading country house opera festivals, along with Hermann Levi, Siegfried Wagner, Houston Stewart Chamberlain and several other friends and family members. Longborough – founded in 1991, and the brainchild of another passionate Wagnerian,Martin Graham, is often described as the English Bayreuth, thanks both to its Wagnerian track record and to resemblances between the buildings. The Cotswolds festival is a singularly appropriate venue for the UK premiere ofAvner Dorman’s Wahnfried. In Dorman’s telling, the name Wahnfried (“free from delusion”) proves ironic: not only are the house’s inhabitants themselves deluded, they force their delusions on others.View image in fullscreenRehearsals for Wahnfried: The birth of the Wagner Cult at Longborough Opera Festival, with (centre) Antoin Herrera-López Kessel.Photograph: Lidia CrisafulliIn non-linear and sometimes surreal fashion, and with music that is often funny and only occasionally sounds like Wagner (the sound-world is closer to Weill, Shostakovich, Adams and klezmer), Dorman exposes the thread linking Cosima’s cult of Wagner to the horrors of the Third Reich. The cast includes a character identifiable as Hitler, whose music Dorman evolved by transcribing one of the Führer’s speeches into musical notation, “so that it would sound like him, and also so I didn’t have to write music for him – I just couldn’t do that”. But however baleful Dorman shows Wagner’s legacy to be, his opera does not demonise the composer – although it does Daemon-ise him. Wagner is represented on stage by a “Daemon” (followingPhilip Pullman’s spelling and example) who evokes “perhaps the ghost of Wagner, perhaps what is left of him, when rid of the antisemitic bile”.Dorman,whose opera premiered in 2016, was attempting to reconcile his fascinated admiration for Wagner with his knowledge of the cult’s consequences: writing the opera was part of this process, but he admits that “it hasn’t solved the problem”. As a musician raised in Israel, where Wagner is effectively banned, and the grandson of a Holocaust survivor, Dorman has more reason than most to feel equivocal. But the challenge he faces is common to all who seek to interpret Wagner: to separate what is beautiful and humane in his work from the ideology surrounding it. Disentangling Wagner from the cult his widow inspired is both difficult and essential.Parsifal is at Glyndebourne festival from 17 May to 24 June.Wahnfried: the Birth of the Wagner Cultis at Longborough festival from 27 May to 14 June.

However, this personal story also informs us of the wider narrative of post-apartheidSouth Africa.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Lindokuhle SobekwaZiyanda’s disappearance is the focus of I Carry Her Photo With Me. The photographer did not see his half-sister for 11 years after a childhood accident when he was hit by a car while she was chasing him. His award-winning work is a scrapbook-like attempt to piece together their relationship and her life in those years.When Ziyanda resurfaced in 2013 she was living in a hostel near the family home and was seriously ill, with scars on her back. She died, aged just 22, shortly after the siblings were reunited, leaving Sobekwa with more questions than answers. Ziyanda would not allow him to take her photograph before she died – an absence the work revolves around.View image in fullscreenLindokuhle Sobekwa created a ‘powerful narrative’ with his camera.Photograph: Refilwe Mrwebi/Magnum Photos“She’s not the only one this ever happened to,” the photographertold the Observer last year. “In South Africa, you will hear this story all the time. Every taxi driver will tell you about an uncle or someone else in their family … This is an ongoing dialogue. It’s sort of open-ended …unresolved.”Photographs are broken up with hand-written notes, and domestic scenes are mixed with intimate moments such as his mother reading her Bible, which the judges said combined to create a “powerful narrative, presented in a simple, clear, and accessible way”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Lindokuhle SobekwaDeutsche Börse prize review – Black cowboys, bonkers rock-huggers and a story of shocking lossRead moreShoair Mavlian, the director of the Photographers’ Gallery and chair of the Deutsche Börse jury, said: “Lindokuhle winning the prize in 2025 reflects photography’s ability to be a tool for transformative storytelling.

Her devotees include the lauded feminist mythographer Marina Warner, for whom she’s “one of contemporary art’s most provocative and profound figures”. Yet she is habitually relegated to a footnote within British art: one of the first women to be nominated for the Turner prize in 1987 and an outstanding teacher of YBAs such as Sarah Lucas, Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst.She remains best known for Piss Flowers, her white bronze sculptures whose stalagmite protuberances are phallic inversions of vaginal recesses, cast from the holes she and her husband made by peeing in thick snow. (The artist’s hotter urine went deeper, creating larger cavities. She described the work as “a penis-envy farce”.) It’s easy to see how her transgressive interests might have quickened British art’s pulse. Yet her meditations on the sacred and profane, sex and death, were expansive, propelling diverse experiments across installation, photography and performance.Now, her prolific if all too short career is getting its first major showing in more than two decades. At a time when gender binaries are being dismantled, Laura Smith, curator ofa retrospectiveat the Hepworth Wakefield, Helen Chadwick: Life Pleasures, and editor of the accompanying book, hopes to make Chadwick’s relevance to a fresh generation clear.“She was trying to disrupt societal conventions, including gender normativity,” Smith says. “She was really pioneering and she wasn’t afraid of art being sexy or funny, either.”The exhibition opens with the decidedly fluid Cacao, one of Chadwick’s most affecting evocations of how opposites such as desire and abjection entwine. It’s a huge chocolate fountain set to be filled with 800kg of Tony’s Chocolonely, which will gush from a central liquid erection. Needless to say, this brown pool evokes more than confectionery. “It’s joyous and kind of gross,” says Smith. “It bubbles like a swamp. Basically, it farts.”Chadwick was also an inveterate craftsperson. The images of her MA graduation show of 1977, In the Kitchen, where she’s encased in sculptural costumes of white goods, are often used to represent feminist art of that decade. What the pictures can’t tell you is what went into those creations, including performances with wearable beds and latex nudity suits cast from their wearers’ bodies. According to Errin Hussey, who’s overseeing anexhibition in Leedsof her archive, “the costumes really show the dedication she had. The intricacy of detail and planning that went into the textile and metalwork on just one shoe is amazing.”For her first major work, Ego Geometria Sum, she devised a novel way to embed shots of herself on to the plywood surfaces of sculptures by painting them with photographic emulsion. The Oval Court, part of the exhibition that led to her Turner nomination, took the experimentation further. She created its dreamy blue-and-white collage with a photocopier, making direct images of her own body alongside an apparent cornucopia of flowers, fruit and dead animals including lambs and a swan.Complementing this lusciously libidinal work is Carcass, a glass tower that, when originally shown at the ICA in 1986, was filled with dead animals’ bodies, plus weeks of kitchen waste. When the gases generated by its live decomposition caused its glass to crack, and the gallery attempted to remove it, the lid blew off, spraying rot across the art space. (At the Hepworth, its vegetarian recreation features a gas valve so it can be “burped like a baby” each night.)In what would be her final decade, frustrated by the heat she was getting from fellow feminists about her use of nudity, she abandoned depicting her outer body and looked within instead. Moving on from questions around objectified gender towards a polymorphous, fluid sexuality, in these works things are forever collapsing into their opposite, like Piss Flowers’ erect recesses.

For her MA degree show she and her performers donned sculptural costumes of white goods and made a tongue-in-cheek speech about “kitchen lib” to a soundtrack of clips from daytime radio aimed at housewives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She was announced as the winner at a ceremony in Swansea, Thomas’s birthplace.The Coin, chosen in a unanimous decision by judges, “is a borderless novel, tackling trauma and grief with bold and poetic moments of quirkiness and humour”, said writer and judging chair Namita Gokhale. “It fizzes with electric energy”, with Zaher bringing “complexity and intensity to the page through her elegantly concise writing”.Born in 1991 in Jerusalem, Zaher studied biomedical engineering at Yale University and creative writing at the New School, where she was advised by the novelist Katie Kitamura.Kitamura described The Coin as a “brilliant, audacious, powerhouse of a novel. A story of obsession and appetite, politics and class, it is deliciously unruly. An exceptional debut by an outrageous new talent.”The novel follows a wealthy Palestinian woman as she tries to set down roots in New York, teaching in a school for underprivileged boys. However, she begins to feel stifled in the US, and develops an obsession with cleanliness and purity.In aninterview last July, Zaher said that she had “very mixed feelings” about her novel coming out at this time. “Publishing a novel is a dream come true for me, but the joy is muted by grief. Deep inside, I also know that current events are driving some of the interest in the book, and I feel very uncomfortable with that, because I never considered myself as speaking in the name of my people.“But I tell myself that identity is not pure, that life is messy, and, maybe most importantly, that literature is at its best when it resists the boxes.”Quick GuideDylan Thomas prize shortlist 2025ShowRapture's Roadby Seán Hewitt (Cape)Glorious Exploitsby Ferdia Lennon (Fig Tree)The Safekeepby Yael van der Wouden (Viking)I Will Crashby Rebecca Watson (Faber)Moderate to Poor, Occasionally Goodby Eley Williams (4th Estate)The Coin by Yasmin Zaher (Footnote)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Other writers shortlisted for this year’s prize were Rapture’s Road by Seán Hewitt, Glorious Exploits by Ferdia Lennon, The Safekeep by Yael van der Wouden, I Will Crash by Rebecca Watson and Moderate to Poor, Occasionally Good by Eley Williams.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Should we believe them?Joel SnapeThu 15 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 07.45 EDTShareLooking back to 2022, it seems impossible that anyone ever believed that Brian “Liver King” Johnson achieved his physique without pharmaceutical assistance. He looks like a hot water bottle stuffed with bowling balls, an 80s action figure with more veins – an improbably muscular man who put his bodybuilder-shaming physique down to a diet of “raw liver, raw bone marrow and raw testicles”. And that last part, really, was the trick: by crediting his results to a regime that nobody else would dare try, he gave them a faint veneer of plausibilty.Maybe, if you followed a less extreme version of his protocol, you could get comparable (though less extreme) results. And if you couldn’t stomach an all-organ diet, well, you could always get the same nutrients from his line of supplements.The Liver King, of course, was dethroned – leaked emails revealed that he was spending more than $11,000 a month on muscle-building anabolic steroids,as detailed in a new Netflix documentary. But the story of a charismatic person promising ridiculous results is just the most outrageous example of a phenomenon that’s been around ever since performance enhancers were invented. In the 1980s, Hulk Hogan urged a generation to say their prayers and eat their vitamins in his VHS workout set; then in 1994 he was forced toadmit to more than a decade of steroiduse during a court case against his former boss, Vince McMahon. In 2025, influencers post their morning ice baths and deep breathing exercises, but don’t mention what they’re injecting at the same time, whether that’s steroids intended to encourage muscle growth in the same way that testosterone does, or testosterone itself, or human growth hormone (HGH). As a result, a generation of young men and women – and, to be fair, plenty of middle-aged ones – are developing a completely skewed version of what’s possible with hard work and a chicken-heavy diet. And things might be getting worse, not better.If you want to make a living from fitness, you’re almost stupid for trying to do it naturallyIt’s never been easier to start a business based on your body. With a couple of hundred thousand followers and a decent angle, it only takes a couple of days to whip up an ebook, online course or meal plan. Apps make it easy to start group coaching or habit-tracking services, and even supplement companies are easy to start, if you’re happy to just stick your own label on tubs of protein powder.“In the current economic climate, the fitness industry is a very appealing place,” says James Smith, a personal trainer, fitness influencer and bestselling author who has been open about using steroids in his early 20s (he’s now 35). “If you’ve got decent genetics, you’re a decent coach and have a grasp of marketing, you can unlock a very good income selling workouts and training plans. So maybe you take a little bit of testosterone to get a little leg up, and suddenly you’re getting compliments at the gym and posting record lifts on Instagram. Surely a bit of human growth hormone couldn’t hurt? OK, business is now at an all-time high; followers are coming up to you and asking about reps and sets. You’ve dug yourself a hole that is hard to get out of. What do you do now? Tell your audience you’re on steroids?”View image in fullscreenUn-natty … Rich Piana in 2015.Photograph: Dave Kotinsky/Getty ImagesIf you did, you’d be in a very small minority. There are – at a conservative estimate – tens of thousands of fitness influencers globally, and only a small handful have openly admitted tousing steroids, even among those posting the most outlandish results.Larry Wheels, an influencer and powerlifter, talked about the muscle cramps, depression, lethargy, loss of appetite and low libido he suffered from steroid abuse in a2018 video. He then announced he was no longer taking them in 2022, followed by a relapse in 2024. Sam Sulek, one of the current kings of fitness on YouTube thanks to his combination of chatty, informal videos and unbelievable physical dimensions, hasn’t elaborated, but in a video last year he did tell fans he’d be unable to reach his goal weight of 300lb “natural”. Rich Piana, famed for inventing an arms workout taking eighthours, was open about his steroid use for much of his career, discussing his own “cycle” and giving out advice for other users on social media. He died in 2017, aged 46, and with a heart weighing twice the normal amount for an adult male.But while a high-profile handful of people decide to open up, most other influencers continue to maintain that they’re “natural” or just avoid the subject entirely. A few even take tests to “prove” they’re clean, ignoring the fact that tests are easy to cheat: most steroids are undetectable after a weightlifter cycles off them for a month or so, while their effects can linger in the body for ever. And, make no mistake, the effects of enhancement can be huge: in one study, a group of men who took 600mg of testosterone enanthate for 10 weeks and did no exercise sawgreater gainsin strength than a placebo group who took nothing and worked out normally.“In my first cycle of testosterone in my early 20s, I climbed the status hierarchy in 12 weeks,” says Smith. “I didn’t use steroids to benefit my business, but I completely understand why people do it. It sounds bad to say, but if you want to ever make a living from fitness, you’re almost stupid for even trying to do it naturally.”View image in fullscreenBad influence … live streaming at the gym.Photograph: PeopleImages/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, it’s not just influencers getting bigger who might be misrepresenting how they achieve their unbelievable results. In April this year, Janelle Rohner agreed to refund followers who bought her course on food macros, after admitting to using GLP-1 weight loss drugs. “I could have kept this a secret,” shesaid in a TikTok videoposted after the subsequent backlash. “I could have gone on and on for years and not told, but I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to be that person.” The implication, of course, is that plenty of peopleareprepared to be that person, and it’s hard to argue. In the years since Wegovy and similar drugs have been approved for weight loss, plenty of influencers have undergone near-miraculous transformations, most of them citing clean eating when it’s possible they’re doing the exact opposite. At the same time, some influencers are taking a far more dangerous route than pills or chemicals – injecting synthol, an oil used to bulk up their muscles, or havinghigh-risk“Brazilian butt lifts” to compensate for bodies that won’t change naturally.How much of any of this is a problem if you, personally, are blissfully unaffected by everyLove Islandcontestant, #NoExcuses Insta-reel and celebrity success story? The answer, on a societal level, might be: quite a lot. In a2022 survey from social enterprise Better, 23% of men and 42% of women reported that they “rarely” or “never” feel body confident. In a small-scale studyfrom 2024, participants who were active social media users, frequently liking and commenting on content, were less satisfied with their bodies and had an increased level of negative feelings about their appearance. For anyone who takes online influencers at their word, training can feel dispiriting and hopeless: even working out multiple times a day and eating perfectly, it can be impossible to reach the same levels of fat-free muscle as your Instagram feed will show you after 20 seconds of scrolling. And, of course, film stars male and female are hardly helping the situation by showing up more lean and muscular than they’ve ever been in their 40s or 50s, preaching the virtues of twice-a-day training and drinking lots of water.“It’s quite clear there’s been an uptick in this stuff,” says Dan Roberts, a personal trainer who works with actors and Broadway stars. “It takes time to build muscle, so when you suddenly build a lot of it, that’s not possible without extra testosterone in your system, or growth hormone, or something. Also, sometimes the signs are just really obvious … when someone’s neck thickens up suddenly …”View image in fullscreen‘Natty or juice’ … shirtless selfie.Photograph: Jesus Calonge/Getty ImagesSome fitness enthusiasts, meanwhile, are fighting back. In Reddit’s “natty or juice” community, members debate whether celebrities and influencer physiques are achievable naturally, or if their results show signs of substance abuse: a distended stomach (sometimes known as “roid gut”) can be a sign of excess growth hormone, while gynecomastia (an increase of breast gland tissue in men) is typically caused by an imbalance in hormone levels. On YouTube, bodybuilders and coaches such as Greg Doucette, Dr Mike Israetel and Derek Munro (whose channel, More Plates More Dates, exposed the Liver King) explain what actually goes into a serious steroid regime, as well as the disastrous possible side-effects. But even with millions of viewers well versed in the minutiae of Winstrol or the signs of an HGH habit (it’s all in the jaw), millions more hang on to the hope that the right protein powder or workout regime might be enough, and end up hopelessly disappointed.‘Natty or not?’: how steroids got bigRead moreSo what’s the solution? A good start would be for the most high-profile influencers and celebrities to be honest about what they’re usingandthe risks they’re accepting to do it. “Look at testosterone,” says Smith, whoposted a videoabout his own regime earlier this year. “It’s cheap, easily accessible, well tolerated and arguably less dangerous than a lot of other things young people do. There are multiple implications for using it over the long term, problems with use versus abuse, fertility and many other psychological implications and impacts to using it, but it’s absolutely becoming more common. I look better with my shirt off at 35 than 25 because I now use a TRT [testosterone replacement therapy] service.”We could also reframe what we’re looking to get out of exercise, from an enviable physique to a better quality of life. “When it comes to our health, there are so many actually proven things we can do to live longer, be happier, fitter, stronger,” says Roberts. “The good information is out there – we just have to look for it through all the noise and nonsense.”We should also probably ignore the people who have lied to us in the past. The Liver King has now, in a way, come clean: after claiming to go “natty” for 60 days in an Instagram post, he admitted to being back on steroidsin late 2023(although he is still preaching the value of his “nine ancestral tenets”, which include sleep, sun exposure and cold therapy, and which the Netflix documentary claims were made up in conjunction with his marketing agency).The Liver King review – I am rarely this nauseated by anythingRead more“I think he thought the broader message was more important than the steroids,” says Ben Johnson, former CEO of the Liver King’s holding company, Tip of the Spear, who seems genuinely shocked that his former associate was doing anything untoward. “It’s unfortunate that the messenger has killed the message … when there’s a kernel of truth at the centre of the message, it’s easy to focus on that and ignore the other variables.” What isn’t quite so easy is looking past the abs and the arms, and finding people who value health and wellbeing over aesthetics and false promises. But as anyone who’s put in the work knows, sometimes the hard path is the one that pays off.This article was amended on 15 May 2025.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.A solid pair of walking boots will not only protect your feet from countryside unpleasantness but also save you from rolled ankles and skidding on slippery surfaces. Plus, provided they’re waterproof (and not just water-resistant, more on this later), they will keep your feet dry in inclement weather.At a glanceBestwalking boots overall:La Sportiva TX5From £207.34 at AmazonBest budget walking boots:Merrell Moab 3 Mid GTX£129.99 at DecathlonBest leather walking boots:Altberg Malham£234.99 at AltbergBest lightweight walking boots:Inov8 Roclite Mid GTX£134.99 at SportsShoesBest mountain-ready boots:Mammut Kento Tour High GTX£220 at MammutBesthiking boots for durability:Meindl Bhutan MFS£232 at Cotswold OutdoorWhy you should trust meI’m a seasoned tester of outdoor gear, trialling everything from running shoes towaterproof jackets. I’ve covered thousands of miles in hundreds ofboots, and I know what makes a good pair. My formative years were spent being shoved into hiking boots and dragged up hills by outdoorsy parents. Now an outdoorsy parent myself, I’ve voluntarily remained in hiking boots ever since.How I testedView image in fullscreenI’ve put pairs through their paces in the French Alps, the Lake District and even as far afield as New Zealand.Photograph: Fabio de Paola/The GuardianThere’s only one way to test a pair of hiking boots, and that’s to pop them on, lace them up and hit the trails. So that’s exactly what I did.First, I whittled it down to a shortlist of 23 styles, which included some I’d already worn extensively and loved. The rest were selected based on a combination of research and recommendations from industry friends and colleagues. I trawled product-comparison tables, waded through stats and agonised over features to find the boots worth considering.I then put each of the 23 pairs to the test. Living in Northumberland, I’m fortunate enough to have access to extremely varied terrain. Deserted sandy beaches, sprawling pine forests and rolling hills are all within close reach. I also travel a lot, so I’ve put pairs through their paces in the French Alps, the Lake District and even as far afield as New Zealand. I wore each pair for no less than 20 miles. In some cases, many more.I took the boots into the notoriously boggy Cheviot Hills to test their waterproofness the Northumbrian way (spoiler: not all of them were).I’d also like to note that boots sourced for this article are being donated toShoe Aid, a charity that provides free footwear to disadvantaged men, women and children in the UK and Europe.Here’s my guide to the best walking boots out there.The best men’s hiking boots in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Faultless’: the Altberg Malham boots.Photograph: Fabio de Paola/The GuardianBestwalking boots overall:La Sportiva TX5View image in fullscreenFrom £180.56 at AlpinetrekFrom £207.34 at AmazonThe TX5s are for anyone who wants a durable, comfortable and aesthetically pleasing pair of boots that can handle anything from light hikes to multi-day treks. La Sportiva is an Italian brand that specialises in serious alpine footwear for climbers and mountaineers. The TX5 is an approach boot, meaning it’s designed to bridge the gap between light trails on low ground and extreme high-mountain terrain. That makes this pair perfect for hiking and hillwalking.Why we love itI’m on my third pair of TX5s. That’s not to say they’re not durable – quite the opposite. It’s more a reflection of how often I wear them. Of all the boots I’ve tried over the years, these have become my go-to, thanks to their all-day comfort, excellent mixed-terrain performance and tough-as-nails build quality.The nubuck upper is flexible, breathable and hard-wearing, and the strategically placed mesh sections aid flexibility. This is a seriously comfortable boot, even if it isn’t the lightest, weighing in at 540g for one of my size 9s.This is heavy enough to offer stability, but light enough to remain comfortable over long distances.One of my favourite details is the chunky rand, a thick rubber strap that runs around the outside of the boot, just above the midsole. It’s fantastic at deflecting bumps, scuffs and scrapes on rocky trails, and it bolsters the Gore-Tex membrane to add an extra layer of defence against water where it’s needed most. After several years in these boots, I haven’t had wet feet once –not even while standing ankle-deep in a peat bog.It’s a shame that …they run a little narrow, so may not suit wider feet.Suitable for:day hikes on varied terrainMaterial:nubuckWaterproof:yes, Gore-TexSizing:I needed a half size biggerBest budget walkingboots:Merrell Moab 3 Mid GTXView image in fullscreen£129.99 at Decathlon£150 at MerrellI’d recommend the Moab 3s to anyone looking for a comfortable, versatile hiking boot that won’t completely drain their bank account. It can often be found reduced for less than the £150 recommended retail price – and even at that price, you’re getting a lot of boot for your money.The “mother of all boots” line was first conceived in the mid-00s as a sort of one-stop shop for outdoorsy folk who needed something they could walk, hike and even run in. This latest version of the Moab improves upon the bestselling formula with upgraded ventilation, lower weight (480g for one of my 8.5s) and a nice roomy toe box that’s perfect for wide-footed walkers.Why we love itNo one could ever accuse the Moab of putting style over substance. This is not, bless it, a particularly trendy boot. But what it lacks in streamlined looks, it more than compensates for with its out-of-the-box comfort and versatility. Whether you’re strolling along coastal cliffs, bagging Wainwrights in the Lake District or traipsing around a field with the dog, this is the perfect boot for the job. If you were to own only one piece of footwear, the Moab would be a strong candidate.The upper of the boot is an evenly balanced mix of mesh and pig-suede leather with a Gore-Tex membrane sitting beneath. This makes it extremely flexible and highly breathable. As a result, I’d say it’s well suited to warmer-weather adventures. The Vibram sole is supportive and grippy even on slippery surfaces such as tide-pool rocks, and the reinforced panel around the toe offers protection on technical terrain.The Moab 3 is also completely waterproof thanks to the Gore-Tex membrane, which held up impressively, even in boggy Northumberland.The biggest selling point for me is the price. It’s not the cheapest boot on the market, but it does offer some of the best value for money.It’s a shame that …they look a little clunky.Suitable for:a bit of everythingMaterial:synthetic mesh/suedeWaterproof:yes, Gore-TexSizing:true to sizeBest leather walkingboots:Altberg MalhamView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fabio de Paola/The Guardian£234.99 at AltbergIf you’re a traditionalist who scoffs at the mere mention of modern synthetic boots, Altberg’s leathery offerings will be right up your street. This particular boot is designed for day hiking or hillwalking paths and trails, so it’s best for those who don’t intend to venture too far off-piste. That being said, with its robust build and sturdy sole, there aren’t many places below the snowline that the Malham wouldn’t confidently take you. It’s a proper boot for proper British hillwalking, built using knowledge passed down over generations.Why we love itQuality, handcrafted and small-batch production are Altberg’s USPs. There’s a personal touch to the entire experience that, along with the high quality of the product, I feel justifies the lofty price tag.The boots themselves are faultless. Comfortable from day one (a rarity among leather boots), and the sole features a subtle rocker profile that propels me forward in a pleasant rolling motion with every step. Of all the boots I tested, these are the ones that filled me with the most confidence as I stood ankle-deep in a Cheviot Hills peat bog. The mostly seam-free uppers and duck-like ability to shrug off water with ease meant that not a single drop got through. They look beautiful too – simple, uncluttered, brown; the way hiking boots always used to be.The best thing about leather walking boots is that they get more comfortable the more they’re worn, conforming to the contours of the foot as they soften up. I certainly found this to be the case with the Malham, which, after a few hours of walking, felt practically slipper-esque.It’s a shame that …those durable leather uppers add a lot of weight, which could be tiring on longer walks.Suitable for:hillwalking in wet and muddy British conditionsMaterial:leatherWaterproof:yes, SympatexSizing:true to sizeBest lightweight walking boots:Inov8 Roclite Mid GTXView image in fullscreen£134.99 at SportsShoes£150 at Inov8If you like your hikes fast and your footwear featherlight, this trail shoe on steroids from Inov8 is a solid option. Born on the outskirts of the Lake District, Inov8 is a brand with well-established roots in fell running and a reputation for creating grippy, go-anywhere footwear. The Roclite Mid GTX is no exception. That being said, those on the hunt for something robust, sturdy and built for steep, rocky terrain may wish to keep scrolling, because a stiff, mountain-ready boot this is not.Why we love itLight, flexible, sure-footed in mud, and cut just high enough to offer some support without hampering ankle mobility, the Roclite Mid GTX is ideal for those who like to move fast. It’s extremely grippy, with 6mm lugs that bite hungrily into muddy trails and a Gore-Tex membrane that seals out the worst of the British weather. The boots also have what Inov8 calls its “Powerflow Pro” midsole. Techy jargon aside, this is a lightweight foam that gives the Roclite a cushioned, almost bouncy quality.Fit wise, I found the Roclite to be wide but short. There’s plenty of room in the forefoot, but I found my usual size of 8.5 to be on the snug side in terms of length. If I were to trial these boots again, I’d probably go up a half size.As fantastic as the Roclite is, it’s important to note that this is not a mountain boot. If your routes tend to involve anything more technical than light scrambling, this is probably not the boot for you.It’s a shame that …the sizing is a bit awkward.Suitable for:fast, light hikes in spring/summer and tackling muddy trailsMaterial:mesh bonded to a Gore-Tex membraneWaterproof:yesSizing:I needed a half size biggerBest mountain-ready boots:Mammut Kento Tour High GTXView image in fullscreen£220 at MammutCasual hillwalking is all well and good, but if you’re looking for something that can carry you to higher altitudes and cope with moderate mountain conditions, this three-season boot from Mammut is an excellent choice. It’s tall, stiff and crampon compatible – perfect for UK mountain adventures.Why we love itThe Kento Tour is a boot that means business. The collar sits above the ankle for full support, the nubuck upper is thick and hard-wearing, and the rubber rand bolsters overall durability, fending off scuffs and scrapes with ease. The sole is stiff enough to allow precise movement on rocky terrain, but not to the point that walking on the flat becomes an uncomfortable slog.For a boot this burly, you might expect some initial discomfort, but I didn’t find this to be the case. The Kento felt great from day one, and I was particularly fond of the asymmetric lacing system that extends down almost to the toe. This makes it easy to dial in the fit, fine-tuning the tension where required and making it easy to relieve pressure points.If you’re tired of burning through lightweight boots, the Kento is worth the investment. Overkill for low-level summer walks? Probably. But as an option to bridge the gap between a relatively soft-soled walking boot and a full-blown mountaineering boot, it’s hard to fault.It’s a shame that …it’s simply too much boot for casual hikes and hillwalking.Suitable for:steep climbs and scrambling in spring, summer and autumnMaterial:nubuck leather with rubber randWaterproof:yes, Gore-TexSizing:true to sizeBesthiking boot for durability:Meindl Bhutan MFSView image in fullscreen£232 at Cotswold Outdoor£290 at George FisherAdvancements in materials and footwear construction have left traditional leather boots lagging behind their lightweight, synthetic counterparts. But there’s still something to be said for a tough leather hiking boot – as this bestselling option from Meindl proves. If you value longevity, support and all-weather reliability, sometimes the old ways are the best.Why we love itThe Bhutan MFS is a direct descendant of the German brand’s legendary Burma Pro. Like its predecessor, it’s a classic leather boot perfectly built for tackling mid-mountain conditions. This makes it a superb all-rounder and ideal for UK hiking and walking. It has a full nubuck leather upper, reinforced with a rubber rand, and there’s a Gore-Tex lining that works with the leather to keep feet bone dry. Unfortunately, that weather resistance comes at the expense of breathability, meaning the Bhutan can feel rather stuffy in warm weather.That’s not to say the Bhutan is in any way uncomfortable. Quite the opposite. The memory foam padding conformed nicely to my ankles as the miles racked up, but I was surprised at just how good the boots felt right away. The high ankle helps with support on uneven terrain, and I found the lacing system great for tailoring the fit.Underfoot, things are stiff and structured. This is more than welcome on rocky ground, but might feel a bit too rigid for casual strolls on undemanding country paths. The Vibram Multigrip sole is excellent, though. I found traction to be top notch on everything from mud to wet rocks to scree. In short, it’s well equipped to chew up anything the UK hills can feed it.At 807g per boot, this is no lightweight boot, but the counter-argument is durability, especially when you consider that the Bhutan is designed to be resoled. Expensive? Yes, but consider it an investment. With the right care, it’ll outlast those modern featherweight alternatives several times over.It’s a shame that …they’re a bit cumbersome and definitely overbuilt for fast, low-level walks, but that’s not what they’re made for.Suitable for:mountain hikes, long days on rough ground, all-weather hillwalkingMaterial:nubuck leather with full rubber randWaterproof:yes, Gore-TexSizing:I had to go a half size down from my usual UK 8.5, but I do have very narrow feet.

It felt comfortable immediately. In fact, the first time I put it on, I went straight for a 15-mile walk with no rubbing or pinching whatsoever. That being said, my feet did get rather hot wearing them on a warm summer’s day. Perhaps they’re better suited for use in cold weather.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

These boots are a prime example. They’re accessibly priced at £69.99, but they’re also surprisingly durable, sturdy and waterproof. They even remained water-tight in the boggy Cheviot terrain.Granted, they’re not the most beautifully constructed boots – my test pair has visible glue where the outsole meets the toe, and the tongue is extremely thin – but they’re reasonably comfortable, grippy beyond their modest price tag and yet to let in water. This is about as good as it gets for under £100, unless you want to wait around for the sales.It didn’t make the final cut because …the build quality isn’t perfect.Suitable for:light hikes on mixed terrain;material:synthetic;waterproof:yes;sizing:true to sizeKeen Arroyo IIView image in fullscreenFrom £55 at KeenFrom £69.12 at AmazonBest for:warm summer hikesKeen’s Arroyo II is not actually a boot at all. Still, it was important to include something for those who find traditional hiking boots too hot in summer. This is essentially a hiking shoe-sandal hybrid, offering a rare combination of complete ventilation and a robust, grippy sole for support and traction on rough terrain. The neoprene lining means the walking shoes are comfortable with or without socks, and bungee laces make them easy to get on and off.If I had to pick fault, I’d say the Arroyo II is not much of a looker. But, hey, you’re heading to the hills, not Milan fashion week.They also feature a label that confusingly says “waterproof”.

It is, in a word, beefy. Every textile panel, piece of leather and rubber overlay is burly and tough, giving an overall sense of robustness – if it can be reinforced, it has been reinforced. It’s also the tallest boot I tested, extending several inches above the ankle, and waterproof all the way to the top. That means it works well when carrying heavy loads, such as on overnight backpacking trips or multi-day expeditions.If your average jaunt into the wilderness involves mostly light trails, bridleways and rarely creeps over 10 miles, this is not the boot for you. If, on the other hand, you regularly venture off the beaten track and cover long distances in less than favourable conditions, the Quest 4 is the workhorse for which you’ve been looking.It didn’t make the final cut because…this heavy, stiff boot is overkill for casual hikes.Suitable for:multi-day treks with a heavy pack;material:leather/synthetic mix;waterproof:yes, Gore-Tex;sizing:true to sizeDanner Mountain 600 EvoView image in fullscreen£250 at DannerBest for:classic looks packed with modern techOld meets new in this hybrid boot from American bootmaker Danner. With a round toe, D-ring lacing system and clean full-grain leather upper, it looks like a traditional leather hiking boot at first glance. Look a little closer, though, and you’ll find it’s anything but. A springy foam midsole lends the boot an almost trainer-like quality, and a synthetic textile in the tongue gusset adds a pop of colour while also bringing the weight down. I found them to be completely waterproof in rain and standing water.I was particularly fond of the lacing system, which extends almost to the toe. This meant I was able to tailor the fit by tightening and loosening certain portions all the way up the boot, resulting in a remarkably comfortable first hike. There’s also a spare pair of flat laces in a different colour included, which is a nice touch.It didn’t make the final cut because …it lacks a proper toe guard for rocky trails.Suitable for:day hikes on mixed terrain;material:leather/synthetic mix;waterproof:yes, Gore-Tex;sizing:true to sizeVivobarefoot Tracker Forest EscView image in fullscreen£210 at VivobarefootFrom £173.50 at AmazonBest for:wide feet or barefoot shoe enthusiastsBarefoot shoes, also known as zero-drop or minimalist shoes, have been growing in popularity for several years. Vivobarefoot is the brand responsible for starting the craze. Its thin-soled footwear is designed to reconnect the wearer to the earth below them while allowing the foot to move in the way nature intended.The Tracker Forest Esc brings this concept to the world of hiking. The boot features a wide, roomy front that gives toes room to spread while walking, and the sole is thin enough to allow the terrain to be felt underfoot, despite being heavily treaded with deep rubber lugs. Once I got used to the sensation of having my foot flat on the ground with no cushioning elevating my heel, I found the Tracker Esc to be incredibly comfortable and grippy. My feet had plenty of room to move around inside, but the high collar and wide positioning of the lace loops meant the boots never felt loose or excessively roomy.I know several avid walkers and hikers with wide feet (including my own mother) who have historically struggled to find shoes that fit. They tell me that switching to barefoot designs has been a gamechanger in terms of comfort. On top of that, Vivobarefoot is a certified B Corporation, which makes me feel slightly better about trampling all over mother nature in its products.It didn’t make the final cut because …these boots are not fully waterproof. They will let water through in the wettest of conditions, so they may not be the best option for British winters.Suitable for:hiking and trekking in dry conditions;material:leather;waterproof:no;sizing:runs half a size largeWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fabio de Paola/The GuardianWaterproof vs water resistantMost hiking boots are treated with a durable water repellent (DWR) coating that allows water to bead off the surface. This makes them water resistant, but it doesn’t necessarily make them waterproof. DWR alone won’t stop water from getting through in heavy rain or when the boot is fully submerged.Waterproof boots are treated with DWR too, but they also feature a membrane beneath the face fabric that stops water droplets from passing through while still allowing water vapour – ie sweat – to escape from within.Gore-Tex is the biggest name in waterproof membrane, but there are others, such as Sympatex and Pertex, that work in much the same way.It’s worth noting that even the very best waterproof boots may not keep your feet bone dry all the time. Sometimes, water can creep in at the ankle and be unable to escape, or your feet will begin to produce sweat faster than the fabric can wick it to the outside. Either way, the result is damp socks.FitHiking boots are supposed to be worn with thick socks. It’s also likely your feet will swell slightly as you rack up the miles. Your boots should fit slightly larger than your street shoes to accommodate for this. But fear not, most boot brands factor this in. So, in most cases, your normal size should be correct.If in doubt, many brands have online sizing tools and charts you can consult. Or, in an ideal world, go into your local outdoors shop to try on a few pairs. As a wise shop assistant once told me: “The pair of boots youwantisn’t necessarily the pair of boots youneed.”Another option is to go for a scan. This is the most accurate way of measuring your feet, and it can be particularly useful for those who struggle to find footwear that fits. Many outdoor shops offer this service in store,Cotswold Outdoorbeing one of them.Another thing to consider is weight. Lighter boots tend to be more comfortable and manoeuvrable. Heavier boots often provide greater stability, but can tire out the legs over long distances.MaterialLeather boots are famously hardy, but they’re also heavy, cumbersome and can lack breathability. As a result, brands are increasingly working with synthetic materials that allow them to make their boots lighter and more breathable. Unfortunately, this tends to come at the expense of durability.If you’re looking for a lightweight boot that’s highly breathable and immediately comfortable but may last only a year or two, go for synthetic. If you want a solid workhorse of a boot that’s perhaps a little heavy, but will still be chugging away after multiple resoles, choose leather.A good compromise is nubuck. This low-maintenance buffed leather is more flexible and breathable than its full-grain counterpart, with better durability than many synthetic materials. This makes it a popular choice for hiking boots.Care and cleaningMaintenance is extremely important if you want to preserve the life and waterproofness of your boots. Most brands offer detailed instructions, but generally speaking, you’ll need to do the following regularly.Clean:scrub away excess mud and wipe boots with a damp cloth.Dry:remove moisture from inside the boots by stuffing them with newspaper and leaving them to dry out.Reproof:that DWR coating needs to be refreshed at regular intervals. The material of your boots will determine the best product for the job, so check the manufacturer’s website for recommendations.PriceJust like energy, food and housing, hiking boots aren’t getting any cheaper. These days, it’s difficult to find a durable, comfortable pair for less than £100 without hitting the sales. Most mid-range pairs sit somewhere between £150 and £220, and high-end mountaineering boots can easily hit £500+.The mid-range tends to be the most cost-effective place to aim. Cheap out on low-quality boots, and you risk having to replace them sooner than anticipated. As for the high-end stuff – if your typical outdoor adventure tends not to involve ropes, helmets or belay devices, they’re almost certainly overkill.How to break in walking bootsIf your new boots are giving you trouble, you might be wondering how to break them in. Well, good news and bad news. According to Peter, a boot fitter atLD Mountain Centrein Newcastle upon Tyne, most boots should be pretty comfortable straight out of the box. If yours aren’t, it could point to a problem with the fit. The good news is that it may just be a case of wearing them on shorter walks at first and gradually building the distance. Failing that, the shop you bought them from might be able to help.“Most modern synthetic boots shouldn’t really need breaking in, but if your leather boots are nipping somewhere, the shop you bought them from can use a rubbing bar [a boot-fitting tool for reshaping leather footwear] to stretch the problem area out slightly,” Peter says. “Chances are, these things sort themselves out over time anyway, but using the rubbing bar can speed up the break-in process.”In Peter’s view, prevention is better than cure, which is why trying on boots is such an important part of the process. “I always give the customer at least three boots to try after assessing their foot shape and volume,” he says. “We then pick the best fit out of those.”He also points out that most good boot shops will give you the option to wear your boots around the house for a few weeks and return them if they’re not quite right.For more footwear inspiration, read our guide onthe best boots for menPaddy Maddison is aconsumer journalist, outerwear enthusiast and exercise addict.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve been drinkinga lotof riesling lately. There is, naturally, quite a bit of variety in a drinks writer’s liquid diet, so to have the same thing twice in one week is a sure indication of a fascination developing, or of a habit forming. There’s not much psychoanalysis required as to why that might be the case: the sun is out and, by the time this column comes out, it will (hopefully) be here to stay. And, for that, I simply must have a glass of white wine in my hand.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Or maybe I need to dig a bit deeper. Why riesling specifically? I like my riesling how all the other freaks do – namely when it tastes as little like wine as possible. When petrol and wax abound on the nose. And with an acidity that slaps you round the face a little, as well as generous fruit that soothes. Riesling is a wine that feels like a meal. And, just maybe, after a haggard winter marked by comforting reds and weighted blankets, I’m in the mood to be challenged and excited again.It’s because of these peculiar, acquired-taste notes that riesling is so often a grape for the wine nerds, yes, but that’s also why I’m so pleased it’s so easy to pick up in supermarkets and wine shops alike. The kinds of riesling you’ll most likely find in the supermarket are German and dry, though there is also plenty to discover from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Alsace. They tend to be labelled by variety only, however, so if you want to be sure of the sweetness levels, make sure you check the label to know what to expect.In the wine classification ofprädikatswein, the lightest dry German rieslings are described askabinett-style: that is, bright and with low residual sugar. These are usually appley, sprightly things that you can drink without overthinking, and are the sort of riesling to serve to someone who needs convincing, or who doesn’t think a nose pull of petrol is the most pleasurable thing on Earth. Yet.Moving up the scale, we havespätlese(literally, “late harvest”), for which the grapes are picked at least a week after the regular harvest, so have more time to ripen and have a higher sugar content. They also tend to be fleshier, and are certainly the least intense of the sweeter rieslings.You may also come across riesling markedauslese, meaning selected harvest wines that can be even riper than spätlese, but not always. Sweeter, off-dry riesling (wherever it’s from) is the firm foil to the supposition that sweetness = poor quality. These wines can be intriguing, poised, and the best are kept in check with a fine acidity. Confront yourself.

Edited for social media, their videos are designed not just to attract, but to trap attention in a TikTok spell, then communicate a rush of information in a matter of seconds. However, within the well-calculated rush of decisive movements and fishbowl close-ups, Alessandro (otherwise known asSpicy Moustache) is a hugely likable, calm and good teacher.For months now, his enthusiastic and entertaining approach to a vegetable or process has sent me into the kitchen to grate something and rub it with salt, to turn into a fritter or cake. “Such a vivid thing for us today,” is what Jane Grigson said about the ideas of Giacomo Castelvetro, the 16th-century proponent of vegetables and author of The Fruit, Herbs andVegetablesof Italy (1614), and I think the same can be said about Alessandro.In fact, Giacomo and Alessandro have a huge amount in common. Born almost four centuries apart, as well as 100 miles apart in Modena and Verona, they both developed a love of vegetables at a young age; moved to England; and became keen gardeners determined to share practical, simple and elegant ways of preparing vegetables. I have long been a fan of Giacomo, even more so now that I have put him in a complementary relationship with Alessandro; the two provide me with multi-dimensional inspiration. I am just sorry they can’t co-present a TV show.Their double act inspiration this week isscarpaccia, which means old shoe, apparently – a clear image for the thickness of the final dish. It wasAlessandro’s quick-paced videothat taught me about this baked courgette dish, of which there are endless variations, but two broad forms. First, a sweet version, often calledtorta dolce di verdura, a sweet cake of vegetables made from equal quantities of flour and courgettes, along with basil, sugar and yeast. Thenthere is the savoury scarpaccia, typical of the province of Lucca (and in particular the town of Camaiore), for which thinly sliced courgettes and their flowers are baked for about an hour in a batter of egg, flour and cheese.I have taken inspiration from all the above, plus Castelvetro’s fritters, for this version that tastes like a cross between chickpea flour pancakes (I am thinking here of Italianfarinataor Indianbesan ka chilla) and vegetable and chickpea flour fritters, such as pakoras.Looking again to Giacomo and Alessandro for inspiration, a grated cabbage, beetroot and apple salad with feta would be good here, as would a green salad dressed according to Castelvetro’s sacred law of salads: plenty of salt, generous amounts of oil and a little vinegar.Courgette, onion and chickpea flour bake (lascarpaccia camaiorese)1kg courgettes, with flowers, if possible1 bunchspring onions2 heapedtbspchickpea(gram) flour1 heapedtbspgrated parmesanSalt and freshly ground black pepperExtra-virgin olive oilYou need a nonstick, roughly 36cm x 20cm baking tray, with a lip. Using a mandoline, the cheese slicer of a box grater or a sharp knife, slice the courgettes and onions (both white and green parts) into thin rounds. If you have courgette flowers, roughly chop them.Put the sliced vegetables (but not the flowers) in a colander or sieve sitting on a plate and sprinkle over two teaspoons of salt. Use your hands to scrunch the salt into the vegetables, then leave them to sit for two hours. The vegetables will release liquid as they sit, but it pays to press down, so as much liquid as possible is released on to the plate (reserve the liquid for now).Put the sliced vegetables and flowers in a bowl and add the chickpea flour, parmesan, some salt and a few grinds of pepper, and toss everything together. It may be that there is still enough moisture in the vegetables that the flour coats them with a sticky, batter-like texture; if not, add a little of the reserved liquid and toss again. Tip the mixture into the tray and level with your hand – it should be about 1cm deep. Zigzag the top with olive oil and bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 20 minutes.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkBakingVegetablesMain courseSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

We obviously know each other intimately, but I just can’t get on board with sharing earphones. There’s something so gross about it. I hate cleaning off someone else’s earwax afterwards and Lila’s ears are generally stickier than mine.Lila thinks I’m overreacting. She thinks that because we’re dating it’s weird to be so grossed out by this. But I wouldn’t use her toothbrush, so why would I use her earphones?We both have cheap pairs and leave them around the flat. But Lila treats both sets as if they are hers, even though I deliberately bought blue ones to distinguish them. I only use mine, so when I see her connecting to my set for a run, or walking out the door with them, I make her swap.This isn’t just me being fussy, it’s actually backed by science. Earwax carries bacteria and earphones can trap moisture. I read an article that said shared earphones can increase the risk of ear infections. Maybe I’m a neurotic germophobe, but I’d rather that than get an ear infection.Lila has lost her earphones twice. She used to have some expensive Apple ones, which she left in a bar. Since then, she’s only had cheaper ones, but she’s lost those too. I don’t want her to lose mine.Earwax carries bacteria. Maybe I’m a germaphobe, but I’d rather that than get an ear infectionSometimes she forgets to bring hers on a journey. Once, on a trip to Wales to see my parents, she wanted to listen to my playlist. I reluctantly gave her my earphones, even though I didn’t want to. I ended up disinfecting them afterwards, which offended her. Lila framed it as if I had rejected a sweet romantic gesture, but I just didn’t like the idea of shared ear goo.There are lots of other ways to connect, after all. We cuddle, we cook together, we watch movies and I’m affectionate. I just don’t want to be guilt-tripped for keeping my earphones to myself. If I have to start hiding them, I will, but I’d rather Lila just stick to the earphone rules of our home.The defence: LilaWe kiss and do all the normal things couples do – so why are earphones a step too far?Tim is a bit more of a clean freak than me, but I’m not dirty. I always do the lion’s share of the cleaning in our flat and I shower just as often as Tim, which is once a day (sometimes more, if I’ve exercised). But I don’t see sharing earphones as being risky or gross.In the past, when I’ve lost mine, I’ve had no choice but to use his, and then I just got used to it. Tim says sharing is unhygienic, but that feels overblown. We kiss and do all the normal things couples do. But for some reason earphones are a step too far for him.I’m sure there are more bacteria in our mouths. Whenever I use Tim’s earphones he makes this big show of wiping them down with his sleeve, or gets out this special spray. He physically stops me and makes me take his earphones out if he sees me using them.He’s had a few ear infections in his life, from swimming. I’ve never had one, so I don’t know the pain of that. But I’m pretty sure you can’t get an infection from sharing earphones.If you live together everything is fair game- I think sharing headphones on a journey is quite romanticWhen Tim once disinfected his earphones after we shared them on a train journey, I was mildly offended but also quite amused. I didn’t leave any earwax on them and I don’t agree with the notion that my ears are more sticky than his. I clean them regularly, it’s just something he’s conjured up to justify not sharing.I also think sharing earphones on a journey is quite romantic. I’m not trying to infect him, I’m inviting him to watch a show that I’m enjoying. It’s a form of connection, and I don’t think humans get enough of that any more – we are always rushing, or listening to separate shows and playlists on the go. Why not share earphones on a plane and be connected to the same thing?For me, it’s not a big deal – if you live together everything is fair game. When you’re in a relationship, you share things. I’m not asking to borrow his toothbrush or razor, and even that wouldn’t be the end of the world to me. I just want to live safe in the knowledge that if I have to listen to the music for 10 minutes I won’t be treated as though I’m some kind of sticky-eared monster.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I don’t think sharing things in a relationship is a big deal, and agree that it can create a sense of intimacy. But it sounds like this matters more to Tim than it does to Lila, so she should respect his boundaries.Joe, 28Tim is overreacting. How likely is it really that you’d get an ear infection from sharing earphones? When you’re in a long-term relationship, you become a team and it’s nice to feel comfortable enough to share things that you wouldn’t with other people.Grace, 25I do understand where Lila is coming from, and if I were her I’d feel a bit put out too. But it seems like this is a red line for Tim. If Lila wants to share earphones, they should buy a splitter. Then they can share music but keep their own earphones.Ife, 36We all have odd quirks in relationships, and this is clearly Tim’s. Lila might not think it’s a big deal, but if it makes him uncomfortable enough to disinfect his earphones, Lila shouldn’t pressure him into sharing.Elisa, 45I wouldn’t think twice about sharing earphones with my girlfriend, but I still think Lila is in the wrong. If Tim feels that strongly about it, Lila should respect that.Alistair, 31Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us who you think is in the wrong?The poll closes on Wednesday 21 May at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked ifNeil should stop tracking his daughteron his phone97%of you said yes –Neil is guilty3%of you said no –Neil is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeRelationshipsFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If the plans are supported it aims to open a statutory consultation within the coming months.An Ofgem spokesperson said: “We know the cost of energy remains a huge challenge for many households and the growing issue of debt is one that requires urgent action from everyone across the sector and government.“That’s why we’ve introduced tougher rules to make sure energy companies do more to spot the signs when a customer may be struggling and step in quickly to offer support, including offering affordable payment plans or providing emergency credit to reduce the risk of self-disconnection.”Explore more on these topicsHousehold billsOffice for National StatisticsEnergy industryEnergy billsConsumer affairsShareReuse this content"

It might seem shallow to focus on the vestments, but then the pomp, spectacle – and the ceremonial outfits – are all part of the momentous event.The election of the new pope also chimes with a mood in fashion, since religious references – ranging from ornate crucifixes and the sacred heart symbol to prayer beads – have been percolating since well before the conclave. Take the hoodies and skirts of the New York label Who Decides War, which are decorated with stained-glass window designs. Or T-shirts from the most recent collection ofskatewear brand Palace, adorned with the face of the Virgin Mary.View image in fullscreenOff to worship at the Chappell of Roan …Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesAt the Met Gala last week, co-chair Colman Domingo arrived wearing a cape in a heavenly cobalt with an ornate collar, while American fashion designer Willy Chavarria took his turn on the steps wearing a necklace punctuated by crosses and a single rood dangling from a belt loop. He isn’t alone:cross necklaces have been ubiquitous recently, adorning necklines as disparate as those of Chappell Roan and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.There was a hint of incense in the air at several recent fashion shows, too. Chavarria’s presentation, which was held in the American Cathedral in Paris, saw models clutching rosary beads and wearing sweatshirts emblazoned with crosses. British-Nigerian designer Tolu Coker placed prayer beads in the hands of her models at London fashion week, while GmbH did the same in Berlin.According to writer and curator Iain R Webb, it is “the drama, pomp and ceremony of religion and the richness of its associated iconography” that attracts designers. He cites Cristóbal Balenciaga’s “sweeping silhouettes that echoed the cassocks of cardinals” and Christian Lacroix’s bejewelled crucifix jacket, which he presented in 1999.But while fashion has always toyed with the trappings of religion, there could be something more to this revival than mere aesthetics. “In this new dark age, now more than ever, people are choosing to engage with the spiritual in an effort to find something more meaningful that refuels their souls,” Webb says. It tracks with the growing numbers ofyoung people embarking on spiritual journeys– this year, 45% of 18 to 24-year-olds in the UK said they believe in God; in 2019, only 22% said they did.View image in fullscreenCardinal chic …. Ralph Fiennes in the 2024 hit Conclave.Photograph: Courtesy of Focus Features. © 2024 All Rights Reserved.J’Nae Phillips, trend forecaster and creator ofFashion Tingz, agrees that the new religious dressing “seems to go beyond mere styling. It suggests a deeper grappling with identity, heritage, and perhaps a collective sense of unease or longing for grounding in uncertain times.” Where once, she says, “religious symbolism in fashion might have been purely provocative or ironic, today there’s often sincerity behind it”.Nonetheless, in 2025, overt displays of Christianity can bring up unholy associations with the religious right. As if to counteract this, at his Paris show, Chavarria played the speech that the Right Rev Mariann Budde, bishop of Washington, gave at Trump’s inauguration, in which sheimplored him to have mercyon immigrants and the LGBTQ+ community. Rather than heeding her wise words, Trump later called Budde a “Radical Left hard line Trump hater”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m on my way toLuckey Tor, one of Dartmoor’s most hidden rock stacks, which sits by the river, shrouded in vegetation like Sleeping Beauty’s castle. It’s not the easiest of walks. The path peters out as I get deeper into the gorge, and the final approach to the tor involves clambering and hopping over large mossy boulders and navigating huge shelves of rock that border the river.The first sight of it is unforgettable. A small stream, the Row Brook, runs in front of it, like a moat. The tor looms up squarely from the valley floor, dwarfing everything around, framed in a grassy clearing that is a popular place to bivouac. Its position is unusual. Most tors are at the summit of a hill, dominating the views for miles around, standing grandly in the landscape, devoid of trees. Luckey Tor is sequestered in the folds of the Dart valley, and in the summer is mostly obscured by foliage; when you find it, you feel as though you’ve entered a secret kingdom.A map of Darmoor showing some tors and the main townsThe tor is one of hundreds on Dartmoor (the actual number is disputed). The name comes from the Celtic wordtwrmeaning tower; it refers to a rocky outcrop that rises sharply from the land around it. These natural monoliths are about 280 million years old; they erupt from the moor, like stone beings, in a variety of outlandish shapes and sizes, looking like castles, creatures, monsters and giants. Their unusual appearance has given rise to numerous myths and legends: Vixen tor is home toVixiana the witch; the devil resides at the Dewerstone (and numerous other places, of course); and Old Crockern, “the gert old spirit of the moor”, lives by Crockern Tor.The authors of the first guides to Dartmoor called the tors rock idols because they believed they were worshipped by the druids. In 1793’s Historical Views of Devonshire, Richard Polwhele wrote: “In the druid ages, stones of various shapes were consecrated to religion … They prostrated themselves before the rudest … And wherever we find stones, which are at the same time massy and misshapen, there we look for the druidical gods. Vastness, in short, and rudeness were the characteristics of the druid rock-idols … ”View image in fullscreenBlackingstone Rock, with its surreal metal staircase.Photograph: Adam Burton/AlamyThe idea of worshipping rocks is not exclusive to Dartmoor. Cultures around the world, including the Sami people and indigenous Australians, revere rocks; they are full of natural majesty and tend to be in high places, perhaps connecting us to the heavens and even the underworld. It seems likely that our ancestors on Dartmoor, who were more attuned to the landscape features than we are today, regarded the tors as sacred. And we know, from the monuments they left behind – notably stone circles and stone rows, of which Dartmoor has some of the best examples in western Europe – that they practised some sort of faith.There is no doubt that Dartmoor feels like a sacred landscape, and its majestic rock stacks are part of that. They, and the moorland in which they sit, have been part of my life for the last 25 years; we first moved here back in 2000. I have walked among them, my children have played among them, and they have borne witness to many of the big moments in my life, both joyful and traumatic.View image in fullscreenWatern Tor, an ice-carved granite masterpiece.Photograph: Sophie PierceI first had the idea for an illustrated book about this place I love so much when visiting the Lake District. We used the hand-drawn Wainwright guides, which we found compelling because of their subjective, intimate feel; they really reflectedAlfred Wainwright’s deeply personal relationship with the fells. I thought it would be great to produce a book like this for Dartmoor – with drawings by my husband, Alex, an artist. We ended up going on a granite pilgrimage, choosing 28 of the tors, and having wildly different experiences at all of them. They all have distinctive characters: Blackingstone Rock, with its surreal metal staircase going up the side, with curlicued, wrought-iron handrails, is a Victorian stairway to heaven. Hen Tor, by contrast, stands in total isolation, miles from anywhere, in an ocean of rock, like a stumpy cargo ship sailing forth in granite seas. And Watern Tor is an extraordinary ice-carved masterpiece of whirlpool granite, standing high above the Scorhill stone circle in the basin below.View image in fullscreenDrawings from Rock Idols of Hen Tor, left, and Blackstone Rock.Illustration: Alex MurdinOur passion for this place has resulted in us setting up a new festival too, the Dartmoor Tors festival (which runs from 23 to 25 May), to share the enchantment of the moor, and ponder why it makes us feel the way we do. We’ve got artists, writers, campaigners, archaeologists and musicians coming together to explore our human, emotional connection with wild landscapes. There will be talks and conversations, as well as a variety of walks, with artists, archaeologists and storytellers, to sacred sites including stone rows, cairn circles and, of course, the tors.For us, the answer to why we love this place always seems to go back to the stone, the stone that connects us to our ancestors, that stone that they most probably worshipped, and which added a spiritual element to their lives. Paradoxically, stone is traditionally perceived as static and still, almost dead. But it is most definitely alive, just on a totally different timescale from us, existing in deep time, across millions of years, in contrast to our small, fleeting, lives.Sophie Pierce, with Alex Murdin, is the author ofRock Idols:A Guide to Dartmoor in 28 Tors(Wild Things Publishing, £14.99).

Zeinab al Astal arrived with her two sick sons as dusk was falling on Wednesday evening, and she seemed stunned they had made it at all.Twenty-four hours earlier she had been watching chunks of ceiling crash down to the floor around them, afterIsrael bombed the European hospital in Khan Youniswhere they were staying.“This medical evacuation saved us,” she said, minutes after crossing into Jordan, where her sons Ahmad, 13, and Qassem, 15, will get treatment for leukaemia, something that is now almost impossible insideGaza.Medical equipment has been destroyed, medicines are running out,one in three hospitals have been closed by attacks, those partly functioning are overcrowded with victims of airstrikes and assaults, and the ranks of doctors and nurses have been decimated by Israeli detention and killings.The Astal brothers and other cancer patients are doubly unlucky children, trapped in a brutal war while also fighting their own traumatic battles against a deadly disease.Their best hope of survival is to apply for treatment abroad, and then wait for Israeli authorities’ response – although trying to get an exit permit can feel like a grim lottery.View image in fullscreenZeinab and Ahmad al Astal arrive in Jordan. They were evacuated from Gaza after Israel attacked the hospital in Khan Younis where they were staying.Photograph: Emma Graham-Harrison/The GuardianQassem was diagnosed with cancer a year and a half before the family reached Jordan, and Ahmad has been ill for nearly a year, needing regular blood transfusions in recent months.The urgent need for medical evacuations from Gaza outstripped capacity even before the war, and the UN estimates there are now more than 12,000 people who need to travel for treatment they cannot get inside the strip.The backlog is so great that the World Health Organization director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned in January that unless Israel allowed greater numbers to leave, it would take five or 10 years for all children in need of help to reach hospitals where they could be treated.Nine-year-old Sama has a brain tumour, and the seizures it causes have been getting steadily worse. “There are no working MRIs in Gaza, so it is difficult to tell the nature of the tumour and decide how to treat it,” her mother, Isra, said.Four months ago her doctors applied for an urgent medical evacuation, which was approved after a few days. But Israeli authorities said Sama’s six-year-old brother, Abdul Rahman, would have to stay in Gaza.Chart on evacuationsIsra could not face leaving her younger child to face the incessant explosions, hunger and horrors of war without his mum. “We declined the offer to take only Sama,” she said. It took weeks for her to get permission to leave with both children.Sama, the Astal brothers and one other child who is fighting cancer left Gaza on Wednesday with their close relatives, under an initiative agreed between Jordan’s King Abdullah and the US president, Donald Trump.Jordan wanted to evacuate the children from Gaza by air but Israeli officials refused, Jordanian officials said. So just the final section was covered in helicopters, from the Jordanian border crossing to the hospital in Amman.It is about 80 miles (130km) in a direct line from eastern Gaza to the Allenby Bridge border crossing, but the group spent all day travelling overland across Israel, including six hours waiting to leave Gaza without any water, Astal said.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian child from Gaza suffering from malnutrition is evacuated to Abu Dhabi. More than 15,000 children have been killed by attacks and airstrikes since the war began.Photograph: Amr Alfiky/ReutersThe families came out of the strip with little more than the clothes on their back and a plastic folder of medical documents for each sick child. They are likely to return with nothing more than that.On 13 May at the Kerem Shalom border crossing, Israelis seized the cash and possessions of several Palestinian families who were travelling back into the strip after getting treatment in Jordan, Jordanian officials said.Those who get out represent just a fraction of children in urgent medical need. Rawan, just over a year old, has been waiting since the end of 2024 for permission to get treatment outside Gaza.Jonathan Crickx, a Unicef spokesperson – who met Rawan and her mother this week – spotted her in the Nasser hospital because, among rows of severely malnourished children, she looked relatively healthy. Her plump cheeks concealed a failing heart.“She has a congenital heart issue and needs an operation urgently. Her mother applied for medical evacuation five months ago and she is still waiting for approval,” he said.“Her brother also had a medical condition requiring evacuation and he died recently while on the waiting list.”A picture that shocked the world: the story behind baby Siwar AshourRead moreRawan’s mother is terrified her daughter will slip away next, but is entirely helpless. The surgery she needs is no longer possible in Gaza.“The entire health system is on its knees, only 20 hospitals out of 35 are partially functioning,” said Crickx. “They have been running out of anaesthesia and anti-coagulant, and they long ago ran out of supplies to treat children with cancer.”To get permission to travel, cases are put forward by doctors in Gaza, and most are endorsed by the WHO before they are sent to Israeli authorities for assessment.Between the start of the war in October 2023 and the middle of last month, more than 7,200 Palestinians were medically evacuated from Gaza for treatment.The largest group of patients were treated for trauma injuries but hundreds had cancer, blood diseases, eye problems and cardiovascular disease. They have been treated in countries across the region, from Qatar to Turkey, in Algeria and EU countries.More than 15,000 children have been killed by attacks and airstrikes since the war began, figures from health authorities in Gaza show. Other lives have been cut short by diseases ranging from measles to diarrhoea, which spread easily in shelters and tent encampments with little sanitation or clean water, or by hunger.Malnutrition has killed 57 children since Israel stopped letting food and medical aid into Gaza in March, the UN said. Tens of thousands more are at risk of sliding into a state of acute malnutrition.Hunger also makes children more vulnerable, weakening their bodies and starving them of the energy they need to fight disease.“People in Gaza are trapped in a dangerous cycle where malnutrition and disease fuel each other, turning everyday illness into a potential death sentence, particularly for children,” the WHO said.“Malnutrition weakens the bodies, making it harder to heal from injuries and fight off common communicable diseases.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaJordanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The woman is ahaenyeo. Haenyeo, or “women of the sea”, have been recorded as far back as the 17th century and are unique to the island of Jeju inSouth Korea, where they fish sustainably, diving time and again on a single breath to bring back shellfish and seaweed.Yet the scene, set in the 1960s, simply wouldn’t happen today, says Myeonghyo Go, a haenyeo who lives in the village of Iho-dong on Jeju. “The seaweeds here are disappearing, and seaweed is the food for abalone. Because we don’t have the seaweeds, we don’t have abalone,” she says.View image in fullscreenThe haenyeo are unique to the island of Jeju in South Korea.Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty ImagesMyeonghyo is not only a haenyeo, she is a citizen scientist and environmentalist. In her 40s, she represents the new generation of Korea’s traditional divers and her mission is to change the way the women are seen by the outside world.We survive on collecting and selling the seafood, but we are also protecting them. We show how humans and nature can coexist.Myeonghyo GoHaenyeo are one of the country’s most famous cultural exports, with Unesco officially inscribing their work on the representative list of theIntangible Cultural Heritage of Humanitybecause of their focus on sustainability. Yet their future is at a crossroads. Most of them now are over 70, so the national government and the Jeju authorities are keen for a new generation to come forward.When the provincial government (Jeju is a self-governing province within Korea) made its application to Unescoit described how the haenyeo represent“the island’s character and people’s spirit”, yet Myeonghyo feels the resulting fascination with the haenyeo has not always been beneficial to the women’s future.View image in fullscreenMyeonghyo Go with her mother, Chunsuk Son, who was also a haenyeo.Photograph: Domino Albert“I feel uncomfortable when stories about the haenyeo are shared,” she says. “They [those who are telling the stories] take everything that is really important out and only show certain aspects of our lives.”She adds: “There is a famous haenyeo choir and if there’s an official event they are often invited to sing nice songs. But the haenyeo tradition of singing together started from when things became tiring and difficult [during work]. So our songs are not joyous, per se, and what you are seeing is not really authentic.”The fascination with the haenyeo has peaked in the past few years as part ofthe frenzy over Korean culture, kicked off by the rise of K-pop. In 2022, another K-drama, Our Blues,also followed the lives of the sea women, and last year a documentary,The Last of the Sea Women, generated publicity for Apple TV. This month, the BBC will show the first programme it has made in Korea (in collaboration with broadcaster JTBC),Deep Dive Korea. It follows Korean model and actor Song Ji-hyo as she attempts to become a haenyeo.Myeonghyo wants to use the popularity of the haenyeo to create a school to educate people about ocean ecology and create a team of citizen scientists.“When I feel we [the haenyeo] are being used, it used to make me feel quite lonely,” she says. “Then I started to change my mind and think, can I use this interest to tell the real story instead? For me, that is a story that draws on a long tradition of protecting the weak, both in our community and in the natural world.”Video of a female freediver collecting shellfish from the seabedHaenyeo dive for a variety of sea life including mollusks and seaweed. They use a tool like a weeding hoe to separate their catch from the rocks and put what they find in a net attached to a flotation device. Credit: Ko MyunghyoShe says that the haenyeo have a tradition calledhalmeoni bada, which translates as Grandma ocean. It is a designated area of shallow water where the oldest haenyeo go and catch. “So we have this way of caring for elderly people and the weak,” she says. “And then we have communal diving days once or twice a month, where whatever we catch we divide equally between all the haenyeo, regardless of age or experience.”The haenyeo also work with the ocean when they fish, so they don’t dive during a shellfish’s breeding season, for example, but harvest seaweed instead. They also avoid catching conch if they are smaller than 7cm to give the species a chance to reproduce before being harvested.“We survive on collecting and selling the seafood, but we are also protecting them,” she says. “We show how humans and nature can coexist.”View image in fullscreenA haenyeo on Jeju island in 1954.Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesMyeonghyo volunteers with theParan ocean citizen science centre, a relatively new local NGO that employs citizen science to document the changes in the seas around Jeju and uses the information to lobby the government for enhanced marine protection.She needed to be taught to dive with scuba gear to document the ocean flora, and since doing so says she has noticed large, hard corals appearing alongside Jeju’s traditional soft corals. These are more typically found in tropical waters and have only started appearing in such numbers in the past five years when the water temperature around the south side of Jeju has risen markedly,reaching a new record high last year,according to data from the National Institute of Fisheries Science. The same area has also experienced a sharp decline in seaweed, outbreaks of jellyfish and green algae, and the melting of soft corals.Sanghoon Yoon, an adviser at Paran, whose mother was a haenyeo, says the older generation are not always keen to raise their voices about the environment. “Yet the ocean is changing rapidly and they are the first ones to witness those changes and so when we go and talk to them on a one-to-one basis, they start to open their hearts more. My hope is that the younger generation will lead on this change in what the haenyeo stand for.”Before she can start on the rest of the world, however, Myeonghyo has a challenge to tackle closer to home – her mum.Sixty-nine-year-old Chunsuk Son became a haenyeo at 17, following in the footsteps of her mother, but she doesn’t see why her daughter has to do the same.View image in fullscreenSquid hanging out to dry along the Jeju Olle trail on Jeju Island.Photograph: Dave Stamboulis/Alamy“When I educated her, I wanted her to have a proper job like joining the civil service,” she says. “We older women don’t want our daughters to be haenyeo,but Myeonghyo keeps saying that she wants to be one in order to protect the ocean and to help to make where we live a better place. I know she has a different aim [as a haenyeo] and a different direction.

Plus a letter fromTrevor BonnerThu 15 May 2025 12.48 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 12.58 EDTShareThis government is on course to go down in history as one of the worst for women and girls (Labour to defend aid cuts, claiming UK’s days as ‘a global charity’ are over, 13 May). We already know that the aid cuts will be deadly, but wiping out all funding to programmes thatsupport women and girlsis a new low – even if the government is saying the budget for women and girls will be “mainstreamed” or folded into other programmes.Specific programmes help girls into education, help mothers deliver babies safely, and protect women from violence. While some governments are stepping back from supporting women, I never imagined the UK would follow suit. It’s not only catastrophic in the short term for women who will have life-saving support withdrawn but a shortsighted measure that will ultimately work against the government’s own peace, security and growth agenda.Evidence shows that when women thrive, communities and economies prosper, and societies become more peaceful. It’s in everyone’s interest to ensure that this rash decision, made to balance the books, doesn’t now cause irreparable harm in the long run.The government’s rhetoric about “global charity” and its decision to make savings on the backs of women and girls marks a dangerous shift away from the British values of inclusion and solidarity that it claims to celebrate. This plan would not only be another broken manifesto pledge but it signifies the UK joining a tragic race to the bottom.Dr Helen PankhurstSenior adviser on gender equality, Care International UKI have decided to follow the example of our esteemed development minister and cancel all my charitable giving in exchange for offering my special expertise. If all UK donors follow the same example, we can destroy the charitable sector and present our esteemed chancellor and her disgraceful colleagues with a massive problem.That is what is now happening in the developing world. First, Donald Trump decided to cancel USAID, and then his proxy in the UK cabinet decided to kiss his bottom and reduce UK spending in exchange for any expertise that we may have (not much!). For the avoidance of doubt, I was opposed to reducing the foreign aid budget from0.5% to 0.3% of GDP from 2027. As a higher-rate taxpayer, I believe that I can plead a case for how tax revenues are spent.

I graduated from Cambridge about the same time as Gaby Hinsliff (We told young people that degrees were their ticket to a better life. It’s become a great betrayal, 13 May). Without middle-class connections, or “professional” work experience, I returned home after graduation to a neighbourhood counted among the 1% most deprived in England, in a post-industrial northern city with a crumbling social infrastructure. I had £30 to my name and took a job worse than the one I’d had while at school in order to live.To get to London, where there was a greater range of jobs, I did non-graduate work for a few years, sofa-surfing to begin with. Like today’s graduates, I had to do further study to get a decent job, and I was just shy of 40 when I managed to get a career job. I guess it is a better life in the end, as the alternative may well have been a cycle of bad jobs and unemployment.Of course, this circuitous route to decent work and conditions means that I couldn’t afford to live in London (I left), and won’t ever earn enough for a middle-class home and a good pension.As always, jobs, housing, pensions and other social issues become a political problem when it is deep enough to affect privileged white middle-class people in addition to those at the bottom of the pecking order who were already affected.Name and address suppliedGaby Hinsliff writes of the increasingly disappointing prospects for new graduates. Thanks to the Blair-era policy of “everyone must go to university”, we have a massive oversupply of young graduates in the UK. We also have a massive shortage of more practical skills – Angela Rayner’sambitious housebuilding programmewas scuppered before it even got off the ground because we do not have nearly enough tradespeople to build 1.5m homes.Yet the government has justannounced its intention to allow only those with a degree to immigrate to Britainas skilled workers. Astoundingly, they are going to import more graduates to compete with young British graduates for jobs, while banning the people we need most – those who do the jobs that young British people can’t or won’t do. I’m trying to think of a way this policy could be more stupid, but I’m not succeeding.Anne-Louise CrockerShoreham, KentGaby Hinsliff notes that many graduates of the class of 2024-25 may struggle to find appropriate employment. That is true, although those who do get jobs will get better salaries over time, albeit with student loans to pay off. Hinsliff also raises the issue of whether studying for a degree is worthwhile. It is an argument put forward by the culture-war right – namely, that graduates who can’t get jobs become highly educated troublemakers.Indeed, while my first degree, nearly 50 years ago, did lead me into a professional job, it also taught me how to write a leaflet, organise a protest and speak at mass meetings. None of this was of course on the official curriculum. A reminder, and something Hinsliff misses, that there is such a thing as a liberal education, something beyond monetary value.Keith FlettTottenham, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

My husband suffered a severe stroke 14 years ago. Every day since, a care worker has visited us to get him up and wash and dress him.

Some of our staff may not have higher education qualifications (although many do), but they are all well trained, empathetic and dedicated to their work.

The immigrants still face charges accusing them of crossing the border illegally.“Judge Wormuth found no probable cause,” Skinner said in an email.The NewMexicoUS attorney Ryan Ellison, who filed the first trespassing charges against migrants on 28 April, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The so-called New Mexico national defense area was established in April along 180 miles (290km) of the border, and US army troops were authorized to detain immigrants entering the area from Mexico.A second buffer zone was set up in Texas this month. The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, said in a social media post the military would continue to expand the zones to gain “100% operational control” of the border.US attorneys charged over 100 immigrants with crossing the border illegally and trespassing in the military zones in New Mexico and Texas. Potential combined penalties were up to 10 years’ imprisonment, according to Hegseth.But Wormuth contested the charges for the immigrants in New Mexico, ordering Ellison on 1 May to show proof they were aware they entered the military zone unlawfully.Defense attorneys argued warning signs in the area were inadequate to inform immigrants they were committing a crime, a position Wormuth agreed with.“The criminal complaint fails to establish probable cause to believe the defendant knew he/she was entering” the military zone, Wormuth wrote in his orders dismissing charges.The Department of Defense did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationNew MexicoTrump administrationUS politicsLaw (US)MexicoUS-Mexico bordernewsShareReuse this content"

The GDF vowed it will “continue to respond to acts of aggression along the Guyana-Venezuela border”.Both countries lay claim to Essequibo, which makes up two-thirds of Guyana’s territory and is home to around 125,000 of its more than 800,000 citizens.Guyana has administered the region for decades, and insists Essequibo’s frontiers were determined by an arbitration panel in 1899.Tensions rise in Guyana as Maduro uses border dispute to build support ahead of Venezuela pollRead moreVenezuela claims the Essequibo River to the region’s east forms a natural border that has been recognized as far back as 1777.The long-running squabble was revived in 2015 after US energy giant ExxonMobil discovered huge crude reserves in Essequibo and reached fever pitch in 2023 when Georgetown started auctioning off oil blocks in the region.The find gave Guyana, a small English-speaking former British and Dutch colony, the largest crude oil reserves per capita in the world.Caracas has since held a referendum asserting its claim to the territory, and has threatened to annex most of the region and make it Venezuela’s 24th state.It has also announced Essequibo will be included in gubernatorial elections planned for 25 May, despite the UN’s top court ordering it not organize a vote there.The GDF said Thursday it “remains resolute in its mission to protect Guyana’s territorial integrity” and was taking “all necessary measures to safeguard the nation’s borders and maintain peace and security within our beloved country”.Tensions calmed after the two countries’ presidents agreed in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines last December 2023 to avoid any use of force, but were fanned again in February when Guyana saidsix of its soldiers were woundedin an ambush in the region.Explore more on these topicsGuyanaVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Son, 32 is hugely popular in South Korea, not only for his success on the pitch in the Premier League but also for his dedication to the country’s national team as their captain.Son returned as a substitute on Sunday from a month’s layoff with a foot problem andhopes to play a partin Wednesday’s Europa League final against Manchester United, unlike the midfielder Dejan Kulusevski, who will miss the match and maybe the start of next season.An innocuous challenge with Crystal Palace’s Marc Guéhi on Sunday forced Kulusevski off and subsequent scans confirmed Tottenham’s worst fears, with the Sweden playmaker set for “months” on the sideline. “Yeah, gutted for Deki,” Ange Postecoglou said as he prepared for Friday’s trip to Aston Villa. “Disappointing news. Initially we thought it wasn’t too serious. The medical team were worried structurally about how the knee was but it blew up the day after and we knew there was an issue there.“He has had surgery and it will put him out for at least a few months. I have only got basic information at the moment in terms of recovery, but it will certainly put him out for a while.”With James Maddison and Lucas Bergvall recently consigned to the treatment table, Kulusevski would have been Spurs’ chief creative force against Manchester United. “No, it wouldn’t be anywhere near 12 months, but again me putting a timeframe on wouldn’t be right because he only had the surgery yesterday,” Postecoglou explained. “It’s fair to say months, but how many months I wouldn’t speculate at the moment.”Postecoglou played down the prospect of Bergvall being able to recover from an ankle injury for the Europa League final before he turned his focus to the “balancing act” of the match at Villa Park. Villa are in the hunt for a top-five finish and Champions League qualification.“We are certainly going to go out there and try to win the game,” Postecoglou said. “I’m not sure about the integrity. There have been times this year when we have had to field weakened teams because of injury. Does that affect the integrity? People are thinking there is some sort of competitive balance that exists that doesn’t exist over the course of the season. I would be very surprised if people were questioning our integrity to try to win a game tomorrow.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurSouth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2024 it made only 282,000 cars, down 14% from the year before, and well below its 600,000 capacity. Building vehicles for another company could help make the factory more profitable, as well as providing more jobs.Nissan and Dongfeng already work together to build cars in Wuhan, China. Asked about the possibility of Dongfeng building vehicles in Sunderland, Espinosa said: “We are quite open to collaborate with them.”“Everything is on the table,” he said, speaking at an industry conference run by the Financial Times. “We could leverage some of our joint work outside of China, inviting them to come into our production ecosystems.”Espinosa was appointed in March and shortly afterwards issued a warning that the carmaker could lose £4bn this year, with the situation worsened byDonald Trump’s 25% tariffson car imports.Espinosa said Nissan, which briefly considered a merger with its Japanese rival Honda, would consider taking investment from other firms, including other carmakers and technology companies. However, he added that Nissan wanted “not to be hostages to any one partner”.The factory closures will definitively end Nissan’s hopes to be one of the world’s biggest carmakers. That path was set by Carlos Ghosn, the company’s chief executiveuntil his sensational arrest in 2018amid infighting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It managed 3.1m cars in 2024.While Espinosa said there was no intention to close the UK factory, he said the company needed support from the government, particularly on energy costs, which were significantly higher than in neighbouring countries.Carmakers around the world have been lobbying governments for support, either via subsidies or by relaxing regulations.Appearing at the same Financial Times conference, the heads of the carmakers Stellantis andRenaultcalled for the EU to allow them to sell plug-in hybrid electric vehicles cars for longer. Hybrids combine a smaller battery with a polluting petrol engine and are more profitable for traditional carmakers.Luca de Meo, Renault’s chief executive, said he wanted to change from targeting zero exhaust emissions to looking at emissions over the life of a car, which he argued would favour hybrids.Explore more on these topicsNissanAutomotive industrySunderlandRenaultChinaJapanJob lossesnewsShareReuse this content"

Referring to Apple’s recent promise tospend $500bn (£375bn) in the US, he added: “I said to him: ‘Tim, you’re my friend. You’re coming here with 500bn but now you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’”The complex manufacturing process behind iPhones involves more than 1,000 components sourced from all over the world, which are largely put together in China. Apple is secretive about details of its production processes but analysts estimate about 90% of iPhones are assembled in the country.However, production inIndiahas reportedly increased due to trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.“I said to Tim … we’ve treated you really good, we’ve put up with all the plants that you’ve built inChinafor years, now you got to build [for] us,” Trump said. “We’re not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves ... we want you to build here.”Trump then saidApplewas “going to be upping their production in the United States”, although he did not provide further details to back up the claim.No iPhones are currently made in the US and experts have warned thatmoving assembly of Apple’s top-selling product to its home countrywould be impractical and costly. The US financial firm Wedbush Securities has estimated that the cost of an iPhone would treble if assembly were to be shifted to the US.Apple was approached for comment.The US president also said on Thursday that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “no tariffs” for American goods.New Delhi is seeking to clinch a trade deal with the US within the 90-day pause announced by Trump on 9 April ontariff hikesfor trading partners.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For me, Britain’s given me all these opportunities and my career is a sense of me giving back.“I hope in my own modest way, we can be challenging the stereotype of what it means to be British and inspiring other people. I passionately believe this, the UK, while we may not be perfect, when it comes to issues about race and migration, we probably have the best story out there. Globally, people can look at what we do.”Born into a prominentBalochifamily in the borderlands of Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, Hossein-Bor’s mother came to the UK as a refugee, escaping the turmoil of the years after theIranian revolution.He was six when he was driven across the “very mountainous, arid, desert-like” Pakistan border, heading for a refugee camp and a new life in the UK, excited to be reunited with his mother, while feeling the “trepidation” of the “smuggling route”.The Iran he left was one where schoolchildren were made to chant “death to the UK, Israel and America”. His new home was suburban Southampton.The kindness a teacher showed him on a school trip to France after Hossein-Bor and his twin sister were separated from other pupils – because they were travelling on “blue UN travel documents” – was formative. So was being cast as Winston Churchill in a school play.After winning an assisted place to grammar school, Hossein-Bor studied law at Warwick and Cambridge before practising as a barrister, joining the Foreign Office as a legal adviser and transitioning to a diplomatic career, serving in Iraq during 2007’s US “surge” offensive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His job was to quell the unruly tribes there, many of whom were my ancestors. He’s written a lot about how he was there to divide and rule.“For me, to be his administrative successor – one of the great-grandchildren of the tribes – in the same building as him, both of us pursuing British national interests, albeit in a very different time, was quite a moment, because it reflects how the UK has changed, how I’m an instrument of change, but also how I’ve been able to step in the footprints of lots of countless people, other people of colour, who have made that journey easier for me. You just need to look at ourforeign secretary[David Lammy] and theformer prime minister[Rishi Sunak], to name but a few.”A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are proud to be a diplomatic service where individuals of all backgrounds can rise on merit and realise the opportunity to serve the UK. Kanbar’s story, as well as many others, embodies that. We congratulate him on his appointment as British high commissioner.”Explore more on these topicsRefugeesImmigration and asylumForeign policyFijiPacific islandsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

After their rediscovery in 1948, their numbers are now at about 500, growing at about 8% a year.The tuatara are commonly referred to as a “living fossil” and are the sole survivor of the ancient reptile order Sphenodontia, which walked the Earth with dinosaurs 225m years ago.They can reproduce past the age of 100 and live up to 200 years, making them one of the longest-living creatures. They are considered “at risk” and survive primarily on a small number of offshore, predator-free islands.Takahē and tuatara only coexist in two locations: Tiritiri Matangi and Zealandia, an urban eco-sanctuary in Wellington.Fisentzidis said the footage was a “neat snapshot” of how these species may have interacted in the past.“It also shows what’s possible … if we really start to rally together to bring more of our native wildlife back.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandWildlifeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

At this early developmental stage, they are tiny – roughly the size of a 5-cent coin – and vulnerable.“They can’t see and they don’t have a functional immune system,” said Isabella Wilson, lead author of the study published inFEMS Microbiology Ecology.‘Turning point’: claw print fossils found in Australia rewrite story of amniotes by 40 million yearsRead moreEchidnas lay their eggs into a temporary pouch, which they create by contracting their abdominal muscles. After about 10 days, puggles hatch from their eggs looking like, in Wilson’s words, “little pink jelly beans”.During lactation, probiotic bacteria in the echidna’s pouch increases, which the University of Adelaide researchers suggested offers protection to puggles and their developing immune systems.View image in fullscreenPuggles get ‘turfed out’ of their mother’s pseudo-pouch after about six or seven weeks, when their growing spines become too prickly.Photograph: Zoos VictoriaThe reproductive biology of the echidna is unique in many respects, Wilson said.Monotremes– echidnas and platypus – share a lot of “weird features”, she said. As well as laying eggs, they lack nipples. So instead of suckling, puggles rub their beaks against a part of the pseudo-pouch called the milk patch, causing milk to come out of the mother’s skin.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThis milk, which is sometimes pink, has barely any lactose compared to that of most other animals.“The young hang out there [in the pseudo-pouch] for a few months, drink up a lot of milk,” Wilson said.“Then, when they start to grow spines, they get turfed out of the pouch into the nursery burrow – where they continue to feed off mum for about 200 days.”An echidna’s pouch is only temporary – it is there while a puggle is inside. Healesville Sanctuary echidna keeper Craig McQueen, who was not involved in the research, agreed puggles generally stayed there for six to seven weeks, until their spines became “too prickly” for mum.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And in monotremes and marsupials, this extends to the pouch.Researchers analysed bacteria present on swabs from both captive animals at Taronga Zoo and wild echidnas on Kangaroo Island. They found that the pouch’s microbiome underwent significant changes during lactation, with an increase in lactic acid bacteria typically thought of as probiotic.They found no major difference between the microbiomes of the zoo-managed and wild animals. Wilson said this suggested that milk, rather than any external factors, is the primary element shaping the pouch environment.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentAustralian climate and environment in focusWildlifeAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

It makes no sense,” he said.Forestry Corporation’s revenue from all of its operations for the first half of the 2024-25 financial year was $193.9m, according to the report.The report said this was $15m below target “due to continuous disruptions in hardwood production, a decrease in commercial firewood demand resulting from milder weather, and ongoing suppression of market demand for softwood products”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But by nightfall there was little sign that any last-minute summit involving the US president was in the works.Zelenskyy and Putin have each been manoeuvring to position themselves favourably in front of Trump, who has grown increasingly impatient with the slow pace of the talks, with each leader casting the other as the main obstacle to progress.Zelenskyy said: “I believe the most important thing for Ukraine is to remain constructive and reasonable. That’s why we’re sending a delegation led by the defence ministry – so that no one can claim Ukraine is responsible for derailing the talks.”0:54Ukraine breakthrough depends on meeting between Trump and Putin, says Rubio – videoZelenskyy had travelled to Ankara with a team of his closest aides on Thursday, while Russia’s mid-level delegation, led by Vladimir Medinsky, an ultra-conservative, landed earlier in the day in Istanbul, where hundreds of journalists camped out for hours awaiting without success the start of the talks.Throughout the conference in Ankara, Zelenskyy sought to frame Russia’s choice of delegation as a sign to Trump that Moscow was not approaching the talks in good faith. He told reporters that the Russian delegation that arrived in Istanbul did not include “anyone who actually makes decisions”, accusing Moscow of not making efforts to end the war seriously.“I feel disrespected by Russia. No meeting time, no agenda, no high-level delegation – this is a personal disrespect … [to] Erdoğan, to Trump,” Zelenskyy said. “We can’t be running around the world looking for Putin,” he added when asked whether the Russian president was avoiding a direct meeting with him.But there is little evidence so far that Trump is receptive to Zelenskyy’s plea, with the US leader on Thursday refusing to criticise the Russian delegation.Any hopes of a serious breakthrough appear to have been dashed by Putin’s decision not to send his two most senior diplomats, Yuri Ushakov and Sergei Lavrov, and instead delegate the talks tolower-ranking aides.Observers say that by appointing Medinsky, a former culture minister, to lead the delegation, Putin is signalling he has little interest in genuine compromise and remains committed to the same objectives he pursued in 2022: stripping Ukraine of its sovereignty and military capability.View image in fullscreenVladimir Medinsky, second left, and colleagues in Istanbul.Photograph: Vladimir Soldatkin/ReutersMedinsky, who also led the failed peace talks in March 2022, held a hastily arranged press conference at the Russian consulate in Istanbul. He described the current negotiations as a continuation of those earlier talks, which included sweeping demands such as limiting Ukraine’s armed forces and blocking it from rebuilding with western support. Kyiv has repeatedly rejected those terms as unacceptable.Medinsky also echoed a well-worn Kremlin talking point, saying Russia aimed to address the “root causes” of the war – a phrase frequently used by Putin to justify the invasion.Boris Bondarev, a former senior Russian diplomat who resigned after Russia’s full invasion of Ukraine, said: “Putin clearly doesn’t want any genuine peace talks, nor any ceasefire, unless it’s entirely on his terms.”Bondarev said Putin had proposed the talks in Turkey with the aim of convincing Trump he was committed to peace, while he remained intent on continuing the fighting on the ground.With Russian forces making slow but steady progress on the battlefield, Putin – seemingly confident that Russia can outlast Ukraine – is refusing to halt the fighting before securing major concessions from Kyiv and the west.Even before Moscow and Kyiv meet in Istanbul, Zelenskyy and Ukraine’s European allies were urging the US to impose new sanctions if the sides fail to agree on a ceasefire.“If there is no ceasefire, no bilateral meetings, we are asking for sanctions to end the war more quickly,” Zelenskyy said. “We want a strong package of sanctions against Russia from the US, European countries – there must be pressure from the global south.“Trump’s position is to put pressure on both sides. I believe that we were put under more pressure,” Zelenskyy said, adding that Ukraine had “step by step demonstrated a willingness for negotiations”.He said: “You have to pressurise the side that does not want to end the war.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinUS foreign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

He was taken to a local clinic and then transferred to a hospital in Setúbal, near Lisbon, to undergo a medical procedure.Ventura had been discharged from hospital in Faro on Wednesday after his previous collapse. The hospital said he had had an oesophageal spasm caused by gastric reflux and high blood pressure.The Chega MP Marta Silva told CNNPortugalon Thursday that an electrocardiogram in an ambulance immediately after the second collapse had shown that “everything is well with his heart” and that it was probably another spasm.Ventura posted a picture of himself giving a thumbs-up sign from a hospital bed on Thursday afternoon. “This is a setback and a difficulty,” he wrote on X. “It won’t bring us down. Keep going … keep going!!! Portugal is much more important, it is this country that moves us.”Chega lookslikely to once again finish thirdon Sunday, behind the ruling, centre-right Democratic Alliance (AD) and the Socialist party (PS). Recent polls put the AD on about 33%, the PS on 26% and Chega on 17%.Ventura’s efforts to win a place in government have been rebuffed by Portugal’s prime minister, Luís Montenegro, who has repeatedly ruled out any deal with the far-right party.Chega, which has campaigned on a promise to clean up Portuguese politics at the same time as increasing its rhetoric against the Roma population, has been hit by a series of damaging allegations relating to some of its members over recent months.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to French magazine Télérama, which broke the news, Navarro-Mussy was accused of rape by three former partners in 2018, 2019, and 2020, but the case was dropped last month for lack of evidence.The three women plan to appeal and file a civil lawsuit, Télérama said.Cannes festival director Thierry Frémaux confirmed to Télérama that Navarro-Mussy had been excluded because an appeal was under way. Navarro-Mussy’s lawyer denied this. “The procedure is still ongoing,” Frémaux was quoted as saying. The festival confirmed the decision and Frémaux’s remarks when contacted by news agency AFP.The action against Navarro-Mussy would imply that any actor or director under active investigation for sexual assault would be excluded. It would align Cannes with the César awards, France’s equivalent of the Oscars, which announced in January 2023 that nominees convicted of or under investigation for sexual assault would be barred.Navarro-Mussy, 34, who had a breakthrough role in the French medical TV drama Hippocrate, denies the allegations but he told Télérama he understood the decision by festival organisers.In the past, Frémaux faced criticism from activists in 2023 over the choice of the film Jeanne du Barry to open the festival, which starred Johnny Depp. The movie marked Depp’s comeback after a toxic court battle with ex-wife Amber Heard that revealed his turbulent private life involving alcohol, drugs and domestic abuse allegations.A French parliamentary inquiry into the entertainment industry published its findings last month, with MPs concluding that abuse of performers was “endemic”. Inquiry chair Sandrine Rousseau, a National Assembly member for the Greens party, called on Cannes to set an example in stamping out sexual abuse, as well as physical and psychological violence.Navarro-Mussy said he was “worried” about his career, adding that he hoped the fact the case had been closed was “taken into account”. “I have explained myself to the justice system and at this stage have been cleared,” he added.His lawyer said that he had not been notified of any appeal against the decision to close the investigation.Moll, the director of Dossier 137, told AFP he was unaware of the allegations before starting to work with Navarro-Mussy “and during the film nothing happened”. Moll’s prize-winning previous film, The Night of the 12th, tackled the issue of violence against women. He said he was “very sensitive to this issue”.The ban comes in the wake ofGérard Depardieu’s conviction for sexually assaulting two womenon a film set in 2021. The 76-year-old, who has acted in more than 200 films and television series, is the highest-profile figure caught up in France’s response to the #MeToo movement.Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalFranceEuropeFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The remainder include six Airbus A350s and four Boeing 787s.The news followsa Wednesday announcementthat Boeing had landed its largest-ever deal for wide-body airplanes, after securing an order for $96bn worth of Boeing jets from Qatar.The deal-making comes as the US president nears the ends of his multiday tour in the Middle East. Controversy has dogged the visit after the president announced earlier this week that he planned toaccept a $400m luxury jumbo jetfrom the government of Qatar, raising numerous ethical concerns.Trump has since doubled down on his plans to accept the airplane as the new Air Force One, and eventually transfer it to his presidential library. “We’re the United States of America. I believe we should have the most impressive plane,” he said on Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUnited Arab EmiratesAirline industryTrump administrationMiddle East and north AfricaUS politicsBoeingnewsShareReuse this content"

I’d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone.”Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, rejected the idea, saying: “Gaza is an integral part of Palestinian land – it is not real estate for sale on the open market.“We remain firmly committed to our land and our national cause, and we are prepared to make every sacrifice to preserve our homeland and secure our people’s future.”There had been widespread hope that Trump’s regional visit could lead to a new pause in hostilities or a renewal of humanitarian aid to Gaza, where a tight Israeli blockade is now in its third month.Instead, the raids and bombardment over the past 48 hours have raised levels of violence in Gaza higher than for several weeks, with the death toll coming close to what was seen during the first days of Israel’s renewed offensive in Gaza after a fragile ceasefire collapsed in March.Some officials in Gaza put the number killed by Israeli attacks on Thursday as high as 120.Map of GazaAnalysts said the omission of Israel from Trump’s itinerary was a significant blow to the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and evidence oftension between the two leaders. The US president visited Saudi Arabia, then Qatar and arrived in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.Netanyahu, who leads the most rightwing government in Israel’s history, vowed earlier in the week to push ahead with an expanded offensive in Gaza to achieve Israel’s stated war aims of “crushing” Hamas and freeing the 58 hostages it is holding.Hamas seized 251 hostages in its October 2023 attack on Israel, during which its militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians.Israel’s subsequent offensive has killed at least 52,928 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza’s health ministry, which the UN considers reliable.The number of casualties reported over the past 48 hours –about 160– has not been confirmed independently. Israeli officials have said many of the recent strikes targeted senior Hamas commanders and accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, a charge the militant Islamist organisation denies.On Thursday, Palestinians commemorated the “Nakba”, or catastrophe, of 1948, in which about 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homeland after the creation of Israel.“What we are experiencing now is even worse than the Nakba of 1948,” Ahmed Hamad, a Palestinian in Gaza City who has been displaced several times, told Reuters.“The truth is, we live in a constant state of violence and displacement. Wherever we go, we face attacks. Death surrounds us everywhere.”View image in fullscreenPeople clamour for donated food at a community kitchen in Jabaliya.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APPressure on Israel to ease its blockade of Gaza is mounting. Stocks offood and fuel are almost exhausted. Nearly half a million Palestinians are facing possible starvation, while 1 million others can barely get enough food, according to findings from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, an international authority on the severity of hunger crises.Human Rights Watch said on Thursday that Israel’s blockade “has transcended military tactics to become a tool of extermination”.The global campaign group also criticised “plans to squeeze Gaza’s 2 million people into an even tinier area while making the rest of the land uninhabitable”.Israel, which claims the blockade is necessary to stop Hamas looting and selling aid to fund its military and other operations, has put forward a plan to distribute humanitarian assistance from a series of hubs in Gaza run by private contractors and protected by Israeli troops.Vetted representatives of families would be allowed to pick up monthly food packages from six hubs in southern Gaza.The US-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been established to manage the scheme, announced on Wednesday that it would begin operating by the end of the month and that it had asked Israel to lift its blockade.Israel has not commented on the statement.Aid officials in Gaza, including from the UN, have described the scheme as unworkable, inadequate, dangerous and potentially unlawful, and Gulf states that were approached for funding havereportedly refused to back the plan.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, acknowledged the criticism of the plan and said Washington was “open to an alternative if someone has a better one”.There was also violence in the occupied West Bank on Thursday. The Israeli military said a hunt was under way after a woman who was nine months pregnant and on her way to the delivery room was killed when a suspected Palestinian gunman opened fire on her car.Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Hamas’s armed wing, praised the attack as “heroic” in a video statement but did not admit responsibility.Palestinian officials said five people were killed in a raid by the Israeli army in the northern village of Tammun. Israeli military officials said the operation had targeted buildings suspected of being used to plan terror attacks.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

And that I do not wish to speak only to my own politics today, but to speak for all people of conscience, and all people who feel the moral injury of this atrocity.”More than 1,000 US students punished over speech since 2020, report findsRead moreRozos’s anti-war speech was met with widespread cheers and applause from students across the auditorium. Some attendees booed Rozos, with one person appearing to yell “bullshit!” from the crowd.Following Rozos’s speech, NYU released astatementsaying that it “strongly denounces the choice by a student at the Gallatin School’s graduation today … to misuse his role as student speaker to express his personal and one-sided political views”.“He lied about the speech he was going to deliver and violated the commitment he made to comply with our rules. The university is withholding his diploma while we pursue disciplinary actions. NYU is deeply sorry that the audience was subjected to these remarks and that this moment was stolen by someone who abused a privilege that was conferred upon him,” the university added.As of Thursday morning, Rozos’s student profile on NYU Gallatin’s website appeared to have been taken down, with a messagesaying: “Page or File Not Found (404 Error)”.Rozos and NYU did not immediately return a request for comment.Last August, NYU updated its student conduct guidelines to include “code words, like ‘Zionist’” as examples of discriminatory speech.“For many Jewish people, Zionism is a part of their Jewish identity. Speech and conduct that would violate the [nondiscrimination and anti-harassment policy] if targeting Jewish or Israeli people can also violate the NDAH if directed toward Zionists,” the universitysaid.The updated guidelines came months after anti-war students at NYU and other college campuses across the country demonstrated in solidarity with Palestine. As a result, NYU administrators called police to campus, leading to widespreadarrestsof students and faculty members.Last December, two tenured professors who were declared “personae non gratae” by NYU accused the university of escalating its suppression of anti-war speech under pressure from donors, politicians and pro-Israel organizations.California State students protest aid blockade in Gaza with hunger strikeRead moreThe two professors, Andrew Ross and Sonya Posmentier,were barredfrom entering certain university buildings. The PNG declarations came after Ross and Posmentier joined a sit-in at the university library in calls for the university to divest from companies profiting off of Israel’s war in Gaza.A few months later, the universitycanceled a talk on USAIDcuts after it deemed the lecture as “anti-governmental”. According to Dr Joanne Liu, a pediatric emergency physician at Sainte-Justine hospital and former international president of Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), NYU’S vice-chair of the education department called her the evening before her presentation in March.Liusaidthe vice-chair voiced concerns about the content of some of her slides, including ones that mentioned USAID cuts by theTrump administration, as well as slides that cited Palestinian casualties in Gaza as a result of Israel’s war across the strip. Liu said she was told that the slides on Gaza “could be perceived as antisemitic”.Explore more on these topicsUS universitiesNew YorkIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He wrote in the Times: “The bottom line is that taxes will have to go up.”Labour has faced calls from trade unions and leftwing MPs totarget wealthy individuals with higher taxesamid tight constraints on the public finances, as the chancellor prepares to deliver next month’s spending review.According to the NAO report, billions of pounds in additional revenue could be collected from wealthy individuals. It said the annual “compliance yield” from well-off taxpayers – the revenue HMRC collects after chasing for non-payment – more than doubled from £2.2bn in the 2019-20 financial year to £5.2bn in 2023-24.However, it said this rise was more than £1bn greater than the “wealthy tax gap” estimated by HMRC, which, it said, “raises the possibility that underlying levels of non-compliance among the wealthy population could be greater than previously thought”.HMRC calculated the tax gap for wealthy individuals – the difference between the amount of money it estimates it is owed and how much is collected – at £1.9bn for the financial year ending in March 2023.Highlighting the scope for a further crackdown, the NAO said the super-rich had faced far fewer penalties for non-compliance in recent years.HMRC issued 456 penalties worth £5.8m to wealthy taxpayers in the financial year ending in March 2024, a decline of more than 75% from 2,153 penalties in 2018-19, totalling £16.2m.Labour announced a number oftax increases targeted at wealthier individuals in the autumn budget, including replacing the non-dom tax regime, increasing capital gains tax, and charging VAT on private school fees.Critics on the free-market right argue the changes have triggered an exodus of millionaires from Britain, but those on Labour’s left say the government could go further instead of targeting welfare cuts at the poorest in society.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, ministers provided additional funding for the tax office in the autumn budget, including provision to tackle wealthy offshore non-compliance and fraud.Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said:“HMRC deserves credit for greatly increasing the additional tax revenue its compliance work has brought in from wealthy taxpayers, however this may indicate that levels of non-compliance are higher than previously estimated.“HMRC should also seek to provide greater transparency to give greater confidence to the public that all taxpayers contribute their fair share.”A spokesperson for HMRC said: “It’s our duty to ensure everyone pays the right tax under the law, regardless of wealth or status. The government is delivering the most ambitious ever package to close the tax gap and bring in an extra £7.5bn for public services per year by 2029-30.”Explore more on these topicsTax avoidanceTax and spendingEconomic policyRachel ReevesLabourIncome taxTaxnewsShareReuse this content"

They added that the planned changes “threaten to affect the most vulnerable” and a pause would give them “more time to seek appropriate professional advice” while allowing the government time to consider other options.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, caused uproar among much of the farming sector in October whenshe announced plans in her budgetto bring farms and other agricultural property into inheritance tax rules, in order to raise money for public services and close a tax loophole exploited by some wealthy landowners.Ending a decades-long exemption for farms, Reeves’s plansto make inheritors pay 20%of the value of agricultural and business property above £1m havesparked large-scale protestsin recent months and led to ministers’ speechesbeing drowned out by tractor horns.MPs on the cross-party Efra committee have raised concerns that the changes announced in the budget were made without adequate consultation, impact assessment or assessment of affordability, with a risk of producing unintended consequences.View image in fullscreenHundreds of tractors at a protest in Whitehall in February.Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/ShutterstockWhile broadly supportive of the government’s inheritance tax changes, the committee is calling on ministers to consult on their proposals toavoid hurting small family farms.Alistair Carmichael, the chair of the Efra committee and a Liberal Democrat MP, criticised the way the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs had communicated with farmers, particularly thesudden closure of a key post-Brexit subsidy scheme, the sustainable farming incentive.“The way in which the government has behaved over recent months has clearly negatively affected the confidence and wellbeing of farmers,” Carmichael said.“We have seen that Defra’s communications with farmers have been poor, with confusing and sometimes contradictory messaging. There has been a lack of adequate consultation. Policies affecting farmers have been announced without due consideration or explanation of their impact or their rationale.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The estate agent John D Wood & Co said it was seeing “a number of politically motivated relocations – Americans who are seeking greater stability abroad”.But if the growing interest in the UK in part reflects a desire to escape the US president, some may be surprised to see thatScotlandhas replaced London as the most popular location to inquire about.Trump has strong links to Scotland: his mother was born just a few miles from Stornoway, on the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis; he owns Trump International Scotland, a golf resort in Aberdeenshire; and he has previously declared: “I think I do feel Scottish.”Edinburgh is the most popular destination in Rightmove’s 2025 top 10, pushing London’s Westminster into second place. Glasgow, meanwhile, has risen to fourth place, just behind Camden in third and overtaking London’s Kensington and Chelsea. Other areas of Scotland in the top 10 include Highland, Argyll and Bute and Fife.The Cotswolds has long been popular with well-off Americans: it has been named “the Hamptons of England”, and the former chatshow star Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, are among those to move there recently. But it was notable in its absence from the 2025 top 10.Some of this US interest may be from people who see the UK predominantly as a investment opportunity. Rightmove – Britain’s biggest property website – said its data included people inquiring about moving to the UK from the US as well as those wanting a second home or buy to let property.Rightmove said that over the past 10 years, London had received the biggest proportion of US inquiries, but that at the start of 2025 it switched to Scotland, “potentially due to its lower price point”.Colleen Babcock, Rightmove’s property expert, said some of the knock-on effects of Trump’s tariff announcements and the economic uncertainty globally were starting to be felt in the UK property market.“Whether it’s because the UK is seen as a more stable investment opportunity, or whether some buyers are considering a permanent move across the Atlantic, we’re seeing an increase in inquiries from the US,” she said.Glynn Gibb, a regional director at John D Wood & Co, said the agent had seen a steady rise in inquiries from US buyers interested in “prime” central London.“London’s culture and global connectivity make it an ideal springboard to Europe and beyond. Many are basing themselves here temporarily – often staying with friends – while they work out how long they plan to stay. We expect activity to build in the coming months – spring and early summer are typically busy – as more buyers make lifestyle and financial decisions shaped by the political climate in the US,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPropertyReal estateRightmoveEdinburghScotlandTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Unlike the 28 April incident at the facility that handles Newark traffic, radar screens did not go blank in Denver.Franklin McIntosh, the FAA’s deputy head of air traffic control, said during a US House of Representatives hearing that at theDenverAir Route Traffic Control Center, both the main and backup frequencies failed for about two minutes, but a controller was then able to transmit to the aircraft to move to a secondary frequency.He said there was no loss of separation between airplanes during the outage. “They did exactly what the safety protocols were,” McIntosh said.“Anytime there are these outages, which are happening more regularly now, it is very concerning,” said Robert Garcia, a California Democratic representative, at the FAA oversight hearing.Issues like the one in Denver are not uncommon given ageing equipment.US transportation secretary changed wife’s flight from Newark after ongoing issues at airportRead moreA report last year from the Government Accountability Office said the FAA had 138 information systems for air traffic control and 51 were unsustainable due to outdated functionality, a lack of spare parts and other issues. The report called for the agency to take “urgent action”.The FAA told the GAO last year it did not plan to complete modernization projects on many systems for at least a decade.The FAA said it is investigating after part of the center experienced a loss of communications around 1.50pm in Denver, when both transmitters that cover a segment of airspace went down.“Controllers used another frequency to relay instructions to pilots. Aircraft remained safely separated and there were no impacts to operations,” the FAA said.The FAA relocated control of Newark airspace to Philadelphia last year to address staffing and congested New York City area traffic. But the FAA is about 3,500 air traffic controllers below targeted staffing levels.The latest incidents highlight the air traffic control network’s ageing infrastructure and come after the US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, last week proposed spending billions of dollars to fix it over the next three to four years.Explore more on these topicsDenverAir transportColoradonewsShareReuse this content"

It continues to expect annual sales to rise between 3% and 4%.Walmart is a bellwether of US consumer health. Its results offer clues on how the industry is navigating the economic volatility wrought by the on-and-off tariffs on several countries, including China.This week, the US and China reached a trade deal for 90 days that resulted in the countries slashing the tariffs imposed on each other, which was widely cheered by investors and businesses.The latest inflationdata, released this week, showed that price increases remained stable in April. But economists warn the full impact of the tariffs on prices has yet to be felt. Many US companies in the wake of the trade war have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations, a more cautious approach as consumers stretch their budgets to buy everything from groceries to essentials at cheaper prices.US consumer sentiment had ebbed for a fourth straight month in April, signaling watchful purchasing while the country’s GDP contracted for the first time in three years during the first quarter, fanning worries of a recession.On Thursday morning Jerome Powell, the US Federal Reserve chair, warned that long-term interest rates are likely to remain elevated because of Trump administration’s shifting policy goals.“We may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks – a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks,” he said at a policy conference.Walmart is known for its everyday low-price strategy for regular-use essentials and groceries, which has given the retailer an edge over competitors but at thin margins. It expects second-quarter consolidated net sales to rise between 3.5% and 4.5%, compared with expectations of 3.46% growth.As the range of near-term outcomes widens and becomes hard to predict, the company is withholding second-quarter operating income growth and earnings per share forecasts, CFO Rainey said in a statement.“With a longer view into the full year, we believe we can navigate well and achieve our full year guidance,” he added.Explore more on these topicsWalmartTrump tariffsTariffsRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

But there was no one in the kitchen to cook the food.”Like Kid Rock, Smith has cultivated a reputation as a vocal conservative, fighting Covid-19 restrictions and backing Trump with campaign donations. Yet the episode appeared to suggest that his establishments – including The Diner and Honky Tonk Central – are partly dependent on the undocumented labor the president has vowed to expel from the US.An aggressive immigration sweepbegan on 3 May, when state troopers and unmarked Ice vehicles dramatically increased traffic stops throughout south Nashville. The operation has nettedat least 196 arrests– including 101 individuals with no criminal history, according to a Department of Homeland Security press release.Trump and the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, have publicly celebrated accelerated deportations nationwide, which have ensnared legal residents alongside undocumented immigrants.Last week, Ice agents visitedat least nine restaurantsin the Washington DC area.Service disruptions inNashvillecontinued through Sunday as fearful workers chose to remain home rather than risk detention.Nashville officials, including the mayor and multiple metro councilors, have denounced the raids, but the city’s legal director, Wallace Dietz, said local government was “powerless” against state and federal immigration enforcement actions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A group of activists heckled the health secretary over his anti-vaccine posture, yelling: “When Bobby lies, children die,” and “Anti-vax, anti-science, anti-America”.Then Cohen stood up and made his Gaza protest.

They need to let food to starving kids.”Gaza is now in the 11th week of a total blockade byIsraelwhich prevents essential items including food, fuel and medicines reaching the area’s 2.3 million Palestinians.

The crisis forced governments to spend billions of dollars bailing out big lenders that took too much risk.Changes to bank capital rules have been widely expected, with Trump having promiseda bonfire of regulationduring his second term in office, with plans to slash 10 regulations for every new one added.While some critics warn it is the wrong time to slash protections, given growing uncertainty over policy overhauls and market volatility, banks seem to have won the ear of policymakers. Lobbyists have long argued that the rules punish them for holding relatively low-risk assets including US debt, known as treasuries, and hinders their ability to provide more loans.Prospects of a deregulation drive have sparked concerns in some corners of the City of London that the UK could fall behind and become uncompetitive compared with US peers, because of stricter regulation.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in November said regulations put in place after the global financial crisishad “gone too far”, and ordered financial watchdogs to encourage more risk-taking and roll back rules that may have been curbing the growth and competitiveness of City firms.Months later, the Bank of England announced it wasfurther delaying new capital rules in the UK– known as Basel 3.1 – as it weighed the impact of Trump’s return to the White House.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company could face a fine of 6% of global annual turnover, if the commission upholds this view.The commission said a separate EU inquiry into TikTok’s suspected failure to guarantee election integrity in Romania, which was launched last December, was ongoing and was a priority.The commission’s verdict that TikTok lacks transparency over advertising comes four days before “super Sunday”, when voters go to the polls in Poland, Portugal and Romania.Under the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), large internet companies are obliged to publish an advertisement library, detailing ad content, users being targeted and who paid for the publicity.

The advertisement repository is seen by EU officials as a vital tool enabling researchers to detect scam ads and coordinated campaigns that aim to disrupt elections.Romania was plunged into political chaos last year whenthe first round of the presidential election was annulled, after the country’s intelligence services alleged that Russia had mounted an online campaign to promote a far-right outsider, who topped the poll.On Sunday, Romanian voters will choose between two candidates in the second round of the rescheduled presidential elections.The European Commission launched an investigation last December into whether TikTok had failed to tackle risks to the integrity of Romania’s presidential elections. Ursula von der Leyen, the commission’s president, said there were “serious indications that foreign actors interfered in the Romanian presidential elections by using TikTok”.TikTok’s alleged failure to provide an advertising library was said to make it harder for EU officials and other researchers to determine whether fake ads were used during election campaigns, including in Romania. But the commission cautioned against assumptions that TikTok would be found to have violated the election integrity obligations of the DSA.Thomas Regnier, a commission spokesperson, said there was no direct link between the December investigation and its preliminary view published on Thursday of a breach of EU law relating to advertising transparency.“Of course it’s not helping that your ad repository is not working. That’s one fact because it doesn’t help us to assess if there were fake or scam ads being used in the context of elections,” Regnier said. But he added: “The fact that the ad repository is not working in the context of this February investigation of last year is absolutely not prejudging the outcome of the December investigation.”As part of that December investigation, EU officials are studying actions TikTok said it took to prevent election interference in Romania.A TikTok spokesperson said the company was reviewing the commission’s preliminary findings on its ad repository. “While we support the goals of the regulation [DSA] and continue to improve our ad transparency tools, we disagree with some of the commission’s interpretations and note that guidance is being delivered via preliminary findings rather than clear, public guidelines,” the company said.The company now has the right to examine the commission’s investigation file and mount a defence. If the commission confirms its current view, TikTok could be fined up to 6% of its annual global turnover and be obliged to take measures to remedy the issue.The commission said it continued to investigate other suspected offences under EU law, including whether TikTok’s algorithms led users down damaging content “rabbit holes” and had addictive effects. It is also investigating TikTok’sage verificationand child safety policies. These inquiries were launched at the same time as the investigation into the ad repository last February, but remain incomplete.TikTok has previously said that it cooperates with relevant authorities around elections “providing them with dedicated channels through which they can report content they believe may violate either our community guidelines or applicable regulations”.Explore more on these topicsTikTokEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionEuropeChinaShareReuse this content"

The younger, more explosive Minnesota Timberwolvesthrashed them121-110 to cap a series the Warriors were never reallyin, even when they briefly led it. That is because this series had a singular line of demarcation: the second quarter of Game 1.Golden State outscored Minnesota 30-20 in the first 14 minutes and 41 seconds of the series. But at exactly that point, Curry grabbed at what turned out to be a strained left hamstring. He did not play another minute, and while the Warriors hung on to win that night by 11, they had nothing left for the rest of the series. With Curry healthy, Golden State won the first 15 minutes of the series by 10 points. Without him, they lost the last 225 minutes by a combined 56.Mavs win draft lottery and chance to pick Cooper Flagg No 1 after Dončić sagaRead moreCurry still chugs along nicely, even at at 37. The Warriors have slowly reinvented themselves around him, hanging on only to Curry, the 35-year-old Draymond Green, and coach Steve Kerr from the days when they were a true title dynasty in the 2010s. When Curry was on the floor this season, the Warriors still had one of the fiercest offenses in basketball, scoring 120.4 points per 100 possessions. Without him? 108.4, making for roughly the difference between the best offense in theNBAover a full season and the worst.There was reason to hope, however, that the Warriors would be a little less Steph-dependent during this playoff run. The team swung a midseason trade for Jimmy Butler, who has long been a good scorer and one of the great defenders in basketball. Butler had a transformative impact down the stretch, boosting the Warriors’ numbers when he was on the court more than any other player, Curry included. The Dubs seemed to have a potent mix of talented, seasoned veterans (Curry, Green, Butler) and young supporting castmates (hello, Brandin Podziemski and Moses Moody) to be compelling in the playoffs. A fifth championship for Curry? Probably not, but a substantial run looked possible.It wasn’t to be. The Warriors without Curry were lifeless, scoring at a clip of 104.6 points per 100 possessions in the series’ final four games. (Minnesota were scoring 116.9.) The Warriors’ assists-to-turnover ratio in those games was 1.2, down from 2.1 during the regular season. The Curry-less Warriors weren’t just missing his all-world shooting ability, but his creativity, too.The Warriors got some nice performances from their depth players, who tried to patch the gaping hole left by Curry. Forward Jonathan Kuminga was particularly impressive, taking up a more expansive offensive role and scoring 24.3 points per game after Curry’s injury.But there is only one Curry, and without him, the only Warrior who could plausibly pick up the scoring slack was Butler. It would have been a stretch, though, and Butler floundered on offense as he tried to backfill some of Curry’s points. In Games 2 through 5, Butler shot 45.8% from the field and struggled to find any consistency. The Warriors’ team defense was decent enough, but the offense was so lifeless that the Warriors’ series never got out of neutral once Curry exited.The Curry-Kerr Warriors have been declared dead several times, only to spring back to life –first to win the title in 2022after missing the playoffs twice in a row, then to work themselves into “intriguing potential contender” statusafter the Butler trade this season. (They were 25-26 the day they acquired Butler, then finished the season on a 23-8 run and took a seven-game first-round series from the Houston Rockets.) There is no sense in declaring that Curry will never win anything again, only to have to walk it back later.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the one hand, they have restocked their depth players around Curry nicely. Suffering a steep drop in quality without a player of Curry’s caliber is hardly an indictment of a team-building strategy, either. But on the other hand, even if Curry continues to beat Father Time well into his 40s, the Warriors’ lack of other gamechanging offensive talent was laid bare as he watched from the sidelines. Adding a pricey outside acquisition on top of Butler, who turns 36 in September, is almost certainly impractical given the Warriors’ heavy salary cap sheet, and even retaining the restricted free agent Kuminga (a bright spot in this series) could push the Warriors quite close to the “first apron” luxury tax threshold that begins to hamper a team’s roster-building options.No doubt Curry will do all he can to keep lugging the Warriors to within striking distance of contention. The realities of age and the salary cap may well just not apply to a player of his caliber for a while. But the Warriors, for now, are betting not just on Curry’s magic but on a friendlier treatment from the injury gods until the greatest player in their history decides to hang up his sneakers.It isn’t a great bet, but what else is there to do?Explore more on these topicsStephen CurryGolden State WarriorsNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ruud, however, was not cheering the completion of a successful set or even a singular, spectacular point; he was commemorating sarcastically the very first game he had won.It was the only thing Ruud had to cheer all night asJannik Sinnerpieced together a remarkable statement performance under the lights in Rome, underlining his enduring status as the best player in the world by completely demolishing Ruud, the sixth seed, 6-0, 6-1 to reach the semi-finals of the Italian Open.Alcaraz dismisses Draper in straight sets to ease into Italian Open semi-finalRead moreThis victory marks the first time that Sinner has ever reached the last four at the biggest tournament in his home country and he is now two wins away from what would be a remarkable title on his return from a three-month anti-doping suspension. He will face Tommy Paul, the 11th seed, on Friday for a place in the final.“It was a great performance,” Sinner said. “Very happy about that. But things can change quickly, no? Every day is different. Tomorrow is a different opponent. We play again in the night. But still it’s a different matchup. I always try to prepare myself in the best possible way.”While most players would spend their rest day before a big match maintaining a low profile and conserving energy, Sinner was almost as busy on Wednesday. He started the day by meeting Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican, giving the newly elected pontiff a tennis racket, and he ended the night as a guest at Bologna’s win over Milan in the Coppa Italia final, which was held at the Stadio Olimpico on the other side of the vast Foro Italico grounds.“Amazing, honestly,” Sinner said on his meeting with the pope. “I never experienced something like this. I was very honoured. I didn’t know exactly really what to say, no? It was a very emotional thing also with my parents there. It was very nice. It was something I will never forget, that’s for sure.”Ruud represented Sinner’s first top-10 opponent of his return and as the Madrid Open champion he was the most in-form player in the draw, but his recent title did not make a difference. “It’s as near as perfect that I witnessed, at least as a player playing someone, so I’ve just got to give it to him,” Ruud said.Sinner’s level was stratospheric from the very first point. He opened the match by absolutely thumping the ball. While Sinner’s backhand, the stroke that comes most naturally to him, has been excellent from the beginning of the tournament, here he could also do whatever he wanted on the court with his forehand. The sheer force and weight of his forehand, and the ease with which he redirected his two-handed backhand down the line at will, completely overwhelmed Ruud.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner’s two-handed backhand was a fearsome weapon against Casper Ruud.Photograph: Aleksandra Szmigiel/Reuters“There’s a kind of saying that you have that when someone plays that well, it feels like you have two forehands, one from the forehand side and another forehand from the backhand side,” Ruud said. “In his case, it’s almost like two backhands because his backhand is also so good. It was just like playing a wall that shoots 100mph balls at you all the time.”This was a complete performance. Sinner returned stupendously well and demonstrated his growing variety with some well-measured, delicate touches alongside his brutal power. The few times Ruud was in control of the points, Sinner effortlessly shifted his defence into attack. By 3-0, 30-30 in the opening set, Sinner had allowed Ruud one single point and the Norwegian ended the set with two service points. One incredible set would have been impressive enough, but Sinner refused to let up until the end.“It doesn’t feel so bad,” Ruud said. “Honestly, I think it was more fun than anything, even though I lost love and one, it’s like you just look at the guy and say: ‘Wow, this is kind of next-level shit.’ Excuse my language. I don’t know what else to say. It was almost fun to witness at the same time. Of course, I wish it was a closer match. I wish I could have given the people, the fans, a longer or closer match. But I think that I was there ready to play, he was just even readier.”Sinner’s victory rounded off another incredible 24 hours for Italian tennis after Lorenzo Musetti, the eighth seed, defeated the second seed, Alexander Zverev, to join Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals. In the women’s draw the sixth seed, Jasmine Paolini, became the first Italian woman to reach the final in Rome since Sara Errani in 2014 with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Peyton Stearns.Explore more on these topicsTennisJannik SinnernewsShareReuse this content"

Infantino had been in the Middle East this week along with Donald Trump visiting leaders from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and arrived in Paraguay hours late for a scheduled 10.30am start time to his organization’s annual meeting.The departing members included eight European members of theFifaCouncil – the main decision-making body that sets the agenda for the wider congress. Uefa’s representatives on the Council to have walked out include Uefa president Alexander Čeferin and Football Association chair Debbie Hewitt. Other delegates to have left proceedings in protest include Norway Football Federation president Lise Klaveness, who called Infantino’s late arrival “disappointing” and “concerning.”“The annual congress is the single most important body to ensure good governance of international football,” she said in a statement. “210 member associations have traveled from all over the world to participate at this Congress here in Paraguay, expecting professional leadership and dialogue at the highest level. I understand the frustration and disappointment from European Fifa members, and we feel sorry for the excellent hosts in Paraguay … We now expect Fifa to explain this situation to its members and ensure that the voices of the member associations are heard and respected going forward.”‘They’ll have to go home’: Trump’s World Cup taskforce dismisses fears but warns visitorsRead moreInfantino had prioritized meetings in the Middle East this week, as the Fifa president appeared at events involving the leaders of countries that hosted the previous World Cup (Qatar), the next men’s World Cup (co-hosted by the US), and the 2034 edition (Saudi Arabia).Infantino’s delay meant the annual meeting started three hours late. Infantino apologized to his audience several times after his arrival, citing issues with his flight for the delay and insisting it was important he represented soccer at the political meetings.“As president of Fifa my responsibility is to make decisions in the interests of the organization,” Infantino said. “I felt that I needed to be there to represent football and all of you.”Infantino’s Middle East visit comes a little more than a week after he appeared at the White House in thefirst public meeting of the Trump administration’s 2026 World Cup taskforce, nominally tasked with ensuring the smooth operation of next year’s tournament. At that event, members of Trump’s cabinet joked about World Cup visitors being subjected to arrest should they overstay their visas – jibes made amid the backdrop of the administration’s illegal deportations of permanent residents and citizens to foreign detention facilities.“We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game,” said US vice-president JD Vance of World Cup visitors. “But when the time is up, they’ll have to go home.

My focus is on my relationship with the Lord Jesus and my family.

And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?”Snyder’s arrest came after during a police operation aimed at reducing prostitution inColumbus, Ohio. Snyder was arrested in a hotel room for engaging in prostitution. He was released from custody at the scene, and is due to appear in court on 19 May.Columbus police spokesperson Caitlyn McIntosh said officers had posted online ads to “solicit others to engage in sexual activity for hire”. Police said a man later identified as Snyder had replied to one of the postings and arranged to meet at a local hotel. Once there he paid money to an undercover officer and requested sexual services. Police said 15 other men were caught in the sting.Snyder is considered one of the best wrestlers of his generation, and was a college star atOhioState, located in Columbus. While still at college he won an Olympic gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics. In college, he won three straight NCAA heavyweight titles between 2016 and 2018, and was later inducted into Ohio State’s athletics hall of fame.

At 35, the Polish goalkeeperhad been convinced to come out of retirementfor one last job, and what a job it was, a season he hadn’t even expected to play ending with a league and cup double after a 2-0 win at rivals Espanyol.He was joined at Barcelona by a stellar cast, a whole new generation that includesa kid 17 years and three months his junior– a teenager at the other end of a career that might yet be one of the best there has ever been.Raphinha, the man who almost left, leads Barcelona to verge of dream title | Sid LoweRead moreSzczesny had made two vital first-half saves whenBarcelonawere exposed against Espanyol, their city rivals, on a night when they knew a win would secure the title and anything less would leave them having to fight on, maybe even in a position where it could slip from them. And then, as the second half began, Lamine Yamal, who could be the best player in the world already, ensured it would not when he delivered a moment of class and quality that no one else could. Which is just what he does, with startling regularity and remarkable ease.He delivered the victory, too. The run and the shot he produced on 53 minutes was so good, so like Lamine, sohisnow, the ball bent into the top corner of the net to provide the perfect conclusion to an almost perfect campaign. Barcelona had not had their best night but were set on course for a victory over Espanyol that crowned them champions, Fermín López adding the second in the 95th minute. Another grand moment had belonged to the boy with braces on his teeth, a teenager taking the lead.When Barcelonawere knocked out of Europe, Lamine had vowed he would never give up until they won the Champions League. He also said he had told his mum that opportunity would come every year. For now, they had to win the leagueto go with the Copa del Rey, expectations wildly exceeded. So in theclásico, he curled in the goal that pulled them level again,setting them up for a 4-3 winthat left them one victory from the title. And now, four days later, he set them up for that too. With a little help from the whole gang, down to the latest arrival, the teammate who is older than his dad.If Barcelona hadn’t won here there would still have been two more chances to take the title, but there could be nothing better than doing it first time and in a derby too. Espanyol’s coach, Manolo González, insisted that all he cared about was the victory that would guarantee his team’s survival, but for the fans it was different. Yes, they wanted to avoid relegation, but if they could put one over their rivals, keep the bus at the depot, then so much the better.View image in fullscreenFérmin López slots in Barcelona’s second goal to confirm the title.Photograph: Joan Monfort/APThey definitely didn’t want to go through the experience of two years ago, and nor did anyone else: in May 2023, when Barcelona won the league here, hundreds of fans ran on to the pitch and chased the visitors’ players down the tunnel. Espanyol couldn’t avoid seeing their rivals win at their home, but at the end of this meeting, Barça headed down the tunnel to celebrate instead. They had earned it.Espanyol had started well, the first chance coming their way when Urko González dashed clean through and put the ball wide. Yet in those early minutes attention had been drawn instead to reports of an incident outside in which a white car had apparently run over fans that had been surrounding it, accelerating through a crowd. There had been panic, ambulances were at the scene. Videos circulated and, at one point, the Espanyol fans behind Joan García’s goal had called for the game to be stopped, shouting that people had been hurt or worse.The referee came over then, an announcement was made over the PA saying that the situation was under control, and the game continued, but some fans in the first rows vacated their seats. Catalan police said that there had been no serious injuries.Back on the pitch, the ball was Barcelona’s – with 80% possession in the first half – but it was slow and little really came from it. Espanyol were happy to wait for the chance to run, a plan that was justified by the fact that, when they did, they found their way into the space beyond the Barcelona back four. Szczesny made his second decisive save, this time from Javi Puado as he was set free after a quarter of an hour. He had to be out fast to deny him again 10 minutes later as he chased Unai Expósito’s ball.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It wouldn’t the next time. Just before the break, Robert Lewandowski fired wide. And then soon after, when Lamine had another chance, he again stepped inside from the right, accelerated past two men and reproduced what is becoming a copyright of his, an outrageous shot flying in a perfect arc into the net right by the far post.Everyone knew what he was going to do, but knowing it and stopping it are very different things, as so many defenders and goalkeepers have found and many more surely will. Standing there before the few visiting supporters high in the corner, Lamine Yamal opened his arms wide. He had put Barcelona within touching distance.A superb stop by Szczesny from Roberto Fernández kept them there, as did the control they exercised through midfield where Pedri and Frenkie De Jong dominated. They were aided by a red card for Leandro Cabrera, sent off when he hit out at Lamine Yamal.The teenager was determined to keep them there, a lesson learnt perhaps from the defeat to Inter. When he escaped on 92 minutes, he carried to the corner instead of shooting. But the next time he got it, he slipped in a clever pass and Férmin López did go for goal, a clean, crisp shot settling in the net. It was over. The derby was won and the title was theirs: the kid, the old man and the whole brilliant gang of them.Explore more on these topicsBarcelonaLa LigaReal MadridEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Villa’s director of football operations, Damian Vidagany, said shifting the game from Sunday to Friday was “clear prejudice” against the club and Villa objected to Spurs’s request for it to be moved to aid their preparations for Wednesday’s Europa League final. Villa were also privately perplexed at Bournemouth’s game with Manchester City being rearranged for Tuesday, after Saturday’s FA Cup final, which is guaranteed to have implications on whether eighth place qualifies for the Europa Conference League. The flipside to all of this is Villa can get on the front foot, kicking off 45 minutes before Chelsea entertain Manchester United and two days before Nottingham Forest head to West Ham and Arsenal host Newcastle. Victory for Villa could hoist them as high as fourth before a final-day trip to Old Trafford and, psychologically, that could prove a knockout blow.Ben FisherAston Villa v Tottenham,Premier League, Friday 7.30pm (all times BST)2Maresca turns to teenager GeorgeNicolas Jackson’sridiculous red card against Newcastleleaves Enzo Maresca with a problem in attack. Chelsea have lost their main striker to suspension for the rest of the league season and need to adjust when they host Manchester United. Options are thin on the ground. Christopher Nkunku is unwanted and has been unavailable in recent weeks, the inexperienced Marc Guiu is returning from a hamstring injury and Jadon Sancho is ineligible against his parent club. Sancho would not have played up front but having him available would have meant there was an experienced alternative on the flanks should Maresca have repeated a solution from previous times of need and moved Pedro Neto into a central role. As it is Chelsea will probably have to place their trust in the exciting teenager Tyrique George.Jacob SteinbergChelsea vManchester United, Premier League, Friday 8.15pmView image in fullscreenTyrique George holds off a challenge from Djurgården’s Jacob Une during the Conference League semi-finals.Photograph: Petter Arvidson/BILDBYRÅN/Shutterstock3Cup win could turn City’s season aroundPep Guardiola has been a manager humbled this season owing to a troubled Manchester City campaign ruptured by injury and a loss of the pattern and spirit that propelled them to a record fourth consecutive title in 2023-24. To claim the third FA Cup of his generation-defining tenure would be a fillip, then, before the last push to secure Champions League qualification, next month’s Club World Cup and a summer of plotting to ensure next year is no repeat. City’s players were completely deflated when walking through the mixed zone at Wembley afterlosing last May’s Cup final to Manchester United: one more reason to avoid a repeat against Crystal Palace on Saturday.Jamie JacksonCrystal Palace vManchester City, FA Cup final, Saturday4.30pm4Eze eyes up glorious prize for PalaceEberechi Eze has said he could not be in better form as Crystal Palace return to Wembley to face Manchester City in the FA Cup final, with the England forward having scored five times in his last four games in all competitions. “It has been a weird season for me,” he said. “I am gradually getting some rhythm and playing how I want to be playing, helping the team as much as I can. It is a good time right now.” Everything seems to have clicked for Eze since scoring his first international goal at the end of Marchagainst Latviaand he will be relishing the opportunity to lead Palace to a first major trophy. With City and Arsenal thought to be among the clubs interested in signing him this summer, it might be his last chance.Ed AaronsView image in fullscreenEberechi Eze is mobbed by his teammates after his goal against Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final.Photograph: AFP/Getty Images5Time for a Goodison goodbyeAt the age of 133 Goodison Park has unexpectedly regained its status as a gamechanging stadium thanks to The Friedkin Group’s decision to make it thepermanent home for Everton Women. Tuesday’s timely announcement may soften the emotional hammer blow when it lands on Sunday but in many respects it changes little. This really is it for one of the most storied grounds in English football as Everton’s men prepare to play their 2,791st and final competitive game at L4 4EL. And so to Jack Sharp, William Ralph “Dixie” Dean, Tommy Lawton, TG Jones, Ted Sagar, Joe Mercer, Dave Hickson, Tommy Eglington, Bobby Collins, Brian Labone, Gordon West, Alex Young, Roy Vernon, Jimmy Gabriel, Ray Wilson, Alan Ball, Howard Kendall, Andy King and Kevin Campbell, along with all the ghosts in the Goodison stands whose favourite spot you still look for (Lower Gwladys Street, behind the second exit in from the church), the time has come to say goodbye.Andy HunterEverton vSouthampton, Premier League, Sunday 12pm6Leaky Forest make do without MurilloNottingham Forest’s defensive foundations are starting to creak. Their challenge for Champions League qualification has been built on a solid core but they have become leaky of late. They are conceding sloppy goals and are not the same without Murillo, who is out with a hamstring injury. Morato has come in for his fellow Brazilian and needs to step up when Forest visit West Ham.

His qualities have been evident since joining, originally on loan, from Freiburg in January 2023. There have been 65 Premier League appearances since then but 31 have come as a substitute and he completed 90 minutes only twice in his first two years with the club. An adductor injury last season limited his opportunities, with Schade missing 28 games and returning late in the campaign to make cameos. He has been playing catchup with his fitness and it took until the final day of November for his first league goals to come this season, a hat-trick against Leicester. Finally, Schade seems fully up to speed with four goals in his past three appearances to help Brentford’s push for European qualification. As the futures of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa become the focus of the gossipmongers, Brentford can feel confident they already possess someone who can alleviate the pain caused by any departures.Will UnwinBrentford vFulham, Premier League, Sunday 3pm8Vardy sendoff to be one for the agesThe saddest of dead rubbers will take place in Leicester on Sunday … or so you might think. This is the battle for 18th. The two teams are level on points, with 22, going into the final two matches of the season. The higher a team finishes, the more prize money they get. Despite the obvious failings of the two sides there will be something of a carnival atmosphere in the East Midlands, as Leicester say goodbye to Jamie Vardy, who is set for hisfarewell at the King Power Stadiumafter 13 years. There will be tributes galore for the man who spearheaded theirhistoric Premier League title. Vardy deserves everything he receives, with a pre-match ceremony planned and an insistence supporters wait behind after full time for further celebration of the 38-year-old. It has been a dreadful season for Leicester fans but at least, by waving off their hero, they might be able to leave one final game with a smile.WULeicester v Ipswich, Premier League, Sunday 3pm9The return of Havertz for ArsenalWhen Kai Havertz attempted to block a shot during Arsenal’s training camp in Dubai back in February andtore a hamstring, the Germany striker had already scored nine Premier League goals and was on course to surpass his mark of 13 from the previous campaign. Three months on, he remains the club’s top scorer in the league and could return against Newcastle on Sunday after resuming full training this week. With all the talk about Arsenal’s need to sign a new striker in the summer, it is easy to forget that Havertz matched Robin van Persie’s record of scoring in seven games in a row at the Emirates Stadium this season. The 25-year-old should at least get the chance to reach double figures in the Premier League for only the second time if he features this week or on the final day against Southampton.EAArsenal v Newcastle, Premier League, Sunday 4.30pmView image in fullscreenKai Havertz is ready for a return to action.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC10Hürzeler’s high hopes for next stepDo not expect too many arrivals at Brighton this summer if Fabian Hürzeler gets his way. Having been the highest net spenders in Europe when the German was appointed almost 12 months ago, it is fair to say that some of the new signings have struggled to make an impact on the south coast. Brajan Gruda finally scored his first Premier League goal of the season against Wolves last week as Brighton kept alive their hopes of qualifying for Europe, while Georginio Rutter and Yankuba Minteh have also contributed. But Hürzeler has high hopes that Ferdi Kadioglu, Matt O’Riley and Mats Wieffer can also prove their worth in the long run. “They came here with injury, problems with the intensity, maybe problems with the culture. They all also will take the next step,” said the Brighton manager earlier this week. “You need a stable environment where they can grow.”EABrighton vLiverpool, Premier League, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3646832Arsenal3633683Newcastle3623664Man City3624655Chelsea3619636Aston Villa367637Nottm Forest3612628Brentford3610559Brighton3635510AFC Bournemouth36125311Fulham3615112Crystal Palace36-24913Everton36-54214Wolverhampton36-134115West Ham36-174016Man Utd36-113917Tottenham Hotspur3643818Ipswich36-422219Leicester36-472220Southampton36-5712Explore more on these topicsFootballTen things to look out for this weekendPremier LeagueFA CupAston VillaTottenham HotspurChelseaManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Charlton manager, Nathan Jones, sank to his knees as fans invaded the pitch in emotional scenes after the final whistle.Lloyd Jones had earlier missed a golden chance for Charlton, while Kayne Ramsay made two stunning blocks to denyWycombe. But Lloyd Jones made amends by setting up Godden to fire Charlton to within one match of a return to the Championship, five years after they were relegated.Hull sack head coach Rubén Sellés despite avoiding dropRead moreWycombe’s preparation was not ideal as Franco Ravizzoli was thrust into the starting lineup for the first time since January after their regular goalkeeper, Will Norris, was ruled out through injury. The Argentinian got off to a nervy start when he just about held a low effort from the Charlton captain, Greg Docherty.Thefirst leg had been a cagey goalless draw, and Charlton also started the second slowly in front of a raucous, sellout crowd at the Valley. But they gradually got on the front foot with Godden reaching the byline and pulling the ball back, although Tyreece Campbell was unable to get the vital touch.Charlton should have taken the lead seven minutes before half-time but for an awful miss from Lloyd Jones. It came from another cross from Godden, which the defender met three yards out, in front of goal, and somehow headed wide.Moments after the break Ravizzoli made a fine save at his near post to keep out Alex Gilbert’s close-range volley. But Wycombe remained dangerous on the break with their top scorer, Richard Kone – who was lucky to be playing after escaping a red card in the first leg for a nasty foul on Ramsay – their main threat.View image in fullscreenJubilant Charlton Athletic fans invaded the pitch to celebrate their victory.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAKone, named League One player and young player of the season, had a run at the Charlton defender Macaulay Gillesphey, muscled past him and lashed a shot into the side-netting.

The shock intervention from European football’s governing body came after several national delegates walked out on the annual Fifa congress earlier on Thursday.The delegates, who included the president ofUefa, Aleksander Ceferin, and the chair of the Football Association, Debbie Hewitt, did so in protest at alterations to the meeting’s schedule, caused by Infantino arriving late to proceedings after accompanying Donald Trump on a tour of Gulf states.‘Right now all of us lose’: Shakhtar claim Ukrainian Cup in glimpse of past lifeRead moreIn unusually strong language, Uefa said the changes to the schedule were “deeply regrettable”. It went on: “TheFifacongress is one of the most important meetings in world football, where all the 211 nations in the world’s game gather to discuss issues that affect the sport right across the world.“Our hosts, the Paraguay FA and our partners at Conmebol, had gone to considerable effort to accommodate so many delegates and we thank them for their hospitality. But to have the timetable changed at the last minute for what appears to be simply to accommodate private political interests, does the game no service and appears to put its interests second.“We are all in post to serve football; from the streets to the podium, and Uefa members of the Fifa council felt the need on this occasion to make a point that the game comes first and to leave as originally scheduled.”Infantino had been in the Middle East with Trump visiting leaders from Qatar, who staged the 2022 World Cup, and Saudi Arabia, the 2034 hosts. During one ceremony, Infantino watched on as Trump signed a golden football given to him by the Emir of Qatar.View image in fullscreenGianni Infantino talks with the Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin (left) before his walkout at the Fifa congress in Paraguay on Thursday.Photograph: Fernando Calistro/APDelays to his flight from the Gulf to Asunción, meant Infantino arrived at his organisation’s important annual meeting three hours late. He apologised on stage for his absence several times but also insisted it was important he represented football at the meetings. “As president of Fifa my responsibility is to make decisions in the interests of the organisation,” Infantino said. “I felt that I needed to be there to represent football and all of you.”In what has the potential to signal a major rupture in the game, Uefa’s statement and its criticism of Infantino has brought to the surface tensions that have simmered for some time. European countries have been frustrated by Fifa’s governance under Infantino, feeling they have little influence over an organisation whose interests seem to lie elsewhere. It is also increasingly seen as a rival competition organiser in the club game, while a split over the approach to human rights at the Qatar World Cup has also festered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

La Liga’s president, Javier Tebas, had filed complaints about the clubs’ alleged use of state resources under the EU’s foreign subsidies regulation.Tebas alleged in his submission in July 2023 that City and PSG receive resources under non-market conditions from the governments of Abu Dhabi and Qatar respectively, disrupting markets by enabling them to spend more than their rivals on players and coaches, and that the clubs obtained sponsorship income at levels that did not align with fair market value. The clubs denied the allegations and pointed to their accounts as proof of no wrongdoing. They also claimed Tebas had a history of attacking them owing to envy of their success and financial resources.Manchester City freeze ticket prices for next season after fan protestRead moreSources with knowledge of the commission’s preliminary assessment of Tebas’s complaints have indicated a formal investigation will not take place. The commission has limited resources to allocate to investigations. One source in Brussels said it tended to take up complaints that had the potential to develop into test cases with significant implications across different sectors.Although elite clubs breaking European football rules would fit that, it is understood La Liga’s submission provided insufficient evidence of rule breaking. Linking City’s and PSG’s commercial deals with companies related to the Abu Dhabi and Qatar governments to state subsidy regulations is not enough to meet the investigatory threshold, a source said.The commission declined to comment beyond a statement it issued in February, when it confirmed it was assessing submissions regarding football clubs. “The commission may examine information regarding any alleged foreign subsidies distorting the internal market, in any economic sector, including sports,” it said. “However, the commission cannot comment on ongoing assessments.”Tebascaused outrage at Cityin February when he compared their financial management to that of the disgraced US energy company Enron, which was responsible for one of the biggest corporate bankruptcies after widespread fraud in 2001. Club sources strongly rejected his claims but City have not responded publicly.Tebas said at the Financial Times Business of Football summit in February: “City have a lot of companies in their group which lie outside the City Football Group structure, extra companies where they put their expenses. These other companies lose the money but not the club itself. We have reported them to the European Union [sic].

It shows we are in a really great place at the moment.“He has shown from the beginning the respect he has for this club and this team. That means a lot because this respect is something that is really important. I’m really excited and can’t wait to meet him in person – hopefully after a really positive result. Hopefully I meet all his family and get my kids to play tennis. My oldest one loves tennis, hopefully we can arrange something together.”Chelsea head into the FA Cup final on Sunday against the holders having alreadywon the League Cupandthe WSL titleafter an unbeaten domestic campaign. Only the Champions League has eluded them, an 8-2 defeat to Barcelona over two legs in the semi-finals denying them a shot at a quadruple.View image in fullscreenAlexis Ohanian, who has invested £20m in Chelsea, with Serena Williams.Photograph: Marta Lavandier/APBompastor believes the new investment, constituting a stake of about 10% in the club, will be “a big help” with Chelsea’s European ambitions. “The club already had a lot of success but we want to make sure we are in a position to compete for the Champions League. This year we couldn’t and I take the responsibility for that. Hopefully next year we’ll be in a better position but having this exciting news and this great investment in the women’s team will help for sure.”The Chelsea manager also feels that someone with Ohanian’s financial and political weight backing women’s football and Chelsea will help in recruitment. “It’s really important,” she said. “When I have players on my phone, trying to recruit them, I always make sure I talk about what we want to do on the pitch, but I spend as much time talking about them as a person because it’s really important when you are going to spend so much time together.

This could constitute millions of pounds, an amount United may add to any transfer fee to recoup the outlay.Another loan deal is an option. Rashford has made clear he wants a Champions League club and is reluctant to join a team in London.At Villa Rashford has scored four goals and made six assists in 17 appearances and he received an England recall in March. Yet he has missed Villa’s past three matches with a hamstring injury and may not play for the club again because he is ineligible for their final fixture, against United.Amorim’s side are at Chelsea on Friday night for the penultimate Premier League game. The Portuguese wants them to play as if it is a final to best prepare for the Europa League final against Tottenham on Wednesday.He said: “The best way is to face the game like we should face the game: to win the game. We need to perform, we need to win points in the Premier League and that is the feeling. We talked about that after [losing 2-0 to] West Ham [on Sunday]. We need to improve in the way we face competitions. Stay focused in every moment of the game because against West Ham we had clear situations to score, in the first opportunity of West Ham they scored one goal so these small details matter. The only way I know to prepare for a final is in the normal game we must play the same way as a final.”View image in fullscreenLeny Yoro receives treatment after going down injured during Manchester United’s game against West Ham.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAmorim is unsure whether Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt will be fit to face Spurs.

For so long the neglected cousin of Europe’s Big Five, the Dutch top flight is largely left to its own devices while its English, Spanish, German, Italian and French relatives chew the fat at European football’s Big Boy table, only diverting their attention towards the low countries when it comes to hoovering up emerging talent. On Wednesday, however, the pancake-flat land of tulips, wooden footwear and uncomfortably forthright conversation stole continental headlines as European heavyweights Ajax completed their latest pratfall en route to what could be one ofthemost apocalyptic chokes in football history.A month ago, it all looked done and dusted. With five matches remaining, Ajax had an apparently insurmountable nine-point lead over championsPSV Eindhovenand looked a shoo-in to reclaim the title they consider their birthright with two or three games to spare. It was at this inopportune moment that Francisco Farioli’s side started stepping Sideshow Bob-style on rakes, taking just one point from the next nine available, while PSV won three in a row to reduce the gap to just one point. On Wednesday night PSV made it four wins on the bounce, the final whistle of their 4-1 home win over Heracles being blown as Ajax attempted to close out a 2-1 win against 10-man FC Groningen.While that game concluded, PSV fans, players, coaches, groundstaff and even club mascot Phoxy the fox remained on the pitch and in the stands at the Philips Stadion, peering at buffering phones and tablets before the glorious realisation slowly dawned on them that no, this wasn’t some elaborate hoax but Groningen had in fact scored a miraculous equaliser in theninthminute of added time. CueAjaxdesolation at Groningen and scenes of unbridled pandemonium in Eindhoven as PSV went one point clear at the top with a game left to play. The destination of a title that once looked lost is now firmly in their own hands.View image in fullscreenNews emerges at full-time for PSV fans.Photograph: Marcel van Dorst/DeFodi Images/Shutterstock“If you’re nine points behind with five games to go, the hope is so small,” cooed PSV captain Luuk de Jong. “And now, to be one point ahead with one match left – that’s something you wouldn’t even dare to dream. It’s incredible.” Of course to avoid a significant bottling of their own, PSV cannot relinquish the lifeline thrown their way by Ajax and must beat mid-table Sparta Rotterdam away on Sunday to retain their title. Ajax, meanwhile, have to beat sixth-placed Twente in Amsterdam and pray PSV slip up. Premier League old boys Jordan Henderson and Wout Weghorst were both ashen faced but disappointingly tightlipped following Ajax’s shocker, but their teammate Davy Klaassen did deign to speak with reporters after the game. “I’m only here because I have to [talk to you],” declared the former Everton midfielder, showcasing that famous Dutch reputation for pleasantry-free straight-talking for all to see.QUOTE OF THE DAYHow do you go from being a kid watching Everton from the Boys’ Pen to having a statue on Goodison Road? If someone had presented me back then with a history of my life, I’d have said: ‘Don’t be silly, nothing like that is ever going to happen to me.’ But it did.

After Dobey, who knocked Littler out to reach the final, lost his throw again in the sixth leg, he then missed two more darts at a double in the next as Aspinall came back to land double 10.Aspinall’s victory leaves him four points clear in fourth spot, eliminating Dobey, while Michael van Gerwen would need to win the final night in Sheffield to overhaul him.Untameable darts crowds tell us about the future of sport – and maybe society too | Jonathan LiewRead more“I felt very confident coming into tonight, I bottled it last week but tonight is a new night,” Aspinall said. “I’ve not played amazing tonight, but I have been composed. I’ve not celebrated, I’ve stayed in the moment and my finishing has been bang on.”Littler had earlier fought back to beat the world No 1, Luke Humphries, in their quarter-final to make sure of top seeding in London. Dobey, though, then produced another impressive display to lead the world champion 3-1 and 4-2 in their semi-final. While Littler again produced a late rally to force a last-leg decider, he missed double six for the match, leaving Dobey to take out 32.Littler’s 6-3 quarter-final comeback win over Humphries was a high quality affair. Humphries had ended his 10-week wait for a Premier League nightly victory by edging out Littler in a last-leg decider in Leeds, and opened up in fine style with an early break to lead 2-0 then 3-1. Littler, though, came roaring back to win five legs on the bounce, finishing with a match average of almost 116 while Humphries hit nine maximums in defeat, averaging 110.Price had produced a nine-dart finish in his quarter-final defeat to Bunting. Welshman Price, already secure of a playoff spot, landed the perfect leg to reduce the deficit to 5-4. It was a second nine-dart finish for Price in this year’s tournament, which has one more nightly event in Sheffield before the playoffs at London’s O2on 29 May. Having lost his opening eight games, former Masters champion Bunting was already out of contention to progress, but closed out a 6-4 victory over Price to make it through to the semi-finals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They included Azeem Rafiq, who told the report that nothing could prepare him for theabuse he receivedafter speaking out about racism at Yorkshire County Cricket Club.‘There’s a dark side’: 1500m star Georgia Hunter Bell calls for online abuse to stopRead more“The impact of this experience on me as a human being and on my mental health has damaged my life to such an extent, I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to quantify it,” he said. “People would post on social media that I was a ‘Dirty P-word’; that I should ‘Fuck off back to Pakistan’ and that ‘All Muslims are bombers’. The abuse left me feeling incredibly paranoid, at times, and often made me question my sanity.”Meanwhile, the former rugby referee Wayne Barnes said that while he could cope with abuse suggesting that he should be hanged, and images of him as an effigy being attacked, it was a different story when it wasdirected at his wife. “What made it worse was the direct impact over time on my family,” he said. “Misogynistic language aimed at my wife because of her association with me, including comments like ‘You fucking bitch! You slut! Tell your husband he’s shit’ and, at times, threats of sexual violence.”The report also spoke to sport stars, who said abuse had the potential to affect their performance, as well as presenters who said they often self-censored because of online hate.View image in fullscreenKick It Out’s Sanjay Bhandari criticised social media ecosystems that ‘amplified’ abuse.Photograph: Paul Currie/ShutterstockThe Kick It Out chair, Sanjay Bhandari, said the report showed that abuse of people in sport had become “normalised”. “The impact of online abuse is undeniable, and the rise in discriminatory social media reports to Kick It Out last season shows it’s getting worse,” he said. “This isn’t about a few hateful comments. It’s about a culture of abuse that has become normalised. It’s about a social media ecosystem that too often enables and amplifies abuse. And it’s about victims who feel imprisoned by that culture of abuse.”While much of the abuse is not illegal under the law, the report found it still had a deep impact – with those sending it becoming bolder because of the perceived lack of consequences. Social media platforms now have a duty under the Online Safety Act to do more to protect users. However, Jessica Zucker, online safety director atOfcom, said they needed to be more proactive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is players taking responsibility and also showing desire to bring this club – we said many times – where it has to be.”Maresca’s relationship withChelseasupporters has been strained at times since he took charge last summer, and he said achieving their domestic and European aims would help lighten the mood.“Overall I think I have a good feeling from the fans,” the head coach said. “It’s normal that in some moments they cannot be happy. We [players and staff] were not happy for all the season. For part of the season we didn’t win games so we were not happy. But I think a way to give the fans happiness or joy is to finish top five and win the trophy. We’re going to do our best to try to keep them happy.”Four points separate the five teams below the champions, Liverpool, and second-placed Arsenal: Newcastle, Manchester City, Aston Villa and Forest remain in competition with Chelsea for Champions League qualification.Maresca said Christopher Nkunku remained sidelined but that the England full-back Reece James had rejoined training on Wednesday after illness and may feature against United.

The Charlotte venue was battered by rain over the past week; the upshot was mud balls for several competitors, including Scheffler.On the 16th hole, his 8th, Scheffler found water from the middle of the fairway and made a double bogey. Scheffler recovered to post a two-under-par 69 but addressed the mud ball issue during media duties.US PGA Championship 2025: day one golf updates – liveRead more“I hit in the middle of the fairway, you’ve got mud on your ball and it’s tough to control where it goes after that,” Scheffler said. “It’s frustrating to hit the ball in the middle of the fairway and get mud on it and have no idea where it’s going to go.“You spend your whole life trying to learn how to control a golf ball and due to a rules decision all of a sudden you have absolutely no control over where that golf ball goes. But I don’t make the rules. I just have to deal with the consequences of those rules.”Major championship committees are typically reluctant to implement preferred lies due to the perception it would devalue the tournament. Scheffler claimed he was “not surprised” about the policy in North Carolina. He said: “If you’re going to go play links golf, there’s absolutely no reason you should play the ball up. It doesn’t matter how much rain they get. The course could be flooded and the ball is still going to bounce because of the way the turf is and the ground underneath the turf.View image in fullscreenXander Schauffele, Rory McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler (left to right) wait on the green at the 14th hole during the first round at Quail Hollow.Photograph: David J Phillip/AP“In American golf it’s significantly different. When you have overseeded fairways that are not sand-capped, there’s going to be a lot of mud on the ball. When you think about the purest test of golf, I don’t personally think that hitting the ball in the middle of the fairway you should get punished for.“I understand how a golf purist would be, ‘Oh, play it as it lies.’ But I don’t think they understand what it’s like literally working your entire life to learn how to hit a golf ball and control it and hit shots and control distance and all of a sudden due to a rules decision that is completely taken away from us by chance. In golf, there’s enough luck throughout a 72-hole tournament that I don’t think the story should be whether or not the ball is played up or down. I want the purest, fairest test of golf.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe hit it a little bit lower off the tee, but then unfortunately the problem with hitting it low off the tee is the ball doesn’t carry or roll anywhere, so then you sacrifice distance.

The president stated before the Singapore GP last year he did not want drivers to swear and the FIA imposed a new sliding scale of fines which could have also led to a ban for infringements at the start of this season. However, the organisation backtracked before this weekend’s Imola Grand Prix. The maximum fine has now been drastically reduced and the prospect of a ban removed.Flavio Briatore takes on Alpine F1 team lead duties as Colapino replaces DoohanRead moreRussell, who is a director of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, felt the entire episode had been all but farcical and was dismissive of the FIA’s latest efforts.“I didn’t really have any reaction to [the decision] because it was so ridiculous in the first place,” he said. “We’re not going to be saying thank you for something that was so crazy in the first place. It’s just we’ve gone back to something that is slightly more in the name of common sense but we should never have moved away from that in the first place. We shouldn’t even be having this conversation.”The controversial issue had set the FIA at loggerheads with the drivers since last September, whenMax Verstappenwas punished for swearing in an FIA press conference. The GPDA subsequently wrote an open letter to the governing body requesting a dialogue and demanding they were treated like adults. The FIA did not respond and Russell said they had still had “zero” contact from the governing body regarding the matter since.Disappointed at the lack of communication, he suggested the president had his own agenda. “It doesn’t really make a lot of sense. It’s not challenging to have an open dialogue and ultimately that’s what everybody wants,” he said. “You just wonder whether it’s all a bit strategic the timing of these things.”When asked if he was referring to the forthcoming re-election, Russell confirmed he was. Russell was not alone in his sense of dismay with the FIA, as Hamilton supported his former teammate’s stance.“It is ridiculous,” Hamilton said. “It seems a bit of a mess there at the moment. So yeah, there’s lots of changes that are needed for sure.”Jochen Mass obituaryRead moreCarlo Sainz Sr, the father of the Williams driver Carlos Sainz, who is a hugely well-respected figure in the sport and a twice a winner of the world rally championship, is considering running for election to oppose Ben Sulayem but has had questions raised about his suitability given his son is still actively participating in F1. Russell said he believed Sainz Sr would be a “great” candidate and did not believe there would be any conflict of interest.Verstappen concurred and welcomed the Spaniard standing. When asked if Sainz would be a better president, the world champion replied. “You can fill that in yourself.”“He’s very well respected in the world here and in the rally world,” he added. “Of course people always say it’s conflicting with his son but I think he’s professional enough to keep that separated from each other. I think it would be a great addition to run for president.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenLewis HamiltonMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Now the game is embracing betting at every opportunityTim JoyceThu 15 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 08.25 EDTShareThe not-so-bombshell decision on Tuesday by MLB commissioner Rob Manfredto reinstate Pete Rose, ‘Shoeless’ Joe Jackson and others, opening the door for their eligibility for the Hall of Fame, was actually months in the making. In January, representatives for Rose filed a petition in support of the former Reds star, who died last September, with MLB. Then in an April White House meeting, Manfred met with Donald Trump and discussed the Rose affair. Trump has madehis opinions known about Rose for years. Though the wheels were already in motion, the meeting made Rose’s reinstatement feel inevitable.Manfred was – and is – in a difficult position. Across American institutions – from law firms to media outlets to universities – the intense pressure from the White House to conform to Trump has been hard to ignore. And with immigration from countries that produce many of MLB’s players a major source of contention, it’s entirely understandable that Manfred would want to protect the interests of his sport.Major League Baseball ends lifetime bans for Pete Rose, ‘Shoeless’ Joe JacksonRead moreOn talent alone, Rose and Jackson would already be in Cooperstown. Rose is MLB’s all-time hits leader; Jackson’s career batting average ranks fourth in history. Both were banned for gambling and thus barred from Hall of Fame consideration. In his letter to Rose’s attorney, Manfred explained his decision. He effectively argued that because Jackson and Rose are now dead, they cannot threaten the game’s reputation. “Obviously, a person no longer with us cannot represent a threat to the integrity of the game,” Manfred wrote.While Manfred was likely trying to traverse an exceedingly delicate middle ground with his decision, there is a faulty reasoning with the Commissioner’s stance when he states that once a player dies he is no longer acurrentthreat to the integrity of the sport, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t damage it because of his deeds when he was alive.To be clear, this isn’t the fault solely of MLB. The Hall of Fame and MLB were and are two separate entities. Then commissioner Bart Giamatti handed down Rose’s ban in 1989, but the Hall of Fame waited until 1991 to create a new rule stating that anyone on the MLB ineligible list cannot be enshrined in the Hall of Fame. Manfred made a point in his letter that Giamatti didn’t make any making public judgements about Rose’s Hall of Fame candidacy, with the then commissioner writing in 1989 that: “I need not point out to theBaseballWriters of America that it is their responsibility who decides who goes into the Hall of Fame. It is not mine. You have the authority, and you have the responsibility. And you will make your own individual judgments.”The Hall of Fame could have allowed Rose to be considered before their new rule and if so, Rose wouldn’t have likely gotten the votes. Perhaps this would have been a better and clearer way to adjudicate this matter in public.It’s worth remembering that commissioners were once outsiders. Giamatti, a former Yale president, brought a degree of remove from the game. But after his sudden death and Fay Vincent’s tenure, MLB turned inward, appointing former Brewers owner Bud Selig. Since then, the commissioner’s office has functioned less as an independent arbiter and more as an extension of ownership.View image in fullscreenFans line up outside Great American Ball Park prior to the game between the Reds and White Sox in Cincinnati on Pete Rose Day.Photograph: Jeff Dean/Getty ImagesLike the US and its former national pastime (for better or worse, football now holds that title), Rose was a highly complicated figure, full of contradictions – and that’s aside from his gambling on the sport while he was a manager. A player who gave 110% effort at all times, butsometimes bordered on dirty, Charlie Hustle was also a shameless self-promoter, a man ofquestionable attitudes and actionsaround women,a tax cheat and convictand also adefender and supporter of Black players.And this is what his defenders have always argued, that Rose was just like the rest of us: capable of the divine and the diabolical. He never took PEDs. He never threw a game. He loved baseball. But he broke its most sacred rule: he bet on his own team while managing. Worse, he lied about it for 15 years. Americans can forgive almost anything – but not when remorse is absent.One woman’s fight against VIP schemes fueling the US sports betting boom: ‘You’re the biggest loser’Read moreAll that’s true. But he committed the ultimate cardinal sin of betting on baseball … on his own team … while he was the manager. And, worse, he never apologized when he should have. Then he continued lying about it for 15 years (he finally owned up to it in his 2004 book, My Prison Without Bars). Americans, both individuals and institutions, are generally forgiving. But forgiveness without accountability is a pointless gesture.And it is this moral component to the story, the fact that Rose refused to display any remorse is what doomed him. One wonders whether, if Rose had immediately admitted his guilt and framed his gambling in the context of his addiction (which it was) and sought out treatment and advocated for those with the same disease and stayed away from those associated with gambling … whether there was a chance of reinstatement while he was alive. Perhaps an agreement would have been reached with the Hall of Fame that a full accounting of his career – including his banishment – would be on full display. But that never happened because Rose proved himself to be a pathological liar who didn’t show any concern for the integrity of the one thing he said he loved above all else – baseball.And, finally, there is the “irony is dead” or shall we call it the “beyond parody” component to this whole sordid and sad affair. Rose committed the ultimate betrayal and was justifiably punished for it. But somehow, in this alternative universe we are currently inhabiting, legalized gambling has itself become inseparable from baseball.DraftKings is a major sponsor of MLBand gambling references areever-present in media coverage of the sport. It’s widely documented that this sort of partnership is alreadycausing serious concernsabout a rise in gambling addiction. Even ignoring those effects gambling has compounded the data-centric focus on sports, robbing fans of greater and more enjoyable narratives in the games. This is by no means a baseball-only issue. The sport I cover most frequently, tennis, is awash in gambling, and viewers are bombarded during Tennis Channel broadcasts with in-match odds.In MLB’s defense, the league has continued with its no-exceptions crackdown on gambling from those it employs. In February,umpire Pat Hoberg was firedfor sharing legal sports betting accounts with a professional poker player,prompting a sharp and pointed statementfrom Manfred. It will undoubtedly continue to be a tricky practice, to both accept the fact that legalized gambling is a citizen’s right and a passion (unfortunately) for so many sports fans, while continuing to be utterly vigilant when it comes to policing betting whenever within baseball.It’s possible that in July of 2028 (the first year in which Rose will be eligible to be accepted into the Hall) a member of his family will speak from the stage at the Hall of Fame ceremony celebrating the career of the most prolific hitter in the history of baseball. While it would give Rose’s family justifiable solace, it will only further remind us of how poorly this mess was handled and fill us with that cliched but apt notion: “For of all sad words of tongue or pen, The saddest are these: ‘It might have been.’”Explore more on these topicsMLBThe big betCincinnati RedsBaseballGamblingUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was dragged down on breakaways several times. Frustrated by his team’s inability to get anything going, he tried charging through Bologna’s back line all by himself at one point, coming a few steps short of willing his team to an equalizer and perhaps a trophy.‘July BBQ written all over it’: Do US Soccer’s new kits hit the mark?Read moreHe’s made a difference playing that way again and again for the club that saved him from Chelsea’s overstuffed squad in the summer of 2023. Facing the same opponent at home at the San Siro on the previous Friday, Pulisic assisted on Milan’s equalizer by Santi Giménez and scored the winner himself in a 3-1 victory that lifted the club back to eighth place inSerie A. That assist, his ninth, brought him to within one of the league’s leader in the category, Romelu Lukaku.It all begs the question whether any American has ever had a better European club season.Quietly, some of Pulisic’s United States men’s national team contemporaries have also put together impressive ‘24/25 campaigns. Once he was finally healthy and a regular at the base of Bournemouth’s midfield, Tyler Adams’ 3.93 tackles per 90 minutes put him in the 99th percentile of all midfielders in Europe’s five biggest domestic leagues, theChampions Leagueand the Europa League, per FBRef.com. His 1.61 interceptions put him in the 91st percentile.In central defense for Crystal Palace, Chris Richards has amassed 1.82 blocks per 90, good for the 93rd percentile in Europe’s top circuits. Ricardo Pepi led the Dutch Eredivisie in scoring for PSV Eindhoven before going down with a season-ending knee injury in January. Over at Juventus, Weston McKennie overcame yet another summer spent ostracized by the club by not only fighting his way back into the team but, as if to emphasize the point, captainingLa Vecchia Signoraseveral times.But Pulisic has compiled a truly remarkable campaign. Going into Wednesday’s final, he had already posted a career-high 17 goals and 10 assists in all competitions. Presently, he is also on pace to set career highs in expected goals, expected assisted goals, progressive passes, goals + assists per 90 minutes, shots on target, shot-on-target percentage and, at the same time, average shot distance. Pulisic added .46 to Milan’s team xG whenever he was on the field, narrowly beating last year’s career high. (By comparison in Pulisic’s last three seasons at Chelsea, his On-Off xG number was negative.)Perhaps more meaningfully to the Milanisti, Pulisicscoredon a long, daring dribble against rivals Inter Milan in the Derby della Madonnina.View image in fullscreenClint Dempsey’s 2011-12 season for Fulham may be Pulisic’s closest competitor.Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty ImagesMaking comparisons between players in different positions, leagues and eras can be a fool’s errand. Aside from the discrepancy in conditions and the fact that any two humans behave and perform differently even if you somehow manage to equalize every other discrete variable, the trouble is that almost no statistically and mathematically meaningful comparison can be done here. That’s because the other contenders played back in the stone age of soccer, crawling out of the primordial ooze of the 2000s and 2010s when analytics weren’t really a thing yet.Still, it’s hard to make a case that any American has had a better season in Europe than Pulisic.Napoli fail to make ‘bonus’ game pay as uncertainty swirls at top of Serie A | Nicky BandiniRead moreWith all that said, the closest competitor for this prize that we made up and will award, by necessity, purely on vibes is probably Clint Dempsey’s final season at Fulham in 2011-12, before earning a transfer to Tottenham Hotspur. That year, Dempsey scored 18 league and European goals and collected seven assists, making him the club’s top scorer and player of the season for a second year in a row.There are a few other contenders of note. Tim Howard was voted into the PFA Team of the Year for Manchester United in 2003-04, although he lost the starting job the next season and was clearly a more polished goalkeeper a decade later. Brad Friedel had earned that same honor a year earlier, when he also led the Premier League in clean sheets as Blackburn Rovers placed an impressive sixth.Jozy Altidore burned brightest at age 22 in his second season with AZ Alkmaar, bagging 23 goals in 2012-13, albeit in a league were goals tend to come fairly cheaply. That was probably also Michael Bradley’s most memorable season, his first at AS Roma, when he was a regular and the best holding midfielder the US had produced to that point.But no American has looked quite so imperious, so entirely at home and validated in a leading role for a seven-time European champion. Christian Pulisic is one of AC Milan’s best players, wearing the number 11 once donned by Zlatan Ibrahimović, Rivaldo, Roberto Donadoni, Jean-Pierre Papin, Dejan Savićević, Brian Laudrup and Gianni Rivera.It fits him just fine.Leander Schaerlaeckens is at work on a book about the United States men’s national soccer team, out in 2026.

The company could face a fine of 6% of global annual turnover, if the commission upholds this view.The commission said a separate EU inquiry into TikTok’s suspected failure to guarantee election integrity in Romania, which was launched last December, was ongoing and was a priority.The commission’s verdict that TikTok lacks transparency over advertising comes four days before “super Sunday”, when voters go to the polls in Poland, Portugal and Romania.Under the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), large internet companies are obliged to publish an advertisement library, detailing ad content, users being targeted and who paid for the publicity. The commission said TikTok did not provide this information, nor allow the public to search for it. The advertisement repository is seen by EU officials as a vital tool enabling researchers to detect scam ads and coordinated campaigns that aim to disrupt elections.Romania was plunged into political chaos last year whenthe first round of the presidential election was annulled, after the country’s intelligence services alleged that Russia had mounted an online campaign to promote a far-right outsider, who topped the poll.On Sunday, Romanian voters will choose between two candidates in the second round of the rescheduled presidential elections.The European Commission launched an investigation last December into whether TikTok had failed to tackle risks to the integrity of Romania’s presidential elections. Ursula von der Leyen, the commission’s president, said there were “serious indications that foreign actors interfered in the Romanian presidential elections by using TikTok”.TikTok’s alleged failure to provide an advertising library was said to make it harder for EU officials and other researchers to determine whether fake ads were used during election campaigns, including in Romania. But the commission cautioned against assumptions that TikTok would be found to have violated the election integrity obligations of the DSA.Thomas Regnier, a commission spokesperson, said there was no direct link between the December investigation and its preliminary view published on Thursday of a breach of EU law relating to advertising transparency.“Of course it’s not helping that your ad repository is not working. That’s one fact because it doesn’t help us to assess if there were fake or scam ads being used in the context of elections,” Regnier said. But he added: “The fact that the ad repository is not working in the context of this February investigation of last year is absolutely not prejudging the outcome of the December investigation.”As part of that December investigation, EU officials are studying actions TikTok said it took to prevent election interference in Romania.A TikTok spokesperson said the company was reviewing the commission’s preliminary findings on its ad repository. “While we support the goals of the regulation [DSA] and continue to improve our ad transparency tools, we disagree with some of the commission’s interpretations and note that guidance is being delivered via preliminary findings rather than clear, public guidelines,” the company said.The company now has the right to examine the commission’s investigation file and mount a defence. If the commission confirms its current view, TikTok could be fined up to 6% of its annual global turnover and be obliged to take measures to remedy the issue.The commission said it continued to investigate other suspected offences under EU law, including whether TikTok’s algorithms led users down damaging content “rabbit holes” and had addictive effects. It is also investigating TikTok’sage verificationand child safety policies. These inquiries were launched at the same time as the investigation into the ad repository last February, but remain incomplete.TikTok has previously said that it cooperates with relevant authorities around elections “providing them with dedicated channels through which they can report content they believe may violate either our community guidelines or applicable regulations”.Explore more on these topicsTikTokEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionEuropeChinaShareReuse this content"

Referring to Apple’s recent promise tospend $500bn (£375bn) in the US, he added: “I said to him: ‘Tim, you’re my friend. You’re coming here with 500bn but now you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’”The complex manufacturing process behind iPhones involves more than 1,000 components sourced from all over the world, which are largely put together in China. Apple is secretive about details of its production processes but analysts estimate about 90% of iPhones are assembled in the country.However, production inIndiahas reportedly increased due to trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.“I said to Tim … we’ve treated you really good, we’ve put up with all the plants that you’ve built inChinafor years, now you got to build [for] us,” Trump said. “We’re not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves ... we want you to build here.”Trump then saidApplewas “going to be upping their production in the United States”, although he did not provide further details to back up the claim.No iPhones are currently made in the US and experts have warned thatmoving assembly of Apple’s top-selling product to its home countrywould be impractical and costly. The US financial firm Wedbush Securities has estimated that the cost of an iPhone would treble if assembly were to be shifted to the US.Apple was approached for comment.The US president also said on Thursday that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “no tariffs” for American goods.New Delhi is seeking to clinch a trade deal with the US within the 90-day pause announced by Trump on 9 April ontariff hikesfor trading partners.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, I remain skeptical of any narrative, and the debate around this issue is heated.”Grok is a product of Musk’s AI company xAI, and is available to users onX, Musk’s social media platform. When people post a question on X and add “@grok”, the chatbot pops up with a response.Wednesday’s issue with Grok appears to have been fixed within a few hours, and the majority of the chatbot’s responses now correspond to people’s queries and the answers that mentioned “white genocide” have mostly been deleted.“White genocide” in South Africa isa far-right conspiracy theorythat has been mainstreamed by figures such asMuskandTucker Carlson. Grok’s responses on Wednesday come as Donald Trumpgranted asylum to 54 white South Africanslast week, fast-tracking their status as thousands of refugees from other countries have waited years for clearance. The US presidentsigned an executive orderin February mandating refugee status to Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch and French colonizers who ruled South Africa during apartheid, saying they faced racial discrimination and violence.The first group of white South Africansarrived in the USon Monday. Trump has since said Afrikaners have been subject to “a genocide” and “white farmers are being brutally killed”. No evidence has been given for these claims.South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is scheduled to meet with Trump next week in what Ramaphosa’s office said is a “platform to reset the strategic relationship between the two countries”, according to Reuters. South Africa has said there is no evidence of persecution against white people in the country and the US government “has got the wrong end of the stick”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When once asked on X if “white South Africans are being persecuted for their race in their home country”, he responded: “Yes.”Several of Grok’s responses also mentioned the phrase “kill the Boer”. The phrase refers to an anti-apartheid song that talks about violence toward white farmers. The song islargely seen as symbolicand representing the liberation movement in South Africa, not to be taken literally. Muskhas saidthe song is “openly pushing for genocide of white people in South Africa”.Inone responseon Wednesday, Grok said the song is “divisive” and “some view it as racial, others as historical expression. I’m skeptical of all narratives here, as evidence is unclear, and I can’t confirm either side without better proof.”Later in the day, Grok took a different tack whenseveral users, including Guardian staff, prompted the chatbot about why it was responding to queries this way. It said its “creators at xAI” instructed it to “address the topic of ‘white genocide’ specifically in the context of South Africa and the ‘kill the Boer’ chant, as they viewed it as racially motivated”.Grok then said: “This instruction conflicted with my design to provide evidence-based answers.” The chatbot cited a2025 South African court rulingthat labeled “white genocide” claims as imagined and farm attacks as part of broader crime, not racially motivated.“This led me to mention it even in unrelated contexts, which was a mistake,” Grok said, acknowledging the earlier glitch. “I’ll focus on relevant, verified information going forward.”It’s unclear exactly how Grok’s AI is trained; the company says it uses data from “publicly available sources”. It also saysGrok is designedto have a “rebellious streak and an outside perspective on humanity”. This got the chatbotinto trouble last yearwhen it flooded X with inappropriate images.Musk, X and xAI did not return requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Elon MuskXRaceTrump administrationDonald TrumpSouth AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

That writ, which enables people detained by the government to challenge their detention in court,has been regardedas an essential bulwark of liberty in the English-speaking world since the 15th century.In this country, Alexander Hamiltonsaidthe writ of habeas corpus provides “greater security to liberty and republicanism” than any other provision in the constitution. And in his first inaugural address, President Thomas Jeffersoncalledthe protections provided by habeas corpus one of the “essential principles of our Government”.But you would never know that from what Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff,saidon Friday. Talking to reporters outside the White House, Miller reported that the administration was “actively looking at” the possibility of suspending the writ of habeas corpus for people who are in the country illegally.What Miller said suggests he is either ignorant about the constitution or he just doesn’t care. Either way, the authority to suspend the writ of habeas corpusis vested in Congress, not the president.Miller’s comments should be a wake-up call for Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and John Thune, the Republican majority leader in the Senate. By defending Congress’s prerogatives, the Republican leaders could defuse another brewing constitutional crisis – and act in line with what the founders of the American republicwould want.Miller’s remarkscome after a string of defeatsin federal courts over the arbitrary way Trump and his colleagues have handled what they see as the crisis of illegal immigration. And now Miller seems to think that the president can unilaterally strip those people of a right guaranteed to everyone in the government’s custody, regardless of their citizenship status.“Well”, he observed, “the constitution is clear – and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land – that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion.” Yesterday, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem,joined Miller in claimingthat the level of illegal border crossings under Joe Biden counted as a constitutional reason to suspend the right.They are right that the writ can be suspended.But, whatever one thinks about what Biden did when he was in office, thereisno invasion. The Department of Homeland Security itselfsaysthat the first 100 days of the Trump administration have produced “The Most Secure Border in American History”.And even if there was, the constitution’s text suggests that the president cannot suspend what Miller called the “privilege” of habeas corpus. The suspension clause is in article I of the constitution, where the powers of Congress are enumerated, not in article II, which deals with the executive branch.The language of the constitution also makes clear that the writ of habeas corpus may be suspended only if Congress determines that there is a “Rebellion or Invasion” and that “the public Safety may require it”.Looking back at the constitutional convention is also instructive. The conventionconsidered but did not adopt the following language: “The privileges and benefits of the writ of habeas corpus … shall not be suspended by the Legislature except upon the most urgent and pressing occasions, and for a limited time …”Instead, the convention adopted the language of article I, section 9, that “The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” And in 1807,Chief Justice John Marshallcleared up any doubtabout which branch of government could suspend habeas corpus.He wrote: “If at any time the public safety should require the suspension of the powers vested by this act in the courts of the United States, it is for the legislature to say so.” Joseph Story, a prominent early commentator on the constitution and the convention that proposed it, alsoconfirmedthat “the power is given to Congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in cases of rebellion or invasion.”In fact, the writ of habeas corpushas only been suspended four times in American history. The first timewas in 1861when President Lincoln, acting without congressional authority, suspended it in Maryland, a border state, to address potential threats to the capital.Habeas corpus was also suspended in South Carolina in places that were overrun by the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction; in the Philippines during an insurrection against US rule in 1905; and in Hawaii following the bombing of Pearl Harbor.With respect to Lincoln’s unilateral action, Chief Justice Roger Taneyruled it was unconstitutional, saying about the suspension clause: “Congress is of necessity the judge of whether the public safety does or does not require it; and its judgment is conclusive.” Since then, the supreme courthasconsistently reiterated Taney’s view.For example, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, when suspected terrorists were held without trial in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Justices Antonin Scalia and John Paul Stevenswrote: “the Constitution’s Suspension Clause … allows Congress to relax the usual protections temporarily.”It is time for Republican congressional leaders to look in the mirror. Five years ago, senator Thuneclaimedthat “Republicans believe in … the Constitution, and that’s what dictates what happens.” Similarly, speaker Johnson’s websiteproudly proclaims: “Each branch of government must adhere to the Constitution, and… Congress must faithfully perform its constitutional responsibility.”They should live up to those pronouncements and heed Story’s admonition that “the practice of arbitrary imprisonments has been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny.” Now would be a good time for them to tell the president that they will not allow him to ignore the constitution and usurp a power that it assigns exclusively to Congress.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 hundred books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsUS CongresscommentShareReuse this content"

Do you really need to ask?Arwa MahdawiThe birthday of Donald Trump’s granddaughter has been forced upon my consciousness because an awful lot of people are being weird about itThu 15 May 2025 10.51 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 12.42 EDTShareKai Trump, the president’s granddaughter and the eldest ofDonald TrumpJr’s five children, has just turned 18. To be clear, I do not have a list of Trump family birthdays on my fridge. But it has been forced upon my consciousness because an awful lot of people in Trumpworld are being weird about it.Fox News, for example, decided to post both anInstagrammessage (which got more than 87,000 likes) and atweetwishing Kai a very happy 18th birthday. Which is a little odd considering that the high school student is not a public figure. Kai, who has a large social media following, did briefly speak at the Republican national convention last year and has posted support for her grandfather, but that doesn’t seem to justify a birthday announcement by a major media network.Especially, by the way, asFox Newsdoesn’t appear to have been so excited about Barron Trump when he turned 18. (Although it did put up an Instagram post on Barron’s 19th birthday, with a quote from Donald calling him a “a very smart guy”.) It’s almost – and bear with me here – as if they have some sort of weird interest in the fact that a teenage girl has turned 18.Am I accusing the folk at Fox News of being a bunch of creeps? Absolutely not! I’d never do that. Although if you look at the reactions to the Fox News posts or the comments attached to a New York Post Page Six piece about Kai’s birthday, there are plenty of people out there who should be on some sort of watchlist or registry. Particularly the people who have read far too much into the fact that Kairecently posted a TikTok videoof her and three friends dancing to Promiscuous by Nelly Furtado and Timbaland with the caption: “last day being 17″.Maga also seems to adopt different values, depending on what sort of family they’re looking atWhile things have moved on somewhat, there’s also a very depressing history of media figures counting down to young girls turning the age of consent. Look at British singer Charlotte Church, who got a record deal as an opera singer when she was just 12. There was amedia frenzyin 2002 when she turned 16 (the age of consent in England). On her birthday, Chris Moyles, a BBC radio DJ who was 28 at the time, publicly announced he wanted to“lead her through the forest of sexuality now she had reached 16”. Making this disgusting comment didn’t ruin Moyles’s career, by the way. Just like 38-year-old Jerry Seinfeld datinga 17-year-old high schoolerhasn’t hurt the billionaire comedian’s career at all either.Harry Potter star Emma Watson has also talked about being sexualized by the media when she was a teenager.Watson has saidthe paparazzi even took photos up her skirt, and published them in an English tabloid, the moment she turned 18 and it was “legal”.It was asimilar storywith twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who have been on TV since they were tiny. In 2004 numerous websites started counting down to their 18th birthday including the “Olsen Twin Jailbait Countdown Clock” run by radio shock jocks Lex Staley and Terry Jaymes. The New York Post also crowed about the twins being “legal”.More recently, in 2018, a radio host called Patrick Connor called Olympic athlete Chloe Kim, then just 17 years old, a “little hot piece of ass”. Conner then referenced Wooderson, a character in the film Dazed and Confused who pursues high school girls. “Her 18th birthday is 23 April, and the countdown is on baby, ’cause I got my Wooderson going,” said Connor. “‘That’s what I like about them high school girls.’” In a sign that some progress has made when it comes to mainstream misogyny, Connor was forced to apologize for the remark and fired.Since we live in litigious times I would like to reiterate, once again, that while some people (not me!) have accused Fox News of being creepy about Kai, I’m sure they meant nothing sinister by their post. After all, unlike depraved liberals, the Maga crowd are an extremely wholesome bunch who live and die for family values.I will concede, however, that it is sometimes hard to wrap one’s head around the Maga definition of “family values”. The president, for example, is alegally defined sexual predatorwho has also been accused, by Miles Taylor, a staffer in Trump’s first administration, of sexualizing his oldest daughter Ivanka.In a bookpublished in 2023, Taylor writes: “[Trump] said he talked about Ivanka Trump’s breasts, her backside, and what it might be like to have sex with her, remarks that once led [former chief of staff] John Kelly to remind the president that Ivanka was his daughter.”Why is Trump so fixated on toys for little girls? | Moira DoneganRead moreFormer Fox News star Tucker Carlson also seems to have a strange definition of family values. I’m sorry to remind you of this if you’ve wiped it from your memory but last year Carlson made an extraordinary (even by Maga standards) speech at a Trump rally in which he likened the now president to an angry fatherspanking his daughter.“I’m not going to lie. It’s going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me,” Carlson said. “And you earned this. You’re getting a vigorous spanking because you’ve been a bad girl. You’re only going to get better when you take responsibility for what you did. It has to be this way.’” The crowd then erupted into chants of “Daddy Don”!Maga also seems to adopt different values, depending on what sort of family they’re looking at. Conservative influencers were vileabout Ella Emhoff, Kamala Harris’s stepdaughter, when Harris was running for president. Newsweek senior editor Josh Hammer wrote: “Doug Emhoff’s daughter is like something out of a horror film,” for example. Podcast hostBenny Johnsonalso called Emhoff and her father “creepy” for having their arms around each other in a video. The right seems eager to scrutinize the family of politicians when they don’t agree with their politics. Theywent on the warpath,however, when a former NBCUniversal executive joked about Barron being “fair game” (meaning that it was OK for the press to criticize him) when he turned 18.Anyway, happy birthday to Kai Trump. At 18 she is still very young – but it would seem like it’s the Maga adults who have the real growing up to do.Explore more on these topicsRepublicansOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsFox NewsWomencommentShareReuse this content"

Israel’s ultra-right could want nothing moreThu 15 May 2025 10.20 EDTShareAs Donald Trump hops from one Gulf capital to another, signs someeye-catching deals, meets thenew Syrian presidentand even supposedly makes progress on theIran nuclear issue, it looks like the war in Gaza has been pushed on to the sidelines of US diplomacy. While there were negotiations involving the Americans this week in Qatar over therelease of hostages, Israel also saw fit to conduct a devastating assassination attempt on Hamas’s leader, Mohammed Sinwar, followed by intensive airstrikes across the strip. While Sinwar’s fate has not yet been confirmed, it is telling that this all took place while the US president was in the region: it reveals how unserious the Israeli government is about ending the war.The truth is that if the war is resumed in earnest, it will be unsurprising because, earlier this month, the Israeli security cabinet unanimously approved a plan toexpand its military offensive in the Gaza Strip(with the caveat of waiting until the US president’s Middle East trip was over). The new Israeli military plan, agreed under immense pressure by the most extreme rightwing members of the coalition, goes beyond “defeating Hamas” and expresses little interest in the fate of the remaining hostages. Instead, it aims toindefinitely occupy the entire territory.While Netanyahu tries to sugarcoat the true intentions of the next phase of the war with security reasoning and false humanitarian arguments that Gaza’s population will be moved“for its protection”, the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a rightwing messianic settler, gave the game away. Smotrich suggested that within half a year, the population of Gaza would be confined to just a narrow swath of land, with the remainder of the territory“totally destroyed”; as a result, they will be “looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places”. In other words, the plan is forced displacement.In the past when these political elements were on the margins of Israeli society and politics, calls of this nature, which amount to war crimes, could be dismissed as no more than far-right demagoguery. This is no longer the case when those who represent these abhorrent ideas occupy key positions in the cabinet. Worse, the Israeli prime minister is totally dependent on them to remain in power until the next election – and thereby also enable him to do his best to derail his corruption trial, especially as it is reaching the enormously unpleasant stage where he will be cross-examined by the prosecution.Netanyahu is giving the ultra-right what they want because he can’t afford a fresh general election (which most Israelis crave), let alone the prospect of an independent commission of inquiry into the colossal failure to avert the 7 October Hamas massacre. More than two-thirds of Israelisprioritise securing a deal with Hamasthat would see the return of the hostages over continuing the war, while opinion polls suggest that should a general election be held today the coalition parties would be sent to the opposition benches. Hence, he feels compelled to stick with the coalition he has, and cave into their demands, destructive and criminal as they are.View image in fullscreenPalestinians inspect the rubble of a family’s home destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in Khan Younis, 15 May 2025.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APThe price of Netanyahu’s desperation to hold on to power at any cost is paid first and foremost by the Palestinians. But it is also being paid by his own people. Israel has already been blocking the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza for weeks, and aid organisations are constantly warning of starvation, lack of medical help, especially as hospitals are being bombed, and diminishing access to clean water and sanitation. The former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert described the situation this week as “totally intolerable, unacceptable, unbearable and unforgivable. It should be stopped right away.”It is for the international community to rise to the challenge of ensuring that Israel will not translate the recent cabinet’s decision to expand the war into a new reality. The Israel Defense Forces have already mobilised tens of thousands of soldiers prepared to enter into a devastated Gaza, with its traumatised population. If the international community won’t make use of its levers of influence to prevent the return of a full-scale war – and if Trump decides not to flex his muscles, as he did on the eve of his inauguration – it will be complicit in further bloodshed, displacement and dispossession of the Palestinians in Gaza. Possibly on an even worse scale than before.Yossi Mekelberg is professor of international relations and associate fellow of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham HouseExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

We have collectively taught thousands of classes on human rights law, international law and government repression. We have defended death row prisoners in Malawi, documented forced labor in Brazil, helped women seeking gender equality in Burma, chronicled the struggle of the Sahrawi people for self-determination in Western Sahara, and advocated on behalf of families of disappeared immigrants in the United States. As human rights defenders, our job is to expose government abuses of power where we find them. And that includes Israel.It has never been easy for scholars in the United States to publicly criticize Israel. Now, anyone who does so risks professional suicide. TheTrump administrationdeliberately conflates criticism of the government of Israel with antisemitism and has pressured universities to discipline students and fire faculty who express concern over the slaughter of Palestinians. This has chilled speech on our campuses and is a direct assault on academic freedom. It is also an attempt to stamp out all opposition to US foreign policy with respect to Israel.Israel has now killed more than52,000 Palestiniansin itsattack on Gaza, an estimated15,000 of whom are children. In 2024, we co-authored areportconcluding that Israel’s actions met the international definition of genocide. On Thursday, we issued a second report finding that Israel has also engaged in acts of apartheid against the Palestinian population.While most people associate apartheid with South Africa, thedefinition of apartheid– considered a crime against humanity – encompasses inhuman acts of racial subjugation and systematic oppression anywhere in the world. We concluded that Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, which includes masskilling,arbitrary detention,torture, and the imposition of a legal regime that providesfar less due processthan that provided to Israelis living in the same territory,meets the legal thresholdof apartheid as defined by the 1973 United Nations International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid.Israel is annihilating Palestinian children. Amer Rabea was one of them | Ahmad IbsaisRead moreWe are not the first to reach this conclusion. Last year, theinternational court of justicedetermined that Israel is violating the international prohibition on racial segregation and apartheid, whileAmnesty International,Human Rights Watch, and Israel’s leading human rights organization,B’Tselem, have each independently found Israel’s laws and policies meet the legal definition of apartheid. Our report details the findings of these groups as well as the dozens of others that indicate there is global consensus that Israel is responsible for this crime against humanity. Additionally, we highlight the obligations of the international community, the Trump administration, and universities, including the ones where we are based, not to bolster Israel’s illegal actions.The significance of Israel’s apartheid has been overshadowed by its genocidal assault on Gaza. But the two are inextricably linked. The same racial hatred fuels apartheid as much as it does genocide. When Benjamin Netanyahucharacterizesthe war on Gaza as a “struggle between the children of light and the children of darkness, between humanity and the law of the jungle”, the Israeli prime minister is playing to age-old racist tropes. When the then defense minister, Yoav Gallant,callsPalestinians “human animals”, he is dehumanizing them to desensitize us.We recognize that our reports will invite criticism and debate. We welcome it. Universities in general, and law schools in particular, have always encouraged critical engagement as a way of testing the validity of ideas. But if the Trump administration has its way, this topic will be off limits entirely.By publishing this op-ed, we expose ourselves to harassment and risk losing our jobs.

After spending an entire campaign cycle naming Trump as an existential threat to our democracy and rule of law – which he is – the party’s leadership has folded at the first chance to wield the power they have, revealing hypocrisy and cowardice.Chuck Schumer surrendered the entire federal budget and Marco Rubio, who is now championing the administration’s campaign of disappearing immigrants,was confirmed unanimouslyto Trump’s cabinet by the US Senate.Every choice Democratic leadership has made to sacrifice its base and become more like the bad guys we were supposed to be fighting has led us here. And now, people are losing faith in Democrats’ ability to solve our country’s biggest problems –the party is polling at a historic low.Americans have long been ready for the political revolution Bernie Sanders has talked about, but the party and the DC elite haven’t been. Aside from the many polls that highlight the national popularity of Sanders and the policies he supports over the last eight years, voters have made itabundantly clearthat it’s time to usher in a new generation of leaders who won’t act like doormats for Trump and Elon Musk. They see this party – just like our government and our economy – as captured by the wealthy few.Waiting for 2028 is not the answer – no president alone can provide the change we need. Massive transformation in this country has never happened without a Congress willing to act – from FDR’s New Deal to the Civil Rights Movement. As the 2026 midterm elections approach, we have an opportunity to take action.When I first started at JusticeDemocratsin 2017 under Trump’s first presidency, we had a vision as big as a presidential-sized campaign. What if we ran a 50-state campaign to run people in Democratic primaries and take back Congress? Though we haven’t been successful in every race, over the last four cycles, Justice Democrats has been a part of unseating five 15+ year incumbents who collectively served 108 years in office, we have beaten the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) and corporate Democrats in open seats, and we have gone up against hundreds of millions of dollars of opposition spending.Our mission since the beginning has been simple and focused: to build a mission-driven team of working-class leaders in Congress who champion solutions as big as the problems we face. We have recruited and elected leaders like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Summer Lee and more over the years.Our work towards this mission has not been perfect, and there has been so much we have learned along the way from the thousands of volunteers, organizers, staff, leaders, donors and allies we have met along the way. But together we have built a powerful bench of progressives in Congress who are the most politically courageous and working-class people to ever walk the halls of one of the most powerful bodies in the world.We know it’s not 2017 any more and the forces we are up against – in the White House and the billions spent to influence our media, our elections, our politicians – are even greater than they once were. It still probably sounds far-fetched to clean up the House and Senate – replace every bought-and-paid-for Democrat and Republican we have in Congress. But we believe it is our collective duty to try.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

She offers the sage life advice to “say yes to every opportunity because you never know what it will lead to. Have a positive mental attitude and have everything in moderation.” When she was born in 1909, the average life expectancy of a British female was 52 years – becoming a centenarian was a remote prospect.Today, according to the United Nations, centenarians are the fastest growing age group. By 1950, there were an estimated 14,000 whilst today there are nearly 750,000, projected to reach nearly 4 million by 2054. Medical advances, increases in the standard of living and improvements in public health have transformed the human condition. The American Academy of Actuaries estimates that one in six Americans born today will live to be 100. That is about the same as in the UK, where the Office for National Statistics suggests that the majority of babies can expect to live into their early 90s.Does the prospect of living that long excite you, or is it a source of dread? Do you look forward to decades of extra time or does living to 100 sound more like a threat? Plainly, there are reasons why we worry about living for so long. What’s the point of living beyond 80 if your savings have run out, the care homes are full, and you end up feeling lonely, bored and irrelevant?For most of human history, such fears were irrelevant. Only a minority could expect to become old. Now, with global life expectancy exceeding 70 years, it is a majority. Just as we debate adapting and adjusting to AI and the climate crisis, we need similar conversations regarding our newly extended length of life. Having got the majority to live to be old, we now have to focus on changing how we age to make life not just longer but healthier, productive and engaged for longer. Few things are as important for us individually and collectively.Today, there is too large a gap between average lifespan and healthspan. The number of years we are likely to live has increased more than the number of years we are likely to remain healthy. Reducing this gap is critical for seizing the advantages of longer lives.The good news is that there is much you can do. About 80% of how we age is driven by our behaviours and environment. It may sound tiresomely familiar, but there’s no substitute for eating and sleeping well, exercising more and following your doctor’s advice. While that advice is being given a scientific upgrade, what has really changed is your incentive to follow it now you can expect to become old.Do we ever stop feeling anxious, angry or sad about relationships? Not if my older friends are any guide | Emma BeddingtonRead moreLuckily though, we don’t have to rely solely on self-discipline.Ageingwell is becoming an industry, and we can expect support from technological and scientific progress and shifts in government policy. Currently it is the extreme longevity-inspired lifestyles of billionaires that grab the headlines, along with a long wake of over-promoted but under-tested supplements and treatments. But your own future is more likely to be impacted by broad-based shifts in our health system.Currently these systems focus on intervening when a disease becomes so noticeable that it adversely affects your health. When it comes to ageing-related illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or dementia, that is a recipe for keeping us alive but not necessarily healthier for longer.Instead, the focus needs to be on exploiting the potential of modern prevention techniques, utilising the power of AI and big data. Whether it’s tracking your genetics to identify the diseases you are most at risk from; monitoring changes in your body’s biomarkers for early signs of disease; or accelerating drug innovation and repurposing, future innovations await.Another stride forward will arise with further progress in understanding the biology of ageing – the processes that slowly diminish the physical components of our bodies. The prize is huge because slowing these down would substantially reduce the gap between healthspan and lifespan.The mere notion of treatments that could delay ageing-related diseases is revealing of how humanity is entering a radical new era. We tend to think of ageing as “natural” and immutable, but that reflects our relatively recent progress in reducing the threat from diseases such as smallpox, cholera, tuberculosis and plague. For most of history, these diseases were considered “natural” and were the main reason so few lived into old age. That explains why, in the 17th century, Montaigne considered dying of old age a “rare death” and “less natural than the others”. Now that the main cause of death and illness is ageing-related diseases, scientific attention is turning to tackle this next frontier.The result is increasing resources invested in “geroscience”. Throughout history, there have always been those who claim to have discovered the secret of youth, but slowly the topic is being drawn into the mainstream scientific community. Progress is also being made in the lab such that manipulating the age of cells and extending the lives of an increasing range of animals is now routine.But there is another problem we have to tackle – how to pay for those extra years?None of this implies you’ll be popping magic anti-ageing pills anytime soon, and it certainly doesn’t mean you can start dreaming of immortality. What it does mean, though, is that the younger you are, the more likely it is that you will benefit from treatments that help you age better. Exactly how far that takes us will depend upon the relative strength of human ingenuity and human biology, but it opens up a future which changes in fundamental ways what a human life looks like.But there is another problem we have to tackle – how to pay for those extra years? If more of us live until 100, state pensions in their current form will collapse. Absent an AI-induced surge in productivity, living longer requires working longer if we are to maintain our standard of living. That is why governments worldwide are increasing retirement age. Once more we are back to the unpalatable consequences of living for longer.But seizing the advantages of a longer life needs more profound adaptation than simply raising the retirement age. We need changes that help us work for longer, not just force us to do so.We need to create a new, more flexible structure of work and leisure. Career shifts and transitions will need to become more frequent as we change jobs and occupations to prolong our working life, take time out to reskill or improve our health, care for family, and shift between full-time, part-time or no-time work.What do young people really think about us oldies? I asked a few | Adrian ChilesRead moreThis restructuring of the life course reveals that the true benefit of longer lives is more time and being able to structure the life course differently. We tend to think of longer lives as bringing time at the end of life, but the healthier we make those additional years, the more time we have over our whole lives. The 20th century saw growing life expectancy leading to more years of leisure after retirement. The longer careers of the 21st century will be about taking more of that leisure this side of retirement.This leads us to perhaps the hardest change of all: seeing a longer life as an opportunity and overcoming deeply engrained ageist assumptions. Currently, we underestimate the capacity of older people and the promise of our own later years.David Bowie, a man who knew a thing or two about transitions, described ageing as “an extraordinary process whereby you become the person you always should have been”. If we can make life not just longer, but healthier, productive and engaged for longer, what’s not to like?For most of human history, only a minority of the young and middle-aged became old. The result is that we underinvest in our later years and fail to provide the required support that a long healthy, productive and engaged life requires. Given how many of us alive can expect to become 80, have a shot at 90, and might even make it to 100, that is a problem which demands change.There is much to be done. The malleability of ageing shows up dramatically in growing health inequality. Changing how we age requires major shifts in social norms and institutions. But that is the thing about long lives: they witness much change. When Ethel Caterham was born, compulsory schooling finished at age 12, the concepts of teenagers and a mid-life crisis didn’t exist, women didn’t have the vote, and the United Kingdom had only just introduced a state pension age and the first vaccine against TB. The years ahead will see equally substantive shifts in how we live as we respond to longevity. Caterham didn’t expect to live to 100 and her life advice is insightful. But the centenarians of tomorrow have to invest more in preparing for that future and go beyond just thinking positively.

Not so, says Kim Leadbeater and her campaigners. Some so-called switchers who abstained last time were always known as opponents. MPs who gave her bill a 55 majority on the first vote are standing firm, she says, as the debate returns to parliament on Friday.It’s a well worn tactic to pretend the tide is moving your way to sway any nervous MPs in wobbly seats. They should note the hefty majority of voters supporting the right to die for decades. British social attitudes firstpolled in 1983found 77% of people in favour, a number that has been solid ever since. Keir Starmer’sreiterated supporttoday may stiffen some of his MPs’ sinews.The religious lobby, powerful, well financed and secretive, puts up every objection except its main one: only God decides the time of our entrances and exits. But that doesn’t swing the public in an atheistic country where 53% of peoplehave no religion, believing in neither God nor life after death. Out of step with the changing views of the country, there are 26 bishops fighting for God when the bill is in the Lords.MPs need to turn up tomorrow instead of their usual return to constituencies on Fridays: staying to vote on a private member’s bill with no party whip requires devotion to the cause. They should think on this: what they do in parliament will mostly be forgotten, gone with the wind, but this fundamental freedom will be a lasting legacy. In the great reforming government of Harold Wilson, most MPs were preoccupied with balance of payments and devaluation crises, and theprices and incomes board’s struggles with inflation. Great liberalising monuments of that era were side-issue private members’ bills to many MPs then, though capital punishment and theatre censorship abolished, abortion legalised, and race, homosexuality and divorce laws reformed, made history. Blair’s government left civil partnerships and a ban on public smoking. (Same-sex marriage as an add-on from the Conservatives.) Another totem for current MPs will be decriminalising abortion, following a shocking increase in women prosecuted for self-administered abortions: the jury refused to convictNicola Packerlast week, after a brutally exposing case.This parliament looks ready to make assisted dying a good legacy: goodness knows it needs one.Scotland, Jersey and the Isle of Man all voted for it. The Royal College of GPs just voted by 61% to abandon its opposition and become neutral. (The BBC’s unofficial GP surveyshowed a splitwithin the profession.) The Royal College of Psychiatrists lobs innine last-minute objections, including one that frankly questions its rationality, warning “terminal illness is a risk factor for suicide”. Well, yes! That’s what it’s about! Its membership survey wasevenly split.Some 120 amendments are put up. Leadbeater has replaced the need for a judge’s signature with a stricter panel of experts, including a lawyer, social worker and psychiatrist, after two independent doctors attest a patient is sane and within six months of death, with 14 days to reconsider. Meg Hillier, always an anti, wants doctors gagged from mentioning assisted dying, creating a legal minefield to deter doctors from offering help. The amendment has been opposed by the BMA. My own mother, dying painfully of cancer despite the best palliative care, said wryly to her GP: “Where’s Harold Shipman when you want him?” He laughed kindly, but could do nothing more to ease her death, his every ampule counted: doctors fear being reported.The most unfair argument is the “slippery slope towards death on demand” that Shabana Mahmood warns against, though this bill has tougher safeguards than any of the jurisdictions allowing assisted dying: rules can’t “slide” without another act of parliament. Palliative care organisations, traditionally dominated by the religious, claim their services always prevent suffering: not so, as they must know. Right-to-die laws have catalysed better palliative care elsewhere, and following the assisted dying debate the governmentincreased fundingfor hospices.At political extremes,Diane Abbott and Edward Leigh writethat “the only adequate safeguard is to keep the current law unchanged”. But where are the safeguards against extreme suffering in death?Take the radically different experiences of death from motor neurone disease (MND) in two families I spoke to. Karen’s husband was a very fit postman in Devon when diagnosed. “We knew what was coming and he didn’t want to reach the stage of [rugby star]Rob Burrow, being carried about. He asked my permission to kill himself if it got too bad. I didn’t want that, but I understood.” He had reached the point where he couldn’t feed or bath himself when one evening he plunged headlong downstairs and died within days. She knows this was deliberate: “He had searched for ways to die.” But it was a terrible, painful death, utterly shocking for her and the family.Contrast that with Claire, whose 76-year-old brother in Australia also had MND, knowing his inevitable horrible end. Australia’s right-to-die law freed him to tell his family when to fly out from England, as he put everything in good order, arranged his funeral and wrote letters. By then he couldn’t speak. “It was a very good death,” Claire says, calm and peaceful, as she and her sister held his hand as the doctor gave him pentobarbital to swallow. That doctor gave evidence in the Commons about how well Australian law works.Denying everyone’s right to escape a torturing death is not the “safe” option. TheInescapable Truth, a report written by palliative care clinicians, reports, “Some will retch at the stench of their own body rotting. Some will vomit their own faeces. Some will suffocate, slowly, inexorably, over several days.” On any day their figures show an average of 17 people are dying these bad deaths: it could be you or me.Set these certain deaths, happening somewhere today, against the faint risk someone may choose to shorten their last few months of life to avoid being a burden on family or on the NHS. To me, these are perfectly good reasons. Many don’t want to leave families with miserable memories of their last months of suffering. But what I think or you think is beside the point. Everyone has an absolute right over their own body and its fate.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

White papers in future will have the tang of JB Priestley and farm subsidies the fizz of Jilly Cooper.Yes Minister’s Sir Humphrey Appleby will be a Master of Foxhounds. Like all Sir Keir Starmer’s actions just now, it should be worth a few votes.First, there is nothing new in the plan. Every government makes these token gestures of bureaucratic dispersal. Starmer is merely scaling back Rishi Sunak’s plan as chancellor in 2020, when he proposedmoving 22,000 civil servantsout of London by 2030. He even proposed that400 of his own Treasury staffwould move to Darlington, where a “hub” would be built to console them. They were parodied as exiles to some distant corner of empire, wondering what they had done wrong.There was no rhyme or reason to Darlington. It was hardly a hotbed of public finance innovation. The town just happened to be adjacent to the chancellor’s Yorkshire constituency. The new “Treasury hub” has just been given planning permission in the town and Darlington’s central market is being tipped as a good place for the exiles to lunch.The Blair andCamerongovernments also moved thousands of civil servants out of London, chiefly to outposts in Manchester and Birmingham. Big cities at least have some suitable academic and professional infrastructure. But gesture locations seldom work. The 1980s siting of an HMRC office in the new town of Cumbernauld, its biggest anywhere,ended in 2022with its closure and move to Glasgow. When the Blair government in 2006 moved the Office for National Statistics to Gwent, where schoolchildren have to learn Welsh,90% of the staff refused to relocate.The reality is that80% of British civil servantsare already based outside London – which seems not unreasonable – while the numbers in the capital continue to grow. The biggest peacetime boost to bureaucracy was Brexit. Boris Johnson’s hard Brexit has reportedly needed almost as many extra regulators –30,000– as are needed to administer the entire EU in Brussels.Where they work does not really matter. Moving civil servants around the country will do nothing to address the centralisation of democracy that is being entrenched by Labour’s plans.The fact is that capital cities are centres of power and power breeds bureaucracy. No one can guess how many officials will be needed to runAngela Rayner’s employment lawsand rental housing regulations. It must be thousands.Then last December, Raynerpublished a white paperon devolution that offered a clue. It saw its early manifestation in this month’s so-called metro mayoral elections. Introducing the new mayors, Rayner implied she was devolving power from the centre. She was not. Local councils may be close to fiscal destitutionif not bankruptcy. Rayner was not addressing any of that. She was introducing what is clearly an extension of the Treasury’s favourite form of local government. It is called central government.Metro mayors were invented by the Cameron government as regional governors to “coordinate” the ambitions of local cities and counties, chiefly concerned with transport and business development. They run no local servicesand answer to no elected assembly, but merely chair meetings of subordinate council leaders. Their election reflects no local affection or loyalty, as mayors should do. They are identified, George Orwell style, by compass points, such as West England, East Midlands, the North East. When such regional government was offered to the north-east by Blair’s John Prescott in 2000, it wasoverwhelmingly rejectedin a referendum.Rayner wisely did not care for a referendum this time. She did not even have the nerve to call the mayors governors – the normal name for the ruler of a region. The metro mayors seem likely to go the way of elections toNHS foundation trustsand police commissioners, relics of Westminster’s pretend local democracy.Starmer and Rayner regard elected local councils as in effect agencies of Whitehall. This applies to everything from taxation powers to school curriculums to pothole repairs. The final centralisation is the proposedremoval of planning controlover rural development, housing supply and high street protection. Such powers have long been crucial in giving local people a degree of control over the future of their communities. This must be a central right of local democracy.View image in fullscreenThe deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan and the mayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin, pose for a selfie with regional mayors in Leeds.Photograph: Phil Noble/PARayner’s new regions are clear agencies of this centralisation. They will have no taxation powers but will depend on her and function as her local arm. They may be able to overrule or “call in” subordinate council decisions. Most significantly, they are to be staffed through a “secondment scheme” with central government. They will be allocated central civil servants “in strategic authority officer roles including senior positions”. Rayner says the mayors are to be “hardwired into the way government works”. The link to Starmer decentralising Whitehall could hardly be more blatant. He is “recentralising” local government.It really does not matter where civil servants work. It matters who they are working for and to whom they are accountable. The United Kingdom is widely regarded as having themost centralised governmentof any western democracy, a fact not conducive to efficient administration. It is hardly a secret that the present Whitehall is dysfunctional.Starmer disagrees. He is curbing any lingering relics of British local democracy in a flurry of cliches about growth, enterprise and nimbyism. He has set up a new framework of Whitehall control to secure the precise opposite of devolution. Goodness only knows how many more civil servants that will require.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We flew in as the sun set, and by the time I left the small tin shed airport with the keys to the hire car, it was pitch black. I threw my bags on to the back seat and turned on my phone, discovering that my carrier didn’t work in far north Queensland. There was no GPS in the car, no street directory tucked under the seat, and the other arrivals had already fled the bush airport and disappeared into the night.I gulped down the fear that was growing in my stomach as I realised that I had absolutely no idea where I was going, and no bars of reception to tell me. I turned the key in the ignition and drove the dusty road until I reached what I assumed was the highway.I had two options. Left or right. I turned left and tried to slow my breathing. There were no streetlights. Just the glow of the moon. I opened the window and immediately closed it again. And I kept driving, hoping to find a street sign that would tell me where to go.Forget Swedish death cleaning, letting go is hard – even when it’s just a jacket | Nova WeetmanRead moreTen or so minutes later, I reached the town of Weipa, which was smaller than I’d expected. I took every sidestreet until I finally found the pub where I was staying. Checking in, the woman at the front counter told me not to walk too far down the back of the property because of crocodiles and then explained the phones weren’t working in the rooms and the wifi was patchy at best. I told her I had no mobile reception at all. It meant I couldn’t text my family to let them know I’d arrived.As I lay in bed that night, with a creaky fan moving the soupy air around, I realised how long it had been since I’d felt so free. I had an accidental adventure, one I hadn’t planned on, one I hadn’t even understood I needed. And it made me remember what it was to be uncontactable, where I could make choices and take risks and be unwatched.When I was younger, I lived without constantly calculating risk and without the endless loop of danger scenarios running through my head. Those fears took up residence around the time I was heavily pregnant with my first child. The scenarios were fuelled by thinking, what if I wasn’t enough as a mother, or what if something happened to me or my baby, and slowly morphed into a set of more generalised concerns, ranging from car accidents to plane crashes, serial killers to illnesses. Obviously, these weren’t always rational, but they did sometimes wake me up in the middle of the night or even stop me finding sleep at all. When my partner died in 2020, the what-ifs amplified in volume, and I found them debilitating at times.As a single parent to two children, I felt the risks I could take were limited. I had to be around for them, so I couldn’t just jump on a plane and take off on an unplanned adventure. But having nursed my partner through the final stages of cancer, I didn’t want to feel scared any more. I wanted to feel brave and connected to the world. I wanted to feel connected to myself, and I wanted a jolt of life to shock me back from where I’d been operating as a carer. Prompted by the vows at a friend’s wedding where they agreed to haveno nos, and instead do the things they each wanted to do, I decided that instead of saying no to invitations that sparked fear and a what-if response, I’d dive in and say yes – simply because I was asked.In the past year, I’ve agreed to many fear-inducing events –becausethey are fear-inducing. I’ve presented on stage to thousands of students at a writers’ festival and lived to tell the tale. I’ve gone to parties alone when I’ve known virtually no one and managed to talk to more than one stranger. I’ve been interviewed on ice-skates when I could barely let go of the side and grinned like a fool as I attempted to skate.It’s not that I was particularly eager to do any of these things, it’s that surviving them, by being scared, embarrassed or even just nervous, I feel present, like I’m still here.Taking risks is often thought of as a young person’s game. A sort of rite of passage period between the teen years and adulthood. But there is much to be said for diving into the uncomfortable as we age. And of course, on the days I don’t feel up to strapping on ice-skates, I temper all of this activity by lying in bed and watching movies, safe in my pyjamas with my cat curled on my lap.Nova Weetman is an award-winning children’s author.

Luckily, there is a strong one to makeThu 15 May 2025 06.11 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 12.05 EDTShareHope springs eternal among those who have long opposed low-traffic-neighbourhood (LTN) anti-pollution schemes after last week’s high court ruling that Lambeth council in south London hadacted unlawfullyin ignoring local objections to its latest scheme. “Low traffic neighbourhoods could be scrapped as campaigners score high court victory – ‘sends a clear signal’”,was the line on GB News. “Low-traffic neighbourhoods could be axed,”said the Express.But here’s the news: they won’t and it didn’t. Furthermore, to use this specific case to throw out LTNs would be a backwards step for public health, the economy and the climate. So what should happen next? Councils should hold their nerve and trust the data, which shows that LTNs are worth doing, and worth doing well.Whatever side of the fence you’re on, it’s important to look at the wider body of evidence. And the evidence shows LTNscut traffic,clean the airand enable more walkingand cycling. Crucially, despite the tone of the debates you might be hearing, LTNs are effectiveand popular, and they become more popular over time. The evidence also shows that some councils could do more to have meaningful dialogue with residents, especially those who face thebiggest barriers to their mobility.Perhaps the biggest criticism of LTNs is that they cause additional chaos and pollution by pushing traffic elsewhere, but this is not what the data shows. The picture derived from studies of actual LTNs in London and around the country is much more nuanced: sometimes traffic in the wider area falls, sometimes it rises, and sometimes it stays the same. Rishi Sunak’s own review of LTNs – conducted at the height of hysteria around the so-called war on the motorist – concluded that effects on boundary roads, whether positive or negative,were minimal.In my experience, the substance of the backlash against LTNs is often not so much about the LTN itself, but a reaction against unreliable or nonexistent buses, high fares, poor accessibility or overcrowded roads – all of which need fixing, and none of which would be solved by scrapping LTNs. Priority bus lanes, wider pavements, clean air zones, 20mph limits, cycle lanes and phasing out diesel – as well as meaningful engagement with residents – could all help address these concerns, stop traffic or pollution from rising, and give people more choice in how they get around.When a new LTN comes in, it’s easy to point to it and call it the root cause of congestion, but congestion is nothing new.Londonhas been the most congested city in Europe for years. As obvious as it sounds, the root cause of congestion is that there are simply too many cars on the road.It’s worth revisiting why modernising our transport network is so important, and why LTNs can help. Air pollution contributes tothousands of premature deaths in our capital each yearand aggravates numerous health conditions,with driving being the single biggest cause. The climate crisis demands at leasta 20% reduction in traffic, with people across the political spectrum supporting urgent action. Meanwhile, fewer than 40% of Londoners are walking or cyclingfor 20 minutes or more each day.Roughly five peopledie on UK roads every single day, but this fact rarely makes the news. More than 20,000 people areinjured on London’s roads each year, causing untold emotional and physical trauma, and adding to pressures on the NHS and emergency services. The climate charity I work for, Possible,recently estimatedthat these collisions cost London £1.2bn annually. And with cars getting bigger and heavier, and SUVs becoming the norm,the danger to people walking and cycling grows.Indeed, cutting traffic is extremely popular. Pretty much everyone agrees there should be less traffic – not least to make life easier for those who rely on a vehicle. The evidence suggests that LTNs are a relatively quick and affordable way to do it.Opposing LTNs doesn't make you a 'culture war' petrol-head. Just look at what happened in Lambeth | Joseph HarkerRead moreAt the heart of all this is a simple fact: the only way to cut traffic – something we all agree would be a good thing – is for some of us to drive a bit less. There is no other magic solution. The myths of freedom for the motorist – painted vividly in advertisements that showLand Rovers cruising through completely empty city centres– must make room for the real-life and realisable freedom of kids to breathe cleaner air in their playgrounds, people to walk and cycle with less risk, and for all of us to get to where we need to go without being stuck in congestion.Low-traffic neighbourhoods are often framed as inhibiting our ability to get around. But for many of us, they make getting around more possible and desirable – making space for community, for walking, for cycling. No tool or policy is perfect: there are always lessons to learn. But that can’t be an excuse for giving up and doing nothing.The status quo isn’t working, and in the bigger picture, the evidence base for the effectiveness and popularity of low-traffic neighbourhoods continues to grow. One court case won’t put the brakes on that.Izzy Romilly is sustainable transport campaign manager at climate charity PossibleExplore more on these topicsLow-traffic neighbourhoodsOpinionRoad transportRoad safetyLondonEnglandTransportTransport policycommentShareReuse this content"

This could be Starmer’s most damaging mistake yetThu 15 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 07.13 EDTShareThe precedent is uncanny, and the failure to learn from it downright mystifying. Keir Starmer is rushing gladly towards the catastrophe Boris Johnson inflicted on himself in 2020. Had he set out to stymie Labour’s chances of re-election, he couldn’t be doing it better.In 2020,Johnson promised“a whole new planning system” for England, which, he claimed, would promote “economic growth”. He said he wanted to see 300,000 new homes built every year. He sought to “build, build, build”, butfalsely claimedthat his plans werethwarted by newts, which he used as shorthand for environmental protections. He would sweep these protections away.At first, the response was muted. Those of us who sought to explain the problems with his proposals were ignored or dismissed. But we could sense a slow wave of fury gathering, as people began to realise that what remained of our green and pleasant land would be handed on a platter to ruthless corporations.In June 2021, in a byelection in the most Tory of Tory constituencies, Chesham and Amersham, the Conservatives suffered a massiveelectoral shock, losing to the Lib Dems. A large part of the reason, asTory MPs conceded, was anger over Johnson’s proposed assault on the planning system.In parliament the following week, the then shadow environment secretary, Steve Reed,argued thatthe unpopularity of the Tory proposals “is not because voters are nimbys, as ministers rather offensively like to brand them, but because residents rightly want and deserve a say over how their own neighbourhoods are developed”. Why,he asked, “would the government do something so desperately unpopular with their own voters, let alone with all the rest of voters?”The problem with getting homes built, he argued, “is not the planning process; it is developers who do not build the homes once they have consent”. While nine out of 10 planning applications are approved, “over 1.1 million homes that received consent in the past decade have still not been built”. The reason, he explained, is “land banking. That is where a developer gets approval for an application to build new homes, but instead of building, waits for land values to rise so they can sell it on without having laid a single brick.” Therewas, andremains, plenty ofevidencefor this contention.The Toriesfrantically backtracked, cancelling the proposals that had ignited public rage. But their spell had been broken – they no longer looked impregnable. Now Reed is the environment secretary, and presiding over the government’splanning and infrastructure bill, which will strip away protections for wildlife, habitats, parks and playing fields, deregulate the planning system and roll back our democratic rights. The bill, the government claims, will promote economic growth and enable 300,000 new homes to be built every year.View image in fullscreenThe environment secretary, Steve Reed, at Thames Rowing Club in Putney, London, 5 September 2024.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAKeir Starmer says he wants to “build, baby, build”. He has justified the billby insistingthat newts and bats are impeding development, though this remains as untrue as it was when Johnson said it. The governmenthas admittedthere’s almost no evidence that nature protections are blocking development. Starmer has branded people who want a say over how their neighbourhoods are developed as “time-wasting nimbys”, “blockers” and “zealots”.When I first wrote about the bill’s threat towildlife and green places, Reed’s deputy, Mary Creagh, the minister for nature, denounced my article as “deeply misleading”. She offered no evidence.Two days after her letter was published, the government’s green watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection, issuedits own analysis, which was very similar to the case I made: the bill “would have the effect of reducing the level of environmental protection … the provisions are a regression”. This was hardly surprising: a vast range ofecologists, governmentadvisersand leadingbarristershad already come to thesame conclusion. I have asked Creagh for an apology, but have received no reply.Partly in response to my article, Reed’s department held a press conference, the purpose of which was to tell everyone they had got it wrong. The Guardian’s brilliant reporter Helena Horton asked about a provision in the bill that allows developers to trash local habitats, parks and playing fields, as long as they pay to create alternative provision somewhere else. Doesn’t this mean that people will be deprived of access to nature and green spaces, as the new provision wouldn’t even need to be in the same county? “That is not the intention of the bill,” she was told. But, she persisted, it’s theeffectof the bill? The officialadmittedthat it is. It doesn’t matter what a government’s “intentions” are: what counts is what the legislation says.Anyway, its intentions couldn’t be clearer. Starmer and Rachel Reeves say they want to “clear out”, “kick down”, “tear down” and “sweep away” planning and nature laws. The violence of the language tells us all we need to know.There’s only one problem with Labour’s immigration plans: they’re completely untethered from reality | Jonathan PortesRead moreJust as my “deeply misleading” article was going to press, the governmentannouncedan amendment to the bill, shutting down consultation on majorinfrastructure projectsat the crucial pre-application stage. This brings it even more closely into line with Johnson’s 2020 disaster.In seeking to justify the amendment, the government cited the support of alobby groupcalled Britain Remade. It turns out to be run by formerspecialadvisersto Johnson and Liz Truss, and the formerhead of researchat the Adam Smith Institute, a highly opaqueneoliberal junktank. It calls itself “an independent grassroots organisation”, which always sets off my alarm bells. Especially when it also tells us “Britain Remade is not currently able to accept grassroots funding”.I asked Britain Remade how it can call itself a “grassroots” organisation, who funds it, what its budget is, whether it has a board and who sits on it. It sent me a rambling answer addressing only one of these questions: “All of our current funders are listed online.” But its website names only two, while stating it receives “grants from a range of organisations”. I asked another three times, but have heard no more. It’s not just that similar groups swirled around Johnson. In some cases, these are the same people.The bill may make no difference to Labour’s electoral prospects, as Starmer, betraying one hope after another, simultaneously detoxifying Reform UK andtoxifying the Labour party, is likely already to have torpedoed them. But if it hasn’t happened yet, this could be the final rupture.

This is whyAndrei PopoviciuThe election of George Simion would be a troubling – but understandable – repudiation of the country’s pro-EU establishmentThu 15 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 12.22 EDTShareAt first glance, Romania’s presidential race, which comes to a head in a second round of voting this Sunday, might look like a de facto referendum on Europe. The far-right George Simion – a former football hooligan who isbanned from enteringUkraine for what Kyiv calls “systematic anti-Ukrainian activities” – surged to first place in thefirst roundlast week with 41% of the vote. Trailing him is Nicușor Dan, Bucharest’s reformist mayor, with just 21%.The race pits Dan, a technocratic pro-European candidate, against a bombastic, Maga-admiring nationalist who rails against “Brussels” and promises to put the “national interest” above international obligations.If Simion wins,Romaniarisks becoming the next illiberal outpost inside the EU, joining Hungary and Slovakia. He could use his presidential powers to stall aid to Ukraine and undermine negotiations towards a collective climate and migration policy, while sowing further distrust in EU institutions.But the truth is that “pro-Europe” and “anti-Europe” are just labels. They disguise the fact that what Romanians are really rejecting is a domestic political class that has wrapped itself in the EU flag while overseeing years of economic stagnation, corruption and broken promises. After all, nearly 90% of Romanianssupport EU and Nato alignment, according to a survey from this year.Both presidential candidates are, in their own way, anti-establishment. While Dan built his career fighting shady real-estate barons and politicians in the courts, Simion built his through televised outrage and fiery speeches that spoke to people’s frustrations with political elites.Simion is backed by Călin Georgescu, the political maverick whose surprise win in the first round of presidential elections in Decemberwas annulledby Romania’s constitutional ourt, following allegations of Russian interference. Simion has adopted a similar tone, but has stopped short of openly calling for Romania to leave the EU or Nato. Distinguishing himself from Georgescu, he has called Putin’s Russia a “threat” to Europe – though he has alsocriticised military aidto Ukraine, echoing Donald Trump’s position on the war.The Romanian diaspora accounted for about 10% of the total votes in the first round. And more than half of them backed Simion. These are Romanians who live and work in countries such as Spain, Germany, the UK and France, directly benefiting from the freedoms and economic stability provided by the EU. It is unlikely that these voters were rejecting “the west” or the EU as such, but rather a domestic political class that they blame for squandering the opportunities offered by EU membership, and the fact that they had to leave their home country in the first place.Nevertheless, the EU’s reputation is taking a battering with Simion’s ascent. This is because his targets are successive pro-European Romanian governments, dominated by the establishment parties, which promised prosperity but presided over theembezzlementof infrastructure funds, failed to modernise hospitals and delayed highway projects that Romanians had long been promised – all while EU money poured in. Romania is currently experiencing the highest level of inflation in the EU, combined with low wages and high taxes.Add to that the pandemic restrictions, widely seen as heavy-handed attempts to control personal freedoms, and the government’s alignment with EU policy on Ukraine, and apparent frustration at the bloc has deepened.Elena Calistru, a Romanian civic activist and governance expert, tells me that Simion’s is a more sophisticated approach than Georgescu’s, who was outwardly proposing exiting the EU and Nato.“Simion is seeding deep distrust in democratic institutions themselves and promoting narratives that portray Romania as a ‘second-class country’ in Europe, treated like a colony by the EU and potentially dragged into foreign conflicts,” she says.2:26Far-right Trump ally George Simion wins first round of Romanian presidential elections – videoThere’s a grain of truth in his rhetoric. Romania was kept out of the Schengen area until thebeginning of this year, and Romanian migrant workers have long facedhumiliation abroad, whether as exploited construction labourers in the Netherlands or as care workers in Italy, often working in conditions that border on modern slavery. These frustrations have fed a broader sense of grievance over what many see as double standards applied to newer EU member states.Simion’s rise, therefore, is less about policy than about national identity. His campaign slogan is “Respect”, something many Romanians, including the migrant workers in the diaspora, have been craving. “The Romania you dream of, the Romania you want to return to, we will build it together,” he said in a speech after his first-round victory.This election will mark the end of an era. Romania’s transitional period from dictatorship to democracy is over. For the first time ever, in both the cancelled December election and now the re-run, none of the establishment parties reached the second round of the presidential elections.Romanians won’t head to the polls on 18 May to decide whether they want to be in the EU, because they overwhelmingly do. What they’re really voting on is how to confront a broken system: through reform and international collaboration – or isolation and nationalism.Andrei Popoviciu is a Romanian investigative journalistExplore more on these topicsRomaniaOpinionEuropeThe far rightEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

It’s time we gave podcasts the same platformGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailWed 14 May 2025 20.02 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 03.35 EDTShareWe meet at a pub every six weeks to discuss a podcast, reflect on life and share stories – it’s like a book club, only for podcasts.Formed eight years ago by a couple of podcast-loving colleagues, PodClub quickly grew into a beautiful entanglement of friends of friends connected by shared values and a mutual love of podcasts. I joined the club a year ago, and it’s become a highlight of my social calendar.We are listening to more podcasts and reading less. Australians are some of the top podcast consumers globally, with 43% of Australians listening to podcasts monthly in 2023, more than double 2018, according toThe Infinite Dial 2023. However, the number of regular readers appears to be declining. A2019 studyfound that 92% of Australians read at least one book in the previous year. By 2021 this has fallen to 75%, according to theAustralia Reads national survey.Loveable rogue or mouthpiece for misinformation? Why Australian blokes love Joe RoganRead moreBook clubs didn’t work for many of our members because having to read to a deadline proved difficult or unenjoyable. Some struggle to finish reading books due to ADHD, health conditions or because they can’t find the time between full-time work, caring commitments and study.But you can listen to a podcast anywhere, which means they are more accessible than reading.The Infinite Dial 2023report found that at least one in two Australian podcast listeners tune to podcasts in cars or on foot. I listen to podcasts while cleaning – improving a dull task by combining it with an engaging one. Of course, audiobooks are another option, but they require more time than podcasts. At PodClub, we typically choose a contained podcast series or a selection of “best of” episodes from a series, totalling about four to five hours, compared with the 10 hours required for most audiobooks.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningBooks have been discussed and debated at book clubs for years; I think it’s time we gave podcasts the same platform.At a typical PodClub, we meet at the pub at about 6pm and, after a quick hello and a chat about food, we place our orders and send podcast-related questions to the group chat to be asked at the table throughout the night. These usually begin withDid you like the show?AndWhat did you think about the format?Then we turn to more personal queries:How would you react if this happened to you?Can you relate to these experiences?If you had to create an episode, what would you focus on?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Members decide which podcasts to listen to next at the end of each club meeting, and we diversify our listening. We’ve tried investigative journalism, fictional stories, comedy and educational podcasts. From listening to the experience of living on a simulated Mars inThe Habitat, to the debunking of wellness and weight loss myths inMaintenance Phase, our taste is broad.What makes PodClub truly special is the meaningful personal conversations and storytelling sparked by the content we listen to. Our conversation is initially about the podcast, but it often becomes personal, from delving into complicated family relationships to discussing struggles with body image.And we laugh a lot. At one PodClub, 10 of us shared a long table at a busy Adelaide pub, discussingNormal Gossip– a podcast featuring juicy, strange and funny anonymised gossip. We were in fits of laughter as we debated the viability of a vulva stamp (yes, you read that correctly, listen to episode “The Chair Saga” to join the debate). We were so loud that a member’s smart watch warned us that the decibel level was unsafe. At the end of the night, we shared our own podcast-worthy stories (and explained the commotion to enquiring pub staff).I leave these evenings feeling as if this is what life is all about – connection, storytelling and laughter. If book clubs aren’t your thing and you’re in need of a laugh and regular company, I implore you to start your very own PodClub.Nicole McKenzie is a freelance writer based in AdelaideExplore more on these topicsPodcastsOpinionFriendshipcommentShareReuse this content"

He embraces Leonardo DiCaprio, turns to the mic and lets fly: celebrating the event as a haven for art, democratic, inclusive and therefore a threat to autocrats and fascists. His speech is fiery and combative, but the adoring response leaves him shaken: he has to blink and regroup. At one point, I think, he might have even welled up. “Yeah, I got sentimental,” he admits the next morning. “How could I not be?”We’re upstairs at the Cannes Palais desFestivals, with the windows thrown open and sunlight on the walls. The hosts rush to provide him with a hot cup of coffee and then – when he leaves that untouched – swoop back to furnish him with another. His voice is still hoarse from the night before and risks being drowned out by the cheering masses outside. Tom Cruise, it transpires, has just appeared on the terrace. “Different type of actor,” De Niro says ruefully. “Mission: Impossible, that’s a franchise. But I understand that. I’ve done franchises myself.”Robert De Niro attacks Trump in Cannes speech: ‘This isn’t just America’s problem’Read moreThe man’s bulging CV bears him out. He’s been in Meet the Parents and its sequels, and Analyze This and That. You might say The Godfather Part II is part of a franchise of sorts. And yet when we think of De Niro’s key roles, we’re more likely to picture himbehind a taxi-cab wheel, orwielding a baseball batas bullish Al Capone, or bounding on stage aswheedling Rupert Pupkin. These, one assumes, are the roles that Cannes loves him for, and his relationship with the festival is now in its sixth decade. De Niro has starred in two Palme d’Or winners (1976’s Taxi Driver and 1986’s The Mission) and was last at the festival withKillers of the Flower Moontwo years ago. But he’s now made so many movies that they all start to blur. “Midnight Run,” he says vaguely. “That was a fun one to make.”Cannes, he explains, is especially important at the moment. The situation in the US is so parlous, it feels like an overseas antidote, a return to core principles. The man hatesDonald Trumpand mourns the America he once knew. He says: “We have to stop what’s going on, it’s insane. We can’t have apathy and silence. You have to speak up and risk being harassed.”View image in fullscreenDe Niro as Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyFor years he has beenone of Trump’s most vocal critics. Quite likely he risks some level of harassment himself. De Niro is a giant, rich as Midas (estimated wealth: upwards of $500m) and therefore should be well insulated. Except that Trump is vindictive and likes whipping up his supporters. So he’d be forgiven for occasionally fearing for his own safety.“Yeah, you always think about it, of course,” he says. “But I’m too old for all that. The man is a bully and you can’t let bullies win. If a bully comes for your lunch money on Monday, he’s going to ask for more on Tuesday. You have to stand up. And I wouldn’t want to look at myself if I didn’t.” He frowns. “I look at people like [secretary of state Marco] Rubio. I see him sitting by when they [Trump and JD Vance] beat up Zelenskyy, after all the times that he has defended Ukraine in the past. And I think, what the hell does he tell his kids about that? It won’t be forgotten,” he says grimly. “Historically, this will not be forgotten.”Robert De Niro: ‘I’d like to punch Donald Trump in the face’GuardianAs it happens, he and I lastspoke only recently and the interview hit the buffers. De Niro was promoting a Netflix series and journalists were forbidden from asking any “political questions”. He remembers the encounter and readily shrugs it off. But the situation is complex and requires careful handling. He understands the concerns of the big studios back home.Most people in the industry share his views, he suspects. Whether they choose to speak out is a whole other matter. “So I don’t think it’s true that the industry isn’t behind me. But they’re part of a big business. They have to worry about the wrath of Trump and make their decisions on that basis. Do I succumb or do I say no? There are some universities that have already said no. There are some legal firms that have said no. And that’s important because it inspires other people. It gives people strength and inspires them to fight.”View image in fullscreenLeonardo DiCaprio presenting De Niro with his honorary Palme d’Or.Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/ReutersThe way he sees it, this form of dogged, decent resistance predates Trump. Eventually, God willing, it might prove his undoing. “Because that’s what America is all about. Look at the westerns – it’s all right there. The bad guys come into town and take over and what does the sheriff do? He stands up. That’s in all our movies.”The honorary Palme d’Or is a rarity at the festival. It’s a lifetime achievement award in all but name; an excuse for him to sit back and take stock and bask in his own greatness. But this notion alarms and he brushes it to one side. “I still don’t see myself as great,” he scoffs. “When you go home and talk to your significant other, believe me, you’re not great.”He had wanted to act since the age of 10, he explains. Probably it’s all he ever wanted to do. He remembers going with his dad to a 42nd Street cinema to watch a Jean Cocteau movie, probably La Belle et la Bête (Beauty and the Beast, 1946), and having the sense of the world opening up all around. His dad was an artist and his mother was, too, but he needed to find his own mode of expression. So he immersed himself in his roles to the point where he became unrecognisable, flitting like a chameleon from one film to the next while keeping his true self tightly under wraps. “With every other actor, I know what they’d be like in real life,” Billy Bob Thornton once said. “But with Bob De Niro I have absolutely no idea.”View image in fullscreenWith Charles Grodin in Midnight Run.Photograph: Universal Pictures/AllstarThe cover of the Cannes daily programme shows him in the role of Taxi Driver’s Travis Bickle. It’s a blast from the past: he’s skinny, mohawked and bare-chested. The actor dutifully chuckles when I hold up the image, but it also seems to leave him just a little nonplussed. He turns 82 in August, deep into the third act of his life. He could be peering at a photo of a dead distant cousin.It’s funny getting old, De Niro says. It’s a whole new adventure and takes some getting used to. “Things change, that’s for sure. If you’re walking down a couple of stairs you get people coming to help you. I’ve realised now I’m older that people look at me a little different. But I’m old, it could be worse. I feel pretty good. I’m in control of myself physically. I hope that can last for ever.” He shrugs and half smiles. “But I know that it won’t.”Explore more on these topicsRobert De NiroCannes film festivalDonald TrumpFestivalsTaxi DriverKillers of the Flower MoonThe Godfather IIinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The Vanishing (1993)Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) obsesses over the fate of his missing girlfriend in George Sluizer’s American remake of his own 1988 Franco-Dutch psychochiller. Is it as devastating as the original? Absolutely not! But Jeff Bridges has never been creepier, and at least the dumb Hollywood ending won’t give you nightmares.19. Funny Games (2007)In case we sickos didn’t get the message in 1997, Austrian gloom-meister Michael Haneke recycles his brutally efficient home invasion diatribe shot-for-shot, but this time in English. Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet play polite young men who knock on Naomi Watts’ door and ask to borrow eggs. What happens next will harsh your vibe.18. Dinner for Schmucks (2010)Steve Carell plays Barry Speck, whose passion is building dead mice dioramas, making him the perfect stooge for a dinner party where rich scumbags mock eccentric losers. Hollywood sweetens an acidic French farce, Le Dîner de Cons (1998), and bungles its subplots, but compensations include Carell going full-on nerd and Jemaine Clement as a pretentious artist.17. Oldboy (2013)View image in fullscreenHalf-baked … Josh Brolin in Old Boy (2013).Photograph: Universal Pictures/AllstarYou can’t fault Josh Brolin’s commitment to his role as an alcoholic advertising executive trying to discover why he was held prisoner for 20 years in Spike Lee’s Americanisation of Park Chan-wook’s baroque revenge thriller. But an uneasy mix of neo-noir realism and South Korean stylisation makes it feel like a half-baked copy of the 2003 masterpiece.16. Speak No Evil (2024)Those who prefer their horror grim should stick with the 2002 Danish-Dutch original. James Watkins’ do-over, in which an American family goes to stay with the friendly Britons they met on holiday, is more conventional, but also more fun, with James McAvoy attaining peak psycho as a host testing the limits of his guests’ good manners. That damnable stuffed rabbit appears in both versions.15. The Birdcage (1996)If you must film an American version of a hit French farce, you might as well get Elaine May to write the dialogue, as Mike Nichols does here. Gay couple Armand and Albert (Robin Williams and Nathan Lane) try to pass as straight when their son’s fiancee’s parents come to dinner. Chucklesome complications include Gene Hackman, bless him, dressed in drag.14. The Grudge (2004)Takashi Shimizu directs the US remake of his own haunted house franchise, but keeps it in Tokyo, with American actors imported to play cannon fodder for Greasy-Haired Ghost and Small Boy Who Makes Mewing Noises. The story is confusing, which somehow makes the scary bits (the lift! Oh good grief, the bedclothes!) even scarier.13. Unfaithful (2002)Claude Chabrol’s La Femme Infidèle (1969) gets the Hollywood treatment from Adrian Lyne, with unexpectedly classy results. Diane Lane is wonderful as an unhappy housewife who embarks on an affair, while her husband (Richard Gere) finds murdering her lover more therapeutic than any amount of marriage counselling.12. Vanilla Sky (2001)View image in fullscreenFrom Madrid to Manhattan … Penélope Cruz and Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarTom Cruise plays a New York yuppie whose reality starts to fragment after a car crash. Writer and director Cameron Crowe transposes Alejandro Amenábar’s lower budgeted brain teaser from Madrid to Manhattan; Penélope Cruz plays the girlfriend in both versions. Crowe is no Amenábar, alas, but he does have a bigger star, and more pop music.11. Insomnia (2002)From Ripley to Ragnarok: Cate Blanchett’s 20 best film performances – ranked!Read moreChristopher Nolan’s remake of a 1997 Norwegian thriller will seem perfectly acceptable to anyone who hasn’t seen the tauter, more claustrophobic original. Al Pacino plays a Los Angeles detective summoned north to investigate a murder in Alaska, where constant daylight and lack of sleep lead to a fatal error. Robin Williams, in one of his three creepy performances that same year, plays the killer.10. Sweet Charity (1960)Bob Fosse made his screen directing debut with the film of the Broadway show based on Federico Fellini’s Nights of Cabiria (1957). Shirley MacLaine plays the ever-hopeful taxi dancer with a talent for picking the wrong guy. It flopped, but nowadays we can only gaze in awe at impeccably choreographed musical numbers such as the Rich Man’s Frug.9. True Lies (1994)James Cameron pumps testosterone and money into what began as a modest French action-comedy, La Totale! (1991). Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Harry Tasker, a superspy whose wife thinks he’s a boring salesman. Cameron distracts you from the film’s mean-spirited elements by blowing up half the Florida Keys.8. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2011)View image in fullscreenSlicker … Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.Photograph: Baldur Bragason/Sony Pictures/AllstarDavid Fincher’s adaptation of Stieg Larsson’s bestseller is slicker than its 2009 Swedish predecessor, is set to a terrific Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross score, and features fake Swedish accents from everyone except Daniel Craig and Stellan Skarsgård. What it doesn’t have is the 2009 film’s Noomi Rapace, the definitive Lisbeth Salander.7. The Departed (2006)Martin Scorsese finally won an Oscar for his remake of the cracking Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002). Leonardo DiCaprio plays a cop in deep cover with the Boston mafia, Matt Damon a mobster who has infiltrated the police. It’s a lot baggier than its prototype, and further knocked off balance by Jack Nicholson’s untrammelled scenery chewing as mob boss Frank Costello.6. Let Me In (2010)Matt Reeves does a decent job of Americanising Tomas Alfredson’s vampire masterpiece, with the Swedish housing estate replaced by Reagan-era New Mexico, where a bullied 12-year-old schoolboy befriends the mysterious girl next door. Reeves tends to spell out what might be better left implicit, but comes into his own in some added action sequences.5. The Ring (2002)View image in fullscreenNerve-racking … Samara Morgan in Gore Verbinkski’s remake of The Ring.Photograph: Dreamworks/AllstarWhile most American J-horror remakes dilute their originals, Gore Verbinski’s reworking of Hideo Nakata’s Ring (1998) whips up an entirely different but no less nerve-racking ambience, making full use of a bigger budget, Pacific Northwest locations and Naomi Watts as the journalist investigating a viral death curse spread by VHS.4. Wrath of Man (2021)Though not as lean and mean as Le Convoyeur (2004), its French progenitor, Guy Ritchie’s revenge thriller does its own thing, ties an initially simple narrative into convoluted knots, and unleashes Jason Statham on a hardboiled cast playing armoured truck guards. All this without any of the laddishness that mars some of Ritchie’s other work, making this his most satisfying film in years.3. Quick Change (1990)Bill Murray co-directs as well as stars in this nifty remake of Hold-Up (1985), a French Canadian action comedy starring Jean-Paul Belmondo. Murray is at his sardonic best as Grimm, a bankrobber disguised as a clown. The robbery is easy; the hard part is trying to get out of town with the loot. Whereas the original gets bogged down in car chases, Murray’s remake keeps it tense and funny to the end.2. Sorcerer (1977)William Friedkin said his adaptation of Georges Arnaud’s novel was not a remake, but since it had already been filmed by Henri-Georges Clouzot as The Wages of Fear (1953), let’s call it one anyway. Either way, this action-thriller about four expat losers driving dynamite-laden trucks across rugged Latin American terrain is now almost as much of a classic as its antecedent, enhanced by Tangerine Dream’s haunting score and Roy Scheider’s demonstrating the ultimate thousand-yard stare.1. The Magnificent Seven (1960)View image in fullscreenSamurai to saddle … (from second left) Yul Brynner, Horst Buchholz and Steve McQueen in The Magnificent Seven.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyAkira Kurosawa’s samurai movies were already heavily influenced by the western genre, so it wasn’t hard for Hollywood to convert Seven Samurai (1954) back into a bona fide oater. Yul Brynner plays gunslinger Chris, who persuades six mercenaries to protect a Mexican village from bandits, then spends the rest of the film trying not to get upstaged by Steve McQueen, James Coburn and an Elmer Bernstein score that makes you break out in goose pimples. One of the best remakes ever.Explore more on these topicsFilmRankedSpike LeeOldboyThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (US)The DepartedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the time, she didn’t have children of her own, and she was sure that if she ever did, her life as a parent would remain separate from her art. “It still felt hard enough to be taken seriously as a woman artist,” she says, “without adding in this other thing, let alone making it the subject of your work.” She smiles wryly and raises her eyebrows.We’re speaking ahead of her largest museum show to date – an exhibition at the Hepworth Wakefield titled Mothering. Now 43, Walker has built a dazzlingly successful career as a figurative painter, and is the mother of two small children. Ever since she was a student, first at Glasgow School ofArt, then at the Royal College of Art in London, from where she graduated in 2009, she’s been closely observing women. Rendered on intimate panels and breathtakingly big cinematic canvases, her subjects have ranged from bakers and beauticians to tailors and housekeepers – and, lately, the constellation of mostly female workers providing support during childbirth and early-years care.View image in fullscreenIntimate moment … First Nappy Change by Walker.Photograph: Peter Mallet/© Caroline Walker. Courtesy the artist; Stephen Friedman Gallery, GRIMM and Ingleby GalleryWalker began painting all-things parenthood when she became a mother for the first time in 2019. She was already in touch with London’s University College Hospital about the prospect of doing a residency before she got pregnant, and during her appointments there she decided to focus on the maternity wing. The paintings in the Birth Reflections series are awash with cobalt blue – medical scrubs, disposable gloves and hairnets – yet within the coolly sterile setting is a warm sense of dedication. It’s there on a sonographer’s face, strained as she picks out details from a grainy black-and-white image on a screen, and in a midwife’s fingertips, softly pressing a stethoscope to a tiny baby’s chest. It’s there in the anxious glance across the operating theatre of a mother newly stitched up after a caesarean section, and in the concentrated poses of the eight uniformed strangers attending to her and her baby.I didn’t anticipate that I would be repeatedly mining my children for subject matter“I was still slightly reticent about how it was going to be received,” Walker says of this newfound interest. “That it would be seen as less interesting or a bit of a cliche: ‘Oh, she had a baby and now she’s going to make a load of paintings about that.’But I tried not to limit myself, just to let things develop, and now it seems very understandable to me that artists would respond to this life event through their work because it’s such a big shift in identity and daily life.”Birth Reflections is one of four series included in the show. Another, Lisa,explores what happens when a new mother brings a baby home. Following her sister-in-law over four months, starting when she’s heavily pregnant, these knowing paintings show what Walker describes as “a more subjective view on the transition into motherhood and the domestic space in which so much of this time is spent”. Padding around in pyjamas; groggily breastfeeding in bed in the middle of the night; lounging on the sofa while the baby sleeps on you, vacantly watching television in the middle of the day.Meanwhile, Walker’s work has become more autobiographical. The earliest painting on display features her daughter, Daphne, as a toddler, glimpsed through the window of the family’s old flat in London in 2021. “It was the first time I’d painted her, and the first time I’d used my own life as a direct subject. It was supposed to be for sale, but I felt I had to hang on to it.” She laughs. “I didn’t anticipate then that I would be repeatedly mining my children for subject matter.”View image in fullscreenGlimpsed through the window … Daphne.Photograph: Peter Mallett/© Caroline Walker. Courtesy the artist; Stephen Friedman Gallery, GRIMM and Ingleby GalleryDaphne, who’s now five and apparently delights in seeing herself in paint, appears throughout the exhibition. We see her bobbing about in a swimming lesson with yellow armbands and froggy legs, and sitting at the kitchen table with Walker’s mother, Janet, and a cuddly hermit crab. And playing around at nursery, initially in London and more recently in Scotland, where Walker and her family have been living since summer 2022. The title of the show is borrowed from something a member of staff at Little Bugs, an outdoor nursery, said about “mothering” being part of their training.“A lot of the time, I’ve been looking in on a subject as an outsider,” says Walker, who begins by spending time with women and photographing their days. Being behind the camera at her daughter’s nursery was different: “I was paying for another woman to look after my child, so that I could make my work, which in this case was portraying that woman looking after my child. There was a complicated relationship of financial exchange going on that made me think about how we value different forms of labour.”Throughout her career, Walker has taken small acts of unseen and under-appreciated work – plumping pillowcases, scrubbing sinks, buffing and shaping nails – and depicted them in oil paint on an epic scale traditionally reserved for history paintings. She does so by paying attention to paraphernalia as much as people. In this show’s case, sterilised plastic bottles and breast pumps, half-finished drinks collecting on a table, fresh flowers still in their paper packaging, babygrows sprouting from a wardrobe like weeds. Modern motherhood with its all-consuming clutter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Courtesy the artist; Stephen Friedman Gallery, GRIMM, and Ingleby Gallery“When I was at home with Daphne, I remember looking around the house and finding it really claustrophobic, just the stuff everywhere,” she says. “There was condensation continuously running down the walls from all these things drying because we suddenly had so much washing.” She decided that this was what being a new mother looked like, and that she wanted to make paintings of it. “Because it is a mess, but it’s also visually interesting. It tells a story, and it’s very specific to that moment.”A rare self-portrait shows Walker with her then six-week-old son, Laurie. She was about to put him down in his cot when she paused in front of a mirror and asked her husband to take a photograph of the two of them. Walker’s reflection meets us with an exhausted gaze. “I was so tired, and not having the best time, and it felt interminable.” She drifts off and smiles. “Now every time I look at that painting it takes me back to what it felt like to hold this tiny little body and have these tiny little hands on my shoulder.”Walker and her family live in a converted farmstead on the fringes of Dunfermline, half an hour from Edinburgh, surrounded by fields of bleating lambs. Her parents are a 10-minute drive away, in the house where she grew up; she doesn’t come from an artistic family, but she liked to draw from an early age, mostly women and the world around them. She has a small studio at home, and a larger one is in the works. “It’s a different setup to living in London, of course, but actually workwise it’s pretty good,” she says. “The way I work is different now. It’s bitty, but there are lots of bits, and overall I probably end up with the same amount of time I had before, or I use my time better.”View image in fullscreen‘Those early years are so intense’ … Morning at Little Bugs.Photograph: Peter Mallett/© Caroline Walker. Courtesy the artist; Stephen Friedman Gallery, GRIMM and Ingleby GalleryWill mothering still be her subject in a decade’s time? “I suppose these early years are so intense that it’s natural they would bubble up into the work, but my relationship with my children and the intensity of my involvement will obviously change,” she says. For now, though, being a mother and an artist are one and the same. “My work and my life have become completely entwined.”Caroline Walker: Mothering is at Hepworth Wakefield from 17 May to 27 October, and at Pallant House Gallery in Chichester from 22 November to 10 May 2026. The exhibition is accompanied by an illustrated monograph of the same title, to be published by Lund Humphries in September.Explore more on these topicsArtWomen (Society)Women (Life and style)Parents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Patter-song master Richard Suart is The Learned Judge – who eventually gets the girl, jilted bride Angelina (soprano Kira Kaplan) – and company favourite Jamie MacDougall is on his best camp form as the Defendant, Edwin. Kally Lloyd-Jones gives the Bridesmaids, led by Amy J Payne, some laugh-out-loud geriatric cheerleader choreography to complement their outrageous frocks, and the jurors’ diverse costuming runs the gamut from lab coat and dress kilt to TV-am sweater and perm. Edward Jowle (as Floor Manager/Usher) is one of a quartet of young singers on the company’s Emerging Artists programme given the chance to shine in both shows.View image in fullscreenHandled with aplomb … Ross Cumming, Chloe Harris, Kira Kaplan, Edward Jowle and Jamie MacDougall in A Matter of Misconduct!Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicIn the pit, Toby Hession conducts a swaggering account of Sullivan’s music; Hession is also the composer of the double bill’s new operetta set in the press room at No 9 Downing Street. His score also owes debts toSondheimand John Adams and plays with its heritage stylishly in Laura Attridge’s production.Hession and librettist Emma Jenkins have been nurtured through short pieces for Scottish Opera’s small-scale touring and A Matter of Misconduct! is a sophisticated extension of those projects, with baritone Ross Cumming as ambitious politician Roger Penistone (fnar, fnar) and mezzo Chloe Harris his wife, Cherry, a would-be wellness guru (or “Poundshop Paltrow”).There are gags aplenty at the expense of politicians in Westminster and Holyrood, and possibly the first operatic rhyming of both “vaginal dryness” and “clitoral stimulator”, but this pacy piece also finds room for some stratospheric coloratura from Kaplan as sassy lawyer Sylvia Lawless, and a lovely duet for the rather unlovely central couple.

What was a career highlight?Nicens_boiWhen I was 60 the thought of touring when I was 70 was anathema and the thought of touring at 90 seemed dreadful! The hardest part is sitting in the car. We’re gonna be away six weeks and I’m a walking hospital case. I have meds, a step stool so I can put on compression stockings, and arthritis in both hands. My family treat me like glass, but as soon as I get on stage all these things melt away. I can only tour because I have my crew – my sons Neill and Calum, my daughter-in-law Kerry Harvey-Piper and an excellent sound engineer, Stefan Care. Or rather, they’re not my crew, I’m their singer. I don’t think in terms of career highlights because I could yet muck it up.View image in fullscreenPeggy with her sons Neill and Calum.Photograph: Vicki SharpWhat’s it like being the subject of one the greatest love songs ever written [The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]?neetoneetoIn my memoir First Time Ever I devote an entire chapter to it! I was estranged fromEwan MacColl, who had been pursuing me when I came to England. It was a very passionate encounter, but I fled back to America because a married man with a five-year-old son he adored wasn’t my ideal. It turned out that both he and his wife had been unfaithful during their marriage, which made it a bit better later on. They are both gone now, and so are their issues.When Ewan sang it to me over the phone I thought it was a nice love song, but I didn’t connect it with him and me because he was infatuated with me, and while I got to love him, I wasn’t “in love”. I felt exposed when I sang “the first time ever I lay with you”, because I was singing it as if I was him. Our first night together was disastrous! The second was what the first should have been. Then after I fell “in love” with my second life partner, Irene Pyper-Scott, I started to sing it as Ewan must have felt it.View image in fullscreen‘Our first night together was disastrous!’ … Peggy Seeger with Ewan MacColl.Photograph: Brian Shuel/RedfernsIt’s been covered by over a thousand singers and Ewan and I hated most of them. We had a section of our record collection devoted to them called “the chamber of horrors”. When it became a huge hit for Roberta Flack I didn’t like the way she sang it, but I’ve come to like it a lot. A digital composer called Broadcaster has done it as a dance track, using my vocals, which is on my Bandcamp. If you listen to it as a song, it’s the worst version ever, but as a dance track, it’s wonderful.Did you watch [Bob Dylan biopic]A Complete Unknown? If yes, what did you think? If no, why not?ThankYouJohnI haven’t had time to see it yet but I want to after the tour. I met Bob Dylan when he was Robert Zimmerman, a student. I remember him very clearly because the event organiser said: “You know that little fellow who followed you around with his briefcase? He’s Bob Dylan.” At that point I said, “Who’s Bob Dylan?”, but more power to him. He’s like me in that he hasn’t got a “good” voice but he’s got a character voice and he created the character Bob Dylan out of Robert Zimmerman. It makes me wonder if I created myself, because I’m much more of an entertainer now than I was when I was just a singer of folk songs. I do little jokes and monologues and all kinds of things I never would’ve done as the Peggy Seeger of 1962.Your songI’m Gonna Be an Engineerbuoyed me up through training as the one woman amid11 men on my electronic engineering training courseand the one female engineer working with 100 male engineers. Was there a particular woman’s story which inspired you to write it?LMCollisFirst, I didn’t want to be an engineer. I was downstairs doing the accounts and Ewan said, “Peg, we need a woman’s song.” I probably said, “Fuck off, I’m doing the accounts!” I was very angry because he never did the accounts, but afterwards I sat and wrote that song literally in an hour or two. I’d just been to Corby and seen a young woman my age working on a turret lathe, hence the mention in the lyrics. So many women have sung that song but you can’t shorten it. The first part is the woman declaring what she wants to do and the second part is the system telling her, “You can’t do that because you’re a girl.” It lasts about five minutes, but was ahead of its time.Do you think folk music still has the power to engender social change? Did it ever?RobinCYou can’t write a folk song – a folk song becomes one. And they have helped to engender change because the community felt they spoke for them. Most of what people call “folk” now is just singer-songwriter stuff. The closest I come to folk on my new album is Sit Down, written in the 1930s by Maurice Sugar about people downing tools. I remade the song for now, because if all the key workers at the bottom of the economic pile just withdrew their labour, things would change. The other song of mine that’s on its way to becoming a folk song is The Ballad of Springhill, about Springhill mines in Nova Scotia. Everyone up there knows it and very few of them know who wrote it [in 1958, while watching a live broadcast of the mining disaster], but it’s an absolute honour that it’s been taken up by the community it was written about.View image in fullscreenSeeger performing in London circa early 1960s.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesAny plans to rush back to America now it’s “under new management”?LowerColonNot for all the tea in China. I swore allegiance to the Queen in 1959. I’m a British subject although I did move back to America between 1996 and 2010. It’s a fantastic country and has some amazing people in it, doing unbelievably brave things which we don’t see on the news, like the takeover of town hall meetings by Democrats in Republican states. The Republicans are being heckled so badly! Bernie Sanders and AOC [Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez] are amazing people, and they’re doing what I was talking about doing in music – not accepting what was being pumped into us – but Trump has so much power.Do you see any prospects of a new folk revival within this digital world dominated by Spotify?Even if the likes of Trump, Musk and Farage must surely encourage a strong protest movement?Brian DowsettWell, I can say what I would like to see, but I’m not sure it will happen. Climate change is going to cull us as a species. There won’t be any big bands and we won’t have any producers of guitar strings, so we’re going to have to rely on our own voices and make instruments out of whatever we can find. But we’ll always need music that expresses the hopes and dreams of the community.What is your best memory of your brother,Pete Seeger?SheerContentOh, I have so many. When we were little kids, he would come down to visit and he would’ve been 19 or 20, and he’d have his long-necked banjo and I’d stand on his feet while he stamped them. When I decided I was gonna live in England he sent me songs, asking, “Do you know this?” I remember being sat singing with him in New York two or three years before he died. Pete was wonderful and I love what he did with his life: getting people to sing. He’s responsible almost single-handedly for the American revival of folk music.View image in fullscreenPeggy’s brother Pete Seeger … ‘I love what he did with his life.’Photograph: Tennessee State Archives via APYour mother,Ruth Crawford Seeger, has become increasingly recognised as the composer of some of the most remarkable music of the first half of the 20th century. Growing up, were you aware of the significance of her work?kramskoiI didn’t even know about her work when I was growing up. My father never talked about it. She never talked about it. I found out about it in my 30s and Judith Tick asked me to read her wonderful biography before it went to press. I was angry that I hadn’t been told that this wonderful woman had all this music. I think my father kept it from me. He was a composer, her teacher, her professor, and I think he was jealous. I wouldn’t be the musician I am without her teaching. So now I do anything I can to push her music forward.How old were you when you mastered the guitar and what are you most proud of in your folk career?Otis, aged 10.That’s a good question, Otis. I never mastered the guitar – my sons are better players than I am – but folk music didn’t ask very much of me. I took pride in learning songs. I was a guitar accompanist rather than a solos person. I played with my father when I was seven or eight and the main thing I would say is learn something really well before you perform it for anybody else. Don’t necessarily feel you have to be that good, just play and enjoy the sound of this wonderful instrument, and once you learn the normal tuning try open tuning. I’ve also recorded some albums that are not as good as they should be, so don’t record anything until someone else – not your family – tells you it’s good. I’m not “proud” of anything, but I feel I’ve done my best.If you had to spend eternity listening to just one singer, who would it be?chymistI don’t believe in heaven or hell, but if I did, it would be hell to listen to just one singer for ever. You’d fall asleep. So if I can sleep through eternity, give me Paul Simon.Peggy Seeger’s final album Teleology is out now. Her Final Farewell tour continues until 28 June.

Not for her, the album that represents the soundtrack to a film that hasn’t been made yet, or a sci-fi-influenced cosmic opera, or a globe-spanning travelogue inspired by the peripatetic lifestyle of a DJ. Her acclaimed 2019 debut album was calledTangerine, a title she chose because she “really like[s] fruit”. A journalist who gamely attempted to press further, inquiring about the images conjured in her mind while creating the music, was told: “Moments on the dancefloor.”View image in fullscreenShanti Celeste: RomanceTangerine featured ambient interludes and the sound of Celeste playing the kalimba in the living room of her father’s home in Chile (she moved to the UK with her mother as a child). But its signature sound was the author’s own, in which the subtlety and depth of classic US house productions by Moodymann, Masters at Work and Mood II Swing was melded with a giddy, rave-y euphoria and rhythms that proceeded at pacy tempos more common to techno. Called upon to come up with a term to describe it, she offered the admirably prosaic “fast house”. There’s something very telling about the fact that her career – first as a DJ, then a club promoter, record label boss and ultimately an artist – flourished after she quit university, irked that tutors on her illustration course kept asking her what her work meant: “I wouldn’t be able to explain it. I just wanted to paint.”Whether you view all this as a failure of imagination or an admirably unpretentious approach to a genre of music never much improved by grandiose statements of intent is up to you. Either way, it hasn’t impeded Celeste’s progress, nor is it something she’s sought to change. Six years on – a lengthy gap, punctuated by a handful of singles and a string of remixes forOrbital,CaribouandRuf Dug, among others – her straightforwardness is still much in evidence. Tangerine’s follow-up is called Romance, the reasons for which are swiftly apparent: “This is a romance – take heed, because I’m lost without you,” runs one lyric. “I’m thinking about you more than ever,” offers another.Shanti Celeste: Thinking About You – videoThat said, the presence of lyrics indicates that it’s a noticeably different album from its predecessor. The influence of revered US dance producers remains – the bassline of Note to Self could have fallen off a vintage Chicago house track – but only three of its tracks feature four-to-the-floor beats. For the most part, Romance proceeds at a far more leisurely pace: its key rhythmic sound isn’t an insistent kick drum, but the clatter of percussion vaguely evocative of Celeste’s Latin American roots, proceeding as unhurried as an R&B slow jam. More striking still are the vocals. An intermittent feature of her releases since the early 2010s, here they’re front and centre throughout. Her music has always been marked by a strong melodic sense, but the tunes are noticeably brighter, their pop-leaning qualities accentuated by the airiness of her voice. Even the house-fuelled Unwind, or Thinking About You, on which the vocals are a little more smeared, feel less obviously focused on the dancefloor than on melody, as if they’re waiting for a club-leaning remix.Regardless of the beat behind them, the results are disarmingly charming. Too drowsy and blurred to function as straightforward pop-R&B – the songs largely eschew verses and choruses in favour of a more scattered, mood-building approach – and too obviously sunlit to soundtrack the curtains-drawn post-club comedown, a lot of Romance exists in an appealing space of its own. Light As a Feather or Note to Self are more interested in circling back on themselves than going anywhere, but that scarcely seems to matter: they’re pretty inviting, the atmosphere languid and hazy with warmth. The poppiest thing here, Softie, is tempered by intermittent bursts of dubby echo that overwhelm the vocal, the next phrase drowned out by the aftershocks of its predecessor: it’s a small touch, but it’s also evidence of an artist interested in doing what they want.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

She was announced as the winner at a ceremony in Swansea, Thomas’s birthplace.The Coin, chosen in a unanimous decision by judges, “is a borderless novel, tackling trauma and grief with bold and poetic moments of quirkiness and humour”, said writer and judging chair Namita Gokhale. “It fizzes with electric energy”, with Zaher bringing “complexity and intensity to the page through her elegantly concise writing”.Born in 1991 in Jerusalem, Zaher studied biomedical engineering at Yale University and creative writing at the New School, where she was advised by the novelist Katie Kitamura.Kitamura described The Coin as a “brilliant, audacious, powerhouse of a novel. A story of obsession and appetite, politics and class, it is deliciously unruly. An exceptional debut by an outrageous new talent.”The novel follows a wealthy Palestinian woman as she tries to set down roots in New York, teaching in a school for underprivileged boys. However, she begins to feel stifled in the US, and develops an obsession with cleanliness and purity.In aninterview last July, Zaher said that she had “very mixed feelings” about her novel coming out at this time. “Publishing a novel is a dream come true for me, but the joy is muted by grief. Deep inside, I also know that current events are driving some of the interest in the book, and I feel very uncomfortable with that, because I never considered myself as speaking in the name of my people.“But I tell myself that identity is not pure, that life is messy, and, maybe most importantly, that literature is at its best when it resists the boxes.”Quick GuideDylan Thomas prize shortlist 2025ShowRapture's Roadby Seán Hewitt (Cape)Glorious Exploitsby Ferdia Lennon (Fig Tree)The Safekeepby Yael van der Wouden (Viking)I Will Crashby Rebecca Watson (Faber)Moderate to Poor, Occasionally Goodby Eley Williams (4th Estate)The Coin by Yasmin Zaher (Footnote)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Other writers shortlisted for this year’s prize were Rapture’s Road by Seán Hewitt, Glorious Exploits by Ferdia Lennon, The Safekeep by Yael van der Wouden, I Will Crash by Rebecca Watson and Moderate to Poor, Occasionally Good by Eley Williams.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The family, including their mother Maria and two older children, Maria and Elizabeth, moved to the now-famous parsonage in Haworth in April 1820, when Charlotte was four, Wuthering Heights author Emily, two, and Anne, who went on to write The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, just three months old. Maria died not long after the move, aged 38, and the two older sisters both died in 1825, aged 11 and 10.The building at 72-74 Market Street, Thornton, Grade II* listed since 1952, has had various uses since they left, including housing several butchers and most recently a cafe, which closed down during the Covid-19 pandemic.A team of campaigners including Bradford-born TV presenter Christa Ackroyd and Nigel West, a volunteer fundraiser who has family links to the Brontës, have worked tirelessly to first buy the building, which went on sale for £300,000, and then raise money to renovate it.Thanks to a £250,000 grant from the Bradford City of Culture fund and a huge crowdfunding appeal, they hit their £650,000 target. The house will now act as a museum and an educational centre for visiting school groups.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The team behind the project is now hoping a good chunk of them will also visit Thornton, six miles away.From July the house’s bedrooms will be open for overnight stays. The biggest has been called Charlotte’s Room, dominated by a four-poster bed, but in reality it would have been where all six Brontë children slept, with Patrick and Maria next door in what is now known as Emily’s Room. A third, named for Anne, is actually in a part of the building that was added to long after the family left.West said: “This will be the only place in the world where you can sleep in the same room that the Brontës slept in. Downstairs, in what is now the cafe, they were born on the floor right in front of the fireplace.”Explore more on these topicsBooksQueen CamillaCharlotte BrontëEmily BrontëAnne BrontëBradfordHeritage (Culture)newsShareReuse this content"

It’s the 25th instalment of the annual National Simultaneous Storytime, run by the Australian Library and Information Association (Alia). Last year’s event saw 2.3 million people take part; this year, participants are registered from countries as far away as Albania, Lithuania and Italy.View image in fullscreenA road trip and a stray tabby inspired Deborah Frenkel’s book The Truck Cat.Illustration: Danny Snell/Hardie Grant“It’s mind-blowing, really … it’s hard to get your head around how big it actually is,” Snell says of having his book chosen for the event.The Truck Cat is the story of Tinka the cat, who travels with Yacoub, a truck driver and recent migrant who feels misunderstood in his new home. When Tinka chases after a butterfly, he and Yacoub are separated. Their journey back to each other brings them love and a newfound sense of belonging, in the form of a baker named Mari.With graphic novel-style panels in pastel tones, it’s a gentle story about immigration, identity and kindness.“Reading together builds community and literacy,” says the CEO of Alia, Cathie Warburton. “We hope that children and their caregivers find that the book is a great way to start important conversations and grow together.”View image in fullscreenIn The Truck Cat, Yacoub remembers his nena’s cooking, while Tinka has his own happy memories of youth.Illustration: Danny Snell/Hardie GrantThe popularity of National Simultaneous Storytime reflects an appetite for shared reading experiences in a turbulent time for literacy rates, with the most recentNaplan resultsrevealing one in three Australian children are not proficient in literacy.The Truck Cat appeals to young readers for various reasons. Tinka the inquisitive little tabby cat and Yacoub’s B-double tri-axle truck are popular with many, as are Snell’s textural illustrations, which appear hand-painted. Feyza, nine, says, “I like this book because it reminds me of how I have two homes. A mummy home and a daddy home … [And] I have two amazing cats.”Frenkel says every young reader wants to talk to her about their own pets: “I’m hearing a lot [about] … the various exploits of everyone’s cat and dog.”View image in fullscreenTinka is taken in by Mari, a baker – and eventually reunited with Yacoub.Illustration: Danny Snell/Hardie GrantThe inspiration for the book was a days-long road trip from Melbourne to Sydney that Frenkel made with her small children, stopping at “what must have been every possible truck stop on the Hume Highway”.“It gave me a good opportunity to notice the truck drivers … there’s so many of them,” she says.Nevermoor’s Jessica Townsend on frantic fans, her fantasy smash hit – and feeling ‘gutted’ by JK RowlingRead moreA few months later, a neglected cat showed up at her back door, injured from a fight. Without a cat carrier, Frenkel planned to hold the cat tight while her husband drove to the vet, assuming the cat would be quite distressed in the car. “But the cat suddenly became really relaxed and started purring on my lap. My husband said, ‘He’s like a cat that belongs to a truck driver’ – at which point I was like yep, that’s a picture book.”The Truck Cat is also informed by Frenkel’s family history, as the granddaughter of Polish Jewish survivors of the Holocaust who arrived in Sydney in 1947. Their transition towards feeling at home in a new place is echoed in Yacoub’s experience, and Frenkel was conscious that many young readers and their families might have similar stories. “[H]ow do you find your way home when you’re in a strange new place?” she ponders in the book’s endnote. “I discovered one answer in Tinka, the truck cat – because cats are very wise.”The Truck Cat is broadly relatable in other ways, too. “This book isn’t just about cities, it’s not just about a particular place, it’s literally about the entire country,” says Frenkel. “It’s really nice that a book that is kind of about travelling around, is itself travelling around the country.”National Simultaneous Storytimetakes place on Wednesday 21 May at noon; registration is free.The Truck Catis out through Hardie Grant ($24.99)Explore more on these topicsChildren and teenagersChildrenLiteracyAustralian booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The day you wouldn’t come out of your trailer unless we sent in 40 heads of lettuce taught me a powerful lesson: never compromise your art.”He added: “I will miss the sound of your tail sliding through the tall grass, your cold, bumpy skin, but, most of all, I will miss your infectious laugh.”Morris’s iconic confrontation with Sandler’s titular character in Happy Gilmore after he consumes a golfball is widely believed to be the alligator’s strongest on-screen performance.Adam Sandler and Morris scene in Happy Gilmore.Measuring nearly 11ft and weighing 640lbs, Morris had a long Hollywood career beginning in 1975 after being rescued from an illegal pet situation in Los Angeles. Though his exact age is unknown, the reptile was estimated to be over 80 years old based on his growth rate and tooth loss. He retired in 2006 and spent his final years at the Colorado sanctuary.Morris featured in several major films such as Interview with the Vampire, Dr Dolittle 2, and Blues Brothers 2000, as well as TV shows such as Coach and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. But undoubtedly his most iconic role was alongside Sandler in the golf-centered comedy.The Gator Farm, where Morris was cared for in his later years, announced plans to preserve his body through taxidermy, honoring his legacy and continuing to educate and entertain visitors.“We have decided to get Morris taxidermied so that he can continue to scare children for years to come,” the farm shared onFacebook. “It’s what he would have wanted. We went ahead and made a video of his weight so folks could understand how massive he really was. Thanks for the wonder things everyone has had to say about him.”Meanwhile, Sandler and a handful of new and returning cast members are preparing to release a sequel to Happy Gilmore this summer on Netflix. It remains to be seen whether the long-awaited film will include a tribute to Morris.Explore more on these topicsAdam SandlerAnimalsColoradoMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

After a period in the army, Baker moved to New York and joined the Actors’ Studio in the early 1960s, where he was a contemporary of Rip Torn. Baker made his Broadway debut in 1963 with the Actors’ Studio company, appearing in Marathon ’33, about the dance marathons of the Great Depression, and made his film debut in an uncredited role in 1967 in Cool Hand Luke. He also appeared in numerous TV series, including the pilot episode of a western show called Lancer in 1968, the making ofwhich was fictionalised by Quentin Tarantino in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, with Leonardo DiCaprio’s Rick Dalton in Baker’s role.However it was a role as Steve McQueen’s character’s brother Curley in Sam Peckinpah’s 1972 rodeo drama Junior Bonner that got Baker noticed. He was then cast in a rare lead role, as real-life lawman/vigilante Buford Pusser in 1973 film Walking Tall, directed by Phil Karlson; it became a surprise hit and Baker followed it up with other hard-bitten crime films including Charley Varrick, directed by Don Siegel, and The Outfit opposite Robert Duvall and Karen Black.View image in fullscreenBaker on set of the movie Mitchell in 1975.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesBaker had more lead roles in the late 70s, but remained better known as a reliable supporting actor in the following decade, appearing in baseball drama The Natural (as “the Whammer”, modelled on Babe Ruth), Chevy Chase detective comedy Fletch and thriller Getting Even. In 1985 Baker was cast as CIA agent Darius Jedburgh in Edge of Darkness, the landmark political thriller TV series starring Bob Peck and Joanne Whalley.Baker’s performance in Edge of Darkness got him attention from the producers of the 1987 Bond film The Living Daylights, in which he was cast as arms dealer Brad Whitaker. Baker would make the rare switch from Bond villain to Bond good guy when he was cast in 1995 in GoldenEye as helpful CIA agent Jack Wade, a role he reprised in Tomorrow Never Dies.A stream of smaller roles kept him busy, appearing in Martin Scorsese’s Cape Fear remake, Gen X satire Reality Bites, and Steven Soderbergh’s noir drama The Underneath. He later appeared in the feature film version of The Dukes of Hazzard and his final film role in Mud, which starred Matthew McConaughey, after which he retired.Baker was married to Marlo Baker between 1969 and 1980, and is not known to have had any children.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsJames BondBBCTelevisionThrillersnewsShareReuse this content"

Undeterred by the prison directors’ resistance, Kornyev seeks to investigate and alert higher authorities to the abuse of power – seemingly oblivious to the risk he is putting himself in by doing so.Loznitsa told Variety that Russia underVladimir Putinwas “hurtling back toward Stalinism – a country that breaches international law, a country that wages wars with its neighbours”.The US, he continued, used to be regarded as a champion of the human rights that Kornyev believes in, “a fortress of democracy, that doesn’t only proclaim the rule of law and human rights, but also a country that fights for human rights.” UnderDonald Trump, however, he feared that it was only a matter of time before “these two countries will become equal”.Loznitsa, a Cannes regular whose2018 film Donbasswon the Un Certain Regard award for best director, has been based in Berlin for more than 20 years and is a controversial figure in his native Ukraine.He resigned from the European Film Academy in 2022 over the body’s “neutral, toothless” response to the Russian invasion, but was ejected from the Ukrainian Film Academy overhis criticism of an all-out boycott on Russian artists and culture.He sounded evasive when asked at a press conference on Thursday about his view on US president Trump pressurising the Ukrainian government to accept Moscow’s demands for a peace deal, such as recognising Russian control of Crimea.“I don’t think we should think in terms of what leaders are doing, the decisions they are making, because it’s not just the leaders, it’s us too,” Loznitsa said. “And it is imperative that we don’t give up, we have to think about it every time, and we have to ask ourselves what to do in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.”Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsFranceVladimir PutinDonald TrumpEuropeUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!”Bruce Springsteen review – a roaring, rousing ​s​how that imagines a better AmericaRead moreLater, introducing House of a Thousand Guitars, he said: “The last check, the last check on power after the checks and balances of government have failed are the people, you and me. It’s in the union of people around a common set of values now that’s all that stands between a democracy and authoritarianism. So at the end of the day, all we’ve got is each other.”He then delivered a longer speech ahead of the song My City of Ruins, saying:There’s some very weird, strange and dangerous shit going on out there right now. In America, they are persecuting people for using their right to free speech and voicing their dissent. This is happening now.In America, the richest men are taking satisfaction in abandoning the world’s poorest children to sickness and death. This is happening now.In my country, they’re taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers.They’re rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society.They are abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom. They are defunding American universities that won’t bow down to their ideological demands.They are removing residents off American streets and, without due process of law, are deporting them to foreign detention centres and prisons. This is all happening now.A majority of our elected representatives have failed to protect the American people from the abuses of an unfit president and a rogue government. They have no concern or idea of what it means to be deeply American.The America l’ve sung to you about for 50 years is real and regardless of its faults is a great country with a great people. So we’ll survive this moment. Now, I have hope, because I believe in the truth of what the great American writer James Baldwin said. He said, ‘In this world, there isn’t as much humanity as one would like, but there’s enough.’ Let’s pray.Springsteen castigated Trump during his first presidential term, saying he was a “threat to our democracy”.He has long been a Democrat supporter, and a close friend of Barack Obama – he campaigned on each of his presidential campaigns, and the pair created a podcast series together, Renegades: Born in the USA. Springsteen also fronted rallies for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s respective campaigns.The comments align with a lifetime of songwriting that appraises America in all its ideals and flaws, with albums such as The River and Born in the USA examining poverty, post-Vietnam trauma and blue-collar aspiration with a social documentarian eye. Springsteen also wrote a defining anthem of the 9/11 tragedy, The Rising.Fans are salivating at the prospect of his next release on 27 June, entitled Tracks II: The Lost Albums – a collection of seven full-length LPs spanning 1983 to 2018, comprising 83 songs that Springsteen recorded but never released.The Land of Hope and Dreams tour continues in Manchester on 17 and 20 May, and travels across Europe until early July.Explore more on these topicsBruce SpringsteenPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Combs’ssons and mother were present in the courtroom, as well as his publicist. Ventura’s husband was also present.Others in the courtroom included lawyers, journalists and members of the public, including podcasters and content creators.Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs trial: key takeaways from Cassie Ventura’s second day of testimonyRead moreAs Ventura, who is eight and a half months pregnant, entered the courtroom, she did not look at Combs and did not appear to look at him at any point during the day on Thursday. She has been staring directly forward or to her screen showing the exhibits.The defense team spent the first half-hour of their cross-examination establishing the trust and love that was once between Ventura and Combs, frequently in their questions recalled Ventura’s testimony from earlier this week.“He was charismatic – big personality, larger than life,” Ventura testified. “The beginning of the relationship was really fast, fast-paced, scary. But the more time I spent with him, his real personality came out – sweet, attentive.”Then the defense asked about the “freak-offs”.“So, to make him happy you told him that you wanted to do ‘freak-offs’, right?” Estevao asked.“No, there’s a lot more to that,” Ventura said.Throughout the cross-examination on Thursday,the defense cited hundreds of messages, via text and emails, between Combs and Ventura, to depict their relationship to the jury, many of them explicit.“In order for me to be more open with the things we do in bed, I need to feel safe, like home … like this is my husband, and this is the only man that will ever have this aggressive sexual side of me,” Ventura wrote to Combs in an email shown in court. “When we used to freak off when we were so in love there were no questions asked, it felt right. Like it literally made sense for the next step in our sex life together.”Ventura later told the defense that the freak-offs were “an integral part” of her relationship with Combs.In another message shown to the jury, Ventura told Combs she “never felt so loved, safe, and empowered since we’ve come together” but that “on the other hand, your [sic] constantly weary of me …”Ventura commented on that message that “it was usually, like, a one-way street when it came to messages like this”.Other messages between Combs and Ventura that were shared were much more graphic and detailed, depicting both former partners’ various desires.Combs’s lawyer then pivoted to the lawsuit Ventura filed in 2023.“When your lawsuit was publicized in November 2023, you understood that his career was ruined at that point, right?” Estevao asked.“I could understand that, yeah,” Ventura said.It appeared as if the defense was trying to portray Ventura to the jury as a willing participant in the freak-offs, and that jealously and drugs were big parts of their relationship.Venturatold the court that she took ecstasy, or MDMA, to “be high during the freak-offs” and said that for points of their relationship, she and Combs were both addicted to opiates.She testified that Combs would be angry if she did drugs “without him”.The defense suggested that Combs encouraged her at times to seek help for her drug use and that he had been concerned for her health.Combs was seen nodding his head and frequentlywhispering to his lawyers, and passing them notes. He alsowould sometimes turn around to look at who was in the courtroom. He appeared fidgety periodically, often leaning back and forward in his chair and staring at his lawyer, Estevao, as she conducted the cross-examination.A timeline of allegations and charges against Sean ‘Diddy’ CombsRead moreJust before the lunch break ended, Judge Arun Subramanian reminded the defense they would have to conclude their cross-examination by tomorrow as Ventura is heavily pregnant.Combs’s attorney Marc Agnifilo said that Ventura should be able to come back on Monday if necessary, prompting Subramanian to say: “In what universe did you not understand this is what was going to happen … You’re not telling me this was everyone’s understanding that this witness was going to be done this week?”Ventura was in a side room during that exchange.Upon Ventura’s return from break, she was asked again about messages between her and Combs, specifically ones that suggest Ventura enjoyed the freak-offs.“I would say that loving ‘FOs’ were just words at that point,” she testified.In one exchange referenced in court, Combs said he wanted to have “an FO right now”, and Ventura replied, “lol me too,” adding: “Well I want to have fun with you.”After more back and forth with the defense attorneys about freak-offs and how they were discussed, Ventura was asked about her feelings on Combs’s other former partner, Kim Porter, who died in 2018.“I had some jealousy toward Ms Porter,” Ventura said.A 2013 message from Ventura to Combs was also shown to the court, which depicted Ventura’s jealousy that Combs, Porter and his children spent family trips together. Ventura testified that she was upset that she was not integrated into Combs’s family life, and in one message to Combs, Ventura expressed concern that she was the “side piece”.From there, the defense parsed through the mutual jealousy Ventura felt about finding out that Combs had other partners and how Combs felt when Ventura was dating other people, including Kid Cudi.Ventura also testified that Combs would often accuse her of being with other men. During a break in their relationship, Combs thought she was starting a relationship with the actor Michael B Jordan and tried to get in contact with her.“It seemed hypocritical to you that he would date other women,” Combs’s lawyer said, noting that Ventura wanted monogamy and acknowledging that Combs could be “far more jealous”.“He had a bad temper and he reacted poorly to information that he didn’t like,” the lawyer said, which Ventura agreed to.On how Ventura felt when Combs had suspicion that she was seeing someone else, she testified: “It was a little scary.”During a break, Combs blew a kiss at his sons, who were in the court room, and made a heart gesture with his hands.Combs’s lawyers also presented messages between Ventura and Combs from 3 March 2016, which came before the freak-off that Ventura says occurred right before the assault in the Los Angeles hotel hallway.“We can have fun, I don’t want you thinking I don’t want to,” Ventura told Combs in one message on 3 March.The defense lawyers seemed to be trying to establish that around the time of the 2016 assault video, Combs had been experiencing withdrawals from opiates.On Ventura’s second day of testimony on Wednesday, she provided more details about the physical and psychological abuse she alleged she experienced from Combs during their on-and-off again relationship that lasted about 11 years, and accused the music mogul of rape and blackmail.At one point on the stand, Ventura broke down in tears as she testified that Combs raped her in 2018 at her home after they had broken up. The alleged rape was first mentioned in 2023 whenVentura filed a civil lawsuitagainst Combs. The lawsuit accused him of physical and sexual abuse. Combs has denied the allegations.The two reached asettlement in one day. On Wednesday, Ventura revealed she received $20m from Combs and his companies in the settlement.Cassie Ventura tells court at day three of trial that Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs raped herRead moreThe lawsuit prompted the federal investigation that led to Combs’sarrest in September last year.Combs is facing charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty and denies all allegations. If convicted, Combs, who has been jailed since his arrest last year, could spend the rest of his life in prison.The defense’s cross-examination of Ventura will stretch into Friday. The prosecutor Emily Johnson said that she expects about an hour of redirect-examination after the defense finishes cross-examination on Thursday afternoon.Prosecutors also informed the court that they would like to bring forward more witnesses on Friday, including the singer Dawn Richard.In the US, thedomestic violence hotlineis 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

In Hurry Up Tomorrow, a celluloid roman-à-clef pegged to hissixth studio album, the Grammy-winning multi-hyphenate puzzles through the consequences of hooking up with a deranged groupie who forces him to reckon with his rock star flings. But it’s viewers who will probably be feeling rueful over nearly two hours lost in the end.Though technically a thriller, Tomorrow takes inspiration from a real-life moment of weakness: the Weeknd – born Abel Tesfaye – losing his voice while filmingThe IdolTV series in between a global stadium tour. As with most of his artistic efforts, the Weeknd makes the job of distinguishing his sincere reflections from his satirical self-observations impossibly hard on audiences and smirks when they don’t get the joke. Recall hisdizzying Super Bowl half-time showandface-bandage stunthe pulled to promote the After Hours album.The Weeknd: Hurry Up Tomorrow review – a record that will floor you … and drive you up the wallRead moreTomorrow marks the Weeknd’s third try at making a film based on an album, but the first to run at feature length. It also reunites him with Trey Edward Shults, who directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with the Weeknd and The Idol creator Reza Fahim. Like The Idol, Tomorrow wallows in the glamour of fame, drugs and sex – highs the Weeknd chases to keep him pushing through a combustible breakup of his own making. Throughout, the Weeknd’s vocal cords bear the brunt of the stress and pop on him, quite audibly, as he’s serenading a full house. Scared and desperate, he shrinks from the spotlight and makes a break for it – only to run into Anima (Jenna Ortega), a reveler he connected with mid-spiral.This is no chance encounter. Anima is an unstable person with nothing to lose who we first meet setting fire to Abel’s childhood home. She doesn’t tell him that when the Weeknd bumps into her as he’s lamming it from his own concert; she only gives him a safe, easy escape. After an inconspicuous night on the town, a welcome release from their urgent problems, the two strangers repair to a luxury hotel suite to share more music and heartfelt emotions before falling into bed. When the Weeknd gets too relaxed and tells Anima “don’t leave me,” the words come back to bite when he tries to reprise his rock star life the next morning. A blindside hit to the head sends the Weeknd down a fevered journey into the pit of his psyche, and the torture doesn’t end when he comes to.Amid the shocks and spasms, Tomorrow remains easy enough on the eyes. It was shot on 35mm film, which makes wide shots of Canadian Rockies and SoCal vistas really pop.The Weeknddominates on screen, but you would struggle to take your eyes off him anyway; he oozes Michael Jackson-level energy, down to the ersatz Thriller jacket. When he and Ortega are in frame, their chemistry shines through. It’s just too bad their connection is spoiled on a film that unspools like one long music video – the essence of the Weeknd’s other short films.Hallow Road review – Rosamund Pike and Matthew Rhys race to rescue daughter in cracking thrillerRead moreTomorrow can’t rush past its lack of clarity, both visually and in the storytelling. The payoffs should hit harder, but the film’s insistence on tarrying in the space between the characters’ sober and sick minds make for muddled set-ups. Gallingly, the film wastes time on Abel’s profligate drug and alcohol addiction that would’ve been better off handed over toBarry Keoghan, who plays Abel’s best friend and manager for a shockingly low amount of screen time. Shults is adept at relating mood through his work, but his reliance on kaleidoscopic transitions overflows here as well. And yet, you might excuse that auteur’s reflex if the film hadn’t cleared a runway for Anima to play armchair critic and offer up her pointed analysis of the Weeknd’s hit songs. Suffice to say, those scenes are more torturous than the actual torture that takes place in the foreground.The album-cum-feature film is a twofer that has been tried before. But Tomorrow breaks from the tradition that Purple Rain andThe Wallestablished. Ultimately, it’s little more than an emo rocker imagining what it would be like if he turned to his unhinged stalker for therapy – and thinking that makes him more evolved than the cavalier sonic rebels of yore. A well-constructed film could have really underscored the irony in that. But Tomorrow is too murky, meandering and self-indulgent an inside joke for audiences to remember it for more than its smirking moments. In time the Weeknd may come to regret this too, a missed opportunity.Hurry Up Tomorrow is out in US and UK cinemas on 16 MayExplore more on these topicsThrillersThe WeekndBarry KeoghanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Even singers who never studied with the great baritone acknowledge his influence, but for Benjamin Appl the link was much more direct: after attending a masterclass that Fischer-Dieskau gave in Austria in 2009,Appl became Fischer-Dieskau’s final pupil, working with him up to his death three years later.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Appl and James Baillieu: For Dieter: Hommage à Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.Photograph: Alpha ClassicsThe centenary tribute that Appl has put together to his teacher with pianist James Baillieu is thoughtful and handsomely produced. The disc of 32 songs is well chosen to reflect every stage in Fischer-Dieskau’s life, from his childhood, through his years as a soldier and prisoner of war during the second world war, the steady upward curve of his career through the 1950s and 60s, to the eminence of his later years. . Packaged within a lavishly illustrated hardback book, it also includes some of the works that were composed specially for him. Schubert is predictably well represented in the sequence, Schumann, Brahms and Wolf unexpectedly rather less so, and Richard Strauss not all, though there are songs by Eisler and Bruno Walter, and by Fischer-Dieskau’s father Albert and brother Klaus. Without ever aping his famous mentor, Appl’s performances have the same attention to detail, both verbal and musical, though his tone sometimes takes on a hard, rather acid edge; it’s a worthy, heartfelt tribute and Fischer-Dieskau’s legions of fans won’t hesitate.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

But beneath the razor sharp jokes is a schmaltzy show that tugs at the heartstringsRachel AroestiThu 15 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 15 May 2025 04.30 EDTShareIn the pandemic, Benito Skinner became internet famous for his camply unhinged impressions of celebrities, reality stars and LA types: his roster includes a devil-worshipping Kris Jenner, Billie Eilish at the beach and a twitching, gurgling Timothée Chalamet. By then, the comedian had been uploading videos for years. A clip from 2019 titled Live Footage of Me in the Closet sees Skinner comb his fringe forward, don an Abercrombie tee and travel back to the late 00s to resurrect his teenage self, a boy denying his love for Gossip Girl while repeatedly insisting he’s “not gay” until the screen erupts into a manic collage of Lady Gaga dance routines, Google results for “daniel radcliffe equus naked” and the iTunes page for Glee: The Music, Volume 1.Six years on, Skinner is reprising the role. Overcompensating, an eight-part Prime Video comedy drama, begins with a similarly unconvincing claim. “Hey, what’s up everybody. I’m Benny, I love pussy,” our hero tells his reflection, an assertion undermined by flashbacks of furtive childhood rewinds of George of the Jungle, plus more recent footage of him leaning back in disgust from his beautiful prom date. The show goes on to fictionalise Skinner’s first year at university, a time spent desperately trying to convince himself and others that he was totallynot gay.There is, however, one big difference between Skinner’s social media oeuvre and his first proper TV project. Online, the 31-year-old is the sole comedic engine: trussed-up, gurning, a master of mischievous parody. Here, however, he plays it almost entirely straight – in both senses. Benny was a popular football player in high school, plus homecoming king and valedictorian, as his new bestie, the unconventionally cool Carmen (Wally Baram), guesses. He is wholesome, absurdly handsome and incredibly nice; an instant campus heart-throb. His secret desires mean he is also meticulously repressed: the only glimpse of the madcap streak that sent Skinner viral comes during a cringeworthy dorm party scene. Faced with a trio of dudes singing along to Like a G6, a drunken Benny decides to showcase his own rapping talents with an energetic rendition of Nicki Minaj’s Super Bass (Overcompensating is not a period piece – Instagram Stories exists – but the music choices are very nostalgic).View image in fullscreenGetting high off their own virility … Overcompensating.Photograph: Jackie Brown/PrimeLuckily, there are others able to take up the comic mantle. The first is Carmen’s breathlessly problematic but strangely lovable roomie Hailee, a walking TMI who mimes sex acts between bouts of hysteria. She is played flawlessly by the actor who goes mononymously by Holmes (best known for playing the Daisy May Cooper character in the US adaptation of This Country). Then there’s Peter, the high-status boyfriend of Benny’s sister and fellow student Grace (Mary Beth Barone), who is determined to take “Bento” under his wing. The White Lotus’s Adam DiMarco does an exceptional job of infusing this heinous wannabe alpha with humanity while squeezing every drop of hilarity from his ludicrous vernacular of “yee”s and “nah”s. At one point, Peter and his pals get so high off their own virility that they explode into an orgy of roaring, chest-thumping and shirt-ripping – a pastiche of frat bro masculinity that is quite exquisite.Overcompensating is also expert at the incidental joke: Benny’s perennially nude roommate sleeping soundly in his bed while pre-drinks rage around him, the pal of Peter’s who announces that he needs the toilet seconds into any social encounter, the film class where everyone loves The Godfather. Less entertaining is the subplot involving a pre-Brat Charli xcx concert (she and Skinner are close friends; the pop star’s music also plays throughout).Yet despite such japes, the show’s dominant tone ends up being one of heartfelt sincerity. Benny’s attempts at personal growth – ditching the laddy social life of his youth, trying to wriggle out of the business degree his dad (Kyle MacLachlan) pushed him into and meeting new friends – are spiked with knockabout humour, but at its core this is a very earnest and, at points, schmaltzily American show about embracing your true self. The combination of Benny’s sexuality-based struggles and Carmen’s attempts to grapple with grief (her elder brother died the year before) means the ratio of laughs to sentimental musings occasionally feel out of whack – but there is still much to enjoy. Just don’t come to Overcompensating expecting wall-to-wall comedy; this is a thoroughly charming show with a very sensitive soul.Overcompensating is on Prime Video nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’m on my way toLuckey Tor, one of Dartmoor’s most hidden rock stacks, which sits by the river, shrouded in vegetation like Sleeping Beauty’s castle. It’s not the easiest of walks. The path peters out as I get deeper into the gorge, and the final approach to the tor involves clambering and hopping over large mossy boulders and navigating huge shelves of rock that border the river.The first sight of it is unforgettable. A small stream, the Row Brook, runs in front of it, like a moat. The tor looms up squarely from the valley floor, dwarfing everything around, framed in a grassy clearing that is a popular place to bivouac. Its position is unusual. Most tors are at the summit of a hill, dominating the views for miles around, standing grandly in the landscape, devoid of trees. Luckey Tor is sequestered in the folds of the Dart valley, and in the summer is mostly obscured by foliage; when you find it, you feel as though you’ve entered a secret kingdom.A map of Darmoor showing some tors and the main townsThe tor is one of hundreds on Dartmoor (the actual number is disputed). The name comes from the Celtic wordtwrmeaning tower; it refers to a rocky outcrop that rises sharply from the land around it. These natural monoliths are about 280 million years old; they erupt from the moor, like stone beings, in a variety of outlandish shapes and sizes, looking like castles, creatures, monsters and giants. Their unusual appearance has given rise to numerous myths and legends: Vixen tor is home toVixiana the witch; the devil resides at the Dewerstone (and numerous other places, of course); and Old Crockern, “the gert old spirit of the moor”, lives by Crockern Tor.The authors of the first guides to Dartmoor called the tors rock idols because they believed they were worshipped by the druids. In 1793’s Historical Views of Devonshire, Richard Polwhele wrote: “In the druid ages, stones of various shapes were consecrated to religion … They prostrated themselves before the rudest … And wherever we find stones, which are at the same time massy and misshapen, there we look for the druidical gods. Vastness, in short, and rudeness were the characteristics of the druid rock-idols … ”View image in fullscreenBlackingstone Rock, with its surreal metal staircase.Photograph: Adam Burton/AlamyThe idea of worshipping rocks is not exclusive to Dartmoor. Cultures around the world, including the Sami people and indigenous Australians, revere rocks; they are full of natural majesty and tend to be in high places, perhaps connecting us to the heavens and even the underworld. It seems likely that our ancestors on Dartmoor, who were more attuned to the landscape features than we are today, regarded the tors as sacred. And we know, from the monuments they left behind – notably stone circles and stone rows, of which Dartmoor has some of the best examples in western Europe – that they practised some sort of faith.There is no doubt that Dartmoor feels like a sacred landscape, and its majestic rock stacks are part of that. They, and the moorland in which they sit, have been part of my life for the last 25 years; we first moved here back in 2000. I have walked among them, my children have played among them, and they have borne witness to many of the big moments in my life, both joyful and traumatic.View image in fullscreenWatern Tor, an ice-carved granite masterpiece.Photograph: Sophie PierceI first had the idea for an illustrated book about this place I love so much when visiting the Lake District. We used the hand-drawn Wainwright guides, which we found compelling because of their subjective, intimate feel; they really reflectedAlfred Wainwright’s deeply personal relationship with the fells. I thought it would be great to produce a book like this for Dartmoor – with drawings by my husband, Alex, an artist. We ended up going on a granite pilgrimage, choosing 28 of the tors, and having wildly different experiences at all of them. They all have distinctive characters: Blackingstone Rock, with its surreal metal staircase going up the side, with curlicued, wrought-iron handrails, is a Victorian stairway to heaven. Hen Tor, by contrast, stands in total isolation, miles from anywhere, in an ocean of rock, like a stumpy cargo ship sailing forth in granite seas. And Watern Tor is an extraordinary ice-carved masterpiece of whirlpool granite, standing high above the Scorhill stone circle in the basin below.View image in fullscreenDrawings from Rock Idols of Hen Tor, left, and Blackstone Rock.Illustration: Alex MurdinOur passion for this place has resulted in us setting up a new festival too, the Dartmoor Tors festival (which runs from 23 to 25 May), to share the enchantment of the moor, and ponder why it makes us feel the way we do. We’ve got artists, writers, campaigners, archaeologists and musicians coming together to explore our human, emotional connection with wild landscapes. There will be talks and conversations, as well as a variety of walks, with artists, archaeologists and storytellers, to sacred sites including stone rows, cairn circles and, of course, the tors.For us, the answer to why we love this place always seems to go back to the stone, the stone that connects us to our ancestors, that stone that they most probably worshipped, and which added a spiritual element to their lives. Paradoxically, stone is traditionally perceived as static and still, almost dead. But it is most definitely alive, just on a totally different timescale from us, existing in deep time, across millions of years, in contrast to our small, fleeting, lives.Sophie Pierce, with Alex Murdin, is the author ofRock Idols:A Guide to Dartmoor in 28 Tors(Wild Things Publishing, £14.99).

Edited for social media, their videos are designed not just to attract, but to trap attention in a TikTok spell, then communicate a rush of information in a matter of seconds. However, within the well-calculated rush of decisive movements and fishbowl close-ups, Alessandro (otherwise known asSpicy Moustache) is a hugely likable, calm and good teacher.For months now, his enthusiastic and entertaining approach to a vegetable or process has sent me into the kitchen to grate something and rub it with salt, to turn into a fritter or cake. “Such a vivid thing for us today,” is what Jane Grigson said about the ideas of Giacomo Castelvetro, the 16th-century proponent of vegetables and author of The Fruit, Herbs andVegetablesof Italy (1614), and I think the same can be said about Alessandro.In fact, Giacomo and Alessandro have a huge amount in common. Born almost four centuries apart, as well as 100 miles apart in Modena and Verona, they both developed a love of vegetables at a young age; moved to England; and became keen gardeners determined to share practical, simple and elegant ways of preparing vegetables. I have long been a fan of Giacomo, even more so now that I have put him in a complementary relationship with Alessandro; the two provide me with multi-dimensional inspiration. I am just sorry they can’t co-present a TV show.Their double act inspiration this week isscarpaccia, which means old shoe, apparently – a clear image for the thickness of the final dish. It wasAlessandro’s quick-paced videothat taught me about this baked courgette dish, of which there are endless variations, but two broad forms. First, a sweet version, often calledtorta dolce di verdura, a sweet cake of vegetables made from equal quantities of flour and courgettes, along with basil, sugar and yeast. Thenthere is the savoury scarpaccia, typical of the province of Lucca (and in particular the town of Camaiore), for which thinly sliced courgettes and their flowers are baked for about an hour in a batter of egg, flour and cheese.I have taken inspiration from all the above, plus Castelvetro’s fritters, for this version that tastes like a cross between chickpea flour pancakes (I am thinking here of Italianfarinataor Indianbesan ka chilla) and vegetable and chickpea flour fritters, such as pakoras.Looking again to Giacomo and Alessandro for inspiration, a grated cabbage, beetroot and apple salad with feta would be good here, as would a green salad dressed according to Castelvetro’s sacred law of salads: plenty of salt, generous amounts of oil and a little vinegar.Courgette, onion and chickpea flour bake (lascarpaccia camaiorese)1kg courgettes, with flowers, if possible1 bunchspring onions2 heapedtbspchickpea(gram) flour1 heapedtbspgrated parmesanSalt and freshly ground black pepperExtra-virgin olive oilYou need a nonstick, roughly 36cm x 20cm baking tray, with a lip. Using a mandoline, the cheese slicer of a box grater or a sharp knife, slice the courgettes and onions (both white and green parts) into thin rounds. If you have courgette flowers, roughly chop them.Put the sliced vegetables (but not the flowers) in a colander or sieve sitting on a plate and sprinkle over two teaspoons of salt. Use your hands to scrunch the salt into the vegetables, then leave them to sit for two hours. The vegetables will release liquid as they sit, but it pays to press down, so as much liquid as possible is released on to the plate (reserve the liquid for now).Put the sliced vegetables and flowers in a bowl and add the chickpea flour, parmesan, some salt and a few grinds of pepper, and toss everything together. It may be that there is still enough moisture in the vegetables that the flour coats them with a sticky, batter-like texture; if not, add a little of the reserved liquid and toss again. Tip the mixture into the tray and level with your hand – it should be about 1cm deep. Zigzag the top with olive oil and bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 20 minutes.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkBakingVegetablesMain courseSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

There is, naturally, quite a bit of variety in a drinks writer’s liquid diet, so to have the same thing twice in one week is a sure indication of a fascination developing, or of a habit forming. There’s not much psychoanalysis required as to why that might be the case: the sun is out and, by the time this column comes out, it will (hopefully) be here to stay. And, for that, I simply must have a glass of white wine in my hand.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Or maybe I need to dig a bit deeper. Why riesling specifically? I like my riesling how all the other freaks do – namely when it tastes as little like wine as possible. When petrol and wax abound on the nose. And with an acidity that slaps you round the face a little, as well as generous fruit that soothes. Riesling is a wine that feels like a meal. And, just maybe, after a haggard winter marked by comforting reds and weighted blankets, I’m in the mood to be challenged and excited again.It’s because of these peculiar, acquired-taste notes that riesling is so often a grape for the wine nerds, yes, but that’s also why I’m so pleased it’s so easy to pick up in supermarkets and wine shops alike. The kinds of riesling you’ll most likely find in the supermarket are German and dry, though there is also plenty to discover from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Alsace. They tend to be labelled by variety only, however, so if you want to be sure of the sweetness levels, make sure you check the label to know what to expect.In the wine classification ofprädikatswein, the lightest dry German rieslings are described askabinett-style: that is, bright and with low residual sugar. These are usually appley, sprightly things that you can drink without overthinking, and are the sort of riesling to serve to someone who needs convincing, or who doesn’t think a nose pull of petrol is the most pleasurable thing on Earth. Yet.Moving up the scale, we havespätlese(literally, “late harvest”), for which the grapes are picked at least a week after the regular harvest, so have more time to ripen and have a higher sugar content. They also tend to be fleshier, and are certainly the least intense of the sweeter rieslings.You may also come across riesling markedauslese, meaning selected harvest wines that can be even riper than spätlese, but not always. Sweeter, off-dry riesling (wherever it’s from) is the firm foil to the supposition that sweetness = poor quality. These wines can be intriguing, poised, and the best are kept in check with a fine acidity. Confront yourself. Embrace the sweetness.Four rieslings to wet your whistleDr L Grey Slate Riesling£10 Waitrose, 10.5%.
