Only 24 hours earlier, Denmark, an EU and Nato member state, had warned that Donald Trump was intent on“conquering” Greenland, but the reflex at the top of the EU executive to describe the US as a friend runs deep.Trump’s weekend announcement that eight countries that have supported Greenland would face tariffs unless there was a deal to sell the territory to the US was another hammer to the transatlantic alliance, mocking the notion that the US is Europe’s ally. The eight countries include six EU member states, as well as Norway and the UK, the latter unprotected by the much vaunted “special relationship”. It suggests that Europe’s strategy of flattering and appeasing the US president has failed.For critics, exhibit A is von der Leyen’s decision to sign a trade deal with Trump that was deeply skewed in favour of the US. While the EU agreed to eliminate tariffs on many US goods, it accepted 15% duties on many products and 50% on steel. After years of the EU extolling its heft as a trade player, the terms of theEU-US trade dealsigned at Trump’s Turnberry golf course last July were seen as a humiliation.Von der Leyendefended that dealby saying it provided “crucial stability in our relations with the US” at a time of acute instability in an “unforgiving” world.The Guardian view on Trump and Greenland: get real! Bullying is not strength | EditorialRead moreNow that argument is left in ruins, while the 0% tariffs for the US may never be implemented. The Trump administration has succeeded in uniting the European parliament from radical left to far right – via mainstream groups – against the agreement. The leader of France’s far-right National Rally party, Jordan Bardella, described Trump’s threats as “commercial blackmail” and said the EU should suspend last summer’s agreement. Meanwhile, the centre-right European People’s Party leader, Manfred Weber, aligned itself with other mainstream parties in calling for ratification of the deal to be paused.View image in fullscreenThe Greenlandic flag flies over a building as the HDMS Vaedderen frigate of the Danish navy patrols behind in Nuuk, Greenland, on Sunday.Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesThe unspoken reason for accepting the unequal trade bargain was the hope it would keep the US backing Ukraine to defend itself in its war with Russia, providing capabilities, such as intelligence, which Europe is unable to match after decades of low defence spending. The former prime minister of Latvia Krišjānis Kariņš has described this as Europe’s diplomatic disadvantage. “Europe still needs the US,” he told the Guardian this week, before the latest Trump announcement. “So that’s what makes the entire process [on Greenland] very, very difficult. And national leaders are generally speaking quite hesitant to criticise President Trump. But they’re also hesitant in explaining to their societies why that’s the case, this security dependence.”But Trump may have pushed the EU too far. Although Greenland left the EU’s predecessor organisation, the European Community, in 1985, acquiescing in the forced sale of the territory of an EU member state would send a disastrous signal about the EU as a geopolitical actor and its commitment to Ukraine.As European leaders lined up to declare their determination to uphold Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, there are growing calls to use the EU’s powerful but untested anti-coercion instrument against the US.The regulation, invariably described as the EU’s “big bazooka”, was originally conceived as a response to Chinese economic pressure. It would allow the EU to impose sweeping restrictions on US goods and services, suspend investment or intellectual property protections.France, which has long championed a muscular response to US pressure, called on the EU to trigger the instrument if Trump goes ahead with tariffs on countries supporting Greenland. But using the anti-coercion instrument is neither quick nor simple. While the commission promises “a certain expeditiousness”, agreeing on sanctions could take around one year. Punitive measures require agreement of at least 55% of EU member states representing 65% of the population.When Trump introduced his so-called liberation day tariffs in 2025, European leaders denounced them as “wrong”, harmful, mutually destructive and pledged a “robust response”. In the end divisions among the 27 member states and determination toshelter national industries from Trump’s countermeasuresput the EU on the path of appeasement rather than confrontation. Asthe 80-year-old transatlantic relationship goes through epoch-defining changes, the next few weeks will reveal whether this time is different.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionTrump tariffsTariffsGreenlandDonald TrumpEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Well, at least now we know it’s the other; not an invasion that would have sent young men home to their mothers across Europe in coffins, but insteadanother trade war, designed to kill off jobs and break Europe’s will. Just our hopes of an economic recovery, then, getting taken out and shot on a whim by our supposedly closest ally, months after Britainsigned a trade dealsupposed to protect us from such arbitrary punishment beatings. In a sane universe, that would not feel like a climbdown by the White House, yet by comparison with the rhetoric that had Denmark scrambling troops to Greenland last week it is.That said, don’t underestimate the gravity of the moment.Keir Starmer has tried everything to avoid being forced to choose between Europe and the US, and for a country that has burned too many international bridges lately that was the right instinct. He has swallowed any amount of personal mortification and public disquiet in the process, only to discover that whatever Britain gives, Trump always demands more. For this president, you are either all in or all out. Though Britain joined an American military operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker suspected of sanctions busting only days ago, that didn’t protect us from presidential wrath when we alsosent a single officerto Greenland last week, in symbolic solidarity with our (and at least in theory the US’s) Nato ally Denmark. You can’t ride two horses, it turns out, when one is a mad bucking bronco.All of which means that the old western alliance is effectively dead, and the US under this president is no longer an ally. Anyone expecting Starmer to say so on Monday morning, still less to threaten the closure of American military bases across the country in retaliation, needs however to face reality.Europe’s first instinct will be to try for some negotiated fudge that saves face, jobs and (particularly in Ukraine, where US security guarantees remain critical) lives, with Denmark’s foreign minister due in Downing Street shortly to discuss options. Though no deal with Trump is to be relied upon, doing them still buys time, no bad idea when dealing with a 79-year-old president increasingly unpopular at home, whose power could be constrained by Democrat advances in this autumn’s midterms. In the longer term, however,Europeurgently needs an escape plan.Any woman ever trapped in a relationship with an abusive man will recognise something in the posture of the US’s smaller, less powerful allies over the past year. The first time he lashes out, you tell yourself that it can’t be what you think it is; that it won’t happen again. Before long, you are tiptoeing over eggshells around him, trying not to say or do anything that makes him explode. But since an angry man will find excuses to be angry, eventually it becomes clear that the only answer is to leave. Yet to get away safely from a vindictive man takes some planning.All those smaller democracies reliant on the US, whether they like it or not – for their defence, for the prosperity of which it has long been the engine, for whatever grudging concessions towards Ukraine’s future security can be extracted even from this White House, or just as a bulwark against whichever more malign superpower would otherwise be pushing them around – need time to build alternative structures before burning down the old ones. Good things could arise from those ashes, including the acceptance on both sides of the Channel that Brexit has died along with the old world order, and that Britain must quickly form some new kind of political, military and trade alliance with its neighbours (though probably one thatfalls short of EU membership, which could take a decade to renegotiate). A far tougher sell, however, for a country where public services are already on their knees, will be the requirement to spend billions more on defence and billions less on everything else – unpalatable choices no British prime minister will make until forced to.For what makes this process infinitely more complicated than ending a marriage is the need to separate president and country. Trump cannot last for ever, and so long as there is any chance of him being succeeded by someone more capable of being reasoned with in 2028, a conclusive final breach with the US makes no sense. The epoch-defining judgment call western governments thus have to make isn’t about the US under Trump, but about whether the US itself is lost to us, for a generation or more. Until that is resolved, the only strategy is to play for time; but plan, all along, for escape.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionTrump administrationEuropeNatoUS foreign policyUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

However, backstage after their menswear show in Milan on Sunday, the duo said the volatile present moment was a difficult one to translate to a collection. “You talk about the world now,” said Prada “or you talk about fashion … The two things together, in this moment, are difficult.”The collection was, therefore, “uncomfortable”. Rather than meaning the clothes were not pleasant to wear – this is luxury fashion, after all – there were disparate elements put together in the same outfit: the top of a red sou’wester over a trenchcoat, for example, or a yellow scoop-neck jumper with cuffs of a shirt falling out the sleeve. (There were also some useful unexpected styling tips, such as wallets stuffed in a back pocket, or brightly coloured shoe laces).View image in fullscreenPrada designer Raf Simons aimed to portray a more ‘youthful’ masculinity.Photograph: WWD/Getty ImagesAsked about the role of the designer now, Simons responded: “We ask ourselves that question every day. [We might not answer it but] the fact that we [ask the] question is important. You cannot be in an ivory tower and not look around.”Simons said the connections between fashion and politics had changed: “In the past, people did react to world situations with the way they dressed, if you go to the 60s or 70s and further back. Now, it’s not directly a reaction [but] we feel like we should not sit still, we want to try.”View image in fullscreenSimons said the deconstructed shirt cuffs was a way to reject the image of the political elite.Photograph: Stefano Rellandini/AFP/Getty ImagesHe pointed to the deconstructed tailoring, as with those shirt cuffs, as one way to reject the image of the political elite. “We don’t want the American corporate kind of masculine power,” said Simons. “No, make it youthful.”“Now is a moment of big changes,” said Prada. “Who knows the future? [But] what do you want to keep? What can you transform? How can you learn from this?” Based on this collection, having more questions than answers has rarely looked so good.Dolce & Gabbana’s show on Saturday has also become a talking point during the menswear shows, thanks to what looks like an entirely white cast of models, despite the show being titled The Portrait of Man.View image in fullscreenDolce & Gabbana was criticised for having what looked like an entirely white cast of models.Photograph: Cinzia Camela/LiveMedia/ShutterstockFashion commentators including Blakely Neiman Thornton, Louis Pisano, Brown Fashion Girl, boringnotcom and Lyas have posted on Instagram about the casting. Lyas posted a video calling it “50 shades of white”, pointing out the “audacity” of the title. With more than 41,000 likes, comments underneath the video showed support for his arguments.This is not the first time Dolce & Gabbana has been at the centre of controversy around race. In 2012, it produced earrings featuring what looked likeBlackamoor figures. In 2016, the brand named a shoe “slave sandal”. And in 2018, there were adverts that featured culturally insensitive images of a Chinese model attempting to eat pasta and cannoli with chopsticks. In response, Stefano Gabbana allegedly sent a direct message on Instagram to a user who had criticised the advert, in which he referred to China as “ignorant dirty smelling mafia”. The brand responded that their Instagram account, and that of Gabbana, had been hacked.At Prada’s last menswear show in June the brandwas called out for cultural appropriationwhen models wore footwear with the distinctive toe-ring design of India’s traditional Kolhapuri sandal, which dates back to the 12th century.After the Maharashtra chamber of commerce complained, Prada’s head of corporate responsibility, Lorenzo Bertelli, responded: “We acknowledge the sandals … are inspired by traditional Indian handcrafted footwear, with a centuries-old heritage.” If Bertelli, the son of Prada, suggested in June the company would be willing to potentially work with Indian artisans on the shoes, no designs as yet are to be found on the brand’s website.Explore more on these topicsMilan fashion weekPradaDolce & GabbanaMen's fashionFashion weeksnewsShareReuse this content"

No one can predict the future, which is a good thing, since if the future were predictable, that would mean we couldn’t change it.Now, not everyone understands the distinction. They think science-fiction writers are oracles. Even some of my colleagues labor under the delusion that we can “see the future”.What we lose when we surrender care to algorithms | Eric ReinhartRead moreThen there are science-fiction fans who believe that they arereadingthe future. A depressing number of those people appear to have become AI bros. These guys can’t shut up about the day that their spicy autocomplete machine will wake up and turn us all intopaperclipshas led many confused journalists and conference organizers to try to get me to comment on the future of AI.That’s something I used to strenuously resist doing, because I wasted two years of my life explaining patiently and repeatedly why I thought crypto was stupid, and getting relentlessly bollocked by cryptocurrency cultists who at first insisted that I just didn’t understand crypto. And then, when I made it clear that Ididunderstand crypto, they insisted that I must be a paid shill.This is literally what happens when you argue with Scientologists, and life is just too short. That said, people would not stop asking – so I’m going to explain what I think about AI and how to be a good AI critic. By which I mean: “How to be a critic whose criticism inflicts maximum damage on the parts of AI that are doing the most harm.”View image in fullscreenAn army of reverse centaursIn automation theory, a “centaur” is a person who is assisted by a machine. Driving a car makes you a centaur, and so does using autocomplete.Areversecentaur is a machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine.For example, an Amazon delivery driver, who sits in a cabin surrounded by AI cameras that monitor the driver’s eyes and take points off if the driver looks in a proscribed direction, and monitors the driver’s mouth because singing is not allowed on the job, and rats the driver out to the boss if they do not make quota.The driver is in that van because the van cannot drive itself and cannot get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance.‘There is no alternative’ means: ‘stop trying to think of an alternative’Obviously, it’s nice to be a centaur, and it’s horrible to be a reverse centaur. There are lots of AI tools that are potentially very centaurlike, but my thesis is that these tools are created and funded for the express purpose of creating reverse centaurs, which none of us want to be.But like I said, the job of a science-fiction writer is to do more than think about what the gadget does, and drill down on who the gadget does itforand who the gadget does itto. Tech bosses want us to believe that there is only one way a technology can be used.Mark Zuckerbergwants you to think that it is technologically impossible to have a conversation with a friend without him listening in. Tim Cook wants you to think that it is impossible for you to have a reliable computing experience unless he gets a veto over which software you install and without him taking30 centsout of every dollar you spend. Sundar Pichai wants you to think that it is for you to find a webpage unless he gets to spy on you from asshole to appetite.This is all a kind of vulgar Thatcherism. Margaret Thatcher’s mantra was: “There is no alternative.” She repeated this so often they called her “Tina” Thatcher: There. Is. No. Alternative.“There is no alternative” is a cheap rhetorical slight. It’s a demand dressed up as an observation. “There is no alternative” means: “stop trying to think of an alternative.”I’m a science-fiction writer – my job is to think of a dozen alternatives before breakfast.So let me explain what I think is going on here with this AI bubble and who the reverse-centaur army is serving, and sort out the bullshit from the material reality.View image in fullscreenHow to pump a bubbleStart with monopolies: tech companies are gigantic and they don’t compete, they just take over whole sectors, either on their own or in cartels.Google and Meta control the ad market. Google and Apple control the mobile market, andGoogle pays Applemore than $20bn a year not to make a competing search engine, and of course, Google has a 90% search market share.Now, you would think that this was good news for the tech companies, owning their whole sector.But it’s actually a crisis. You see, when a company is growing, it is a “growth stock”, and investors really like growth stocks. When you buy a share in a growth stock, you are making a bet that it will continue to grow. So growth stocks trade at a huge multiple of their earnings. This is called the “price to earnings ratio” or “PE ratio”.But once a company stops growing, it is a “mature” stock, and it trades at a muchlowerPE ratio. So for every dollar that Target – a mature company – brings in, it is worth $10. It has a PE ratio of 10, while Amazon has a PE ratio of 36, which means that for every dollar Amazon brings in, the market values it at $36.It’s wonderful to run a company that has a growth stock. Your shares are as good as money. If you want to buy another company or hire a key worker, you can offer stock instead of cash. And stock is very easy for companies to get, because shares are manufactured right there on the premises, all you have to do is type some zeros into a spreadsheet, whiledollarsare much harder to come by. A company can only get dollars from customers or creditors.So when Amazon bids against Target for a key acquisition or a key hire, Amazon can bid with shares they make by typing zeros into a spreadsheet, and Target can only bid with dollars they get from selling stuff to us or taking out loans, which is why Amazon generally wins those bidding wars.That’s theupsideof having a growth stock. But here is the downside: eventually a company has to stop growing. Like, say you get a 90% market share in your sector, how are you going to grow?The primary goal [for tech bosses] is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to growIf you are an exec at a dominant company with a growth stock, you have to live in constant fear that the market will decide that you are not likely to grow any further. Think of what happened to Facebook in the first quarter of 2022. They told investors that they experienced slightly slower growth in the US than they had anticipated, and investorspanicked. They staged a one-day, $240bn sell-off. A quarter-trillion dollars in 24 hours! At the time, it was the largest, most precipitous drop in corporate valuation in human history.That’s a monopolist’s worst nightmare, because once you’re presiding over a “mature” firm, the key employees you have been compensating with stock experience a precipitous pay drop and bolt for the exits, so you lose the people who might help you grow again, and you can only hire their replacements with dollars – not shares.This is the paradox of the growth stock. While you are growing to domination, the market loves you, but once youachievedominance, the market lops 75% or more off your value in a single stroke if they do not trust your pricing power.Which is why growth-stock companies are always desperately pumping up one bubble or another, spending billions to hype the pivot to video or cryptocurrency or NFTs or the metaverse or AI.I am not saying that tech bosses are making bets they do not plan on winning. But winning the bet – creating a viable metaverse – is the secondary goal. The primary goal is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to grow, and to remain convinced until the next bubble comes along.So this iswhythey’re hyping AI: the material basis for the hundreds of billions in AI investment.View image in fullscreenAI can’t do your jobNow I want to talk abouthowthey’re selling AI. The growth narrative of AI is that AI will disrupt labor markets. I use “disrupt” here in its most disreputable tech-bro sense.The promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AI that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself and give the other half to the AI company.That is the $13tn growth story that Morgan Stanley is telling. It’s why big investors are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And becausetheyare piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family’s financial security.Now, if AI could do your job, this wouldstillbe a problem. We would have to figure out what to do with all these unemployed people.But AI can’t do your job. It canhelpyou do your job, but that does not mean it is going to save anyone money.Take radiology: there is some evidence that AI can sometimes identify solid-mass tumors that some radiologists miss. Look, I’ve got cancer. Thankfully, it’s very treatable, but I’ve got an interest in radiology being as reliable and accurate as possible.Let’s say my hospital bought some AI radiology tools and told its radiologists: “Hey folks, here’s the deal. Today, you’re processing about 100 X-rays per day. From now on, we’re going to get an instantaneous second opinion from the AI, and if the AI thinks you’ve missed a tumor, we want you to go back and have another look, even if that means you’re only processing 98 X-rays per day. That’s fine, we just care about finding all those tumors.”The rise of end times fascism | Naomi Klein and Astra TaylorRead moreIf that’s what they said, I’d be delighted. But no one is investing hundreds of billions in AI companies because they think AI will make radiology more expensive, not even if that also makes radiology more accurate. The market’s bet on AI is that an AI salesman will visit the CEO of Kaiser and make this pitch: “Look, you fire nine out of 10 of your radiologists, saving $20m a year. You give us $10m a year, and you net $10m a year, and the remaining radiologists’ job will be to oversee the diagnoses the AI makes at superhuman speed – and somehow remain vigilant as they do so, despite the fact that the AI is usually right, except when it’s catastrophically wrong.“And if the AI misses a tumor, this will be the humanradiologist’sfault, because they are the ‘human in the loop’. It’s their signature on the diagnosis.”This is a reverse centaur, and it is a specific kind of reverse centaur: it is whatDan Daviescalls an “accountability sink”. The radiologist’s job is not really to oversee the AI’s work, it is to take the blame for the AI’s mistakes.This is another key to understanding – and thus deflating – the AI bubble. The AI can’t do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can’t do your job. This is key because it helps us build the kinds of coalitions that will be successful in the fight against the AI bubble.If you are someone who is worried about cancer, and you are being told that the price of making radiology too cheap to meter, is that we are going to have to rehouse America’s 32,000 radiologists, with the trade-off that no one will ever be denied radiology services again, you might say: “Well, OK, I’m sorry for those radiologists, and I fully support getting them job training or UBI or whatever. But the point of radiology is to fight cancer, not to pay radiologists, so I know what side I’m on.”AI hucksters and their customers in the C-suites want the public on their side. They want to forge a class alliance between AI deployers and the people who enjoy the fruits of the reverse centaurs’ labor. They want us to think of ourselves as enemies to the workers.Now, some people will be on the workers’ side because of politics or aesthetics. But if you want to win overallthe people who benefit from your labor, you need to understand and stress how the products of the AI will be substandard. That they are going to get charged more for worse things. That they have a shared material interest with you.Will those products be substandard? There is every reason to think so.Think of AI software generation: there are plenty of coders who love using AI. Using AI for simple tasks can genuinely make them more efficient and give them more time to do the fun part of coding, namely, solving really gnarly, abstract puzzles. But when you listen to business leaders talk about their AI plans for coders, it’s clear they are not hoping to make some centaurs.They want to fire alotof tech workers –500,000 over the past three years– and make the rest pick up their work with coding, which is only possible if you let the AI do all the gnarly, creative problem solving, and then you do the most boring, soul-crushing part of the job: reviewing the AI’s code.And because AI is just a word-guessing program, because all it does is calculate the most probable word to go next, the errors it makes are especially subtle and hard to spot, because these bugs are nearly indistinguishable from working code.For example: programmers routinely use standard “code libraries” to handle routine tasks. Say you want your program to slurp in a document and make some kind of sense of it – find all the addresses, say, or all the credit card numbers. Rather than writing a program to break down a document into its constituent parts, you’ll just grab a library that does it for you.These libraries come in families, and they have predictable names. If it’s a library for pulling in an html file, it might be called something like lib.html.text.parsing; and if it’s a for docx file, it’ll be lib.docx.text.parsing.But reality is messy, humans are inattentive and stuff goes wrong, so sometimes, there will be another library, say, one for parsing pdfs, and instead of being called lib.pdf.text.parsing, it’s called lib.text.pdf.parsing. Someone just entered an incorrect library name and it stuck. Like I said, the world is messy.Now, AI is a statistical inference engine. All it can do is predict what word will come next based on all the words that have been typed in the past. That means that it will “hallucinate” a library called lib.pdf.text.parsing, because that matches the pattern it’s already seen. And the thing is, malicious hackersknowthat the AI will make this error, so they will go out andcreatea library with the predictable, hallucinated name, and that library will get automatically sucked into the AI’s program, and it will do things like steal user data or try to penetrate other computers on the same network.And you, the human in the loop – the reverse centaur – you have to spot this subtle, hard-to-find error, this bug that is indistinguishable from correct code. Now, maybe a senior coder could catch this, because they have been around the block a few times, and they know about this tripwire.But guess who tech bosses want to preferentially fire and replace with AI? Senior coders. Those mouthy, entitled, extremely highly paid workers, who don’t think of themselves as workers. Who see themselves as founders in waiting, peers of the company’s top management. The kind of coder who would lead awalkoutover the company building drone-targeting systems for the Pentagon, which cost Google $10bn in 2018.For AI to be valuable, it has to replacehigh-wage workers, and those are precisely the workers who might spot some of those statistically camouflaged AI errors.If you can replace coders with AI, who can’t you replace with AI? Firing coders is an ad for AI.Can AI do an illustrator’s job? Or any artist’s job?Which brings me to AI art – or “art” – which is often used as an ad for AI, even though it is not part of AI’s business model.Let me explain: on average, illustrators do not make any money. They are already one of the most immiserated, precarious groups of workers out there. If AI image-generators put every illustrator working today out of a job, the resulting wage-bill savings would be undetectable as a proportion of all the costs associated with training and operating image-generators. The total wage bill for commercial illustrators is less than the kombucha bill for the company cafeteria at justoneof OpenAI’s campuses.The purpose of AI art – and the story of AI art as a death knell for artists – is to convince the broad public that AI is amazing and will do amazing things. It is to create buzz. Which is not to say that it is not disgusting that former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told a conference audience that “some creative jobs shouldn’t have been there in the first place”.It’ssupposedto be disgusting. It’s supposed to get artists to run around and say: “The AI can do my job, and it’s going to steal my job, and isn’t thatterrible?“But can AI do an illustrator’s job? Or any artist’s job?Let’s think about that for a second. I have been a working artist since I was 17 years old, when I sold my first short story. Here’s what I think art is: it starts with an artist, who has some vast, complex, numinous, irreducible feeling in their mind. And the artist infuses that feeling into some artistic medium. They make a song, a poem, a painting, a drawing, a dance, a book or a photograph. And the idea is, whenyouexperience this work, a facsimile of the big, numinous, irreducible feeling will materialize inyourmind.But the image-generation program does not knowanythingabout your big, numinous, irreducible feeling. The only thing it knows is whatever you put into your prompt, and those few sentences are diluted across a million pixels or a hundred-thousand words, so that the average communicative density of the resulting work is indistinguishable from zero.It is possible to infuse more communicative intent into a work: writing more detailed prompts, or doing the selective work of choosing from among many variants, or directly tinkering with the AI image after the fact, with a paintbrush or Photoshop or the Gimp. And if there will ever be a piece of AI art that is good art – as opposed to merely striking, interesting or an example of good draftsmanship – it will be thanks to those additional infusions of creative intent by a human.And in the meantime, it’s bad art. It’s bad art in the sense of being “eerie”, the word that cultural theorist Mark Fisher used to describe “when there is something present where there should be nothing, or there is nothing present when there should be something”.AI art is eerie because it seems like there is an intender and an intention behind every word and every pixel, because we have a lifetime of experience that tells us that paintings have painters, and writing has writers. But it is missing something. It has nothing to say, or whatever it has to say is so diluted that it is undetectable.View image in fullscreenExpanding copyright is not the answerWe should not simply shrug our shoulders and accept Thatcherism’s fatalism: “There is no alternative.”So whatisthe alternative? A lot of artists and their allies think they have an answer: they say we should extend copyright to cover the activities associated with training a model.And I am here to tell youthey are wrong. Wrong because this would represent a massive expansion of copyright over activities that are currently permitted – for good reason. I’ll explain:AI training involves scraping a bunch of webpages, which is unambiguously legal under present copyright law. Next, you perform analysis on those works. Basically, you count stuff on them: count pixels and their colors and proximity to other pixels; or count words. This is obviously not something you need a license for.And after you count all the pixels or the words, it is time for the final step: publishing them. Because that is what a model is: a literary work (that is, a piece of software) that embodies a bunch of facts about a bunch of other works, word and pixel distribution information, encoded in a multidimensional array.And again, copyright absolutely does not prohibit you from publishing facts about copyrighted works. And again, no one should want to live in a world where someone else gets to decide which factual statements you can publish.But hey, maybe you think this is all sophistry. Maybe you think I’m full of shit. That’s fine. It wouldn’t be the first time someone thought that.After all, even if I’m right about how copyright works now, there’s no reason we couldn’t change copyright to ban training activities, and maybe there’s even a clever way to wordsmith the law so that it only catches bad things we don’t like, and not all the good stuff that comes from scraping, analyzing and publishing – such as search engines and academic scholarship.Well, even then, you’re not gonna help out creators by creating this new copyright. We have monotonically expanded copyright since 1976, so that today, copyright covers more kinds of works, grants exclusive rights over more uses, and lasts longer.And today, the media industry is larger and more profitable than it has ever been, and also – the share of media industry income that goes to creative workers is lower than it has ever been, both in real terms, and as a proportion of those incredible gains made by creators’ bosses at the media company.When an artist is being devoured by rapacious monopolies, does it matter how they divvy up the meal?In a creative market dominated by five publishers, four studios, three labels, two mobile app stores, and a single company that controls all the ebooks and audiobooks, giving a creative worker extra rights to bargain with is like giving your bullied kid more lunch money.It doesn’t matter how much lunch money you give the kid, the bullies will take it all. Give that kid enough money and the bullies will hire an agency to run a global campaign proclaiming: “Think of the hungry kids! Give them more lunch money!”Creative workers who cheer on lawsuits by the big studios and labels need to remember the first rule of class warfare: things that are good for your boss are rarely what’s good for you.A new copyright to train models will not get us a world where models are not used to destroy artists, it will just get us a world where the standard contracts of the handful of companies that control all creative labor markets are updated to require us to hand over those new training rights to those companies. Demanding a new copyright just makes you a useful idiot for your boss.When really what they’re demanding is a world where 30% of the investment capital of the AI companies go into their shareholders’ pockets. When an artist is being devoured by rapacious monopolies, does it matter how they divvy up the meal?We need to protect artists from AI predation, not just create a new way for artists to be mad about their impoverishment.Incredibly enough, there is a really simple way to do that. After more than 20 years of being consistently wrong and terrible for artists’ rights, the US Copyright Office has finally done something gloriously, wonderfullyright. All through this AI bubble, the Copyright Office has maintained – correctly – that AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted, because copyright is exclusively for humans. That is why the “monkey selfie” is in the public domain. Copyright is only awarded to works of human creative expression that are fixed in a tangible medium.And not only has the Copyright Office taken this position, they have defended it vigorously in court, repeatedly winning judgments to uphold this principle.The fact that every AI-created work is in the public domain means that if Getty or Disney or Universal or Hearst newspapers use AI to generate works – then anyone else can take those works, copy them, sell them or give them away for nothing. And the only thing those companies hate more than paying creative workers, is having other people taketheirstuff without permission.The US Copyright Office’s position means that the only way these companies can get a copyright is topay humansto do creative work. This is a recipe for centaurhood. If you are a visual artist or writer who uses prompts to come up with ideas or variations, that’s no problem, because the ultimate work comes from you. And if you are a video editor who uses deepfakes to change the eyelines of 200 extras in a crowd scene, then sure, thoseeyeballsare in the public domain, but the movie stays copyrighted.But creative workers do not have to rely on the US government to rescue us from AI predators. We can do it ourselves, the way the writers did in their historic writers’ strike. The writers brought the studios to their knees. They did it because they are organized and solidaristic, but also are allowed to do something that virtually no other workers are allowed to do: they can engage in “sectoral bargaining”, whereby all the workers in a sector can negotiate a contract with every employer in the sector.That has been illegal for most workers since the late 1940s, when the Taft-Hartley Act outlawed it. If we are gonna campaign to get a new law passed in hopes of making more money and having more control over our labor, we should campaign to restore sectoral bargaining, not to expand copyright.View image in fullscreenHow to burst the bubbleAI is a bubble and bubbles are terrible.Bubbles transfer the life savings of normal people who are just trying to have a dignified retirement to the wealthiest and most unethical people in our society, and every bubble eventually bursts, taking their savings with it.But not every bubble is created equal. Some bubbles leave behind something productive. Worldcom stole billions from everyday people by defrauding them about orders for fiber optic cables. The CEO went to prison and died there. But the fiber outlived him. It’s still in the ground. At my home, I’ve got 2gb symmetrical fiber, because AT&T lit up some of that old Worldcom dark fiber.It would have been better if Worldcom had not ever existed, but the only thing worse than Worldcom committing all that ghastly fraud would be if there was nothing to salvage from the wreckage.I do not think we will salvage much from cryptocurrency, for example. When crypto dies, what it will leave behind is bad Austrian economics and worse monkey jpegs.AI is a bubble and it will burst. Most of the companies will fail. Most of the datacenters will be shuttered or sold for parts. So what will be left behind?We will have a bunch of coders who are really good at applied statistics. We will have a lot of cheap GPUs, which will be good news for, say, effects artists and climate scientists, who will be able to buy that critical hardware at pennies on the dollar. And we will have the open-source models that run on commodity hardware, AI tools that can do a lot of useful stuff, like transcribing audio and video; describing images; summarizing documents; and automating a lot of labor-intensive graphic editing – such as removing backgrounds or airbrushing passersby out of photos. These will run on our laptops and phones, and open-source hackers will find ways to push them to do things their makers never dreamed of.If there had never been an AI bubble, if all this stuff arose merely because computer scientists and product managers noodled around for a few years coming up with cool new apps, most people would have been pleasantly surprised with these interesting new things their computers could do. We would call them “plugins”.It’s the bubble that sucks, not these applications. The bubble doesn’t want cheap useful things. It wants expensive, “disruptive” things: big foundation models that lose billions of dollars every year.To pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubbleWhen the AI-investment mania halts, most of those models are going to disappear, because it just won’t be economical to keep the datacenters running. As Stein’s law has it: “Anything that can’t go on forever eventually stops.”The collapse of the AI bubble is going to be ugly. Seven AI companies currently account for more than a third of the stock market, and they endlessly pass around the same $100bn IOU.AI is the asbestos in the walls of our technological society, stuffed there with wild abandon by a finance sector and tech monopolists run amok. We will be excavating it for a generation or more.To pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubble: the myth that AI can do your job, especially if you get high wages that your boss can claw back; the understanding that growth companiesneeda succession of ever more outlandish bubbles to stay alive; the fact that workers and the public they serve are on one side of this fight, and bosses and their investors are on the other side.Because the AI bubble reallyisvery bad news, it’s worth fighting seriously, and a serious fight against AI strikes at its roots: the material factors fueling the hundreds of billions in wasted capital that are being spent to put us all on the breadline and fill all our walls with hi-tech asbestos.Cory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist and journalist.

The fightback begins hereThe Friends of AttentionSun 18 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 13.47 ESTShareIn the last 15 years, a linked series of unprecedented technologies have changed the experience of personhood across most of the world. It is estimated thatnearly 70% of the human population of the Earth currently possesses a smartphone, and these devices constitute about95% of internet access-points on the planet.Globally, on average, people seem to spend close tohalf their waking hourslooking at screens, and among young people in the rich world the number is a good deal higher than that.History teaches that new technologies always make possible new forms of exploitation, and this basic fact has been spectacularly exemplified by the rise of society-scale digital platforms. It has been driven by a remarkable new way of extracting money from human beings: call it “human fracking”. Just as petroleum frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergents into the ground to force a little monetisable black gold to the surface, human frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergent into our faces (in the form of endless streams of addictive slop and maximally disruptive user-generated content), to force a slurry of human attention to the surface, where they can collect it, and take it to market.Fracking (of the Earth and of our minds) produces tectonic instability, toxicity and the despoliation of our landscapes, natural and social. We now know that the heedless exploitation of our external environment has been so relentless and irresponsible that human survival on Earth has been placed in actual jeopardy. The new “gold rush” into theinnerenvironment of the human psyche is well on its way to effecting parallel, if even more insidious destruction.The stakes are existential. And that is because, rightly understood, our actual human “attention” – the thing the frackers want, in the form of our eyes on their screens – is nothing less than our ability to care, our ability to think, our ability to give our minds, time and senses to ourselves, the world and each other. To commodify that is to commodify our very beings. The problem isn’t “phones”, and it isn’t “social media”. The problem is human fracking, a world-spanning land-grab into human consciousness – which big tech is treating as a vast, unclaimed territory, ripe for sacking and empire.That’s the bad news. Thegoodnews is that novel forms of exploitation produce novel forms of resistance. What fills the coffers of thesix largest corporations on the planetis nothing other than the stuff of our humanity. Which is to say this new fight for our attention stands in a long line of clashes between those who are willing to reduce people (their labour, their eyeballs) to cash value and those who insist on a higher view of human flourishing. This history is long and complex, and often painful. But it tells us this much: we can fight back. Indeed, we must.We must insist that human attention is ours, and we will use it to make the worlds we want to live inSo what is to be done about this new kind of human exploitation that is harming us – harmingchildrenandadults,compromising our deliberative politicsand ourpsychological wellbeing? Regulatory efforts are piecemeal and actively thwarted by the powerful interests in play. Psychopharmacological fixes for the ever-expanding damage merely monetise the destruction in a complementary way and render us better able to submit to conditions that are palpably at odds with human flourishing. How to confront a problem that is both unspeakably intimate and unthinkably extensive?The answer is clear: we, the actual people of this planet, must come together in decisive solidarity; we must say no to the human frackers, and do so by insisting, in new ways, that human attention is human, and it is ours, and we will use it to make the worlds in which we want to live. In other words, we need amovement.Think that sounds quixotic? Well, keep in mind that’s how actual change actually happens. And it can happen fast. The environmental movement as we know it did not exist in 1950, but by 1970 it was a global force. In 1946 Reynolds Tobacco was using doctors to promote cigarettes. Fewer than 20 years later, the American Medical Association and the US surgeon general publicly averred that smoking caused lung cancer.And the changes get much bigger than that. Precious few do-gooders devoted themselves to environmental politics in 1925. That’s because “environmental politics” wasn’t even a thing. It took a cultural shift (and the work of advocates such as Rachel Carson) across the mid-20th century to establish the physical environment – the unity of land, water, and air that produces shared life – as a politically tractable object around which diverse groups could organise. This is to say that the very structures of politics, not just our beliefs and hopes, are themselves emergent forms. New things come into being, and old things pass away.Where attention is concerned, there are mounting signs that we are reaching an inflection point. People of all sorts, Maga Republicans and Mamdani progressives, hipsters in Portland and evangelicals in Arkansas– people who don’t agree aboutanything– all actually do agree that something is totally wrong with a world in which everyone spends nearly all their time scrolling endlessly through the algorithmic feeds of their social media, a world where military-grade technology and trillion-dollar corporations take aim at children, and feed them whatever it takes to keep them hooked.You can only abuse people so much, and then, eventually, they turn, they rise, they insist onsomething else. Already politicians on theright and the leftare identifying this issue as one that moves the electorate. In 30 years, we will look back, and this era – the wild west of the tech princes’ smash-and-grab into our hearts, souls and relationships – will be difficult to explain to our grandkids. “How did you all let that happen?” they will ask. And we’ll have to say: “It’s hard to explain: it happened before we noticed; it was so much fun, especially at first; it took us time to figure out what was going on … ”But we are figuring it out. We write as representatives of a fast-growing and increasingly well-organised movement, focused on pushing back against the human frackers, and giving shape to a new politics of human attention. At the heart of our efforts? The formation of broadcoalitionsdevoted to the politics of human attention, the practice of diverse forms ofstudythat call forth the life-giving powers of the mind and senses, and the promotion ofsanctuary spacesfor the protection and cultivation of the kinds of attention that make life good. We call this workattention activism.Our claim? That all of us already have the tools to resist the frackers, because all of us already have things we do and care about that put us beyond the reach of the algorithms. We all already know the deepest truth: that true human attentionisn’tthe click and swipe of screen time. True human attention is love, curiosity, daydreaming and taking care of ourselves and others.Yes, new technologies give rise to new kinds of exploitation and resistance. But new forms of exploitation can even give rise to genuinely new forms of politics. You couldn’t brutalise an industrial proletariat before the factory system. Steam engines set the conditions of possibility for this development. They weren’t themselves a “problem”, of course; they gleamed and were precise and powerful. Who could see them operate without awe? But they also created a world in which it was possible to aggregate and extract physical labour from human beings in a revolutionary way. Along the way, they created a new kind of political subject,Homo economicus, a person who had been reduced, in the calculus of modernity, to “labuor value”. Actual revolutions followed – and a new kind of politics was born which reflected a new world of industrial labour, and new forms of labour solidarity, such as unions and workers’ parties.The new system of human fracking is turning all of us into attentional subjects in a powerful new way.Homo attentusis the end user of every networked system – economic, political, expressive. With this new form of life comes, as we have discovered, appalling new vulnerability. But we are on the brink of understanding the new power that has come into our hands in the fracklands. We believe a new kind of politics beckons. What will it look like? It is hard to say. And there are reasons to be fearful. But if we, the people, can take up the banner of a new kind of freedom movement – a movement for the true freedom of attention itself, what we callattensity– and deploy our truly human attention in new ways, with a new understanding of the stakes, we can defy the frackers, and insist on creating, together, a human world.D Graham Burnettis professor of history atPrinceton University.Alyssa Lohis a film-maker.

At times, he lifted weights for up to four hours a day, aiming to get as muscular and lean as possible. The ideal he was chasing? “If you grab your eyelid and feel that skin,” he says, “that’s the skin thinness you want on your bum and abs.”That quest became an obsession: “How can I push myself to these extreme points, and then do it again and again and become better than last time?” He followed unsafe protocols shared by bodybuilding gurus to make his muscles pop, dangerously dehydrating his body ahead of competitions. He ate six to 10 times a day, restricting his diet to foods considered “clean” by the community at the time: sweet potato, brown rice, broccoli and boiled chicken breast. He skipped his own birthday for years to avoid eating off-plan and took scales to Christmas dinner to weigh out his turkey. “There were a lot of dysmorphic associations around food,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘I had negative body image and confidence issues’: Teo in 2015.Photograph: courtesy of Eugene TeoHis body became a project – one he focused his entire life around, with little room for flexibility, let alone fun. “The driving force behind my bodybuilding was negative body image and confidence issues,” he says. “I alienated myself. I lost friendships. I lost partners.”His mum often asked him, “Why can’t you eat what I eat? Why are you not having my cooking?” Alone at home, he viewed his body like a critical enemy. Even at his most muscular, he saw only flaws. “I couldn’t even wear clothes without thinking, ‘How do my shoulders feel in this? How do my arms feel?’”The realisation came slowly to Teo, but his body was screaming for a life overhaul. “I could lift a lot of weight. I looked exceptional,” he says. “But I was out of breath from simple tasks.” Walking across the gym with clients gave him lower back pain. Even tying his shoes required him to brace himself. “The sheer size of my body wasn’t supporting all the systems appropriately,” he says.Teo changed his training, shifting the focus from muscle size alone to mobility, power and cardiovascular endurance – adding running, stretching, jumping and cycling to his routine. He began to ask himself whether his extreme mindset was making him happy, accepting that “this is now an obsessive trait in my personality, and it’s not bringing me joy”.A decade later, his focus is on his relationships and work as a YouTube fitness coach and app developer, rather than his body. He no longer works out every day and, while he still eats well, he’s more relaxed about it. “If I’m out with my daughter and she wants an ice‑cream, I’ll have one with her.”His body has changed. “It’s definitely smaller,” he says. He has lost around 15kg of muscle. “But performance-wise, feeling-wise – it’s night and day better. I can move better. I’m more athletic around my daughter.” He can jump twice as high as before and can run 5km in 22 minutes. (He couldn’t even complete a 5km run when he was competing. His first took 40 minutes.)“Ten years ago, my body was capable of turning heads on the street,” he says. “That was fun – but it was the only thing it was capable of.” Now, he says, it’s built for function.Eugene Teo is@coacheugeneteoon YouTube and founder of the fitness appGanbaru Method.Explore more on these topicsBody imageChanged body, changed lifeHealth & wellbeingFitnessWeightliftingMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He said that security in the high north is a priority for all Nato allies in order to protect Euro-Atlantic interests,” a Downing Street summary of the calls said. “He also said that applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is wrong.”The firm stance could place Starmer on a collision course with the US after Trump said he would place sanctions on eight European nations, including the UK, that have deployed troops to Greenland in response to US threats over its future.A joint statement by the affected countries on Sunday said Trump’s threats “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral”.On Monday, Starmer will use an emergency Downing Street statement to reiterate the UK’s disappointment at the threat of US tariffs.Calling off a planned event outside London focused on the cost of living, the prime minister was instead due to fully line the UK up with European opposition to Trump’s plan, which has caused shock waves throughout the EU and Nato.At a Downing Street press conference on Monday morning, Starmer will echo the sentiment with robust language of his own. But he is not expected to push for reciprocal tariffs or other retaliatory measures.Starmer is also expected to stress the importance of UK ties with allies like the US, with officials hoping his unexpectedly good relationship with Trump thus far, which has seen the UK evade some earlier US tariffs, could help instigate a climbdown by the White House.Every major UK party has condemned Trump’s threat to apply 10% tariffs from 1 February on the UK, France, Germany,Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Finland, rising to 25% on 1 June if a deal to buy Greenland has not been reached. This includes Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, which is most closely aligned with the US president.A graph showing the trade in goods to and from the US with countries Trump has targeted with fresh tariffsBut Starmer will face pressure to push back harder against Trump, in an acceptance that a normal relationship with his administration is effectively impossible.The Liberal Democrats are pushing for an emergency Commons debate and for the scrapping of a pharmaceuticals deal with Washington, while some Labour MPs want a more overtly Europe-leaning stance.Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, who was the government minister tasked with media interviews on Sunday, refused to be drawn on the prospect of responses like retaliatory tariffs, saying that rather than “shout and yell”, the aim was to have serious but private talks with the US administration.But she said there would be no climbdown on the central point: “Our position on Greenland is non-negotiable. We’ve made that very clear and we’ll continue to make that clear. President Trump’s position on Greenland is different. Notwithstanding that, it is in our collective interest to work together and not to start a war of words.”Asked to confirm that the UK would never accept the US idea of annexation, Nandy told Sky News: “Yes, of course. The prime minister was very clear that we believe that this decision on tariffs is completely wrong. The future of Greenland is for the people of Greenland and the people of the kingdom of Denmark to determine and for them alone.“We’ve been consistent about that. That is a view that we’ve expressed to our friends and allies in the American administration.”Starmer has consistently sought to engage with and, if needed, openly court and flatter Trump, most notably in early 2025 when he used a visit to the White House tooffer the US presidentan unprecedented second state visit to the UK.He has subsequently met Trump at several global summits and fielded numerous calls from him, someseemingly madeon the spur of the moment by the US president. Trump regularly says he likes Starmer, an affection the prime minister privately admits hecannot fully explain.UK officials insist this has brought benefits, in terms of trade arrangements with the US and also in allowing Starmer to act as a bridge between Washington and other Nato members over Ukraine and the importance of US support and security guarantees against Russia.But there has been an awareness that the capricious US leader could blow up relations at any point.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandKeir StarmerDonald TrumpDenmarkEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

While Rosindell is notably lower profile than Jenrick, the departure of another sitting MP is a blow to the Tories.Tory defectors: who has already joined Reform UK and who may follow?Read moreIn his statement, Rosindell said he had been a long-term advocate for the rights of Chagossians removed from the island of Diego Garcia in 1971 to allow the construction of a large UK-US airbase.Both Labour and the Conservatives “have been complicit in the surrender of this sovereign British territory to a foreign power”, he wrote, criticising the decision earlier in January to order Conservative peers to not vote down the bill setting out the Chagos deal.He said: “Sadly, I now believe that the Conservative party is irreparably bound to the mistakes of previous governments and unwilling to take meaningful accountability for the poor decisions made over so many issues.“Following a conversation earlier this evening with Nigel Farage, I have therefore agreed to join Reform UK as its seventh member of parliament. It is clear to me that Reform UK is now the only political movement that is genuinely willing to fight for the best interests of the United Kingdom.”He added: “Radical action is now required to reverse the damaging decisions of the past and to forge a new course for Britain – one that firmly places the interests of the British people first.”The 59-year-old is the third sitting Tory MP to defect, the East Wiltshire MP, Danny Kruger, havingsigned up to Reformin September.The former cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi, who is no longer an MP, wasannounced by Farageas another defector on Monday. Jenrick’s departure after months of secret talks with Farage was forced on Thursday after Badenoch’s team learned of his plans and he was sacked from his shadow ministerial role and lost the party whip.A Tory party source told the Press Association that Rosindell had threatened to defect for months but denied he was doing so until as recently as Saturday.“The Conservative party supported Rosindell throughout his many troubles,” the source said. “And he’s responded by stabbing his friends, colleagues and activists in the back. Reform are welcome to him.”In a statement, Farage said of Rosindell: “Andrew is a great patriot. The Tories’ lies and hypocrisy over theChagos Islandsbetrayal has tipped him over the edge, and we are delighted to welcome him to our ranks.”After Jenrick’s move, Farage announced that the deadline for any other defectors to join his party would be 7 May, the date of elections to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, and to councils aroundEngland.Explore more on these topicsReform UKEnglandChagos IslandsConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

They were met by hundreds of counterprotesters, who covered Lang in aerosol string, doused him in water in freezing cold temperatures and chased him off to jeers. However, images of Lang and one of his five supporters bleeding after scuffles with demonstrators were eagerly shared online as evidence of violent chaos in Minneapolis.The city’s mayor, Jacob Frey, said on Sunday that any military deployment would be “ridiculous” and only exacerbate tensions in Minnesota’s largest city, where the Trump administration has already sent 3,000 immigration and border patrol officers who have been confronted by largely peacefulprotests.“That would be a shocking step,” Frey told NBC News. “We don’t need more federal agents to keep people safe. We are safe.”Confrontations between federal officers and protesters in the city intensified after the killing of Good, which theTrump administrationhas called justified.Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, told CBS News on Sunday that Frey should set up “a peaceful protest zone” for demonstrators. The aim of the protesters, however, is not to simply voice their dissent but to make life difficult for the immigration enforcement officers, by jeering them and blowing whistles to alert their immigrant neighbors to their presence.Trumphasrepeatedlyinvokedan unrelated scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending in immigration agents. The president and administration officials havesingledoutthe state’s community of Somali immigrants.ICE agents are targeting other immigrant communities in the Twin Cities as well. On Sunday, agents entered a St Paul house and removed an elderly man who was wearing only underwear and a blanket as onlookers shouted at them to leave. The man was a member of the Hmong community, which came to the region from Laos starting in the 1970s after siding with the US in the Vietnam war. About one-third of the US Hmong population are immigrants, according to thePew Research Center.If active-duty troops are deployed, it is unclear whether the Trump administration would formally invoke the Insurrection Act, which gives the president the power to deploy the military or federalize state national guard troops to quell domestic uprisings. Even without invoking the act, a president can deploy active-duty forces for certain domestic purposes such as protecting federal property, which Trump cited as a justification forsendingmarines to Los Angeles last year.In addition to the active-duty forces, the Pentagon could also attempt to deploy newly created national guard rapid-response forces for civil disturbances. “The Department of War is always prepared to execute the orders of the commander-in-chief if called upon,” said Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell, using the Trump administration’spreferredname for the department of defense.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the order, which was first reported by ABC News.As Minnesotans joke the federal invasion of their state in winter echoing Napoleon’s doomed invasion of Russia and share images of ICE officers slipping on ice, the soldiers subject to deployment specialize in cold-weather operations and are based in Alaska, the officials said.Trump sent the surge of federal agents to Minneapolis and neighboring St Paul early this month, as part of a wave of interventions across the US, mainly to cities run by Democratic politicians, includingLos Angeles,ChicagoandPortland, Oregon, all in states that voted against him in the previous three presidential elections.Trumpcalledthe deployments necessary to protect federal property and personnel from protesters. But this month he said he wasremovingthe national guard from Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, where the deployments have faced legal setbacks and challenges.Local leaders have accused the president of federal overreach and of exaggerating isolated episodes of violence to justify sending in troops. Minnesota’s governor,Tim Walz, who, along with the Minneapolis mayor, is reportedly thetargetof a federal criminal investigation for allegedly impeding immigration raids, has mobilized the state’s national guard to support local law enforcement and the rights of peaceful demonstrators, the state’s department of public safetyannouncedon Saturday.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryMinnesotaMinnesota ICE shootingMinneapolisTrump administrationDonald TrumpICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)newsShareReuse this content"

He added that recent events – namely an Islamistattack on a synagoguein Manchester and what he described aswidespreadantisemitismfollowing the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 – had led him to believe that British Jews should be given the option of sanctuary in the US.Western alliance hangs in balance as Europe stiffens itself against Trump’s threatsRead moreSome supporters ofIsraelin the UK cast mass demonstrations there against the Israeli response to the 2023 attack, in which tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians were killed in Gaza, as motivated by antisemitism.In aUS television interviewin late 2023, Garson himself called protesters in New York and Los Angeles who opposed the Israeli response “marauding mobs” and accused them of “masquerading as protesters” to shout “antisemitic chants baying for Jewish blood”.In the new interview with the Telegraph, Garson said he could see “no future” for Jews in the UK and placed much of the responsibility on to British prime minister Keir Starmer, accusing him of allowing antisemitism to grow.Garson, a former British barrister who practiced in London before relocating to the US in 2008, told the Telegraph: “The UK is no longer a safe place for Jews. I have spoken to the state department as to whether the president should be offering British Jews asylum in the US.”He went on to say that such a proposition is attractive because “it is a highly educated community”. “It is a populous that speaks English natively, that is educated and doesn’t have a high proportion of criminals,” Garson said.He added: “When I look at what is going on with Jews in Britain, and when I look at the changing demographics, I don’t believe – and I have discussed this with people in theTrump administration– that there is a future for Jews in the United Kingdom.“For me, that is particularly sad.”Israelis demonised as a ‘vehicle for hatred of Jews’, says UK terror laws watchdogRead moreGarson said he raised the idea of the US acting as a refuge for British Jews with Trump’s special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, Yehuda Kaploun, in his role as a board member of the US Holocaust Memorial Council. Trump appointed Garson to the council in May after dismissing board members who had been appointed during Joe Biden’s presidency.Trump previously hired Garson to pursue a$50m lawsuitagainst investigative journalist Bob Woodward that wasdismissed.A 2025 survey conducted by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research found that feelings of safety in the UK’s Jewish community havedeclined sharplyin recent years. It found 35% of Jews felt unsafe in Britain in 2025, compared with 9% in 2023 before the Hamas attacks and the protests in Britain against the Israeli assault on Gaza.Perceptions of antisemitism had also intensified, with 47% of British Jews seeing it as a “very big” problem – up from just 11% in 2012.In October, the Trump administration hadannouncedthat it planned to restrict the number of refugees it admits into the US in 2026 to just 7,500 – and those spots would be mostly reserved forwhite South Africans. It wasn’t immediately clear how British Jews would factor into that figure should the US grant them refuge.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS immigrationAntisemitismJudaismReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

The bill will still return to the Commons for its report stage and third reading as planned.Withdraw Hillsborough law amendment, urge Liverpool and Manchester mayorsRead moreThe government has performed a series of recent U-turns on controversial policy areas, includingfarmers’ inheritance tax,digital ID cardsandbusiness rates for pubs. A government spokesperson said the decision was intended “to make sure the bill is the strongest it can possibly be, without compromising national security”.The campaign group Hillsborough Law Nowsaid in a post on X: “We welcome the government listening to the campaign, families, MPs and supporters by withdrawing their security services amendment.“We shall engage further with government to ensure the bill fully applies to the security services whilst not jeopardising national security.”The new legislation has been prompted by the campaigning of families bereaved in the 1989 disaster at Sheffield Wednesday’s Hillsborough stadium where 97 people died as a result of a crush at the FA Cup semi-final betweenLiverpooland Nottingham Forest.In the aftermath of the disaster, South Yorkshire police mounted a concerted effort to blame Liverpool supporters, alleging misbehaviour at the match. After a 27-year battle by families to establish the truth, an inquest in 2016 found that the men, women and child wereunlawfully killed due to gross negligence manslaughter by the South Yorkshire police officer in command, and that a catalogue of failings by police and the ambulance services contributed to their deaths. The inquest jury also concluded that no behaviour by football supporters contributed to the disaster.Speaking on Sunday before the amendment was pulled, MPs who opposed it argued that it could do real harm to Labour’s reputation with campaign groups. Ian Byrne, the MP for Liverpool West Derby, said that promises made to those who lost their loved ones at Hillsborough would be broken if the amendment was included, which he described as “untenable and unacceptable”.“Families of people who were killed at Hillsborough went to the Labour party conference and were on the stage with the prime minister,” said Byrne. “Commitments were made to them in person and there was a lot of political capital made out of them. And now that promise to them must be delivered.”Byrne, who was at Hillsborough with his father on the day of the disaster, said that as a survivor he had expected the prime minister to keep his word for the law to be “implemented without being watered down”.The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who was born in Liverpool, called the proposed law with the amendment included “a Hillsborough law, but not the Hillsborough Law”.Labour MPs could rebel over Hillsborough law after talks with families break downRead moreMcDonnell warned of a risk of “almost permanent damage to the Labour party” and added: “We need a few experienced, calm heads to come together and think. We’re now in a situation where we’re hoping the government just pauses tomorrow and doesn’t try to force the bill through, because at the moment it’s looking like a complete car crash.”Paula Barker, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree, said the government’s insistence on the amendment would feel like “the ultimate betrayal” to the people of Liverpool.“Let’s just get it right the first time,” she said. “Let’s stop ripping the party apart because, quite frankly, that’s what’s happening. The frontbench is ripping our party apart.”A government spokesperson said: “This legislation will right the wrongs of the past, changing the balance of power to ensure the state can never hide from the people it should serve and putting a legal duty on officials to respond openly and honestly when things go wrong.“The bill will make the police, intelligence agencies and the whole of government more scrutinised than they have ever been, but we can never compromise on national security.“We will continue to work with all parties to make sure the bill is the strongest it can possibly be, without compromising national security.”Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterLabourLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

South East Water has faced heavy criticism from MPs and the public aftera similar outagebefore Christmas left 24,000 people in Tunbridge Wells without drinking water for two weeks.A fault at a treatment works on Saturday left 4,500 homes in villages outside Maidstone with no water or low water pressure. By Sunday night, South East Water said the issue had been fixed and that normal service was expected to resume overnight.Another 800 homes in Linton near Maidstone had similar issues on Sunday after a burst main, with repairs due to take place overnight. And 320 homes were still dealing with disrupted water supply in Bidborough, five days after South East Water first reported a power outage.On Sunday evening, another burst main between Maidstone and Ashford left 500 homes that had already been hit by the treatment works failure with no water or low pressure. The water company has been arranging bottled water stations in Maidstone, Ashford and Tunbridge Wells.It was alsorevealedthis week that the treatment centre failure in November was foreseen weeks before it happened and could have been stopped, according to the regulator. Marcus Rink, the chief inspector at the Drinking Water Inspectorate, told MPs the problem had begun on 9 November when there was a “noticeable deterioration” at the plant and the company had also failed to do proper testing.The environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, has called on Ofwat toreview the company’s licence to operate. The water regulator has launched an investigation into whether South East Water had “complied with its obligation to provide high standards of customer service and support for its customers”.South East Water’s chief executive, David Hinton, has faced calls to resign and refuse his bonus for this financial year. But the water boss, who earned £457,000 in the year to June 2025, is still in line for a£400,000 long-term bonusregardless of his performance, if he stays in the job until 2030.South East Water’s incident manager, Matthew Dean, said: “We’re sorry to customers currently impacted by the water supply interruptions across our network in Kent.“Elsewhere, tankers are still being used to inject water into storage tanks across Kent to continue balancing the network. Our leak repair teams are working around the clock to fix the leaks and bursts across Kent and Sussex, with extra resources available to help carry out repairs.”Explore more on these topicsKentWater industryEnglandUtilitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Someone gets killed, suspects abound, the detectives pootle around for a bit, then the culprit is caught and everyone forgets about what they just watched. No harm in that. A select few, however, are so good they break out of their category: the likes of Happy Valley and Line of Duty do have cops collecting clues to try to nail a villain, but are so well made they leave regular crime behind and rise up to mix it with the swankiest prestige dramas.Then there are the shows that are somewhere in between. Premium genre pieces, you could call them: they stick to the template of sleuthfests that air on weeknights on terrestrial channels at 9pm, and can be enjoyed purely on that level, but they’re pushing at the edges, adding quality where they could easily not bother. Unforgotten is one; in 2024, the first season of writer Mick Ford’s Yorkshire-set series After the Flood was another.After the Flood’s main trick is simply that there is a lot going on. In season one, its hero, Jo Marshall (Sophie Rundle), was a junior police officer applying her strong morals to a murder case she wasn’t assigned to, without telling her more senior cop husband what she was up to. She did that while heavily pregnant, in a way that exposed deep historic corruption in her department – all this in the aftermath of a flood in her perpetually rained-on home town that enabled the script to make a powerful, but not hectoring, point about the climate crisis and the way communities in the north of England have been left defenceless against rising waters. The finale, which had a second flood, the birth of Jo’s baby, the solution of the murder and the unveiling of the corrupt kingpin’s identity, was a belter.Now we’re a year on. Jo is a proper detective. She is separated from her baby’s father, Pat (Rundle’s real-life other half, Matt Stokoe), but together they’ve vowed to bring down the bent cop who secretly runs the town. Then a body turns up on the moors, which must be connected either to a chemicals company dumping nasty stuff in the river, or to the burning of heather on the uplands (which, as has shockingly been the case in reality in 21st-century Britain, is done to facilitate grouse shooting, with the loss of vegetation leaving the normal working people who live further down the valley more vulnerable to floods), or to the fly-tipping of commercial waste on farmland, or all three. Oh, and someone is going round town daubing a red X on random buildings, in protest at we know not what.Rundle remains luminous in the lead role, her Jo a beacon of sympathy and curiosity in a place where almost everyone else keeps their head down as either villain or victim. That she now lives with her widowed mother Molly means we get more of the lovely dynamic between Rundle and the star of the supporting cast, Lorraine Ashbourne: Jo and Mo are right at the point in the parent/child relationship where who looks after whom is in flux. Molly’s encyclopaedic knowledge of the whole town’s business going back decades, meanwhile, makes her a neat sidekick when Jo’s investigations stall, and her big mouth and ever-twitching bullshit detector have now propelled her on to the local council, where she allows the show to explore how poorly equipped local authorities are to protect the environment.After the Flood is still beyond the average crime saga where the discovery of a corpse stirs up buried secrets in a town with sad inhabitants and awful weather, but maintaining a premium genre piece is a delicate business. Indulge those tropes too much and they will pull you back down. Season two retreads similar ground rather than moving its formula on: its subplots are reactions to the darkest surprises of the first run and are less intriguing than the original revelations, while the murder case – which sees Jo working with a friendly, inherently trustworthy new partner, Sam (Jill Halfpenny) – replaces season one’s death in the flood that wasn’t actually a drowning with a body full of shotgun pellets that isn’t actually a shooting. It’s the same again, only less so. Jo is in danger of pootling from clue to clue and from suspect to suspect like any other TV cop.Also, this may sound churlish but: there’s no flood. The impressive set piece that opened the first run announced that the show was aiming higher, and the lack of an equivalent here signals that those sights have been slightly lowered. After the Flood has begun to drift.After the Flood aired on ITV1 and is onITVXnow in the UK and on BritBox in Australia.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

What is causing the outbreak, and is there anything we can do about it?Emily RetterSun 18 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTShareLouise (not her real name) is listing the contents of a bin liner she has packed with fresh essentials in case of emergency. Clothes, toothbrushes, hairbrushes, a teddy … “Although it should be two teddies,” she re-evaluates, quickly. I can hear her trying to quell her panic.A diehard survivalist preparing for catastrophe? Actually, a beleaguered 44-year-old mother recovering from scabies – an itchy rash caused by microscopic mites that burrow under human skin. Far-fetched as it sounds, emergency evacuation is exactly what she, her partner and children (six and four) resorted to in November in a desperate bid to beat the bugs. She is now on tenterhooks in case they return.Telltale spots had appeared in September, first on her own body, later on her son’s and daughter’s. Two rounds of topical treatment followed, alongside a frantic maelstrom of laundry. They were washing clothes and bedding after every use, as well as steaming mattresses, duvets and sofas, churning through hundreds of disposable gloves, “boiling the kids’ crocs”, and quarantining anything else they could think of in bin bags. When all those measures failed, it was time for the nuclear option: they took the kids out of school for a week and rented a caravan near their home in south-west England. They changed into fresh clothes at the door of their home, then travelled by steam-cleaned car, before repeating treatment for a third time. A fresh teddy was needed for their daughter on arrival, and a replacement before leaving.“It was hell,” she says. “My mental health was in the pan, the scratching, the itching drives you insane, and the cleaning and laundry, and you feel you can’t talk to anybody …” She apologises, fearing she might sound crazed. “It affected our lives so horrendously, I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.”View image in fullscreenThe telltale scabies rash.Photograph: Irina Starikova/Getty ImagesWhile extreme, their experience is becoming less of a rarity. If you don’t know someone with the condition, a glance at social media reveals many posts, dogged by the same desperation. They read like SOS calls. Many have endured a very itchy Christmas and can’t see the end. “Please help if you can!” pleads one. “I’m writing this in tears, I’ve had scabies for almost a month now.” Another says she is “not sleeping at all”; still another “I feel like my skin is on fire. I have done so much washing … I feel really low.”Although it sounds like a long-ago disease – the Roman author Aulus Cornelius Celsus is said to have first named the condition in 25 AD–it seems very much at home in the present day. And, since the pandemic, case numbers have been far higher, leaving many doctors, ahem, scratching their heads.A 2024report from the UK Health Security Agencyfound annual increases from 2021, growing even more significantly since 2023. Scabies is sometimes mistaken for an STI because the groin is one of the most commonly affected areas, and the agency analysed those presenting with scabies at sexual health services – finding a 44% increase in diagnoses between 2023 and 2024 (4,872 in 2024, up from 3,393). The years leading to the pandemic saw a relatively stable 1,500 cases annually, and restrictions on socialising during the pandemic led to a decrease.Likewise, figures from the Royal College of General Practitioners’ Research and Surveillance Centre show a rise in scabies, especially in autumn and winter months when people spend more time indoors, and return to schools and universities.Its weekly report for Englandconfirms that cases remain stubbornly higher than the five-year national average – peaking at almost double across the final four months of last year. Cases in the north of England are higher still.Yet few people affected by scabies will initially know anything about the condition – that it is caused by the human mitesarcoptes scabiei var hominis, which is invisible to the eye and burrows into skin at a rate of 0.5 to 5mm a day. There, the females lay their eggs, which hatch after three to four days. Symptoms can take four to six weeks to develop – allowing the bugs to lurk undetected while those affected are most contagious.View image in fullscreenComputer artwork of scabies mites (Sarcoptes scabei) burrowing into the skin.Photograph: SCIEPRO/Getty Images/Science Photo Library RFWhen they do finally appear, the key symptoms are itchy bumps and “burrows” or thin lines – tunnels where the female has dug down. They can appear everywhere, but are usually found in skin creases such as between the fingers; they do not often appear on the head, except in young children and elderly people. A rarer form, crusted scabies, which usually affects those with weakened immune systems, is much more visible.The mites are often transferred through prolonged skin-to-skin contact with other humans, but they can survive outside the body for up to 36 hours. The NHS advises washing all bedding and clothing “at 60C or higher, and if possible in a hot dryer” and putting “clothing that can not be washed in a sealed bag for at least three days until the mites die”. It also stresses the need to avoid sexual or close physical contact until treatment has ended, and to avoid sharing bedding, clothing and towels. Work and school can be resumed once treatment has begun.Louise hopes she is now in the “post scabies itch” phase, which can, confusingly, continue for a few weeks after the mites die. Her children have recovered. When she first discovered symptoms, she was shocked. “I first thought of it as a dirty thing,” she says. “I was ashamed.” In fact, scabies has no connection to poor hygiene.Louise’s GP prescribed permethrin, a synthetic insecticide which can also be bought at pharmacies. The cream must be applied across the body and left for eight to 12 hours before washing – in two doses, a week apart. Cohabitants and close physical contacts are advised to follow the same treatment. However, after this first treatment, Louise’s spots spread across her body and her son also developed a spot, so she returned to the GP about a month later, receiving even more permethrin.Meanwhile, their home became a battleground. “It was bin bags and bin bags of washing every day … the dryer and washing machine were going day in, day out,” she says. It was only during this second treatment period that they realised they had to bag up coats, hats, shoes … “Nobody told us about that stuff.”View image in fullscreenScabies bumps can appear anywhere but are usually found in skin creases, such as between the fingers.Photograph: airdone/Getty ImagesRegardless, her daughter then showed symptoms and Louise wasn’t improving. By mid-November, she pleaded to try other remedies: another insecticide cream, malathion, plus ivermectin, an anti-parasitic oral tablet treatment – all of which she tried. GPs tend not to prescribe ivermectin first, because, although it is easier to use, it is not considered more effective, and it is expensive. This was when Louise bought “the cheapest” essentials and booked the caravan (“we have over £1,000 on the credit card”), telling only a trusted few people. Her sister had to do a mercy dash with plastic ponchos when they realised they’d forgotten coats.Amanda Rushton, 55, who lives in north-west England, recounts a longer battle. Her family fought scabies for about 10 months, from October 2024 until last August. She still sounds weary. She first developed it after providing care for her late mother, who she believes caught scabies in hospital. She, her son, 13, who has Down’s syndrome, and daughter, 12, used permethrin twice, did laundry up to 10 times a day, and even bagged up sofa cushions, but her condition didn’t clear up. She finally bought another topical cream online, benzyl benzoate, which isn’t routinely prescribed by UK GPs.Symptoms kept reappearing, and by last June they also appeared on her son. “He was scratching all the time, he couldn’t sleep, his sheets were full of blood. He was crying every time I put the cream on,” she says. “It actually destroys you because you’re constantly checking your skin and then having to do all the washing … I wouldn’t let anyone come into my house.”Experts are grappling for reasons for scabies’ growing prevalence. One possible factor is that there were shortages of permethrin and malathion two years ago, due to supply chain issues. Dr Donald Grant, a GP who practises in a Welsh NHS surgery and privately as a senior clinician atThe Independent Pharmacy, believes there could still be a knock-on effect. After the pandemic, people started mixing again, which, he says, “could have influenced a rise in scabies, made worse by the frequent stock issues surrounding important treatments, leading to a potential ‘ping-pong’ effect where individuals are continuously reinfested within households or close groups of friends”.However, Michael Marks, Professor of Medicine at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the former chair of the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies, stresses that “the reasons for the ongoing rise … are unclear.” He says “similar trends” are being seen across Europe and that likely reasons include “outbreaks in crowded settings such as halls of residence and hostels”.These are perhaps exacerbated by “delays in people being able to access care, and inadequate tracing and treatment of their contacts”. He says the strain on NHS GP waiting lists, leading to delayed treatment, lack of guidance and redirection to pharmacies, may also contribute to the problem. “Probably all of this plays a role,” he says. Some social media posts report frustration at initial misdiagnoses, often of dermatitis or eczema. One woman says her daughter “was tortured” with symptoms for a year before she received the correct treatment.There has been talk of the mites becoming resistant to permethrin, although Marks says trials still find it to be highly effective if used properly. “There have been a small number of more plausible reports that there is some possible resistance,” he says. “But most treatment failure is likely to be due to ‘pseudo-resistance’: this means it fails not because of the product itself, but because it is so difficult to actually apply cream on your whole body and keep it on for 12 hours, and because, most of the time, we aren’t successful at finding and treating all (our) contacts.”View image in fullscreenA computer-generated image of a scabies mite, which can survive outside the body for up to 36 hours.Photograph: Science Photo Library/AlamyYoung people, who are more likely to live in communal settings, appear to be affected the most. The UKHealthSecurity Agency report found 41% of scabies diagnoses in sexual health services in 2024 were in people aged 20 to 24. John (not his real name), in London, is one of them. The 20-year-old, who works in hospitality, lives with his family, but it was after he began seeing a new partner in late October that he started showing symptoms. He later learned her house had recently suffered a scabies outbreak.Dr Lea Solman, consultant paediatric dermatologist at Great Ormond Street hospital, flags embarrassment as one of the key hurdles she encounters. “The shame around scabies is one of the biggest obstacles we face in controlling outbreaks,” she says. “It stops people seeking help quickly, and it stops them having the difficult conversations needed to ensure everyone gets treated at the same time.” Solman sees the same stumbling block in parents of babies, who are particularly vulnerable. “Parents often feel deeply ashamed when their baby has scabies and that shame intensifies when they inevitably catch it themselves.”John’s distress is clear. Itching interrupts his sleep; he wakes in blood-stained sheets. “I’m going to have quite significant scarring from this as well,” he says. “My sleep has taken such a blow and I’m going a bit loopy.” He knows 10 young people who have had scabies, but says it has become too much of a joke within student circles. “It doesn’t quite do justice to how much it affects you: this has taken a really big toll on my mental health and self-esteem,” he says.What is norovirus and how contagious is it?Read moreProfessor Tess McPherson of the British Association of Dermatologists says freshers’ week has become a peak transmission time. She knows patients who have left university because they can’t cope, some trying treatment up to 10 times. As John says: “No one, as a student living on their maintenance loan, has the money to be washing their clothes every single day, or to buy a steamer. I’m lucky I still live at home.”“We’re never going to completely eliminate scabies,” says McPherson. But scrupulous treatment should be taken seriously. “You can get infections in the skin from all the scratching,” she says. “In rare cases that can lead to renal disease.”In Kingston-Upon-Thames, south-west London, Dr Lewis Haddow, consultant in HIV and sexual health at Kingston Hospital NHS foundation trust, is “seeing scabies all the time.” The majority of patients are young, heterosexual men, which he can’t explain. Scabies is not an STI, but, as with John’s case, patients often show up at STI clinics when their GPs’ insecticidal prescriptions don’t appear to be working. “Sometimes their GPs have specifically recommended they contact us.” The fact that medics often don’t see scabies as their area may be part of the problem, he believes. “Nobody really owns it,” he says.There is certainly a wretched sense of going it alone among sufferers. “I had been researching and researching. I’d been on the scabies Facebook page near enough daily because I was just desperate,” Louise says. Now, she just hopes she will not have to go through it all over again.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There has been a cultural shift and it is now cool to be a gamer, especially since a lot of celebrities proudly admit they are gamers.”He cited as examples Henry Cavill, the Superman star who has been voted sexiest man in the world, and is slated to star in the upcoming Amazon-produced Warhammer film and TV series. Other famous fans include Ed Sheeran and Fast & Furious actor Vin Diesel.Warhammer collectors build large forces of miniature plastic gaming models, which can cost more than £100 each. Each model is made up of hundreds of pieces, which they glue together and paint. These are used to play out strategic clashes on a tabletop battlefield at home or at events, although some fans prefer to instead show off creative versions of the models.View image in fullscreenGames Workshop is valued at a staggering £6bn and is almost ever-present on British high streets.Photograph: May James/ReutersWarhammer is a hobby, not just a game, encompassing painting detailed figures, reading and learning rules, immersive gameplay, storytelling and community, said Livingstone.He added that Games Workshop was an experience rather than a shop, with expert staff offering advice to customers and handing out free models for visitors to paint, and gamers forging friendships with fellow gamers through games nights.The company’s benefits are similarly multifaceted, including a very loyal customer base; high product quality; a vertically integrated business model where Games Workshop owns the entire supply chain; and decades of fiercely defended intellectual property. The company has also pledged to invest in artists and not AI‘A nucleus of a community’: the five-hour stage play about Dungeons & DragonsRead more“It’s a gaming success story – commercially, it’s a very impressive thing, being able to placate shareholders and fans simultaneously. They’ve found a way to monetise geek culture,” said Douglas Brown, professor of games at Falmouth University, who has taught alongside co-founder Steve Jackson.Games Workshop is the 77th biggest company in the UK by market capitalisation, and worth more than many British businesses such as Burberry, Whitbread and Barratt homes. The fact not many people are aware of its success reflects a wider underestimation of the economic impact of the UK games industry, which is bigger than the fishing and steel industries, Brown added.View image in fullscreenEach model is made up of hundreds of pieces, which collectors glue together and paint.Photograph: Ton Koene/AlamyWarhammer historian Jordan Sorcery, who has interviewed more than 100 people who have worked for the company, said Games Workshop had made “smart business decisions” over the years, such as creating Warhammer in 1983 as a war game which required people to buy not just a handful of orcs – but entire armies.This, combined with its emphasis on creativity and world-building, meant that many people would view Games Workshop as “on the precipice of going mainstream”, if it’s not there already, he said.Though Warhammer remains male-dominated, Mike Ryder, an academic at Lancaster University who co-founded the world’s first Warhammer academic conference, said he had seen “an increasing number of female fans” in recent years.Its appeal has broadened thanks to popular film and TV franchises such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones, which have removed the stigma from being a “geek” or a “nerd”, said Ryder. Equally, product line updates have made it “far easier to get into the hobby, with smaller-scale skirmish games for people who don’t want to collect a full army”.He anticipated that, along with the Amazon project, plans to open a Warhammer World in the US and had “the potential to open up Games Workshop and Warhammer to a whole new army of fans”, he said.View image in fullscreenCo-founders Ian Livingstone, John Peake and Steve Jackson sold their shares in 1991.Photograph: Courtesy of Ian LivingstoneGames Workshop’s recent success is partly down to this global expansion, said Charles Hall, head of research at Peel Hunt. He added that, paradoxically, hobbies are something that people view as an “essential spend”, and that despite being high margin, models represent affordable luxuries for many.Many Warhammer players have a deeply emotional relationship with the game. Euan Bennington, treasurer of Derby University’s growing Warhammer Society, said he most valued the “sense of belonging”, and felt this was shared by fellow members, who he has seen become “louder, excitable, confident and happy”. He noted that many are neurodivergent, and appreciate a calmer, alcohol-free space in which to socialise.“I hate small talk, so long discussions about something I’m passionate about are a lot more rewarding. It settles anxiety when it comes to socialising, because you always have something to fall back on,” he said.Explore more on these topicsBoard gamesGame culturenewsShareReuse this content"

Allen listens, confused then hurt, for almost two minutes as a presumed husband on the other end asks to open up the relationship. Fans made the obvious connection to Allen’s own marriage to David Harbour, the cop from Stranger Things (who is perhaps equally well known for histasteful Brooklyn townhouse). The two dabbled in polyamory, goes the tabloid story, only to have Harbour break the rules and hurt Allen in the end.The album is good – pretty and catchy, with an appealing edge of anger. But public reaction went beyond appreciation for the work. The breakup became the object of gruesome rubbernecking. It was a juicy story about one of the oldest topics: infidelity, betrayal, an affair.I watched with interest, since I was about to publish a novel, The Ten Year Affair, which is a comedic take on the same topic. The book has a dual timeline structure and sends up the well-worn tropes: the sleazy hotel room, the champagne bucket, the escalating lies told to spouses. The structure is experimental; the timelines converge and diverge, beginning, toward the end, to blur. In fiction anyway, infidelity is infinitely iterative, a way to frame and explore contemporary life, a setup with implicit stakes – a shared home and maybe children.Someone once joked to me that the Odyssey is an affair story: Odysseus spent all that time with Circe, after all. Man meets wife; man cheats on wife. It’s a story we’ve been telling for a long time. In recent years we have seen the reprisal of the academic affair novel (Julia May Jonas’s satirical rompVladimir; Emily Adrian’s sly and witty Seduction Theory); the rise of the polyamory novel (Raven Leilani’s electricLuster, in which a young Black woman navigates the messiness of moving in with her boyfriend and his wife); and the throuple blockbuster (Sally Rooney’sConversations With FriendsandIntermezzo).A recent entry I enjoyed was Andrew Miller’s Booker-shortlistedThe Land in Winter. Set in rural England in 1962, it captures the tone and texture of the era. The story follows two couples: country doctor Eric and his posh wife Irene; and Oxford dropout turned gentleman farmer Bill and his wife Rita, a former nightclub dancer. Both women are pregnant and strike up a friendship, visiting each other in the bleak, empty days of a record-cold winter. Meanwhile, Eric is having an affair with a rich woman named Alison. “Was this thing he had with her a vulgar bourgeois nonsense,” he thinks, “Or was it the one thing in his life that felt like life, that he was in fact proud of?”The book is retrospective, a historical novel about a culture on the precipice of change. At the other end of the tonal spectrum is Miranda July’s hilarious, quirkyAll Fours. One of the most celebrated books of the past few years, it may also be fairly described as a perimenopause novel. It tells the story of an unnamed narrator who leaves her husband and child at home in LA to take a cross-country road trip, only to find herself holed up in a cheap motel a few towns over pursuing an affair with a young Hertz employee named Davey. The narrator’s crisis has been triggered by reaching her mid-40s and realising her sex drive might decline. Her grandmother, she keeps remembering, “put herself in a trash bag” and jumped out of the window of her apartment when she hit 50.Polyamory emerges as a big theme, an idealised fix-all for the problem of monogamy that ends up creating problems of its ownFor much of the book, the narrator comes as close as you can to cheating without technically doing it. She and Davey take walks together, lie next to each other in the motel room, make chaste but intense physical contact, and in one harrowing scene, observe each other in the bathroom. The reader waits for the moment the narrator will finally go for it but, ultimately, something stranger happens. Instead of sleeping with Davey, she sleeps with an older woman, a friend of Davey’s mother with whom Davey had an ambiguously abusive sexual relationship when he was a teenager. The move is thrillingly bizarre and dark – instead of the young man she’s obsessed over for 200 pages, this odd, older woman.Other recent examples are less subversive. InLiarsby Sarah Manguso, a woman named Jane discovers that her husband John has cheated, and responds with the expected rage. The story of their disintegrating marriage is told in short, brutal fragments: “Those days, when John ignored or dismissed me, my mind told me I felt bad because I gained weight or because of a bad book review. I refused to look at the real reason.”Similarly,The Möbius Bookby Catherine Lacey reads like a postmortem. Half of it is nonfiction and the other half fiction. The gimmick is that it may be flipped over and started from either side. In the fiction half, lines about love and sex come off as stilted or constructed. This seemed to me a clever way of making a point about the language of fiction, its limits and its tendency toward banality. “There you go with your romantic one-liners,” one character says to another.But ultimately, both The Möbius Book and Liars boil with a resentment that undermines their innovation. The authors’ judgments are on every page. The cheating man in The Möbius Book is not given a name, but referred to disdainfully as “The Reason”. Both books refuse to see the conflict from any angle but anger; both refuse to plunge any deeper. Reading them, I wondered, is it the novelist’s job to moralise?Lauren Elkin’sScaffoldingis less judgmental. It takes desire seriously – its main character, Anna, is a psychoanalyst with a particular interest in Jacques Lacan. It is also formally inventive, following a couple living in an apartment in Belleville, Paris, as well as a couple who lived there decades before. Both couples grapple with the push-pull of independence and stability, of home and freedom. Both grapple with affairs.The two narratives rhyme in places, or echo each other. Elkin uses the dual structure as a way of speaking to the universality of these problems, their intractability, and to relate them to everyday life. Placed within a world of home repairs and wall calendars and glasses in the sink, the problems of longtime monogamy are presented as ordinary features of life.Each generation writes their own novels of domestic repression. As millennials settle into marriage, and as those marriages fray, we will surely only see more. The millennial version tends to explore new relationship models, with polyamory emerging as a big theme, an idealised fix-all for the problem of monogamy that ends up creating problems of its own. Promisingly, it also tends to centre women and allows them to be fallible, funny and dynamic.The enduring appeal of the genre might be as simple as voyeurism, but I think it also has to do with ever-evolving perspectives on longing, ageing and fear of death. “The most interesting part of infidelity isn’t will they or won’t they,” remarks a character in Scaffolding. “It’s everything else around it.”The Ten Year Affair by Erin Somers is published by Canongate.

But I had no idea just how brutal custody cases can beMy experience of court was eye-opening. And when I sat in on other cases, I realised how often mothers are vilifiedLara FeigelSun 18 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 08.24 ESTShareIt’s 1836 and the French writer George Sand is swimming in the River Indre with her clothes on, weighed down by layers of ankle-length fabric. To anyone passing by, she must look mad or worse – driven by a death wish. But for her there is the relief of cool water sluicing hot skin, after walking for hours in 30C heat. She’s been moving all day because if she stops she’ll remember how frightened she is: she’s about to go to court to fight for her children against a husband driven by punitive anger.Custodire. To care. To look after. To guard. To restrain. Maternal care is, we are constantly told, the most natural of functions. But for century after century, women who transgress the expected norms of what a mother should be have battled for their children and been found wanting. Maternal care comes at a price when the law is involved. And all too often custody can be more a question of restraint than care.These cases happen now in blandly carpeted municipal rooms, and with less fanfare than they did in Sand’s day – she won her case against all odds, only for her husband to kidnap their daughter. But I thought of her when I fought for my children in the dull desolation of the winter of the pandemic, and discovered what it means to subject your capacity for love and care to a legal test likely to leave one parent high on the power of a win and the other traumatised by the vilification that often forms a part of these proceedings.Your children, I had been told by a friend as I embarked on my divorce, will be ripped in half. She sketched with her hand a line running straight down the middle of her body between the top of the head and the toes. I denied it at the time, but it was turning out that she was right: my children were being cut in half, as Sand’s children had been.I had moved to the countryside with the children for six months at the beginning of the pandemic and decided I wanted to stay. My ex-husband had given me permission to keep our two-year-old daughter but not our eight-year-old son. I began the case believing that I could make an argument for the life my son had with me, his mother, living in the countryside. I naively thought we could do this without lawyers, representing ourselves and treating the judge like a sort of family friend, seeking advice together. I quickly began to feel that I was being judged not only as a mother but as a woman.I came away from court feeling I had been held to account by standards I had mistakenly believed feminism to have eradicated. Women weren’t meant to write books or own property; and if we aren’t sufficiently emotional and sufficiently repentant, we can’t be the kinds of mothers who put our children first. The experience of being cross-questioned in the witness box remains one of the most difficult of my life to date. For months afterwards, the polished, insinuating voice of the barrister rang out in my head in my dreams or when I woke in the night, making endless statements masquerading as questions. “You act unilaterally, don’t you, over and over again?” “You don’t put your children first, do you?” “You just do what you want, whenever you want?” I answered back, despairingly, coming up with better answers than I’d managed in court, but even in these private nocturnal reveries I failed to have the final word.In the weeks between hearings, I found myself reading compulsively about women in similar situations. Crossing the foggy meadows to the Oxford courtroom, I was walking alongside George Sand in the 1830s countryside, and also alongside the fatally witty and beautiful writer and socialite Caroline Norton in 1830s London, when her philandering husband accused her publicly of adultery with the home secretary, and then asserted his right to their three young children. “I could hear their little feet running merrily over my head while I sat sobbing below – only the ceiling between us, and I am not able to get at them,” she wrote, after failing to retrieve them from the house where he’d hidden them.I lost my case. My son was to live mainly with his father, and my daughter mainly with me, though they’d be together for weekends and holidays, alternating between us. I wasn’t astonished at the court’s decision, though I was surprised the court was prepared to separate the siblings. But I was shocked at the arguments that had been successfully used to vilify me. It turned out that I lived in a culture where women who were seen as too independently minded could have their children taken away.Imperfect women are made more imperfect by a system that can seem designed to exacerbate their faults and heighten conflictAs my daughter and I adjusted to being on our own in the grim January lockdown that ensued, I continued to read about women fighting for custody – about Sand, Norton, Elizabeth Packard, Frieda Lawrence, Edna O’Brien, Alice Walker and Britney Spears, and about thousands of ordinary women across the centuries, whose divorce and custody files I’ve been able to read.I also went into court as a journalist, and over the past year or so I’ve become used to sitting again in the cluttered, carpeted courtrooms where my own fate had once been decided. I’ve become used to the bucket seats in the corridors; to the dehydrating faces of men and women who haven’t slept for days, waiting hour after hour for their hearing until suddenly the judge is ready, but the solicitor is still on the phone, trying to get her laptop mended because otherwise her team won’t have the court documents.In court, month after month, I have come to think that children have as little agency as they did in the 19th century, when in England they were legally the possessions of their fathers with no rights of their own. Most pernicious now is the idea of “parental alienation”, introduced by the American child psychiatrist Richard A Gardner in 1985 to characterise a “disorder” wrought by the (possibly unconscious) “indoctrinations” of men-hating mothers. Gardner’s own writing is no longer given much credence, but his ideas slip in through expert reports by unregulated psychologists. Here, children are enmeshed, or unconsciously aligned with their mothers. Their wishes and feelings can’t be trusted because they’re likely simply to reflect the wishes and feelings of their all-powerful mothers.It’s not that the mothers in the cases I’ve seen have been perfect – far from it. The courts aim to be gender neutral, and some kind of shared care is the desirable norm, although they publish no data on how often this is achieved. Yet in case after case, I’ve seen an imperfect mother lose custody to an imperfect father because their children were in some way rejecting the father. Imperfect women are made more imperfect by a court system that can seem designed to exacerbate their faults and to heighten conflict. The predictable result is that children are handed over to fathers who end up over-empowered by the court process – their faults minimised. Watching these mothers suffering in courtrooms, I’ve found that I end up respecting them all the more for the desperate sincerity with which they try to present their cases to the court, often digging themselves in further as they do so. And I’ve felt painfully sorry for the children who lose their mothers because they love them too much, which can only be the mothers’ fault.East London. This court has been hollowed out of two upper floors in an anonymous office building. It’s a world of sleek riverside bars and stately Victorian colonnades and hustling financiers, such as the one who has come to court today to fight for his daughter – whom I’ll call Lana. The mother is hostile, the father says; she acts unilaterally, and their 50/50 arrangement isn’t working. He wants to have his daughter most of the time and to have full decision-making power. The court-appointed “expert” is on his side: a parenting coach-cum-therapist who’s attempted to improve the family dynamics while monitoring their interactions. In the court process, surveillance and nurturing are often meant to be miraculously embodied in the same person.The imbalance of power is palpable. This father is a highly paid European businessman at ease with the workings of the state. The mother was an immigrant sex worker who got together with him – her client – long enough to get married and produce a daughter and a lot of confused resentment on both sides. He took sex toys in a suitcase on business trips while she was left alone with the baby.He’s mellifluously represented by his barrister – a large, smiley woman who puts everyone at ease except the mother she calmly eviscerates. He’s also paying, indirectly, for his ex-wife’s much cheaper barrister, who doesn’t specialise in family law and has to have things explained by his lawyer when she gets confused.Already the father has won a case for 50/50 custody, costs (though the mother’s only income is the maintenance money he pays) and a change of nursery. As the day unfolds, it’s easy to see why. The father, giving evidence, is eloquent about his love for Lana. He demonstrates his capacity for self-reflection, describing himself imagining the questions Lana will ask him later about why he took her away from her mother. And he plays games with the mother’s barrister: “Do you want to do the answer as well as the question?”The mother, giving her evidence, is extravagantly evasive. She claims not to remember the year she moved house or the year she was in prison, a decade ago, for passport fraud. Asked if there’s anything good about this man, she can think of nothing. She can’t comment on the good times he has with Lana because she isn’t there. She can’t even reassure the court that she’ll support the arrangements if the father wins. “I don’t know. How can I answer that? I will be heartbroken.”She’s made mistakes and they all come out. In the last hearing, she produced photographs of him having sex to show his disregard for his own physical safety, and exposed his “cross-dressing”. The previous judge found all this “an exercise in humiliation on her part” – evidence of her agenda to “severely limit the father’s role” in their daughter’s life. She enrolled Lana in her previous nursery without his consent.View image in fullscreen‘The mother’s crime has been to hate the father. But isn’t hatred a common feature of divorce? And isn’t the legal system designed to stoke it?’Photograph: Cian Oba-Smith/The GuardianYet when she says, in despair, that she tries to prepare Lana for the handovers, only for her to scream as she leaves the house, I believe her. The coach and the father claim that Lana only cries because she hasn’t been properly prepared. But I believe that the mother did her best: she sent her with her favourite book and toy, wanting her to be at home with him.“I don’t dispute that Lana has a strong emotional bond with her mother,” the father acknowledges. But why aren’t his books and toys good enough? “I have a library at home with about 50 books.”The mother’s mistakes seem to me the mistakes made by a parent who is ill at ease with the system and community she’s found herself in. The first nursery she enrolled Lana in was a merely good enough nursery, but it was embedded in her community. Now Lana has to take the train, squashed with City workers, from east London to her “outstanding” nursery. The mother gives vague excuses for not attending nursery stay and plays. But as a former sex worker, she may not feel at home with the City worker parents, and she may worry that the father will attend. Shouldn’t we accept that she feels intimidated by this man she remains financially dependent on – a man she alleges saw strangulation as part of good sex? Yet somehow there’s no place in court to acknowledge these imbalances. Indeed, the mother’s suggestion that she’d been controlled by her husband had been dismissed by a previous judge on the grounds that sexually “she was, in fact, the dominatrix”. Findings from previous judgments are not open to challenge.A couple of days later, the judgment comes. The father, the judge says, has been “very much focused” on his daughter and displayed “no underlying resentment of the mother”, while the mother’s evidence gave “little reason for optimism”. The videos she filmed of Lana’s distress at the handovers are evidence of “serious harm” which will be “ongoing” in the mother’s home, where Lana is exposed to her mother’s “negative beliefs about her father”. In the witness box, the mother displayed a “lack of warmth”. And so the father gets everything he asks for. The mother’s parental responsibility has been restricted, and Lana will now see her mother for only four nights a fortnight, even in the school holidays.I think of the mother unable to explain what has happened to the daughter she’s soon to lose, because she doesn’t understand it herselfThe mother’s crime has been to hate the father. I try to imagine George Sand or Caroline Norton, told that in order to retain custody they are required not to hate their husbands. Isn’t hatred a common feature of divorce? And isn’t the legal system designed to stoke it?This mother has lost custody because she couldn’t or wouldn’t say that she valued her daughter’s love for her father.It may well be that this painful failure to see what’s required by the system does indeed make her ill-fitted to help her daughter navigate the world. But to say that she lacks warmth as well? Wasn’t it warmth that I saw, in the fierceness of her protectiveness?The night after the judgment, I wake at 5am and think of the mother, perhaps awake, listening to the sleeping breathing of the daughter she’s soon to lose. I think of a little girl, on a Monday morning, being taken to school by her mother, knowing it’s going to be a fortnight until their next weekend, and of the mother, unable to explain what has happened because she doesn’t understand it herself. It’s hard to say whose fault this all is, but we can be sure it isn’t Lana’s.Oxford. Four years after my own court case, I walk up the stairs lined cheerlessly with children’s pictures, to the coffee bar with its lacklustre sausage rolls. The case I’m witnessing today has dragged on for five years and the original issues are no longer contended, but the father now seeks a change in residence. These children are adolescents. Let’s call them Esther and Ada, after Dickens’s tale of a court case that goes on for so long that the disputed inheritance has all been spent on lawyers, and justice has long been forgotten.There’s a court-appointed expert involved, of course. Trish Barry-Relph is best known for a 2022 case in which 13- and 11-year-old sisters accused their father of sexual and physical abuse.The older girl called her psychologist from the father’s bedroom while stayingwith him, threatening to take her own life if she couldn’t go home to her mother. Barry-Relph diagnosed a case of “severe alienation”, finding that the mother had turned them against their father. The children – together with their therapeutic godmother, Barry-Relph herself – moved to the father’s house for 90 days, not seeing their mother at all. The girls smashed up the houseand broke a window to escape. Thankfully, the case went to the high court in 2023. Mrs Justice Lieven did find evidence of alienation, but thought it had been an unhelpful allegation, “embedding conflict and a sense that one parent is right and justified, and the other parent is wrong”. She found that the criticism of the mother by Barry-Relph and others “bordered on the inhumane”. She returned the older girl to her mother, though the younger one remained in limbo.I’m curious to see Barry-Relph, and she doesn’t disappoint. She’s grandmotherly looking in a black cardigan, and seems brisk and kind in manner, but her recommendations are far from kind. Barry-Relph no longer uses the term “alienation” directly, saying instead that Esther and Ada have been left “unwittingly serving their mother’s unconscious needs”. For years, the girls have repeated the same allegations against the father, with Esther, the older girl, accusing him of being abusive. The things he’s done have been found to have been accidents: he threw a ball at her face playing in the pool; he demonstrated a “slap”, clapping his hands by her face. Both girls bring up these incidents to justify their unease, which may indeed be inflected by their sense of both parents’ hostility.For a while, Barry-Relph was recommending that Esther should be moved to foster care while she rebuilt her relationship with her father, which she thought was impossible while she was exposed to the mother’s hostility towards the father. Now she’s recommending a six-month transfer to the father, but as he lives far from their schools, they’re to board full-time and see him for weekends and holidays. Esther has said she doesn’t want to see him; Ada has been happy spending weekends and holidays with him and wants to continue. Both have said they don’t want to board full-time. Cross-questioned, Barry-Relph is clear. If her solution isn’t adopted, Esther will have poor relationships with her sister and with future peers and partners, and her own children and grandchildren will be affected, too. Barry-Relph’s views are shared by the social worker “guardian” appointed to represent the children’s interests.The questioning of the parents begins. This is a packed court, because Esther is old enough to hire her own barrister (though she’s not in court herself), and Ada has the barrister appointed to represent the guardian. The mother has a KC, and up to now the father has had one, too, but this time he’s decided to represent himself, despite his wealth. This is usually disadvantageous, but it gives him a voice in the courtroom, allowing him to cross-question the mother, asking her about a time when the police were called because the girls had phoned her, sounding frightened.“Do you accept responsibility for calling the police?” the father asks.It was her new husband who called the police, she tells the court.“Do you accept responsibility for coming down to my house?”She’s getting fed up, having to answer to him like this.“I want to ask him to take responsibility for calling my husband a fucking bastard,” she replies, addressing the judge, who intervenes, insisting on the original question.“Other judges have been critical,” the judge continues, referring to the judge at the fact-finding hearing who determined that the mother was responsible for the conflict. “When a judge says these things, it’s an opportunity for self-reflection.”She follows the script. She regrets calling the police, she says.When the guardian’s barrister begins her questioning, it becomes clear why the father felt able to represent himself. This barrister is entirely on his side, effectively providing him with free legal representation – all the more powerful because she’s supposedly representing the children. Repeatedly, she asks the mother if she accepts the fact-finding judgment and accepts that the children are happy with their father.“I believe the children, is all I’m saying,” the mother says, fatally. The fact-finding judgment criticised her for taking at face value what the children say: seeing the slap and the ball accident as abuse. The barrister swiftly points out that she’s doing this now.The trap tightens as one day gives way to another and the mother returns to court in a black velvet jacket that seems to defy the muted neutrality of the courtroom. Does she see herself as a victim, the barrister asks.No, the mother insists. But surely there is something off here, she suggests, more hesitantly – something perhaps a little chauvinistic? “Not one person can say something nice about me.”She’s right. Here is a mother whom no one is criticising as a mother, except in her failure to co-parent with the equally uncooperative father. Yet nothing is asked about her parenting. Its exemplary nature is simply taken as a given, so neither Barry-Relph nor the guardian has felt the need to see the mother with the children. The father gets to show that he’s a fun parent, and a thoughtful one. He buys tickets for his children to attend the VIP section at a concert (only Ada attended). He engages with commitment and self-reflection in the therapeutic process with Barry-Relph. What the mother does that’s fun is irrelevant, because only her crimes are relevant here. And it’s true that she has doubted this man’s fathering in the past and doesn’t quite trust him now. But why does this mean that her daughters are better off without her?Esther’s lawyer cross-questions the father about a crucial turning point, in the spring, when Esther had been making an effort to rebuild her relationship with her father. The two girls were to go to him for half-term, and a couple of days beforehand he and Esther discussed how often she would speak to her mother. Initially, she wanted to phone her three times a day, while he wanted twice a week. He was worried that his ex-wife would become a constant witness to their days. Esther immediately tried to compromise by offering twice a day, but this still alarmed him, so she promised that she’d think about talking to her twice a week.‘We really lean on each other’: how to be good parents after a breakupRead moreThe next day, the father panicked, afraid that Esther would involve her mother too much in any day-to-day squabbles she had with him. Without consulting Esther, he’d booked a flight to dispatch her to her mother abroad instead, sending her across the world on her own.Listening, I find it unsurprising that they’ve ended up where they have. The suggestion of moving to foster care, combined with this painful assertion of power: this father may not be abusive, but surely there’s cruelty here, even if it’s cruelty provoked and engineered by the court process and by the pseudo-therapy it gave rise to. It’s not surprising that Esther took refuge in anger; that she revived old allegations, because it was easier to say that he’d thrown the ball at her face on purpose than that she was a vulnerable girl who couldn’t trust in his love.The final submissions come in. The charge, according to the guardian’s barrister, is that the children “have lost a meaningful grasp of reality”, and this is the mother’s fault. The judgment is not a surprise. “The mother has not controlled the animosity which she feels towards the father.” For six months, the girls will board and spend weekends and holidays with their father. They’ll have brief, monthly supervised contact with their mother and then she’ll be hauled in again, to see if she’s sufficiently repentant, and capable of releasing her daughters from their “false narrative”.Around us, there are campaigns for change, especially for parents who can prove domestic abuse. In 2020, the government commissioned the Harm Panel report, which criticised the way that alienation is weaponised as a counter-allegation against domestic abuse, and found that “too often the voices of children go unheard or are muted”. The government has appointed its first ever domestic abuse commissioner, who has recommended that parental alienation is made ineligible in cases involving domestic abuse. Very recently, the government has announced the plan to repeal the clause in theChildrenAct 1989 that presumes that contact with both parents is in a child’s interests unless proven otherwise. This is a welcome move, though it probably wouldn’t have made any difference in either of the cases I’ve described, where the fathers don’t pose a threat to their daughters’ safety.Most promising has been the Pathfinder courts initiative, introduced in pilot programmes in Dorset and north Wales in 2022 and since expanded. These “problem-solving” courts try to interview the children and any professionals involved early on, and then to support families to engage in out-of-court dispute resolution, reducing the winner/loser aspect of the court process.Recently I’ve visited the Bournemouth Pathfinder court. It felt very different from other courts I’d been in: few expert reports are commissioned, hearings can be arranged with a few days’ notice and far fewer transfers of residence are ordered. I’m hopeful that if Lana or Esther and Ada’s cases had come to Bournemouth, the judges would have worked actively on improving the daughters’ time with their fathers, and wouldn’t have felt compelled to order a dramatic change of residence.It’s not surprising that the greatest custody novels are tragedies. Tolstoy’s great novel of adultery, Anna Karenina, is not normally thought of as a book about custody, but it is at heart the story of Anna’s son Seryozha, who helplessly misses the mother who can’t win him in court and has to grow up in a world without her. “Getting divorced with a kid is one of the hardest things to do,” the father’s lawyer says in Noah Baumbach’s brilliant custody film Marriage Story, “it’s like a death without a body.” But in fact there is a body, as Tolstoy knew: it’s a child’s body, and it carries the venom of the courtroom within it for ever, even if it hasn’t been visibly ripped in half.However, it’s precisely because situations of custody are so inherently tragic that we need to do all we can to avoid exacerbating conflict through the court system, splitting parents into traumatised losers and over-empowered winners – and we need to do all we can to give children genuine agency. In my own case, I’ve found that things have improved with each year that we get further away from our time in court. My ex-husband’s tendency to quote the judge’s indictments of my character in any minor altercation between us has gradually diminished, and on the whole we’re able to put the children first in most of our interactions. I’ve learned again to admire this man who may occasionally hate me – and not without reason – but whose love for our children makes him an often impressively collaborative father.“I love you both,” our daughter shouted exuberantly at a handover recently, going from one to the other for hugs. It may be the most important thing a child of divorce can say.This is an adapted extract fromCustody: The Secret History of Mothers, by Lara Feigel, published by William Collins on 29 January at £25.

She said, “I always act in my professional capacity to assist the court and the children’s welfare is my paramount concern. Every case turns on its own facts. It’s not for an independent social worker to ‘diagnose’ alienation as this is a question of fact for the court.”Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingChildrenDivorceFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their peak period lasted until the early- to mid-1990s.In 2008, therecame a rupture– due to “management and business disputes” rather than anything musical – which opened the way to the choice that now confronts their remaining fans: whether to go and seea new vehiclefor the band’s former lead singer called “UB40 featuring Ali Campbell”, or stick with the outfit that still trades under its original name, and includes his estranged brother Robin. For the time being, there seems to be space for them both.Given their staunchly anti-Tory roots, I’m not sure any of the musicians involved would appreciate comparisons that involve such politicians asRobert Jenrick, Nigel Farage and Kemi Badenoch. But the drama currently gripping the people and parties vying for leadership of the British right fits the UB40 model like a glove.Here, after all, is the story of two estranged groupings that now have almost exactly the same worldview: a deep attachment to Brexit, the secular religion of Thatcherism and a modern fixation with immigration and the wider culture wars. Their battle is driven by animosities that seem to be as much personal as ideological. But with every defection from theConservativesto Reform UK, the sense of blurring has been accompanied by a mounting feeling that there can be only one winner. Politics is not like the market for ageing reggae acts: at the key points on the ideological spectrum, there tends to be room for just one viable force.Last week’s drama – Badenoch’s discovery of Jenrick’s planned defection, hisbrisk sacking, and the same day’s Farage-Jenrick press conference – took the battle for supremacy to a new level. Over the weekend there have been no end of stories and briefings, includingJenrick’s claimthat he had left the “Tory posh party” and realised it is “out of touch with the people I grew up around in Wolverhampton” (he is, let’s not forget, a privately educated formercorporate lawyer), and reports that the plan for his defection included the suggestion that he is “the new sheriff in town”. Farage, meanwhile, tried to steady the nerves of Tory-sceptic alliesby insistingthat his party isn’t a “rescue charity for every panicky Tory MP”, and saying there would be no more defections after 7 May, while Badenoch said Jenrick’s sacking is part of “cleaning out the rubbish” from hers.What these rather camp pronouncements – note Farage’s less-than-exacting deadline – actually underline is that this is a feud within the same political family. And it may well end with a reconstitution of Conservatism. A kind that mixes hard-right, authoritarian, nativist ideas with the usual belief in laissez-faire economics, but a reconstitution nonetheless.Farage’s political roots, let’s not forget, are stereotypically Tory. His first political epiphany came in 1978, when Thatcher’s ideological guru Keith Joseph came to Dulwich College – and, according to Michael Crick’s peerless Farage biography One Party After Another, lectured his audience about how people and the market could look after themselves. Farage became a Tory member the following day, and finally departed in 1992, but he remains a cultural Tory to the soles of his feet, as evidenced by his association with no end of Conservative totems and institutions: the City of London, mustard-coloured trousers,members’ clubs,foxhunting.In 2013,he saidthat he was only the British politician “keeping the flame of Thatcherism alive”; in 2022, hegreetedLiz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng’s great ripping-up of fiscal orthodoxy – the credo of the blessed Margaret gone kamikaze – as “the best Conservative budget since 1986”. Note also the substance of a piecehe publishedin Saturday’s Daily Mail. Reform, he said, was now a “centre-right alliance” that would fix Britain by being “shamelessly pro-business and pro-entrepreneur and putting in place measures that will make wealthy people want to return here and businesses want to invest”. Those are not so much the words of a populist as the kind of boilerplate rhetoric Thatcher disciples have been coming out with for at least four decades.In the case of his lieutenant Richard Tice, the sense of ingrained Toryism is even stronger. Hisown websitesays he only called time on his longstanding Conservative membership in 2019. He may have flirted with the nationalisation of British Steel and Thames Water, but aspeech he gave late last yearat the London HQ of Bloomberg bigged up fiscal conservatism, cited the City of London’s liberalising deregulatory big bang as the best inspiration for modern economic policy and looked ahead to a “flatter tax system”: as stereotypically Tory a set of messages as could be imagined.So what drives his and Farage’s animus towards the party they once supported? One answer could be the wondrous political opportunity they have spent years working towards: a fight with a drastically weakened Conservative party, and a chance to remake rightwing politics in their own image. But there is also a story to be told about the years when the Conservative party was remodelled by David Cameron and George Osborne. Much of what happened back then amounted to a visceral insult to hard-right conservatism: the deal with the Liberal Democrats, the embrace of social liberalism – and, running through everything, the capture of the Tories by theOxbridge-educatedNotting Hill set.The people in charge of Reform are not from that layer of Tory society at all. Farage did not go into higher education; Tice has a degree in quantity surveying and construction economics from the University of Salford. Neither are urbane metropolitans: as Jenrick’s “posh” attack on his former colleagues shows, part of their mission appears to be to get conservatism back to the demotic belligerence of the Thatcher period, and forget all about the attempt at “modernisation” that eventually followed it.Since 2016, of course, many Tories have moved in the same direction, which invites an obvious question: what exactly is the difference between them? On Friday morning, the new shadow justice secretary Nick Timothy was presented with a different version of the same point by the BBC’s Justin Webb, who pushed him on a couple of specific issues: Jenrick’s opposition to illegal immigration and “the rise of Islamism, as he would see it, as a threat”, both of which are positions that meant he could effortlessly slide into his new life as a Reform politician. Did Timothy and Jenrick differ on either of those? “If you want the real deal, then … you vote Conservative for those things,” he said. Metaphorically speaking, he was agreeing that there are two bands with the same songs, but insisting that the Tories just play them better. That does not sound like a winning script.And so the feud continues, between two foes who have a lot more in common than they admit. That is not to deny the dire dangers of aReform UKgovernment, nor that there are still Tories who are keenly aware of them. But UK conservatism has been shifting rightwards for a decade now, and if Farage and his ever-increasing band of ex-Tory colleagues become its new standard-bearers, that may not signify an ideological rupture, but something both ardent rightwingers and UB40 fans both long for: a reunion.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsRobert JenrickOpinionReform UKConservativesUB40commentShareReuse this content"

But it can be helped to find its way thereSimon TisdallIndependent media, civil society, the rule of law – these are the things that Iranians truly need. And there are ways for the west to help secure themSun 18 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 09.26 ESTShareSoon after becoming president in 2017, Donald Trump ordered an attack on an Islamic State (IS) underground complex in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province. The strike involved thefirst-ever usein combat of a GBU-43 massive ordnance air blast (Moab) “bunker buster” bomb – the US’s most powerful conventional weapon. The bombing killed about 90 insurgents but failed to crush IS. It also made zero long-term difference to the US’s losing battle with the Taliban.Yet that was not the point. Inexperienced Trump, who had famouslyavoided military service, was keen to show he was in charge, a commander-in-chief unafraid to make tough calls and send troops into harm’s way. He craved a big bang – a spectacular demonstration of unmatched US power. Like a teenager who unexpectedly obtains the keys to the family gun cabinet, he could not resist the temptation to play with all those shiny new Pentagon weapons.Trump’s latestthreats to bomb Iran, prompted by the recent, terrible events across the country, suggest his mindset is unchanged. It’s naive to think he genuinely cares about the killing and brutalisation of unarmed Iranian demonstrators when, on his orders, gun-toting federal militias abuse American citizens in similar ways in Minneapolis and other cities. It’s plain Trumpdoesn’t give a damnabout democracy in the US,let alone in Iran(or newly colonised Venezuela).On the contrary, Trump sees an opportunity to impose US hegemony on ahistorically defiant, ill-led, energy-rich country that Democrats from Jimmy Carter to Joe Biden failed to subdue or co-opt. It’s a chance to play at being supreme leader. Trump does not want a settlement with the mullahs. He wants a capitulation – and regime change on his terms. Yet he also wants instant gratification and quick results. As his lopsided meddling in Ukraine and Israel-Palestine shows, Trump lacks strategic vision, consistency and staying power.As the White House considered military options last week, it became clear that strikes on supposed nuclear facilities, missile defences and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) bases would not deliver the immediate headline success Trump covets. Military action wasopposed by Gulf leaders, fearful of Iranian retaliation and regional chaos. Even Trump’s close ally Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom he recklessly bombed Iran in June,urged caution– perhaps because missile strikes on Israeli cities could damage his re-election prospects.Nor was regime decapitation – the tactic pursued in Venezuela, whose leader, Nicolás Maduro,was abducted– a convincing alternative. Trump claimed in June that US and Israeli forces could easily have killed Iran’s (real) supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But his assassination would not guarantee change – and could set it back. Iran has a “deep bench” ofpossible successors, including Khamenei’s son, cut from the same hardline, theocratic cloth.For all these reasons, and despiteassuring Iranian demonstratorsthat “help ison its way”, “bomber” Trump appears to have backed off – for now.Iran’s murderous, incompetent and corrupt clerical regime, installed after the 1979 revolution, has undoubtedly lost all legitimacy and must be replaced, as previously argued here. Its crimes are legion, its failures endemic. They did not begin with this month’s vicious repression. Nor will they end there, absent radical change. But externally imposed regime change isnot the way to achieve it, or to secure the west’s long-term aim – a stable, peaceful, prosperous, unthreatening Iran.Military intervention would onlymake matters worsefor its longsuffering people. The focus instead must be on ensuring the country’s obscurantist, “divinely ordained” governing system – a religious relic designed to suit the revolution’s leading fanatic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini – is jettisoned by peaceful means. Centres of regime power, such as the Guardian Council, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, internal security agencies and corrupt state monopolies, must be disbanded, too.Surveys suggest a majority of Iranianswould welcomea secular constitution and free, fair and fully democratic elections. The anachronistic post of supreme leader should be scrapped. Universal human rights, especially women’s rights, must be written into law. And individuals responsible for past and present crimes must face justice, in Iran or via the UN and international courts. In short, the theocracy must be demolished.How might this be achieved without even greater violence? Western countries could increase direct economic and financial pressure on the regime and its leaders through sanctions, tariffs, bans and boycotts. Diplomatic contacts should be suspended and Tehran embassies, such as Britain’s,shuttered indefinitely. Any talks on sanctions relief and nuclear issues that normalise this rogue regime should be frozen.If thepolitical will exists, cyber operations and hybrid ops to disable missile defences, cripple security forces’ communications and disrupt regime revenues could be set in motion. It’s been done before. “Ghost” tankers carrying Iran’s oil exports could be seized. More coercive pressure could be applied to China, Russia and North Korea to curtail trade and aid.In any event, Britain and its allies must do more to support Iran’s fractured opposition and identify future leaders. Western tech companies could provide ways for ordinary people to circumvent internet and information blackouts. Use of soft-power tools, such as Persian language broadcasts, should be expanded, rather than shortsightedly cut. All possible means must be employed to help strengthen Iranian civil society, independent media and therule of law.Trump promised Iranians last week that life will change. It was not his promise to make, and cannot be delivered at the point of a gun. The impetus for fundamental reform must ultimately come from within. But the US president, who claims he’sguided by morality, now has a clear moral obligation to break his habit of opportunistic, short-term grandstanding and back his words with sustained, practical and constructive, nonviolent assistance.Dropping big bombs on people is easy. Forging a safe and peaceful future for the betrayed and orphaned children of Iran’s failed revolution is much, much harder.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpAyatollah Ali KhameneiMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

GLP-1 drugs will only make them richer – and strengthen the hold they have over usSun 18 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 12.08 ESTShareFifty years ago, I started thinking about the demand for women to look a certain way and the rebellions against the narrow ways in which we were supposed to display (and not display) our bodies. For a while, there was a conversation about the strictures. Some young women refused to conform. Some women risked being in the bodies they had rather than embodying the dominant images of beingMadonna or the whore. But troubled eating abounded, even if it wasn’t always visible, stoked by the food and diet industries and their bedfellows in the beauty and fashion industries. These industries targeted appearance as crucial to girls’ and women’s identity and their place in the world.Today, a new kind of troubled eating is stalking the land, entirely induced by the newGLP-1 weight-loss drugsproduced by pharmaceutical companies and promoted by their willing agents on social media. It is totally understandable that people want relief from obsessive and invasive thoughts about their bodies and food. The explosion of GLP-1 drugs has provided a kind of psychological peace for many who feel less frightened of their appetites.GLP-1 drugs have captured the public’s imagination, while priceshave been droppingand online doctors in supermarkets prescribe quite freely. The reach will be ever greater as thepill version of the drug, as opposed to the current jab form, hits the marketplace. The notion of managing appetite, of the desire for food, of mouth hunger, of wanting to quell the food chatter that constitutes internal and often obsessive thoughts about eating and not eating, is the promise. So too is the longing for bodies to be transformed. To be slimmed down and disciplined. Having the right kind of body, by which is meant, the acceptable and admirably thin body, will become something to be bought through these drugs.The meanings of troubled eating – which is to say why and how it has become so widespread – will be bypassed and erased. The beauty, food and fashion industries that help to provoke the distress will be able to continue peddling their products without censure.The “GLP-1 face”, with the intense cheekbones caused by rapid weight loss after using these drugs, requires costly interventions from clinicians who seem to have no difficulty re-plumping emaciated faces. The Hippocratic oath of “first, do no harm” has slithered away.The WHO learned to love ‘anti-obesity’ jabs in 2025. I don’t fully agree, but I get it | Devi SridharRead moreNever mind that doctors know about muscle loss. Never mind the many people who can’t get on with these meds facing a new kind of discrimination – as others tut about their weight and ask why they aren’t on the drugs. Never mind the studies that show the drugs do nothing to re-educate people’s appetites and that most peopleregain all the weight lostwithin two years of stopping taking the drug.GLP-1 drugs provide relief in the short term and that is to be welcomed. But the heartache and pain that is implicit in the search for a sustainable and reliable body is still elusive. The food, fashion, pharmaceutical and cosmetic surgery industries are still laughing all the way to the bank.The food industry is run on the ethics of greed. Ultra-processed “non-food foods” are an important part of the business model – the high-salt, high-sugar, high-saturated-fat concoctions, which give taste and no substance except to further stimulate appetite, have free rein. They hook people by overstimulating taste receptors, with relief only coming at the end of the packet.Now this same industry, which has been the biggest factor in the obesity epidemic, has developed divisions to reformulate foods to serve those who now find themselves with scant appetites, labelling the new food “GLP-1 friendly”. Food scientists talk excitedly about how to combine intensity and flavours with protein-rich foodstuffs to entice those whose appetites have shrunk and whose desires for food are alarmingly (for the food companies) suppressed. They don’t want to lose market share.GLP-1 drugs only stop cravings for food as long as they are being taken. For them to have a real place in helping people, we need a deeper understanding of how troubled bodies and troubled appetites have come to be so prevalent. Wherever we look, at whatever stage in life, we can see anxiety around food and bodies, fuelled by the industries that both create and benefit from this distress.A good place to start is at the very beginning of life, allowing babies and parents to relish their hunger and the satisfaction of it. Anxiety too often infuses pregnancy, and the postpartum period can be fraught when it comes to nursing.Inadvertently, a new parent’s desire to get back into pre-pregnancy clothes and back to a measured kind of eating can make feeding oneself and feeding an infant fraught. The cycle of troubled eating and fear of one’s appetites begins very young. We need a whole-body approach, starting at the beginning of life and welcoming the changes as our bodies grow.Wouldn’t it be wonderful for our experience of food to be pleasurable, wholesome and unconflicted? Such relish would contest the power of all of the industries hellbent on inducing body anxieties. That would be really worth aiming for.Susie Orbach is a psychotherapist, psychoanalyst and social critic.

But eschewing animal products helps me ward off a sense of impotence – and despairSun 18 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 12.06 ESTShareLet’s get this out of the way, because I’m itching to tell you (again): I’m vegan, and this is our time, Veganuary! Imagine me doing a weak, vitamin B12-depleted dance. Unlike gym-goers, vegans are thrilled when newbies sign up each January, for planetary and animal welfare reasons, but also, shallowly, for the shopping. This is when we can gorge on the novelties retailers dream up:Peta’s round-up for this yearincludes the seductive Aldi pains au chocolat and M&S coconut kefir.I need retail therapy, because Veganuary has become quite muted and that’s part of a wider inflection point in vegan eating that I’m sad about. “Where have all the vegans gone?”Dazed asked in November, and nowNew York Magazinehas investigated, with the tagline: “Plant-based eating was supposed to be the future. Then meat came roaring back.” It details a wave of vegan restaurant closures (plus the high-profile reverse ferret performed by formerly vegan Michelin-three-starred Eleven Madison Park to serving “animal products for certain dishes”), declining sales of meat substitutes and a stubbornly static percentage of people identifying as vegan (around 1%). It’s not new (rumours of veganism’s demise have been swirling around since at least2024) and it’s not just a US phenomenon; many UKvegan restaurants have closed this year, including my lovely local.What’s going on? For a start, the Trump 2.0 “roaring” meat revival. As theNew York Times reported last year, meat sales are up and fewer Americans are interested in curbing their intake. That movement feels partly provocative – an in-your-face rejection of woke orthodoxies around cutting your carbon footprint, consuming mindfully, or, generally, caring. There’s also the influence of US health secretary RFK Jr, saying what the seed oil-eschewing, raw milk-swilling “crunchy” tradwives and Maha cranks want to hear. His weird newinverted pyramid of dietary guidelinesmajors on making steak great again. TheAmerican Heart Associationwas underwhelmed, highlighting the link between red meat and animal fats and “increased cardiovascular risk”.People are starting to think it’s too late, so why bother – they might as well be hung for a lamb chopBeyond RFK Jr’s tallow-fuelled obsessions, there’s a wellness angle to ebbing interest in veganism. Plant-based eating fits poorly into the relentless protein cult: you can hit your protein goals with plants (even the new, higher US-recommended amount; RFK Jr won’t rest until the entire country can bench press Greenland), but it’s harder. There’s valid concern, too, aboutUPFs: making “meat” or “cheese” from plants inevitably involves some ultra-processing. You can be vegan and avoid UPFs (I do! You simply have to live like a 1970s hippy!), but it’s not a no-brainer.I wonder, though, if other things are happening. I’m concerned that we have reached the “shrug and give up” stage of trying to combat climate breakdown and that’s also why fewer people are vegan. People are starting to think it’s too late, so why bother – they might as well be hung for a lamb chop. Plus, on climate, there’s a good argument that what individuals can achieve is exceptionally limited and that making us feel responsible is a cynical trick. Why am I diligently washing out coconut kefir bottles to recycle, whenhalf the world’s climate-heating emissions come from the products of 36 fossil fuel companies?‘You don’t need animals to make real meat’: the man who grows chicken in a labRead moreMore broadly, I don’t think I’ll surprise anyone by venturing that the world feels tremendously, terrifyingly bad right now. People need the oddlittle treatto face – and keep facing – the horrors. Is it so wrong, relatively speaking, to carpe diem and butter yourself a crumpet now and then? Of course not.All I can say to that, really, is if you’re interested in feeling good – and who isn’t? – it feels good to actually do something. My veganism is basically self-interest, by which I mean, I do it for my health: not physical, but mental. Not supportingecologically disastrous factory farming, not contributing to theregularly reportedacts of abuse and crueltyin the meat industry, and making a – yes, infinitesimally tiny –contribution to cutting carbon emissionshelps ward off my sense of impotence, and despair.More cheerfully, something else is warding off despair right now: this daft new craze for “fibremaxxing”. Because if there’s one thing vegans know, it’s fibre. So hold on, comrades, keep the mung beans soaking.

But she might be wise to treat the finance bros with a certainfroideur.That has not been Labour’s approach thus far: Reeves spared the banks from a windfall tax in her 26 November budget, and the UK’s regulators have justloosened capital rulesfor the first time since the financial crisis.Back in the summer, bank share prices ticked down after the Labour-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR)recommended an £8bn levyon the windfall profits made as a result of quantitative easing (QE).Insiders at other thinktanks said at the time that it was made clear to them by the Treasury that publishing such forthright policy proposals was not a welcome contribution to the debate. When it came to budget day, the banks were left untouched.JP Morgan responded with the announcement of anew £3bn HQin Canary Wharf, east London, and its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said the “UK government’s priority of economic growth has been a critical factor in helping us make this decision”.Time over for banker remorse? Labour must beware relying on the City for economic growth | Richard PartingtonRead moreHis praise came as little surprise, as the FT had alreadyreported that Reeves’s team, lobbied heavily by the banks against a windfall tax, had been urging financial executives to show their gratitude for the chancellor’s forbearance.Little more than a week later, the Bank of England announced it wouldreduce banks’ capital requirements– the reserves they must hold against their assets to absorb potential losses.The logic for both decisions was clear: the financial sector is, as Reeves told City bigwigs in her first Mansion House speech, the “crown jewel” of the economy, and with growth puttering along just above zero, now is not the time to plunder the banks for tax revenue.Moreover, the argument goes, lowering capital requirements will free up more lending capacity so that banks can support productive economic activity.As the Bank’s financial policy committee (FPC), which sets the benchmark for reserves, put it: “Banks should have greater certainty and confidence in using their capital resources to lend to UK households and businesses.” The move followed Reeves urging all regulators to act to bolster growth.Except … there is a catch. As contributors to a timely conference at the London School ofEconomics(LSE) made clear last week, once a country’s financial industry reaches a certain size – which the UK’s sector has long surpassed – it stops boosting growth and starts to become a brake, a result reinforced in a string of academic papers spread over more than a decade.Alex Cobham, the chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, was one of the conveners of the appropriately named Too Much Finance conference. “We seem to be in a generation in which our politicians are trapped in the view that finance is one of the great things that the UK has to offer, and we really need to protect it and grow it,” he said.“Actually, the research really consistently shows that the UK is far past the point where we would maximise the benefits of finance. And actually it’s a drag on the economy, and has been for a long time.”That’s partly because having a disproportionately large finance sector leaves the UK more prone to finance-driven crises, as Reeves’s Labour predecessors Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling learned the hard way in 2008.But it’s also about what it means for how the UK’s economic resources are deployed. As onelandmark academic paper, by Stephen Cecchetti and Enisse Kharroubi of the Bank for International Settlements, put it back in 2012: “Finance literally bids rocket scientists away from the satellite industry. The result is that people who might have become scientists, who in another age dreamed of curing cancer or flying to Mars, today dream of becoming hedge fund managers.”Or as Adair Turner, then chair of the Financial Services Authority, pithily put it in 2009, when the memory of the financial crisis was still fresh, much of the activity that goes on in the City is“socially useless”.At last week’s conference, Dariusz Wójcik, an economic geographer at the University of Singapore,cited evidencethat even at city level, a large financial sector – measured in terms of its share of employment – is bad for growth, once it expands beyond a certain size.The implication is that rather than courting and cosseting bank bosses, politicians should be using the levers of tax and regulation to keep them in check.The former Bank of England chief economist John Vickers and David Aikman, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research,attacked the decisionto cut capital requirements last week. They argued instead that with little room for manoeuvre in the public finances, and risks lurking in the global economy, reserve requirements should be set higher.“If banks wished to expand lending, they could have done so using their existing capital headroom,” they said. “The most likely practical effect of this weakening of resilience will be higher payouts to bank shareholders rather than increased lending to the real economy.”For now, with the AI boom in full swing, the banks and the increasingly powerful private credit lenders are riding high. But, as Cobham argues, after watching the events of 2008 unfold, “we know that the risks that the financial sector creates will end up being socialised when they crystallise –so we’ll all pay for them”.Explore more on these topicsFinancial sectorEconomics viewpointBankingDavosDavos 2026EconomicsEconomic growth (GDP)RegulatorscommentShareReuse this content"

Now we must halt destruction before it more powerfully startsSun 18 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 09.39 ESTShareIn spring 2004, Gen Anthony Zinniuttered about Iraqthe dreaded words in US politics: “I spent two years in Vietnam, and I’ve seen this movie before.” A year after George W Bush’s declaration of “mission accomplished” – when the war had hit itspeak popularity at 74%– the invasion had descended into quagmire, marked by a raging insurgency, the Abu Ghraib torture scandal and US casualties nearing 1,000. For the first time, a majority of Americansjudged the wara “mistake”. In this, they echoed what millions of Americans, predicting fiasco, had been saying since before its start.By the summer of 2005, withIraqexploding in civil war, public support further eroded. Vietnam comparisons abounded. Running against the war, Democrats had blowout wins in the 2006 midterms. The new Congress empaneled the bipartisan Iraq study group, which concluded that the war had to end. Its fate was sealed by the election of Barack Obama, who made good on his pledge to withdraw US troops (though US forces later returned to take on the Islamic State).By 2019, 62% of American adults – and a staggering 58% of Iraq/Afghanistan veterans – judged the Iraq war “not worth fighting”. These numbers belie what feels like a deeper, bipartisan consensus that Iraq was a “stupid war”, never to be repeated. Something like an “Iraq syndrome”, similar to skittishness about major military interventions following Vietnam, had taken hold.With the capture of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, we may be witnessing the opening scenes of a dismal sequel, now to the movie called Iraq. Propelling Trump’s aggression is his gleeful defiance of traditional constraints to war-making, whether international treaties, global norms, congressional consent or the opinion of historic allies. Bush had his own unilateralism, wrapped in cowboy bluster. But his administration secured congressional approval for the Iraq war and at least tried, though failed, to win the same from the UN security council.Trump rejects even a whiff of constraint. “I don’t need international law,”he boasts. He dares the world to stop or even slow him.We desperately need an antiwar movement to at least try. At stake is whether we accept a new era of impunity – not, in the near term, of American power per se, but of a largely unpopular leader, claiming God-like omnipotence, to kidnap and kill, bully and bomb without limit.Here the Iraq syndrome may offer some hope. Perhaps the only limit Trump sees is his pledge, vital to part of the Maga base, to avoid “stupid wars”. This hardly makes him a prince of peace. He clearly revels in violence and coercion. “Stupid wars” are for Trump simply those America can’t easily win, measured by prohibitive costs in (exclusively) American blood and treasure.Hence his reluctance so far to commit “boots on the ground”. Instead, Trump punches down, using military strikes on the high seas against haplesscivilians, special ops, one-off bombings, naval blockades and lethal threats to an expanding list of weak foreign states. America, his administration insists, is not actually at war with Venezuela, even as it kidnaps its leader and heclaims to run the country.Democratic leaders have rightly invoked Iraq to frame the current danger. “I fought in some of the hardest battles of the Iraq war,” the senator RubenGallego wrote. “Saw my brothers die, saw civilians being caught in the crossfire all for an unjustified war. No matter the outcome, we are in the wrong for starting this war in Venezuela.” Some traditional Maga loyalists, fromSteve BannontoMarjorie Taylor Greene, have likewise warned of another Iraq.Trump is at a perilous crossroads. Certain that Maga will never abandon him, he may choose a maximalist course of sizable deployments to Venezuela, or even Cuba, in a bloody bid for “regime change” and the seizure of oil and land. Or he may, mindful of Iraq, pursue supremacy with minimal losses by using threats and remote killing. It’s the difference between imperialism hard and imperialism lite, united in the naked lust for oil profits. Trump could also reverse the current escalation, spinning whatever outcome as victory.Which scenario prevails may depend on the existence of robust, visible and broad-reaching opposition to war. The antiwar movement of the early 2000s can be instructive.The movement did not in itself account for the dramatic shift in public opinion on the Iraq war and, at a slower pace, US policy. The war’s utter failure broke Americans’ faith in it. Antiwar activists take little comfort in being vindicated. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, many of them civilians, and more than 4,500 US military personnel died in the conflict.But antiwar protest helped catalyze the turning by steadily appealing to Americans’ hearts and minds. Stepwise, events on the ground validated protesters’ steady narrative of the war’s deceitful origins, disastrous course and intolerable costs, including to Iraqis. As the war worsened, the movement gained greater salience.The brave stand of the Gold Star mother Cindy Sheehan, demanding to know from Bush “for what noble cause” her son died, had great emotional resonance. New voices, including veterans of the Iraq war, spoke out. Burgeoning antiwar sentiment trickled up to the political class.In late 2005, the Democratic representative John Murtha – a Vietnam war veteran and vocal war hawk – sent shockwaves by demanding a US withdrawal. Murtha, who had visited severely wounded soldiers and read his constituent mail, concluded that the“American public” was “way ahead”of Congress in wanting the troops home now. The antiwar movement had led the way.A main lesson from the antiwar movement – widely judged as a failure for not stopping the US invasion – is that steadfast protest can help erode the perceived legitimacy of a war and hasten its end.The task for today’s antiwar resistance, much as the antiwar movement faced in 2002 and 2003, is to stop war before it more powerfully starts. It won’t be easy. Just building an effective coalition will be a challenge.The left, sure to lead a new antiwar movement, cannot alone restrain Trump. Only a bipartisan groundswell can. Trump sees the left as an enemy, to be attacked, not listened to. From his own ranks, he demands total loyalty, lashing out at even mild dissent. (After angry phone calls from Trump, Republican senatorsbacked off from effortsto have a war powers resolution guide Venezuela policy.) Antiwar Republicans, facing their own struggles, should be encouraged, not questioned.Progressives may bristle at making bedfellows with Maga loyalists, even just on the issue of war. Universes separate them, including on Iraq. Leftists generally decry the Iraq war as part of a neo-imperialist project, using 9/11 as a pretext and willful deceit about weapons of mass destruction, for renewed US hegemony. The war failed because Iraqis expelled a clumsy and brutal occupier. For America Firsters, the war was a well-intentioned, but overly ambitious, exercise in “nation building”. It failed because an ungrateful people proved themselves unworthy of the gift of freedom. The war was not so much wrong as wrong-headed. Its authentic victims were the US soldiers sacrificed to Bush’s “globalism”, not the Iraqis.Neither side has the luxury of requiring broad-ranging affinity as a condition for alliance. The anti-Iraq war movement made decisive electoral and policy inroads only when a sliver of Republicans – who supported the war by a large majority until its bitter end – defied Bush.Progressives may also wince at “imperialism lite” – in which Trump’s aggression is limited, but not fundamentally challenged – as the best achievable goal. Absent Americans in body bags, much of the country will likely shrug at Trump’s imperial ploys. But even a restrained Trump is a dangerous Trump.Wins are relative, as the left’s own history shows. In the 1970s and 1980s, a North American “solidarity” movement took hold. A main goal was to prevent the United States from engaging in full-bore military interventions to overthrow popular leftwing governments, like in Nicaragua, or suppress socialist insurgencies, like in El Salvador. Heeding both the “Vietnam syndrome” and this protest, Ronald Reagan used proxy forces, covert action and foreign security services, who ran death squads and employed torture, to pursue his anti-communist ends. Tens of thousands of civilians died. Still, the US left helped to forestall even greater bloodshed, and could claim qualified success. Something similar may be the current hope.Against this sobering realism, there is a way to dream bigger, grounded in its own realism. The anti-Iraq war movement was profoundly right that the time to stop a war isbeforeit starts. Once unleashed, the destruction is hard to turn back, as “endless war” proved. The tendency of empire is to overreach. Aggressors claim the mantle of virtue, while promising swift and decisive victory. That was the lesson of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars: in December 2002 and May 2003, respectively, Bush declared them over, though they had hardly begun.Trump may, as his critics joke, “chicken out” on tariffs and select other issues. But with violence, including on America’s streets, his tendency is to double down. So much can go wrong, following from the opening salvos of imperialism lite. That should be enough, if the disaster of the Iraq war holds any lesson, to call the current madness off. May a new antiwar movement make the case.What’s giving me hope nowThe anti-Trump resistance is rapidly incorporating antiwar messaging – including a critique of imperialism – into its pushback against Trump’s authoritarianism. The nationwide protests last weekend, following the killing of Renee Nicole Good, were billed as: “No Kings, No ICE, No War.” It’s so important to see unchecked aggression at home and abroad as parts of the same authoritarian system we have to dismantle. Many people in the United States remain deeply committed to the US constitution, the welfare of their neighbors and common standards of decency. Even some Trump supporters are souring on his strongman act. We are poised for a democratic renewal, if we work for it.Jeremy Varon is the author of Our Grief Is Not a Cry for War: The Movement to Stop the War on Terror (University of Chicago Press, 2025)Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationFighting BackIraqVenezuelaDonald TrumpProtest (US)ProtestUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Kristi Noem, secretary of homeland security, maligned Good as having committed “domestic terrorism”. Good’s killing became a national flashpoint as protests erupted demanding justice for the mother of three.Good’s killing is no anomaly. AWall Street Journal investigation revealed13 instances of ICE firing into civilian vehicles since July 2025, with at least eight people shot and two killed. ICE detentions are notorious for theirinhumane conditions;32 people died in ICE custodyin 2025 alone, matching a record set two decades prior in 2004.That a white woman can be killed on camera, with impunity, and be demeaned and ridiculed in her death for standing up for her neighbors shows just how far down the road of violence the nation has gone.It is a road most Americans do not want to continue on –recent polling showsthe majority disapprove of how ICE operates. But to truly stop the damage requires going further – it means eradicating the security logic that ever made people think that arming a secret police onan ethnic cleansing missioncould ever make them safe.Formed in 2003, during the embarrassing and disastrous national excesses of the post-9/11 era – when the nation launched two ill-fated forever wars, and demonized Muslim immigrants – ICE’s mandate was overwrought and ill-considered. Its formation was part of the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) which – as illustrated by its name – formally adopted the idea that immigrants were an inherent security threat to Americans.The casting of non-white immigrants as threats is not itself new – it defines the nation’s immigration system from the first act in 1790, which limited naturalization to “free white persons”, to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, to the whites-only racial quotas for migration that came soon after.In the wake of the civil rights movement and the abolition of racial quotas with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, the United States went from 86% white to just under 60%. And, while immigration law was race-neutral, its policies turned to criminalize increasingly Black and brown immigrants.In 1986, Ronald Reagan coupled the country’s only amnesty program with a seven-fold increase in border enforcement – beginning an arms race that would shape border violence for decades.But it was Bill Clinton’s 1996 signing of theIllegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act (IIRIRA)set the stage for our current mass deportation system, by making deportation easier, and making more people deportable, even for nonviolent crimes. IIRIRA stripped many immigrants of the ability to argue their cases in front of a judge and closed pathways by which undocumented people could become documented.Then came ICE. Mandated with targeting100% of people who are “deportable”, the agency has long been unfettered by the (already limited) regulations placed on police or prisons in the criminal legal system. People in ICE detention arenot entitled to a lawyer or the due process protectionsafforded to people within the criminal legal system.Even before thesupreme court authorized ICE to racially profilethis past September, the agency had along documentedhistory of racial profiling and racism. US citizens have been caught in its net – including in one harrowing case where a man namedDavino Watsonwas detained for 1,273 days, despite repeatedly telling officers that he was a citizen. He never received compensation.From the start, ICE has been a racial project, with its armed operatives targeting Black and brown people. Its categorical mission and lack of oversight are reminiscent of slave patrolstasked with hunting down fugitives.In the wake of Good’s killing, politicians have claimed that ICE needs better training. The problem, as they see it, is the ramp-up of ICE under Trump, with a $75bn increase in funding. But Jonathan Ross has been with ICEfor a decade. Ross wasn’t one of the subpar new recruitswho can’t run a mile and a half; according to testimony he gave in December,obtained by Wired, he was a firearms trainer, team leader, and elite member of its special response unit – a Swat team.Seen from this vantage, Good’s killing is not a “mistake” but a reflection of how the agency is designed to operate. Take it from the border czar, Tom Homan, who said: “There will be more bloodshedunless we decrease the hateful rhetoric.” In other words, Homan, who received an award for his service under Obama, after introducing the idea of family separation, is telling citizens that exercising their constitutional right to speech will prompt government agents to gun them down.Abolishing an agency thatteargasses two-year-oldsand shoots mothers in the street isn’t radical. It is basic human decency. Yet Democratic leadership has refused to back the call todefund ICE, with thinktanks suggesting “abolish ICE” goestoo far.“Abolish ICE” does not go far enough. We need to move away from a systempredicated on violencein favor of one that centers people’s humanity. We need to ensure that every human in the United States facing a legal process – including deportation – has access to a lawyer. We need to expand our legal pathways rather than truncate them. And we need to divest from the logic that violence makes us safer – Renee Good’s killing, the killing ofKeith Porterby an off-duty agent, and the deaths of Parady La, Luis Beltran Yanez-Cruz, Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres and Geraldo Lunas Campos,who all died in immigration custody already this year– prove without a doubt that it will not, regardless of the passport you carry.Heba Gowayed is an associate professor of sociology at Cuny Hunter College and Cuny Graduate Center and author of the book Refuge: How the State Shapes Human PotentialVictor Ray is the F Wendell Miller associate professor of sociology at the University of Iowa and author of the book On Critical Race Theory: Why It Matters & Why You Should CareExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionMinnesota ICE shootingUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Bullying is not strengthEditorialTariff threats over the Arctic island expose the limits of coercive diplomacy. Europe’s united response and pushback shows fear is fadingSun 18 Jan 2026 12.59 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 14.16 ESTShareFor all Donald Trump’s bluster about restoring American strength, his attempt to bully European allies over Greenland reveals a deeper weakness: coercive diplomacy only works if people are afraid to resist.Increasingly, they aren’t. And that is a good thing. Bullies often back down when confronted – their power relies on fear. Mr Trump’s threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Europeans unless they acquiesce to his demand to “purchase” Greenland has stripped his trade policy bare. This is not about economic security, unfair trade or protecting American workers. It is about using tariffs as a weapon to force nations to submit.The response from Europe has been united and swift. That in itself should send a message. France’s Emmanuel Macron says plainly “no amount of intimidation” will alter Europe’s position. Denmark has anchored the issue firmly inside Nato’s collective security. EU leaders have warned that tariff threats risk a dangerous downward spiral. Even Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, seen as ideologically close to Mr Trump, publicly called the tariff threat a “mistake” – adding that she has told him so.What Mr Trump did not reckon with was that intimidating Europe would carry institutional consequences. The European parliament is nowmovingto pause ratification of the EU-US trade deal that European leaders were pressured by the US to accept last summer. The three largest parliamentary blocs in Strasbourg – conservatives, social democrats and liberals – are marching together. In Brussels, this is not theatre. The EU runs trade policy, not individual capitals, as Britain found out during Brexit. Mr Trump can threaten governments; he cannot browbeat European institutions designed to withstand coercion.The UK is speaking up. Though outside the EU, the country issued ajoint statementwith allies saying that Mr Trump’s threat risks a “dangerous downward spiral” and “undermines transatlantic relations”. On his own Sir Keir Starmer was reduced to pleading for better behaviour. Britain is like Greece to America’s Rome – with the added trauma of having once been Rome itself.But there are signs of a rules-based system being built without the US. Canada, one of America’s closest allies, is hedging its bets. The country’strade dealwith Beijing shows how middle powers shift when Washington becomes erratic. Diversifying away from Mr Trump’s America is the right route to take. The US president ought to drop his tough talk and get on with bolstering Greenland’s defences and, if necessary, building proper commercial partnerships that benefit both the US and the island’s population.Some point to Richard Nixon’s “madman theory” as a historical precedent. But there is a difference between unpredictability that creates leverage and recklessness that destroys trust. Nixon shocked the system in 1971 because the system was coming apart. Today we have disorder, but Mr Trump shocks the system because he seems to enjoy the spectacle. That matters because coercive foreign policy requires domestic legitimacy. Polling shows amajorityof Americans think Mr Trump’s presidency a failure. A president who lacks consent at home cannot credibly demand submission abroad. What he projects instead is desperation. Mr Trump believes influence comes through ultimatums and coercion. But power, in the real world, rests on trust, predictability and persuading others to follow. Yet allies arepushing back. The more Mr Trump resorts to bullying, the more the world will learn how to live without him.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionGreenlandEuropean UnionEuropeeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Public trust in science also needs to be shored upSun 18 Jan 2026 12.58 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 16.56 ESTShareIt is true that science is self-correcting. Over the long term this means that we can generally trust its results – but up close, correction can be a messy process. The Guardianreported last weekthat 20 recent studies measuring the amount of micro- and nanoplastics in the human body have been criticised in the scientific literature for methodological issues, calling their results into question. In one sense this is the usual process playing out as it should. However, the scale of the potential error – one scientist estimates that half the high-impact papers in the field are affected – suggests a systemic problem that should have been prevented.The risk is that in a febrile political atmosphere in which trust in science is being actively eroded on issues from climate change to vaccinations, even minor scientific conflicts can be used to sow further doubt. Given that there is immense public and media interest in plastic pollution, it is unfortunate that scientists working in this area did not show more caution.The questions raised are mainly about the measurement of quantities of micro- or nanoplastic in the human body. In particular, one method, pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, may have either been used or interpreted incorrectly. There is still robust evidence via other methods – such as electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy – that these small-scale plastics are in our organs. What is in doubt now is how much.Many, though not all, of the studies in question were conducted mainly by medical researchers, and published in medical journals. It is possible that there was a lack of rigour or technical expertise in chemistry. Some scientists have noted thatthis is a young field, and best practices are still being established.But extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and public interest in this field means that results will be seen as extraordinary in the wider world, whether or not researchers think they are. Until clear and widely agreed standards are established for these plastic measurements, great care – and perhaps wider consultation and peer review – should be taken before results are published, and reported in the media. Hopefully the spotlight trained on the field last week will prompt reflection and future caution.There is, of course, along-established playbookfor magnifying and misrepresenting scientific conflicts – with attempts to discredit the science of global heating a case in point. This is not fair, but it is the world we live in. Scientists are confident that there will be some consensus on the scale of plastics in our bodies soon – probably within a few years. But even when the science becomes clearer, this row will probably be referenced by bad actors to discredit future results. After all, the plastic industryis downstream of the fossil fuel industryand employs many of the same lobbying techniques.Concerns about plastic pollution have thus far transcended traditional political boundaries. Hopefully that will remain true. More worrying than the situation in Europe is the Trump-captured scientific system in the US. Last yearan executive orderentitled Restoring Gold Standard Science warned that strict criteria will be used to disqualify studies from being used as evidence for government policy.Many are concernedthat evennormal debatesand differences of view between researchers could be used to reject wide swathes of well-agreed fact. In effect, science’s treasured self-correcting method could be turned against it.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsOpinionPollutionHealthDonald TrumpUS politicseditorialsShareReuse this content"

Where are these additional magistrates going to come from? The magistracy is the linchpin of our criminal justice system and it is already stretched.Recruitment of suitable volunteers is not easy. The commitment is high, and the criteria are quite properly tight. In January 2022 there was a £1m campaign to recruit 4,000 new magistrates. By April 2024, only 2,008 new magistrateshad been appointed. The success rate of applicants in the year ending March 2025 was only 22%.There is also another proposal that affects the magistracy: to extend their sentencing powers up to 18 months and remove the right to jury trial for offences that fall within that level of sentencing. Those cases will stay in the magistrates court. Last year47% of custodial sentences(23,059 cases) imposed in the crown court were for 18 months or less. On a very basic assessment, this gives an indication of the massive increase in workload that will remain in the magistrates court.Even if this proposal alone goes forward, there will have to be a gargantuan increase in magistrates. This returns to the question, where are these additional magistrates going to come from? Recent recruitment statistics are not encouraging. I can see only one pragmatic solution. To create a “trial only” panel within the magistracy (with faster recruitment, shorter training and more flexible sitting requirements), to sit alongside a fully trained presiding justice, and with a right of appeal. This would enable a far wider cross-section of the community to apply, and it might just work.Janet CarterRetired barrister, LeedsThe government’s recent focus on the Canadian judge-only system referenced in your report as offering support to its proposals to remove about half of the cases still eligible to be tried by a jury misses that Canada also has time limits for cases to be heard. Claims that Canada’s backlog fell due to a judge-only trial system is not accurate.The government has stated that it would seek to place restrictions on jury trials even if the backlog were at a sustainable level. However, the lord chancellor has not explained how this ideology fits with his previous finding, in the Lammy review, that juries are the success story of the criminal justice system as they do not deliver different verdicts between white and black, Asian and minority ethnic defendants.A panel of a judge and two magistrates would not comprise the jury group participation that safeguards against verdicts impacting disproportionately on minority communities.On 13 January, 58 out of the 516 courtrooms in England and Wales were vacant – 11% of all courts. The Prisoner Escort and Custody Servicescontinue to deliver defendants late to court, with there often being insufficient staff to take defendants into the dock. There remains a lack of barristers due to lack of implementation of the legal aid increase.Addressing these issues would reduce the backlog in 2026. Instead, the focus on reducing jury trials (about 2% of cases), and setting up a new court, is draining resources away from immediate action to cut delays for complainants/victims waiting to give evidence in a trial.The jury trial as currently constituted reflects the legal history, tradition and culture of England and Wales. The Bar Council stands firm in protecting it from this further unnecessary erosion.Kirsty Brimelow KCChair of the Bar CouncilDavid Lammyis right that Canadian-style reforms should be considered in England. The problem is that his proposed reforms are nothing like the Canadian system. Defendants there can elect to be tried by judge alone, but have an absolute right to trial by jury much like our current system that Lammy is keen to dismantle. Interestingly Canada also abolished lay magistrates – the very cohort Lammy wishes to try the new intermediate offences – in the 1980s because they were so unreliable. Either Lammy completely misunderstood what he went to see, or he is deliberately misrepresenting the Canadian system for political effect. Either way, we should be worried that he is the minister pushing this proposed reform.Paul Keleher KCLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

If we challenged him first, there was a risk of him going straight out and doing it anyway”; “Badenoch left it to her chief whip, Rebecca Harris, to phone Jenrick, a move which one ally described as ‘delicious’”; “Jenrick’s clever-dick people, they’re not so clever after all”; “She’s blown him up with his own grenade, very decisive, no pissing about, fair play to her”.This language is revealing of where the priorities of the Westminster workforce appear to lie – I do not notice such textured enthusiasm when discussing Northern Powerhouse Rail or fouling of our waterways. To this voter, it suggests there is ample time and eagerness for playground politicking and gossip, but less for debating legislation or addressing constituents’ problems.It is time for the political profession to be properly regulated; perhaps a randomly selected citizens’ assembly could intervene when a member of the Westminster workforce fails to adhere to theNolan principlesof public life.Madhan StreetLiverpoolNadhim Zahawi claims that the UK needs a “glorious revolution” and that only a Nigel Farage-led government can prevent “civil unrest” (Nadhim Zahawi failed in bid for peerage from Tories before Reform defection, sources say, 13 January). This phraseology echoes demands for authoritarian leadership down the ages, reaching its apotheosis in the support given by traditional conservatives to Mussolini and Hitler.It would be too easy to dismiss the attraction of a discredited opportunist to a populist chancer as an example of Marx’s dictum of history repeating itself as farce. With Jenrick now jumping ship and doubtless more to follow, the danger of a Tory/Reform governing alliance after the next election grows. This prospect should concentrate the minds of Labour, Lib Dem, Green and progressive nationalist politicians on working together to ensure it can never happen.Dr Anthony IsaacsLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Needless to say, most of the others have been forgotten. I was bored in my uni halls and it sounded the most interesting.In those days one could sit and watch the global feed – every tweet being posted in the world – with notable seconds between posts. I conversed with an American cat-lover and sometimes no other tweets would appear between our replies to one another.Over the years I curated my following list. It became an invaluable tool. I shared interesting policy blogs or academic articles at work, which helped my career. I always had a clip of a football goal or intelligence on train delays. I bragged about my PR-damaging tweets that would make customer service teams do a volte-face.At least, I convinced myself it was an invaluable tool. As Marie suggested, more recently I had entered a spiral of dopamine-chasing doom-scrolling. After Grok began enabling abuse of women and girls, one of my friends questioned why I was on the platform. My partner had questioned me for years. “For work, football and train updates” started as a genuine excuse but soon sounded hollow.Last Wednesday I deactivated my account. It felt like a moment. I was dreading how I would feel the next day. After proudly announcing to different friendship groups and my partner, and being praised and told it will be good for my health, I felt better. Now I don’t even miss it and it’s as if it never happened. A very strange dream that, on reflection, became a nightmare.Sam NairWhitley Bay, Tyne and WearExplore more on these topicsXGrok AISocial mediaAI (artificial intelligence)InternetDigital medialettersShareReuse this content"

Last August, hundreds of union flags were fastened to our streetlamps overnight and without permission. Demonstrators at our market clock with a Palestinian flag were regularly abused. So, in the first week of January, some Quakers hosted a meeting of political and religious leaders to discuss the growing incivility of political discourse.The pro-Palestinian group leader was followed by the Reform parliamentary candidate. Then various contributors from other parties and local churches spoke at length about what we had in common. A retired diplomat concluded that Britain is resilient. We are still more tolerant than most others. . The local vicar emphasised a “clear, common concern to express differences with tolerance and kindness”. There was no point in holding a plenary, so the final 20 minutes, we all spoke to our neighbours about why we had come and what we had learned. Frozen winter turned to thaw.Geof SewellThirsk, North YorkshireAs I read to the end of Martin Kettle’s column, I felt real regret that it was going to be his last regular one. His analysis of the political situation always hits the right spot without looking for any easy or instant solution. The headline illustrates his approach exactly, as he never lets his readers forget that politicians and their policies do not come hurtling out of nowhere.

And that was true, until injury time in the final, when a video assistant referee decision contrived to produce perhaps the most ludicrous finale to any major final in history.Senegal won it, but that is a tiny detail in the denouement that erupted. There was a walk-off in protest, a missed Panenka and a brilliant winning goal from Pape Gueye. When the final whistle went, players from both sides collapsed to the turf. For Morocco, extending the 50-year wait since their last Cup of Nations, this was agony.Regragui calls Thiaw ‘shameful’ after Africa Cup of Nations final descends into chaosRead moreThe chaos began two minutes into injury time when Abdoulaye Seck was penalised for a slight push on Achraf Hakimi as he headed against a post. Ismaïla Sarr nodded in, but the whistle had already gone. Four minutes later, El Hadji MalickDiouf was penalised, following a VAR review, for a slight pull on Morocco’s Brahim Díaz as he defended a corner. For Senegal, already convinced there was a plot against them, that was too much and the majority of their players stormed off.Sadio Mané seemed notably reluctant to go, and it was he who eventually ran down the tunnel to bring them back from the dressing-room after Claude Le Roy, a veteran French coach of eight African teams including Senegal, had materialised on the touchline to broker a solution alongside El Hadji Ousseynou Diouf; you know it’s a bonkers situation when Diouf is acting as a peacemaker.View image in fullscreenSenegal’s Idrissa Gueye calls players to walk off the ptich.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/APIn total, 15 minutes passed between the award of the penalty and it being taken. Díaz, having scored five in the tournament, stepped up. Who knows what must have gone through his mind as he waited for that fateful quarter of an hour? He had arguably been the player of the tournament and here was a chance to seal it, to end his country’s wait for a Cup of Nations.View image in fullscreenBrahim Diaz kicks misses his penalty.Photograph: Sébastien Bozon/AFP/Getty ImagesHe kissed the ball, placed it on the spot, walked back, puffed out his cheeks and tried a Panenka – and duffed his shot straight at Édouard Mendy who caught it calmly. In the stands there was pandemonium, and the advertising hoardings in front of the Senegal fans collapsed, prompting the deployment of at least 100 riot police.A cagey game suddenly burst open. Four minutes into extra time, Neil El Aynaoui was dispossessed on halfway and the ball worked to Pape Gueye who surged through and lashed a shot into the top corner – a stunning goal, only rendered more remarkable by the absurd circumstances.Senegal v Morocco: Africa Cup of Nations final – liveRead moreSenegal’s actions, obviously, were inexcusable and there will almost certainly be sanctions against their coach, Pape Thiaw, and perhaps some of the players. It’s arguable the game should have been awarded against them. But context perhaps offers some explanation.Senegal hadprotested about a lack of securitywhen they arrived at Agdal station in Rabat on Saturday morning, complained about a ticket allocation of around 2,800 in a 69,500-capacity stadium, changed hotel insisting the accommodation they were initially offered was inadequate, and been unhappy at being asked to train at the Mohammed VI complex in Salé just outside Rabat, seemingly for fear of being spied upon.View image in fullscreenPape Gueye hammers Senegal’s winning goal in the fourth minute of extra time.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesAlthough it is true that there was a large crowd at the station, many of them seeking selfies, it wasn’t entirely clear whether Senegal’s complaints were genuine or part of some broader strategy; certainly Cameroon and Nigeria in the previous two rounds had felt Morocco had enjoyed the benefit of various refereeing decisions and this may have been a pre-emptive strike against any skulduggery.Such was the concern around officiating and the possibility one side or other might protest that Jean-Jacques Ngambo of DR Congo was only confirmed as referee for the final at around 10pm on Saturday night. More disruptive for Senegal was probably the fact that their right-back Krépin Diatta was ruled out at the last minute by sickness, replaced by Antoine Mendy. With their captain, Kalidou Koulibaly, and the midfielder Habib Diarra missing through suspension, that meant three of their back four were aged 21 or under. In terms of their defending, they were magnificent. Diatta seemingly tried to warm up before accepting he was too ill to play and, clearly distressed, was escorted off by sympathetic teammates.The final, it is fair to say, was a slow-burner. Senegal’s policy throughout this tournament has been not to overcommit, not to take too many risks in possession, assuming that eventually one of their array of high-class forwards, a set play or a mistake would create something. Which was not much different to Morocco’s approach, just with slightly more of the ball. Senegal had marginally the better of the first half, Morocco the second, Ayoub El Kaabi skewing one glorious chance wide. Díaz is not the only Moroccan who will have sleepless nights.View image in fullscreenMorocco’s players are overcome with emotion after losing the final.Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/ReutersExtra time was an entirely different issue. Forced to attack, Morocco fired cross after cross into the box. Nayef Aguerd thudded a header against the bar, Youssef En-Nesyri sent a diving header a fraction wide and Senegal made block after block. And, at the other end, Cherif Ndiaye somehow missed an open net from six yards. It was all hilarious, hysterical drama, all the intrigue of the tournament packed into its final 45 minutes.But Senegal held on. There will be repercussions for their walk-off – there must be – but history will record that they won their second Cup of Nations in Morocco, and that despite conceding a 98th-minute penalty when the scores were level. But the best football rarely makes much sense.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Senegal football teamMorocco football teamAfrica Cup of Nationsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The US president was handed the award at the World Cup draw in Washington DC in December with the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, telling Trump: “We want to see hope, we want to see unity, we want to see a future. This is what we want to see from a leader and you definitely deserve the first Fifa Peace Prize.”Since then, the US has launched airstrikes across Venezuela andcaptured the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro,and his wife, Cilia Flores, and flown them to the US, where he was put in jail. Maduro appeared in court on 5 January,pleading not guilty to drugs, weapons and “narco‑terrorism” charges. Trump has alsothreatened to invade Greenlandbecause he said the US needs the territory “very badly”.Geopolitical football: Iran? Trump? How the game can stand strong in a fractured worldRead moreThere was unease withinFifaat the time of Trump receiving the award with the governing body not disclosing any details of the selection process. Now, though, that has shifted to “deep embarrassment”, according to one senior Fifa source. Multiple officials have expressed their unease about the way it was handled.A highly placed official, who declined to go on the record, admitted that staging theWorld Cupin the US is going to be a “very delicate” and “difficult” period, in the months leading up to the tournament as well as during the competition itself.It is understood that Infantino has been left to deal with the “political matters” concerning Trump for the World Cup as others fear it may tarnish their reputations. “Involving myself in the politics surrounding this World Cup is something I stay far away from. My job concerns football on the pitch and nothing else,” a Fifa source said.Fifa, however, doubled down on its decision to give Trump the peace prize, and said it did not comment on “hearsay”. A spokesperson said: “Fifa strongly supports its annual peace prize, an award to recognise exceptional actions for peace and unity. Fifa notes the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize recipient [the Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado]has given her medal to President Trump.“Fifa has strong relations with President Trump, along with leaders from fellow co-hosts Canada and Mexico.

One of Maye’s fumbles set up Houston’s first touchdown.“Just proud of the guys,” Maye said. “Battled the elements. This is New England. This is what we’re trying to embrace and we want to embrace all season long. Props to our defense, played a hell of a game. We’ve got to protect the football better, but we made enough plays to win it.”Carlton Davis III had two interceptions for New England.

Most of the points came in the first half, with the Warriors scoring three converted tries through Ollie Smith, Kyle Steyn and George Horne while Saracens replied with an Owen Farrell penalty.Seb Stephen then rumbled over in the closing seconds of the match to secure a fourth successive bonus-point pool-stage victory for Glasgow.

Following a few phases of forward play the Glasgow backs then worked it through the hands for Smith to dot down.Saracens, though, struck back quickly after Glasgow were pinged for going offside and Farrell made a straightforward kick. Horne looked to extend Glasgow’s advantage with a clever kick and chase down the short side of the scrum before being tackled close to the line by Max Malins. Saracens’ Juan Martín González was adjudged to have slapped the ball away in the resultant play and was shown a yellow card.Tempers then frayed in the dead-ball area between both sets of players after Saracens had successfully repelled the Glasgow maul to win the put-in. But the home side were well in the ascendancy by this point and scored two tries in as many minutes to underline their superiority.Horne was the creator of the first, his neat pass picking out Steyn who had ran the perfect diagonal line off his wing to score under the posts. The next try – Glasgow’s third – was set up by a rampaging carry from Jack Dempsey who then released Horne to score.The home side were temporarily reduced to 14 men at the start of the second half when Kyle Rowe was shown a yellow card after being adjudged to have come in too high on Rotimi Segun as he and Steyn combined to bundle the winger into touch.The home team finished on top and Steyn was stopped just short of the line, with Saracens’ Noah Caluori shown a yellow card in the aftermath. Glasgow, though, would not be denied and the maul drove over Stephen with the clock in the red.Meanwhile, Marcus Smith’s late penalty securedHarlequinsa surprise 27-17 victory away to two-time winnersLa Rochelleand a top-two finish in Pool 3, while the French side were eliminated.View image in fullscreenMarcus Smith helped edge Harlequins to victory in France.Photograph: Lionel Hahn/ShutterstockLa Rochelle needed only a losing bonus point to book their place in the last 16 at fellow two-time winners Leicester’s expense but were undone by a late Quins flourish.Quick GuideChampions Cup last-16 tiesShowBordeaux Bègles v LeicesterGlasgow v BullsLeinster v EdinburghBath v SaracensNorthampton v CastresHarlequins v SaleToulon v StormersToulouse v Bristol(Ties to be played on 3-5 April)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“The club and myself lost big tonight, it’s unacceptable,” said the La Rochelle head coach, Ronan O’Gara, a two-timeChampions Cupwinner with Munster as a fly-half. “It’s especially unacceptable when you see the number of opportunities we had to stay in the competition.

I’m glad he’s managed to give me one for a change.”Higgins beat thereigning world champion, Zhao Xintong,and the current world No 1, Judd Trump, both in final frame deciders, to reach the final but the Scot said he was well below his best on Sunday. “I was just useless,” he said. “Take no credit away, Kyren was by far the better player. He was totally dominant – it wasn’t even a 10-6 match.”Higgins went 1-0 up with a break of 58 but despite establishing a 63-point lead in the second frame, he missed three simple pots and Wilson cleared up to level.Wilson found some momentum to go 3-1 up and although Higgins used all of his experience to take the next two frames, back-to-back century breaks from the Englishman gave him a 5-3 lead heading into the evening.A break of 71 narrowed the gap but Higgins’s attempt at a risky double backfired as Wilson mopped up to restore his two-frame advantage.View image in fullscreenKyren Wilson broke his cue at the start of the campaign and said he was ‘very lost’ after an early exit at the UK Championship.Photograph: John Walton/PAWilson was far from fluent but he was able to pull away with Higgins unable to capitalise on his opponents’ errors.

He added the tariff will increase to 25% on 1 June.European leaders have pushed back on Trump’s demands. “Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer,said. “Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”Sunday’s heckle was not the first time sports fans have shown their displeasure with Trump’s foreign policy.Canadian fans have booedthe Star-Spangled Banner at basketball and ice hockey games in the last year, after Trump threatened to make his neighbor a “51st state” and raised tariffs on Canadian goods.Trump has also been booedby fans in the US.

The result kept Tottenham 14th in the Premier League and continued their miserable run in the competition.

The club are braced for empty seats in their stadium for the visit of Dortmund.Spurs have just brought the formerAjax manager, John Heitinga, on to Frank’s staff to replace the assistant, Matt Wells, who left before Christmas to become the head coach at Colorado Rapids. Heitinga took the session on Sunday, with Frank in his normal overseeing role. Frank said he had driven Heitinga’s appointment, despite the suggestion the Dutchman could replace him on a caretaker basis if the board decides to make a change.The situation is precarious. The directors have been reluctant to dismiss Frank as they are mindful of the problems he has faced – not all of them have been of his own making during what was always likely to be a transitional season.Vinai Venkatesham, the chief executive, wrote an open letter to supporters before the West Ham game, the tone of which was calm and reassuring, the overriding message being a call for patience.Yettoxicity and disaster followedwhen the West Ham substitute, Callum Wilson, scored a stoppage-time winner, sparking mutiny among the home crowd. The fans booed at various points of the game, including when Frank substituted the winger Mathys Tel, whom they had wanted to stay on.

The 13-minute exclusive segment aired on Tuesday, months after CBS’s parent company Paramount agreed to pay Trump $16m over its editing of an unrelated interview ahead of the 2024 election that vaulted him to a second presidency.“Yeah, we’re doing it, yeah,” Dokoupil assured on the audio. Leavitt could be heard replying: “He said, ‘If it’s not out in full, we’ll sue your ass off.’”Trump says CBS anchor Tony Dokoupil wouldn’t have job if Kamala Harris had wonRead moreAt that point, the voice of a woman can beheardsaying to Leavitt, “Oh great, OK,” in response to the press secretary’s threat.Leavitt’s exchange with Dokoupil unfolded with CBS News editor-in-chiefBari Weiss– his boss – having come under intense public scrutiny since she took her position in October. She has been routinely accused of favoritism and deference to the Trump administration, calling into question the network’s editorial independence under Weiss, who did not have any previous televisionexperience.CBS is now controlled by Paramount Skydance, founded by David Ellison, the son of billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison, a friend of Trump. Meanwhile, in October, Paramount Skydance bought Weiss’s Free Press, the conservative opinion media company which she founded after her departure from the New York Times in 2020.Weiss’ tenure as CBS editor-in-chief had already been marked by chaos and editorial controversies even before her anchor absorbed the lawsuit barb from Leavitt. One particularly tumultuous episode was Weiss’s decision to pull a segment scheduled to air on 60 Minutes on 21 December about Venezuelan men deported by the administration, which was reported by the network’s veteran correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi.Weiss said a lack of response from the Trump administration factored into her decision. Citing sources,CNNreported that CBS intended to air the segment in question on Sunday’s 60 Minutes.‘Blood in the water’: Bari Weiss’s chaotic first three months in charge of CBS NewsRead moreFurthermore, in July, Paramount agreed to a $16msettlementwith Trump for its editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Trump’s 2024 election rival, Kamala Harris, which aired prior to the race. Trump had sued, saying the editing of the segment was intended to “confuse, deceive, and mislead the public”. CBS countered that the answers were edited only for time, a customary practice in television journalism, but nonetheless settled what many believed was an exceedingly winnable case.In the recentinterviewwith CBS on Tuesday, Trump warned that the US “will take very strong action” if Iran hangs protesters. He also calledJerome Powella “lousy” US Federal Reserve chairperson and defended the actions of the ICE agent who fatallyshotRenee Good in Minneapolis on 7 January.CBS aired the full unedited interview later that evening, which they maintained was their intention all along. “The moment we booked this interview, we made the independent decision to air it unedited and in its entirety,” the company said in a statement on Saturday.When reached for comment by the New York Times, Leavittsaid, “The American people deserve to watch President Trump’s full interviews, unedited, no cuts.” Leavitt concluded with: “And guess what?

They stayed in their houses because they thought the fire would stop at the edge of the forest,” said John Guzmán, 55, surveying the scene in Penco, where smoke blanketed the sky in an orange haze. “It was completely out of control. No one expected it.”Although the total number of homes burned nationwide remained unclear, one municipality of Concepción in Biobío reported 253 homes destroyed.View image in fullscreenMembers of a family watch as their home burns to the ground in Penco, Chile, 18 January 2026.Photograph: Pablo Hidalgo/EPAJuan Lagos, 52, also in Penco, said: “We fled running, with the kids, in the dark.” The fire engulfed most of the city, burning cars, a school and a church.Charred bodies were found across fields, in homes, along roads and in cars.“From what we can see, there are people who died ... and we knew them well,” said Víctor Burboa, 54. “Everyone here knew them.”Matias Cid, a 25-year-old student who lives in Penco, described fast-moving flames burning through the night and devouring homes.“We had to leave with the shirts on our back. If we had stayed another 20 minutes we would have burned to death,” Cid told AFP.All but one of the fatalities so far were in Penco, Vera said.Lirquén, a small port town, was also hit hard, with many people saving themselves by rushing to the beach, said resident Alejandro Arredondo, 57.“There is nothing left standing,” he added as he surveyed a burning landscape of metal and wood that used to be people’s homes.Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Born and raised in Altadena, an unincorporated area inLos Angelescounty, she didn’t need to look at a map as she drove to where her home of 22 years burned down.We passed empty lots with gaping holes where foundations once stood. The banging of hammers rang through the neighborhood and wood frames rose from the dirt, the smell of fresh lumber in the air.Perched on street corners were signs declaring: “Altadena is not for sale.”The signs speak to an intrusion that has tormented Williams and other wildfire survivors over the last year: real estate investors aggressively pursuing their land.Williams’ family lost four homes in the Eaton fire, which killed 19 people and destroyed about 9,500 buildings. She received the first call from a real estate investor just two days after her home burned down. The call was from a representative of an investment group who knew her full name and asked if she wanted to sell her lot.The calls haven’t stopped. “I got one of those calls yesterday,” she said as she drove. “Immediately people saw dollar signs.”Altadena is known for its thriving Black communitythat moved there when redlining kept them from buying homes elsewhere. Now, the communityis experiencing what academics call “climate gentrification” as residents fight displacement.Longtime residents who lost their homes are drowning financially due to insurance issues and the high cost of rebuilding, realizing they can’t afford to start over, and selling their land for less than it was worth when their homes were still standing.At the same time, real estate investors see Altadena as an opportunity. With ample land cleared by flames and bulldozers, they can buy discounted property in an urban area where it’s hard to find land to build. One recent survey found that real estate investors have bought upnearly halfthe empty lots in Altadena that sold after the fire.View image in fullscreenEllen on her sister Eshele’s lot in Altadena, California. Her home was lost to the Eaton fire.Williams and her family plan to return to Altadena, but she knows that other longtime residents can’t withstand the financial pressure that threatens to reshape her hometown.“It was a good opportunity for investors to come in, so that’s exactly what they did,” Williams said. “How dare you? Within days of people losing their homes you want to give them an offer. We’re still processing, yet you want to put a value on land.”The night of the fire, Williams awoke to her son shaking her. Her family members had arrived in a caravan to warn them that fire was coming down the mountain. Before she went to sleep, Williams had seen the orange glow in the mountains overlooking Altadena and had put some items in the car, just in case.Now police were driving down the street with megaphones blaring. “There were embers flying everywhere. It looked like a war zone,” Williams said. She sat at a restaurant near her house and watched as embers propelled by hurricane-force winds lit the palm trees like matchsticks. That’s when she realized no one was coming to save her home.Within a day of the fire’s outbreak, at least 2,800 Black households were forced to evacuate, aUCLA report found. The report also found that Black households were more likely to sustain fire damage, and to be located in the fire’s perimeter; 61% of Black households in Altadena were located in the Eaton fire perimeter compared to 50% of non-Black households, and 48% of Black homes were destroyed or severely damaged compared to 37% for non-Black homes.The disparity can be partially attributed to the historical policy of redlining, a discriminatory housing practice that saw federal agencies create color-coded maps indicating which areas had large Black populations. Those communities were marked red and deemed high- risk for mortgages. The practice was outlawed in 1968.In the 1960s, Williams’ grandmother moved from Kentucky to California, settling in Pasadena, next to Altadena. But freeway constructiondisplaced Black residentsincluding the Williams family. Due to redlining, Black families couldn’t buy homes east of Lake Avenue, a major road that cuts through Altadena, so the Williams family bought homes on the west side.Together, the freeway construction and redlining pushed the Williams family closer to the fire-prone San Gabriel mountains. Decades passed and climate changeincreased the fire risk, so when the Eaton fire broke out, it was Black households who weremore likelyto live inside the evacuation zone.View image in fullscreenEllen William’s lot. She and her family plan to return to Altadena, but she knows that other longtime residents can’t withstand the financial pressure.As we spoke on the phone, UCLA professor and urban cultural historian, Eric Avila, peered at historic, color-coded maps of Altadena on his screen. Avila noted that the area west of Lake Avenue in Altadena was marked in yellow, or “definitely declining”, in the redlining parlance of the time, meaning it carried significant risk to lenders. The area east of Lake Avenue was green and blue, meaning it was desirable, and Black families would likely have been blocked from buying homes there.“There’s an inherent risk living in this wildland-urban interface zone on the edge of mountains,” he said. “The tragedy is that Altadena reflected an opportunity for a group of people that have experienced high rates of discrimination.”As survivors seek to rebuild, signs of deep racial disparities are appearing. Nearly six in 10 Black-owned homes in Altadena sustained severe fire damage – the highest rate of any racial group, aUCLA analysisfound. Most residents want to return, but nearly seven in 10 severely fire-damaged properties show no progress toward rebuilding. “Black homeowners in particular stood out as facing the greatest barriers,” Gabriella Carmona, the report’s lead author, said.A real estate development company bought Troy Laster’s property after he lost his home of nearly 40 years in the fire. “They bought multiple [lots] on the block. I know for sure they got three, if not more,” he said. At first, he made a pact with his neighbors to rebuild, but later changed his mind. His wife struggled with trauma from the fire, toxic chemicals lingered in the soil, the rebuilding process felt daunting, and they would have had to pay rent and a mortgage for the duration of rebuilding. So they sold their property and moved to Las Vegas.“I know, in my heart, the city will never be the same,” he said of Altadena.Survivors must apply for permits to rebuild, but applications remain stalled. Data suggests this is due to financial burdens. Previous wildfires, like the2023 Maui fire, have shown that disaster recovery exacerbates existing inequities, with spikes in housing prices, underinsurance and bureaucratic delays pushing survivors out of their communities. “It bubbles into exactly what we see in lots of other disasters, and hence the climate gentrification connection,” Carmona said.A rose and a black homes matter sign on a lawnLeft: A blooming rose surrounded by burned vegetation on a burned lot in West Altadena Right: Black Homes Matter sign in West Altadena.After the Eaton fire, the county and state passed policies to reduce costs and expedite rebuilding, and Federal assistance is available, but survivors and advocates say these measures don’t go far enough. “People are in financial trouble, and disaster rips that bandaid off, and then we see more of [the economic precarity that] was already there,” said Lori Gay, chief executive officer of Neighborhood Housing Services ofLos AngelesCounty (NHS), a non-profit that is providing financial support to hundreds of residents who lost homes.Insurance is a key reason the community is struggling to rebuild. Insurers control how and when to release rebuilding funds, and 70% of insured survivors have experienced delayed, denied or underpaid claims, according toone surveyof nearly 2,000 people. Only one in four survivors who suffered severe damage or total loss have had their claims fully approved.The home of Williams’ mother, which she has owned for more than 50 years, burned to the ground. State Farm cancelled her insurance months before the fire, but didn’t notify her, because her insurance payment was combined with her mortgage payment into a single monthly figure. As a result of State Farm’s actions, she was forced into a less robust policy with another company, meaning she was underinsured and received a lower payout than she would have obtained from State Farm. She has not received a payout from State Farm, but believes she is owed one. “We’re still fighting back and forth with State Farm about her property,” said Eshele Williams, Ellen’s sister.People who were underinsured or uninsured face a much larger gap to cover the cost of rebuilding. “I have seen back of the napkin calculations assessing what that gap might look like,” Carmona said. “We haven’t run that analysis ourselves, but it’s probably in the $300,000 or $400,000 range.”Federal funding is not easily accessible to fill the gap. Small Business Administration loans cover some of the rebuilding cost for survivors who meet specific financial criteria, but many don’t qualify.View image in fullscreenEllen and Eshele on Ellen’s lot.For those facing the largest gap, a controversial compensation scheme may determine if they can return. As evidence grew that SouthernCaliforniaEdison’s power lines probably sparked the Eaton fire, the company launched a payment program for survivors who agree not to sue. The company has acknowledged the fire was probably caused by its equipment but has stopped short of accepting full legal responsibility.Survivors who lack insurance may feel more pressure to accept the offer, noted Jasmin Shupper, founder and president of Greenline Housing Foundation, a non-profit that is focused on closing the racial wealth gap, and is supporting Eaton fire survivors. People with adequate insurance are looking to litigate so they can maximize what they can recover from the company. “They can wait, because their insurance will get them back to rebuilding. It really depends on people’s individual circumstances,” said Shupper, who lives in Pasadena and was displaced for six months due to the fire.Gay has had tough conversations with survivors. Many see the offer as inequitable or “race-driven”, yet they find themselves living in unstable housing and are short the half a million dollars needed to rebuild. “Can you afford to live another two to five years waiting on a settlement that’s bigger?” Gay asked. For those who can’t afford to wait, the offer may be their only hope of returning.Rebuilding isn’t only about financially supporting survivors – it’s about preserving Altadena’s identity as asanctuary for Black families that grew into a “Black Mecca”.View image in fullscreenFlowers bloom behind a plastic fence around the lot where the Williams sisters’ mother’s home once stood, now lost to the Eaton fire.“It’s more than just homes, you’re talking about legacies,” Shupper said. “You’re talking about people who, in the face of overwhelming opposition, were able to obtain home ownership and have thriving communities. That’s what’s at stake here.” If resources are not allocated to help the community return, “then it will be completely changed,” she added.Ellen Williams parked next to her property and stepped out to greet her sister, Eshele, who had pulled up in her car. A walkway led to where her front door once stood but only bare ground remained, surrounded by an orange plastic fence marking the property line.The family received financial help and advice from Neighborhood Housing Services. Ellen submitted the plans for her dream home. Up the street, a prefabricated home will be placed on their mother’s land at a lower cost than it would take to rebuild from the ground up. Within sight of their mom’s lot, Eshele is rebuilding her home, too. She was a renter and lacked rental insurance but was able to buy the land thanks to NHS.Seeing palm trees still prompts anxiety, but Ellen Williams is focused on the future. “The neighbors are coming back. The only transfer of property was one of my neighbors over here,” she said, gesturing across the street. “They were older, so they transferred it to their kids, who are adults, so it will still be in their family.”“Other than that, everyone’s coming home, so that’s very exciting. I didn’t want new neighbors,” she joked."

So did their neighbours in the next basket and the ones after that, all down the line of 300 baskets, totalling 18,000 oysters.They are, however, never to be eaten. Instead they are tasked with reproducing and restoring oyster reefs to Dublin Bay more than two centuries after they were wiped out. “We want them to live long and happy lives,” said Lawlor.View image in fullscreenBaskets filled with oysters in Dún Laoghaire harbour in Dublin Bay.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianThis pioneering project in Dún Laoghaire harbour is betting that a species that thrived here for millennia – before the waters became an oyster graveyard – can do so again.Similar restoration projects are unfolding elsewhere in acontinent that once had sprawling reefsof the European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis)until overfishing, dredging and pollution wreaked obliteration.Reefs create rich ecosystems, provide a habitat for almost 200 fish and crustacean species and play a vital role in stabilising shorelines, nutrient cycling and water filtration.“These oysters are amazing climate heroes,” said Lawlor, co-founder ofGreen Ocean Foundation, a nonprofit that is driving efforts in Dublin. “They are natural filter feeders. Each oyster filters at a rate of 190 litres of seawater a day.”By feeding on plankton and nitrates, the oysters clear algae and help sunlight to reach the seafloor, boosting sea grass – a carbon sink – which in turns helps other species and improves coastal biodiversity and marine habitat.Ireland’s inhabitants cultivated oysters in the middle ages but in the 1800s industrialisation and overfishing killed off the Dublin Bay reefs – a phenomenon replicated from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean.Inspired in part by New York’s Billion Oyster Project, Lawlor enlisted volunteers and business sponsors for pilot projects that moved oysters from Tralee Bay in County Kerry to sites in Malahide, Howth, Poolbeg and Dún Laoghaire, which ring Dublin bay, and in Greystones, in County Wicklow.View image in fullscreenLawlor inspects oysters laid in Dublin Bay by the Green Ocean Foundation.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The Guardian“You’re building your understanding of why things work well or don’t work well. You want to make sure they survived, to see what the growth was like, and to see if they spawn,” said Lawlor.The transplanted oysters fared especially well in Dún Laoghaire so it was chosen for the next phase of the project – last November volunteers placed 300 baskets with 18,000 adult oysters in a sheltered part of the harbour. It is hoped they will become broodstock – spawn baby oysters in summer that will settle around the harbour and, in time, create a reef.Scientists from Dublin City University’sWater Instituteanalysed the water last year for baseline indicators and will monitor the oysters’ impact with sensors and chemical and biological assessment.The baskets are connected along a 100-metre line and are flipped by hand every few weeks to let Arctic terns, gulls and other birds peck away fouling that might otherwise curb the flow of water through the baskets.InNorthern Ireland, the charity Ulster Wildlife used a different technique recently toplace 2,000 adult oysters and 30,000 juveniles, sourced from Scotland, on the Belfast Lough seabed.View image in fullscreenAoibheann Boyle and Andrew Collins inspect oysters at the Green Ocean Foundation’s project in Dún Laoghaire harbour.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianTheLuna Oyster Project,a collaboration between Norfolk Seaweed and Oyster Heaven, aims to restore 4 million oysters to the North Sea by using the first mass deployment of clay structures called mother reef bricks.The Dublin initiative is far smaller but will hopefully grow, said Lawlor. “The temptation is to think massive but you need to take one step at a time. A lot of the challenge is bringing people with you,” he said, citing government departments, local councils, wildlife groups and harbour authorities.Last weekend, accompanied by volunteers Andrew Collins and Aoibheann Boyle, he returned to Dún Laoghaire, a wealthy, liberal neighbourhood, and boarded a dinghy to flip the baskets.Under a winter sun the trio recorded clips for the Green Ocean Foundation’s social media accounts and fielded supporters’ queries. One, sent in jest, proved unanswerable: “Can the oysters filter the smugness out of the people of Dún Laoghaire?”Explore more on these topicsIrelandMarine lifeWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cinta was so shy that she refused to feed when keepers at London zoo were around, and staff wondered how they would ever administer the young animal’s vaccinations without traumatising her.So Tony Cholerton, a zookeeper who had been a motorcycle engineer for many years, invented Robovacc – a machine to quickly administer vital jabs without the presence of people.The result, a clever contraption he controlled from an adjacent room with a handset taken from remote-control toy aeroplanes, successfully administered vaccinations to Cinta in a feeding area. The tiger sat up briefly, mid-meal, as the needle penetrated her rear end, then calmly continued eating.Cholerton, who worked at London zoo for 30 years before retiring in late 2025, now hopes a fully developed automatic version of his invention could solve seemingly intractable wildlife challenges – such as the role of badgers in spreading bovine TB to cattle.Badgers have been controversially culled in England for more than a decade, even while wildlife charities have been vaccinating badgers to show there is an alternative to killing Britain’s largest surviving carnivorous wild animal. The main cause of bovine TB in cattle is other cows.View image in fullscreenA still from a video showing the Robovacc in action.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianBadger vaccination can help, but it isexpensiveand time-consuming, and requires catching badgers in traps where they are often held for several hours overnight before they can be injected by a trained vaccinator.In contrast, Cholerton’s fully automated Robovacc machine, known as Autovacc, could administer vaccinations to a colony of up to 20 badgers without human intervention, with each badger being detained for no longer than a minute or two.“The dream is to see it used by scientists and farmers,” said Cholerton, who believes his prototypes could be mass-produced cheaply. “This is about giving the scientists the means to show that the science is correct, and badger vaccination works. The farmers win because they have a means to solve the TB problem in cattle. Everyone wins.”After Cholerton invented Robovacc, vets at London zoo used versions of his machines to deliver vaccines to lions and Diana monkeys. He found it worked best on carnivores, which tolerate the pin-prick, unlike primates, which remember the experience and then avoid the machine. Cholerton said it could be particularly useful to vaccinate captive carnivore species such as Amur leopards, when keepers wanted to keep human interactions to a minimum so they could be returned to the wild.While working as a zookeeper for the past decade, Cholerton spent evenings in his east London flat finessing his invention, developing a fully automatic version that uses three sensors to detect the proximity of the muscular rear end of an animal.The machine for badgers has been tested on ring-tailed coatis, which, like badgers, are unafraid of entering tunnels.The animal is tempted by a food bait into a Perspex tunnel, where smart technology is used to prevent the same animal being vaccinated more than once. When an animal is vaccinated, it is sprayed with nanoparticles that stick to the fur. These activate sensors if the animal returns, and a door opens into a different section of tunnel through which the animal exits.If an animal has not been vaccinated, another door opens into the vaccination section of the tunnel, where the animal’s movement is briefly restricted so its hindquarters rest against the sensors. In a split second, a needle is triggered from behind a protective sheath and injects the animal.Several safety mechanisms ensure the animal cannot bend or break the needle, or leave the tunnel with a needle still in its body. After the injection, the doors open and the animal is released.Cholerton hopes the next stage will involve conservation scientists, charities that have been overseeing badger vaccination and even interested farmers trialling his Autovacc machine.“This has got to be a collaboration,” he said. “The more interest the better. It would just be nice to see it being used with wild animals and undertaking vaccinations in a way that isn’t too invasive.“If it works for badger vaccination in a humane way, whatever government is in power will be obliged to take this route rather than just culling animals.”Rosie Wood, the chair of Badger Trust, said: “Vaccination of any wild species is stressful for the animal concerned so it’s heartening to know that jab-shy captive wild species can now be vaccinated stress free. There are many possible future applications for the technology – most I suspect are ones we haven’t thought of yet but might be the next zoonotic pandemic, so investment in it should be taken seriously.”But Wood added that although vaccinating badgers could be used to prove that badger populations were kept bovine TB-free, it did not have any measurable effect on the rates of bovine TB in cattle. “Even Defra now concedes it is not possible to prove any measurable impact on bovine TB rates in cattle as a result of badger culling – and as killing them isn’t working, vaccinating them won’t either,” she said.Explore more on these topicsWildlifeBadgersAnimalsZoosnewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, beaches across West Sussex have experienced similar problems over the past month, with the situation having been worsened by the impact of Storm Goretti.Donna Trethewey, founder of Selsey Beach Litter Ninjas, said there had been no reports of shipping containers or their contents washing up in her area for years, until three separate incidents in the past six weeks led to 24 containers going overboard.The first incident on 6 December last year involved16 containersfrom the refrigerated cargo ship Baltic Klipper in the Solent, the stretch of water between the Isle of Wight and the British mainland.“The original spillage saw seven containers washing up across our 7½km [5 mile] beach … Whole containers washed up and literally broke up before your eyes,” Trethewey said.She added that containers breaking down at sea had led to their contents, includingproduce such as bananas and avocadosalongside their plastic packaging, being washed up ashore.“We got as much of the big stuff as quickly as we possibly could before it broke down further, but there is still a large amount of small insulation foam pieces across the beach.”Trethewey said the group provided the litter it had collected to a contractor for West Sussex county council, who then took the items away for processing and eventual recycling.View image in fullscreenShipping cargo debris on Selsey Beach.Photograph: Selsey Beach Litter NinjasThe local authority said on Wednesday it was aware of debris from a container washing ashore at Elmer in Bognor Regis, but that weather and water conditions had made recovery operations difficult, while waste materials from a container had been reported ashore between West Wittering and Shoreham-by-Sea.A report by the World Shipping Council (WSC) last year found 576 shipping containers had been lost at sea across 2024, out of the more than 250m transported.Dr Simon Boxall, an academic in oceanography at the University of Southampton, recalled an incident in 1992 when plasticFriendly Floatees bath toys washed into the Pacific Oceanfrom a container ship and ended up distributed across the world, demonstrating how the global ocean network is connected.“It is estimated that 2,200 containers fall off ships into the water each year. They are all being loaded on to ships so it’s not unheard of for a crane operator or system to slip and pop a container into the water,” he said.View image in fullscreenWashed-up shipping containers on the Sussex shoreline.Photograph: Selsey Beach Litter NinjasBoxall said that Southampton’s reputation as the second biggest container port in Britain was a contributing factor to the issue, as well as the Channel being one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.“Regarding the south coast, it’s not surprising we are seeing them as they have always been washing up. I can think of many cases over the years.”The wreckage from a shipping container on the MSC Napoli on Branscombe Beach in January 2007 sawseveral BMW motorcycles, among other goods, allegedly claimed by opportunistic scavengers.The lecturer highlighted threats to wildlife through the spilling of herbicides, pesticides and acids, with hazards to navigation also posed due to the containers floating just below the surface of the water.An Environment Agency spokesperson said it was closely monitoring the potential impact of washed-up containers in Sussex to wildlife and water.Members of the public have also been asked not to touch, move or take any washed-up waste or produce and to keep children and animals away.Despite the longstanding problem, a change in legislation could see the tide starting to turn.The International Maritime Organization, working alongside the WSC, have introduced a law this year that forces shipping companies to report any containers which have been lost at sea.Boxall said: “As of 1 January, it is a criminal offence to not report the loss of a container. The issue is not being treated as a witch-hunt, but rather a way of logging what happens.”View image in fullscreenA clean-up operation on Selsey Beach in West Sussex.Photograph: Selsey Beach Litter NinjasRegarding the onion spectacle on Brighton Beach, Evans said she would welcome moves to see shipping companies taking responsibility in clearing their debris.“It’s only a few containers to them but it displaces whole communities. Surfers and swimmers have been advised not to enter the water, and there’s no sign of the containers’ owners getting involved to clear the mess.”Despite the ordeal, Evans has said the situation has been a great opportunity for the community to come together, with up to 400 local people volunteering to collect waste over the week.“We have 7½ miles of beach here in Brighton. Three days later, it was absolutely clear.“Out of everything that’s happened, we’ve definitely galvanised the community through this.

In an interview withthe Timeslast week, Jones also suggested he would increase performance-related pay and more civil servants would be “shown the door” if not meeting standards.The original vehicle for Whitehall training was for decades the Civil Service College, which was axed in 1995 by the then Cabinet Office minister, Stephen Dorrell, deciding it was unfit for purpose and would have to close. Its successor, the National School of Government, was shuttered under Cameron and his efficiency chief, Francis Maude, in an era when civil servants were called the “enemies of enterprise”. It was replaced by a national civil service learning programme which lacked its own campus.Keir Starmer’s government has embarked on its own efficiency drive, with the prime minister controversially saying too many in Whitehall were content with a “tepid bath of managed decline”.Last week, Wes Streeting, the health secretary,criticised the centre left for an “excuses culture”that blames the UK’s slow pace of change on Whitehall officials and interest groups.But Jones, the PM’s chief secretary, said at the same Institute for Government conference that plans for reforming Whitehall were about improving the system rather than civil servants.He said: “Civil servants are as frustrated as us … but over the years we have ended up with a system that does not enable them to do their work in the same way that politicians might want it to be. The question is why … over time it has become bloated and, as a consequence, on permissions and mandates and risk taking, we have a lot of internal discussion and not enough doing.“I’m not going to criticise civil servants and I’m not going to criticise departments because ultimately it is for ministers to reshape that in the way that they want to. Digital ID will be part of that.”Explore more on these topicsCivil servicenewsShareReuse this content"

While there is no move against Davey, who led the party to itsbest election result in a centuryin 2024, MPs said this could change if there was no progress.“Morale is low,” one said. “No one is saying get rid of Ed. But what they are saying is that those around him need to move with significant pace towards the development of a national story for the party to tell. We need to be a bit more serious about being the third party.“Reform are assuming a place in the national debate, and so are the Greens. We are content to not do this. And it isn’t good enough.”The party’s success in 2024 was built around ultra-disciplined messaging on a small number of subjects, notably the NHS and care, and sewage in rivers. While the messaging has expanded, particularly with Davey’s criticisms of Donald Trump, a number of Lib Dem MPs believe the atomisation of UK politics means more boldness is needed.“The leadership is very good at getting into the media with some things, but talking about A&E or Trump is no substitute for having a national position,” one MP said.Another criticism is a perceived caution in announcing policies. The party spent some weeks working on a plan for film-style age ratings for social media, only to see the Conservativesannounce their own policydays before, getting most of the attention.“I think Ed has a very clear strategy and vision,” another MP said. “The problem we have in part is that we’re too academic at times. But at the same time, the Tory policy on social media didn’t work. If we have ambitions to run the country, we can’t just rush around saying things.”Many Lib Dem MPs nonetheless agree that the party needs a coherent national policy, particularly on the cost of living. “We need a big retail offer on the economy,” one said. “We need to be more radical on this and if we are, Ed is the person to do it as he’s well liked, experienced and won’t scare people.”For now, Davey and his inner circle appear to be focusing more on defending the dozens of seats won in 2024 and seeking out more target constituencies, a gradualist approach that some in the party worry may be not keeping up with events.“If the day after the next election we end up with 80 MPs, it would again be the best result for a century and Ed could retire happy,” another MP said. “But politics is changing fast, and with first past the post if you don’t keep up as a party you can die.”View image in fullscreenDavey and the deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, take a selfie with Lib Dem MPs in Westminster Hall in July after their election success.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesOn the other side of the argument, when the Lib Dems have gone for a bold national messages, it has sometimes been burned,most recently in 2019when a pledge to reverse Brexit racked up votes but the party won just 11 seats.“The 2019 election was very heady but we failed. Ed is not willing for that to happen again,” an ally of the Lib Dem leader said. “Pretty much any seat we fail to win next time will go to Reform or the Conservatives. We have to make sure we have the biggest number of MPs possible.”The ally said Davey was aware of the need for a national message, pointing to what they called a recent “step change” in the party’s social media operation.The frustrations will not be news to Davey, with some MPs having raised the same issues at recent party awaydays.“There’s no shouting, there is no jostling for position. But there are penetrating questions being asked about our purpose and where we are going,” another MP said. “At the moment it feels a bit like gruel. Ed needs to be mindful that it won’t take much more for colleagues to become really frustrated.”A key moment is likely to be May’s elections for the Scottish and Welsh parliaments and councils across England. Disappointing results, particularly coupled with a perceived lack of ambition, could prove a tipping point, the MP said.“It’s not just what the message is, it’s whether the person delivering it is the right person to do so,” they said. “We all know divided parties don’t go down well with the electorate. But if you look at the history of the party, when our leaders go, they go very quickly. They are secure until suddenly they are not. And I don’t think it would take much for frustrations to bubble over.”Explore more on these topicsLiberal DemocratsEd DaveynewsShareReuse this content"

They are not building the social skills needed to thrive, nor having the experiences that will prepare them for adulthood.”They add: “Around the world, governments are recognising the severity of this crisis and taking action.” Noting existing or pending legislation in Australia, Denmark, France, Norway, New Zealand and Greece, they say: “We believe the onus must be placed on technology platforms, not parents, to prevent underage access. We would support a model similar to Australia’s that requires companies to take meaningful steps to enforce age limits.”They conclude: “We urge the government to show leadership on this issue by introducing a minimum age for social media access of 16 years old.”The signatories of the letter represent a wide spectrum of opinion within the party. They include Helen Hayes, the chair of the education select committee, and Florence Eshalomi, the chair of the housing and local government committee.Others include Vicky Foxcroft, the former whip whohelped lead the rebellionagainst the government’s proposed welfare cuts, and Catherine McKinnell, a former education minister. The letter has support from some on the left of the party such as Richard Burgon, and on the right such as the prominent “blue Labour” MP Jonathan Hinder.The weight of Commons support for a ban will put further pressure on the prime minister, who has previously been sceptical about whether such a move would work, but whotold MPsat a recent meeting that he would be open to one in theory.In recent days, government figures have stressed they are concerned that a ban could force children on to the dark web, and they want to see more evidence before committing to enforcing one in the UK.One source close to Starmer said: “In principle, Keir is in favour of a ban. We can all see the dangers and worry about what is happening to young people’s minds. But there are still big obstacles to overcome with implementation. We can already see that from Australia. We need to take our time and make sure we get this right.”A Downing Street figure suggested Starmer could give a ban his symbolic support soon, but the government would then take its time over implementation, “ironing out” any difficulties first.They said: “It’s Keir’s direction of travel but there’s lots of hurdles to overcome first. We’re not going to rush into this.”Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday: “There are strong arguments for banning under-16s from social media but there are also real concerns raised by the NSPCC and others about whether it pushes children to darker, less-regulated places on the internet.”Those arguments were reinforced over the weekend by Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, the teenager who took her own life after looking at suicide content online. Russelltold the BBC’s Newscasthe opposed what he called “sledgehammer-like techniques like bans”.The prime minister’s position will be put to the test this week when peers vote on an amendment by the Conservative member John Nash to the children wellbeing and schools bill proposing enacting an age limit within 12 months of the bill’s passage.Labour has not said how it intends to vote on the issue yet but several peers are expected to support it regardless of whips’ instructions.They include the former MP Luciana Berger, who has co-signed Nash’s amendment. She told the Guardian: “The proposal for raising the social media age limit for under-16s enjoys huge support – across the country and within the Labour party.Social mediais catastrophically harming children and we must act now to protect them. I urge peers to back our amendment on Wednesday so we can give young people their childhood back.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaChildrenInternet safetyKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Some credit unions mimic banks, offering savings and current accounts from high street premises, while others are more modest, lending relatively small amounts and based in properties shared with other community groups.However,membership has grown by 9%between 2020 and 2025 to more than 1.5 million members. Outstanding loansamounted to almost £5bn, with almost half accounted for by credit unions in Northern Ireland, according to the latest Bank of England data. The total amounts to less than one-twentieth of the estimated£120bn of outstanding non-mortgage financial debtheld by UK households.Gareth Thomas, the Labour MP for Harrow West and one of the signatories, said the military credit union in the US had become a huge lender and a model for the three military credit unions in the UK: Serve and Protect; First Defence Finance, which is part of the Plane Saver credit union; and Forces Finance, part of London Mutual credit union.In 2014, Camilla revealed she wasa member of London Mutual, which provides services to, among others, anyone who lives or works in the boroughs of Southwark, Lambeth, Westminster or Camden.She has commented that credit unions should be seen as an alternative to the payday loan industry.Signatories of the letter include the defence committee chair, Tan Dhesi, the business and trade committee chair, Liam Byrne, and the justice committee chair, Andy Slaughter. Other MPs who have signed the letter include the backbench Labour MPs Stella Creasy, Kate Osborne, Matt Western and Nadia Whittome.They said: “As credit unions play a crucial role in tackling financial exclusion, we encourage you to publish a plan to double the size of the credit union sector.”To achieve this aim, they said the chancellor should adopt a series of measures, including:Every employee, starting with teachers and nurses, should have a “right to save” and be able to request that their employer allows them to save directly with a credit union via the pensions auto-enrolment scheme.Every social housing provider should promote credit unions to their tenants and staff.The City watchdog, the Prudential Regulation Authority, should ease the rules on credit unions lending to each other to help them manage their financial security and expand the range of financial services they can offer.Explore more on these topicsBorrowing & debtCredit unionsLabourBankingSaving moneyUK cost of living crisisPayday loansnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the NUP had planned similar attacks “everywhere”.Human Rights Watch accused the government of “brutal repression” of the opposition ahead of the vote.Another key opposition leader, Kizza Besigye, who ran four times against Museveni, was abducted in Kenya in 2024 and brought back to a military court in Uganda for a treason trial that is ongoing.African election observers, including a team from the African Union, said on Saturday that “reports of intimidation, arrest and abductions” had “instilled fear and eroded public trust in the electoral process”.Explore more on these topicsUgandaYoweri MuseveniBobi WineAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had also urged restraint, according to Axios, citing the risks to regional stability.“It was really close,” a US official told Axios, adding that the order to strike never came.In a social media post on Friday, Trump thanked Tehran’s leaders, claiming they had called off scheduled executions of 800 people, including that ofErfan Soltani, 26, the first Iranian protester sentenced to death since the unrest began.Soltani, a clothing shop employee, was arrested in Karaj, a city north-west of Tehran, after participating in protests and was due to be executed on Wednesday, according to rights groups. Since his arrest, his family had received little news about his condition besides a brief, scheduled visit before his expected execution.Over the weekend, Soltani’s family were able to visit him and establish that he was alive. “I am relieved to know my cousin Erfan is alive,” said Soltani’s cousin Somayeh, who lives in Germany. “However, I am worried because I received news that he has been tortured under custody and hasn’t received medical attention yet.“I appeal to the international community to please bring attention to his detention conditions. I also appeal to European politicians to please sponsor his case to demand medical assistance for Erfan. I am also deeply worried for the thousands of other protesters in custody.”At least 5,000 people have been killed in protests in Iran, including about 500 security personnel, an Iranian official in the region said on Sunday, citing verified figures and accusing “terrorists and armed rioters” of killing “innocent Iranians”.During a speech on Thursday, Khamenei acknowledged for the first time that thousands of people had been killed, “some in an inhuman, savage manner”. He blamed the US for the death toll, railing against Trump, whom he called a “criminal” for his support of the demonstrations, and calling for strict punishment of the protesters.On Sunday, monitors said some internet access had been restored in Iran. “Traffic data indicates a significant return to some online services including Google, suggesting that heavily filtered access has been enabled, corroborating user reports of partial restoration,” Netblocks said in a social media post.An Iranian official who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue told Reuters some of the heaviest clashes and highest number of deaths had been in the Iranian Kurdish areas in the country’s north-west. Kurdish separatists have been active there and flare-ups have been among the most violent in recent periods of unrest.The Human Rights Activists news agency said 24,348 protesters had been arrested in the crackdown.No protests have been reported for days in Iran, where the streets have returned to an uneasy calm. Instead, some Iranians chanted anti-Khamenei slogans from the windows of their homes on Saturday night, the chants reverberating around neighbourhoods in Tehran, Shiraz and Isfahan, witnesses said.AFP, Reuters and AP contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Brock – of South Charleston,Ohio– is white.He was convicted of murder, felonious assault and kidnapping Wednesday. He is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison at his sentencing hearing.A message seeking comment was left with his attorney.Brock’s attorney said the shooting was in self-defense and the scammer had made threats against him and his family. Brock testified during the trial that he felt threatened when the driver arrived at his house.But prosecutors said Hall was unarmed and posed no threat when Brock shot her. Investigators said the driver was unaware of the scam call that Brock had received with threats and demands for money.Clark county prosecutor Daniel Driscoll told reporters after the verdict that both families lost loved ones because of the scam.“The really sad part about this is that we know there are still criminals out there,” he said. “We know that the scammers, the folks who started this, haven’t been brought to justice.”Associated Press contributedExplore more on these topicsUS crimeOhionewsShareReuse this content"

Those who support it and continue to host it even now will not be granted a foothold in Gaza. Period.“The prime minister must stand firm on this, even if it requires managing a dispute with our great friend and President Trump’s emissaries.”View image in fullscreenBezalel Smotrich has criticised Turkey and Qatar’s involvement in the White House’s Gaza plan.Photograph: Ronen Zvulun/ReutersOn Sunday, in an apparent attempt to calm tensions and assess his next move, Netanyahu convened a meeting with coalition partners.The prime minister’s central challenge is containing his far-right allies, whose continued participation in the government is key to his political survival and who never agreed to a US-brokered ceasefire struck last October.Netanyahu himself objected to the plan on Saturday, citing how some of the appointments were “not coordinated with Israel and were contrary to its policy”, without specifying who. He told his foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, to contact the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.Israel has previously objected strongly to any Turkish role in postwar Gaza, with relations between the two countries having deteriorated sharply since the war began in October 2023.Trump appoints Blair, Kushner and Rubio to Gaza ‘board of peace’Read moreIn addition to naming Turkey’s foreign minister to the executive board, Trump has invited the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to join the overarching board of peace, along with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, the former UK prime minister Tony Blair and the president of Argentina, Javier Milei. Pakistan’s prime minister Shehbaz Sharif has also received an invitation to join, Pakistan said on Sunday.The White House said Trump’s plan would include three bodies: the board of peace, chaired by Trump; a Palestinian committee of technocrats tasked with governing Gaza; and the Gaza executive board, which would play an advisory role.The Palestinian technocratic committee held its first meeting in Cairo on Saturday.A draft charter sent to about 60 countries by the US administration calls for members to contribute $1bn in cash if they want their membership to last more than three years, according to the document seen by Reuters.“Each Member State shall serve a term of no more than three years from this Charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the Chairman,” states the document, first reported by Bloomberg News. “The three-year membership term shall not apply to Member States that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force.”The US said this week that the Gaza truce plan had entered a second phase, shifting from implementing a ceasefire to the disarmament of Hamas, whose attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 triggered the Israeli offensive in Gaza.The focus of the second phase has shifted from simply stopping the fighting to establishing transitional governance, demilitarisation and reconstruction in the territory – a dramatic escalation of diplomatic ambition amid persistent violencefrom the Israeli military.At least 451 Palestinians have been reported killed since the ceasefire took effect in October last year. Life in the enclave remains precarious. While airstrikes and gunfire have slowed, they have not ceased. At the same time, recent storms have compounded the crisis, causing deaths and flooding in displacement camps already stretched beyond their limits.Strong winter winds caused walls to collapse on to flimsy tents housing displaced Palestinians last Tuesday, killing at least four people. On Saturday, a27-day-old babyin Gaza died from severe cold, bringing the number of children in the region who have died of hypothermia since the start of the current winter season to eight, according to the Palestinian health ministry.AFP contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsraelGazaPalestineIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Trump financial products raise questions about potential presidential conflicts of interestFive exchange-traded funds have been launched by Trump Media, owner of the president’s social media platform Truth SocialLauren Arataniin New YorkSun 18 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 08.02 ESTShareThe word “Truth” was plastered all around the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday morning. At 9.30am, when the market opened, a small crowd stood on the balcony above the trading floor to ring in the day.The group was celebrating the launch of five exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that are tied to Truth Social, Donald Trump’s social media platform that has spun into a menagerie of products over the last few years.Under a parent organization, the Trump Media and Technology Group, Truth Social has been joined by astreaming platform, anuclear fusion energycompany and a growing slate of financial services products.The ETFs are just the beginning of what will probably be a whole range of new financial products, especially related to crypto, rolled out this year all as the presidentcontinues to call backback to his promise to make the US the “crypto capital of the world”.The Trump Media ETFs, which were officially launched on the stock exchange at the end of December, are being branded as “America First” funds, a kind of antithesis to the “woke” environmental, social and governance (ESG) movement that was popular in investment, particularly at the end of Trump’s first term.Each of the five ETFs has a specific theme that centers Trump-branded patriotism: American-based companies, real estate in Republican-voting states, energy production and infrastructure, security and defense, and technology, including bitcoin.ETFs – which are portfolios of assets, trading as a single investment vehicle – have rapidly risen in popularity in recent years. In 2025, new investments in ETFsreached$1.4tn, with a total of $13tn invested in the industry.The “America First” ETFs are being managed by Yorkville America, a branch of Yorkville Advisors, an investment company based in New Jersey that haspartneredwith Trump Media in helping the company roll out its financial products. In 2024, Yorkville Advisors was involved in a $2.5bn fundraising round by Trump Media, and last year the investment company agreed to provide a $5bn line of credit to Trump Media and Crypto.com to form a new crypto treasury.It’s a huge bet that Trump’s brand will be able to draw sustained financial interest. So far, the evidence has been mixed.Truth Social, which the president still uses to fire off daily declarations and diatribes, has far fewer users than the social media giants that it was supposed to compete against. Trump Media, which is trading on Nasdaq, ballooned to over $60 per share in March 2024, during Trump’s presidential campaign, but is now trading closer to $14 per share. While Trump’s $Trump meme coin, which he promoted last January, soared in price to $45 a token around his inauguration, it has since dropped down to $5 a token.The companies are also wading in uncharted waters around potential conflicts of interest that might arise when a sitting president is tied to such deep financial stakes.Much of the company’s new ventures have launched over the last year, coinciding with Trump’s return to the White House, raising concerns among government ethics watchdogs about potential conflicts of interest that these new deals could create.Before his inauguration, Trump put all his Trump Media shares into a revocable trust headed by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Typically, US presidents put their financial interests into a blind trust, managed by an independent third party.“The thing that’s guarding the president from getting involved in conflicts of interests and propping up the presidency are ethics norms,” said Kedric Payne, a former attorney at the office of congressional ethics. “That’s it. So if there are no ethics norms, there is no mechanism set up where you could have officials or agencies that are in charge of making the president comply with norms.”In alettersent to the US treasury on Tuesday, the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren requested that the office of the comptroller of the currency delay its review of a bank charter of World Liberty Financial, Trump Media’s digital asset company, which is trying to become a regulated crypto bank.If the charter is approved, “for the first time in history, the president of the United States would be in charge of overseeing his own financial company”, Warren wrote.Ethics watchdogs are especially concerned that people or companies looking to curry favor with Trump’s can simply invest in one of his company’s products. “The concern is if large investors purchase that financial product to win favor with him,” said Payne, senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center.Questions have already been raised about Trump’s relationship with leaders in the crypto industry. Trump pardoned former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who invested $2bn in World Liberty Financial, and the SEC paused a federal investigation into Justin Sun, another crypto billionaire who bought $200m worth of Trump’s crypto token. (Sun has repeatedly maintained his innocence.) And while the Biden administration was investigating Trump Media partner Crypto.com, the inquiries stopped once Trump became president.“There is absolutely no connection between the decision” and Crypto.com’s political activities, the company hassaid, adding that “any assertion to the contrary is entirely inaccurate”.Meanwhile, the White House has said that “neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest”.Trump was not at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday morning, leaving the iconic bell ringing to Yorkville America.He had rung the bell once before, though, after Time Magazine named him person of the year, in 2024. Standing on the balcony that day as CEOs chanted “USA! USA!” from below, Trump smiled as he gave them a message. “We’re with you all the way!” he said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpEthicsCryptocurrenciesTrump administrationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has previously told the government he would be willing to step in and run the business.The cash shortage at Liberty is a sign of the continued financial troubles facing companies owned bythe under-pressure metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta. Gupta has lost control of several parts of his GFG Alliance empire since the2021 collapse of his key lender, Greensill Capital.Gupta in Augustlost control over Speciality Steel UKin South Yorkshire because it was “hopelessly insolvent”. The Dalzell mill has not filed accounts for five years, and Gupta is facing prosecution over failure to file accounts, as well as a long-running fraud investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.The 216-metre FSS ships, designed to carry munitions, food and other supplies for the navy’s Royal Fleet Auxiliary, are due to be built in Belfast by the Spanish state-owned shipbuilder Navantia. The first ship, RFA Resurgent, is expected to be delivered in 2031.The FSS ship orders were meant to secure employment in the UK, and to rely as much as possible on UK suppliers. Navantia took over the Harland & Wolff site in Belfast last year, afterits British owner collapsed.The cash shortage at Liberty Steel has left it unable to buy the slabs of steel it needs from British Steel, although workers have continued to be paid 80% of their salaries. Small trial runs in November were only able to process about 1,000 tonnes – or about three days of output – sources said. Liberty has hopes of restarting production in the coming weeks, but some industry figures have expressed scepticism over its plans.Murray,a former owner of Rangers football clubin Glasgow, said he wanted to take over the running of the plant, and that it could be profitable within two years with the injection of enough cash to pay for raw materials and working capital with an investment of £50m.Murray tried to buy the plant in 2015 before it was sold to Gupta in a deal brokered by the Scottish government. The government chose Gupta and lent him £7m in part because he also promised to turn around the Alvance aluminium smelter in Fort William in the Scottish Highlands, and to open an aluminium car wheel factory.Alvance was loss-making in the year to March 2021. It has failed to file accounts since then, although social media accounts suggest it is still operating as normal.The wheel factory was never opened, and the £7m loan is still outstanding. The other leading creditor is thought to be an energy company also owned by Gupta.Murray said: “It’s a terrible error of judgment to remain idle when the British economy should have the capability of rolling wide steel which could be supplied to customers like Harland & Wolff and BAE Systems with new naval contracts 17 miles from the mill. We cannot going forward rely on importing everything. We don’t know what’s coming round the corner.”Liberty Steel approached Murray two years ago trying to sell the Dalzell plant as a going concern. However, Murray refused the offer because he believed it should instead be sold via a “pre-pack administration”, in which a sale is lined up in advance of entering the insolvency process.A production restart at Dalzell would provide a welcome large customer for British Steel’s slabs from Scunthorpe plant. The Westminster governmenttook control of the plant from its Chinese owners, Jingye Steel, in April, but has so farspent £274mpropping up the lossmaking operation.A Liberty Steel spokesperson said the plant “is fulfilling” the Navantia order and said trial production runs “are expected to shortly resume”.The spokesperson said: “With the positive momentum from this significant contract Liberty aims to attract more business through a pipeline of select projects.“While sales conditions for merchant plate have been challenging due to competition from cut-price imports, recent UK trade actions coupled with beneficial UK/US tariffs will enable Dalzell to ramp up production of its high-quality plate and continue to support UK industrial policy and jobs.”Navantia UK declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsSteel industryManufacturing sectorSanjeev GuptaRoyal NavyGreensillMilitaryScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Plymouth’s pubs and streets became vivid backdrops for Cook’s work.Photograph: Courtesy of ourberylcook.com © John Cook“Beryl Cook wasn’t painting caricatures,” she said. “She was documenting communities and identities that were actively marginalised with affection, mastery and honesty. Her work from the 1970s to 2000s captures working-class joy, body positivity and queer culture.”The exhibition comes at an apt time: 2026 is the centenary of Cook’s birth and it is half a century since a Sunday Times feature launched her into the public consciousness after her first exhibition at an arts centre inPlymouth.It also coincides with the Devon city – better known for its naval history than its art –bidding to become the UK city of culture.View image in fullscreenBowlers Off the Hoe.Photograph: Courtesy of ourberylcook.com © John Cook 2025Cook, who died in 2008 aged 81, moved to Plymouth in 1968 and the city became her primary subject, its pubs, streets and lido vivid backdrops for her work.The Pride and Joy show features more than 80 paintings, alongside rarely seen sculptures, textiles, and access to Cook’s personal archive of photographs, sketches and correspondence.An “identity and representation” section highlights how she painted those who were “othered” and looked down upon whether through attitudes toward gender, class, sexuality or body shape.Walkup flagged up a little-known 1972 painting called Bar Girls, which features two women with pints of beer. “It may not seem unusual today but in those days there were still some pubs that refused to serve women if they were unaccompanied by men. Here we have two women enjoying a full pint and each other’s company.“She’s not making fun of her subjects at all – she’s painting people occupying spaces unapologetically. She celebrates her subjects and we think there’s something so important and radical and joyous in that.”In a “process and practice” section, Cook’s meticulous methods of working are revealed. She mined media – from local television news to newspapers – for subjects and inspiration.The “influences and impact” section highlights how Cook drew on sources ranging from “saucy” seaside postcards to the work of Amedeo Modigliani and Pieter Bruegel the Elder.Jemima Laing, the deputy leader of Plymouth city council, said Cook put the place on the cultural map. “For over 40 years she painted our sailors, our shoppers, our pubs, our people, always with warmth, humour and genuine affection. While critics dismissed her, the public loved her, and now it’s time for long-awaited and hugely deserved critical recognition,” she said.View image in fullscreenSailors and Seagulls.Photograph: Courtesy of ourberylcook.com © John Cook 2025Laing said larger than lifesize sculptures of some of her characters would be popping up across the city: “They’re Plymouth’s love letter to an artist who never stopped celebrating us.”Julian Spalding, a writer and former museum director, said he was delighted Cook was being feted. “She’s one of the glories of British painting, a modern William Hogarth and Thomas Rowlandson rolled into one,” he said.“I once asked her if she’d ever wanted to paint something that upset her. She said: ‘No. If I thought it would make any difference, I might. But I don’t.’ It’s joy that drove her to create.”Beryl Cook: Pride and Joy opens atthe Box in Plymouthon Saturday 24 January 2026 and will run until 31 May.Explore more on these topicsExhibitionsArtPaintingPlymouthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

As its first show comes to the stage, he explains his plan to bring big productions back to his homelandSun 18 Jan 2026 05.01 ESTShareSince Thornton Wilder wrote Our Town in 1938, it is said that not a day has passed when the Pulitzer prize-winning show hasn’t been performed. “Every time I read it, I come away with the feeling of having been woken up,” saysMichael Sheen, star of the upcoming touring production of Wilder’s play about a close-knit community in small-town America. “With this urgent sense of ‘I have to not waste this.’”Transposing the heart of the American classic to Wales, this new production also marks the launch of Welsh National Theatre, a hugely ambitious company formed – and financed – by Sheen in response to the collapse of the former National Theatre Wales. “Opening night is going to be more than just the opening night of a play,” saysRussell T Davies, the show’s creative associate. “I think in 10 years, we’ll be having a marvellous celebration that all began with Our Town.”Welsh directors are working in studio spaces, which limits the sort of stories we’re telling in WalesMichael SheenThe creation of Welsh National Theatre is a galvanising statement of intent, particularly given the increasing number of theatres in Wales facing cuts and closures. Aiming to champion big stories on big stages, the new venture stands up against the continual devaluing of the arts, with a recent cross-party report finding that Wales spends less on culture thanalmost every other European nation(the only country lower is Greece). Alongside the closure of National Theatre Wales, recent years have seen significant cuts to beloved institutions including Welsh National Opera, Theatr Clwyd and Theatr Na nÓg. Despite an abundance of talented writers and performers in Wales, the theatrical ecosystem has not been blossoming with hope.View image in fullscreen‘It was an emergency situation’ … Michael Sheen.Photograph: Felicity McCabe/The GuardianNow into that picture bursts Welsh NationalTheatre, a company fuelled by the desire to create large-scale platforms for Welsh talent, at home and internationally, and to influence and expand the Welsh canon. Sheen says he wanted to “go back to basics” with a company that blends a community focus with grand, global ambition, “to attract and build an audience, and use that as an engine to address the more infrastructural problems. Like directors being able to take a step up to bigger stages and playwrights being able to write the plays they want to write, rather than having to be too limited by practicalities.”The new company’s opening season sees Our Town followed by Owain & Henry, a new play by Iphigenia in Splott’s writer Gary Owen. A co-production with theWalesMillennium Centre, the show will once again star Sheen, this time as Owain Glyndŵr, the 15th-century Welsh separatist who raised a rebellion against King Henry IV. Matthew Rhys will then lead Mark Jenkins’s Playing Burton, a thorny tribute to the great Welsh actor Richard Burton. “You build upwards,” Sheen says of his plans for the company, “looking at rediscovering Welsh plays, but also looking for world drama that could be adapted for Wales.”The idea to launch Welsh National Theatre with Our Town began with the actor’s desire to give a larger platform to the show’s director, Francesca Goodridge, also artistic director of Cardiff’s Sherman theatre. “One of the challenges we have in Wales is for Welsh directors to work on main stages,” says Sheen. “They’re working in studio spaces and the knock-on effect is that writers write plays for smaller casts. That limits the sort of stories we’re telling in Wales.” The pair met on Nye, Tim Price’s grand tale of the NHS, which Goodridge co-directed with Rufus Norris for the show’s revival, and in which Sheen played Labour politician Aneurin “Nye” Bevan. Sheen had seen Goodridge’s work before on Richard Mylan’s unflinching show about drug addiction, Sorter, at Grand Theatre Swansea, where Our Town will open, as well as on Patrick Hamilton’s nihilistic thriller Rope, at Theatr Clwyd. “He said: ‘I love what you do, and I’d love to see it on a bigger scale,’” Goodridge says, and laughs. “I was like: ‘Yeah, me too.’”Sheen describes Goodridge’s plays as “terrific, but I could see she was theatrically straining at the leash. So I said: why don’t we do something together? By me being in it, it can be on a main stage.” He means this entirely without ego. Sheen is simply, as Davies notes, “a man who makes things happen”.View image in fullscreenFrancesca Goodridge directs actor Matthew Trevannion.Photograph: Helen MurrayFor Goodridge, who is drawn to large ensemble and movement-led pieces, transposing the essence of Wilder’s fictional Grover’s Corners to Wales seemed obvious; the community already felt familiar to her. “You’re seeing two mums gossiping in the garden,” she says. “The kids who start to fancy each other in school. The guy delivering the milk. The routines. It feels like where I grew up.” Goodridge was raised in Fforestfach, Swansea, on the same street as her sister and uncle. “If we were out of milk, I’d go two doors up,” she says. “This play is purposefully saying: we’re an ordinary town. Then in the third act, it tells you that everything you’d thought was mundane is actually what builds all the extraordinary moments of your life.” It is about the details you miss, the things you forget to pay attention to, but which collectively make up a life worth living. “The smell of my mum’s kitchen,” Goodridge says. “Watching my niece grow up.” She hopes audiences will “leave wanting to call the person they love”.As the Welsh cast have been exploring the American play, the fit has felt just right. “I think it’s perfect for a Welsh accent,” says Sheen, “because the language is quite lyrical, quite sing-songy.” Davies, who directed Sheen in a local youth theatre production aged 24, when the actor was in his teens, has been liaising with the Wilder estate to “ease the production into a bit more of a Welsh idiom,” he says. “They protect the play beautifully, so they obviously don’t want things changed too much.” His initial suggestions of switching words to better fit cultural norms – like changing baseball for rugby – were gently dismissed, “because that’s what Wilder wrote”, Davies says, “and I was never there to trample on his words.” What they decided, Davies says, is that it feels “like a Welsh community in America, like we have in Patagonia”.A head of drama at ITV said, people don’t like the Welsh – so I’ve always quietly fought that fightRussell T DaviesThey started to think more imaginatively about how this adaptation might work. “We’ve got the beauty of being able to use our own language,” says Goodridge. One significant decision to help the play fit the Welsh cast has been to translate the hymns. “Hearing them all sing like a big Welsh choir,” Goodridge smiles, touching her neck, “your hair stands on end.” The show has a cast of 18 Welsh actors, a rare and wonderful thing. In the 90s, Davies remembers, he was told to take Welsh characters out of his writing. “A head of drama at ITV said people don’t like the Welsh,” he recalls. “So I’ve always quietly fought that fight. But it takes someone who’s not quiet, like Michael, to lead the way.” Now, being involved in such a grand Welsh story, Davies says, gives him “immense pride”.The play can be misread as twee, with its stage manager (Sheen) open-heartedly introducing the town’s jumble of characters. But to see only that is to miss the play’s muscle. “Wilder’s using this stereotypical idea of small-town life in order to tell a story that is much steelier and harder to be confronted by,” says Sheen. The events of the play end just before the first world war and Wilder was writing it just before the second world war. “The rivers are rising and there’s a sense of something coming,” Sheen says, “of people suffering and it not being addressed. I think Wilder was warning people about the rise of fascism, saying all this could get washed away. But I don’t think the point of it is to say it’s tragic.” When a core character dies, Sheen says, “the point is to go: how did they live?”As Goodridge and Sheen started considering staging the show, National Theatre Wales was in the process of crumbling, after Arts Council Wales took away 100% of its funding. “There was a lot of discontent within the Welsh artistic community,” Sheen says, remembering the rehearsals for Nye where all the Welsh actors were discussing their opinions on “what had happened and why, and what should happen now”. His own production ofThe Passion, staged across his home town of Port Talbot with more than 1,000 local volunteers, would be the final production in National Theatre Wales’s 2011 opening season. The organisation had been struggling for some time, but its closure still left a huge absence in Welsh theatre. It was unclear whether anything would be able to rise from its ashes.I paid for whatever needed paying for, did whatever was needed to get the ball rollingMichael Sheen“No way was I going to get involved,” says Sheen, “but I got a sense of an emergency situation. It was such a tortuous journey to get a national theatre in Wales in the English language in the first place. It felt like a window of opportunity and once that window closed, it would be much harder to get that momentum going again.”There was no public money available; the Arts Council wouldn’t fund something untested. “I realised that ultimately I had to do it,” Sheen says, matter-of-factly. “I’m the one who can open doors, and I don’t need to be paid.” The actor is known for putting his money behind causes he cares about, including recently spending £100,000to pay off £1m of debtfor people in south Wales. Fronting his own money for National Theatre Wales, he “paid for whatever needed paying for, did whatever was needed to get the ball rolling”.The company got a little transitional funding that had previously gone to National Theatre Wales, set up as a completely new company – “the previous organisation brought a lot of baggage with it,” Sheen says – and secured funding for the opening season from the Colwinston Charitable Trust. They also made partnerships with BBC Studios and Bad Wolf, the production company behind Doctor Who. Sheen doesn’t want them to be vulnerable by relying too heavily on one funding source. “We’re looking for funding from all sorts of places,” he says, “and I’m still underwriting stuff. That’s the way we’ll keep moving forwards.”View image in fullscreenSheen and Goodridge with the Our Town ensemble.Photograph: Helen MurrayDoing what he can to make this company possible seems to be a basic instinct to Sheen. He has a clarity of vision that appears to whittle down to the idea that if he thinks something should be done, and he has the ability to do it, he will throw himself into it entirely. This translates into his wider understanding of community, which forms the centrifugal force behind much of what he does with his money and time. “As I’ve got older,” Sheen says, “it’s become clearer to me that at some point in your life, you’re going to need help, and at that point, one has to hope that help will be there. That is what community is. We all need help at some point, so we should all think about giving it at some point as well.”This opening show has also been made possible through its co-production with the Rose theatre in Kingston, south-west London, where Our Town will finish after touring Wales. Sheen partly modelled this on the success of Nye, co-produced by the National Theatre and Wales Millennium Centre. That play demonstrated “the real appetite”, Sheen says, for a big story on a big stage, with its size only manageable through the collaboration of multiple theatres. “Co-producing is essential at the moment,” says the Rose’s artistic director Christopher Haydon. “The finances of the industry generally mean it’s incredibly hard for any theatre to produce on their own.” Co-production also enables greater ambition, Haydon points out. “It’s one of the largest shows the Rose has put on in a long time,” he says.“Scale is important,” Goodridge agrees. “We have big stories to tell.”‘It’s an outrage’: stars join fight against cuts as Welsh arts go into meltdownRead moreBefore it gets to London, passing Llandudno and Mold on its way, Our Town will open at the Grand theatre in Swansea. “When you read a play, you read it in your own accent,” says Goodridge. “So you see your own community. In my head, this has always been a Swansea town.” The Grand, close to where Goodridge grew up, and Sheen’s closest theatre now, runs without an artistic director; instead the councilbooks touring shows. Starting the production and the new company there matters, says Davies: “Now you can be 15 years old living in Swansea and seeing things happening on your doorstep. See the rehearsals are just down the road on the seafront. See local actors are in it. Friends of your mums and dads are in it.”This is part of the hope of Welsh National Theatre: to build talent and belief and possibility. “That’s how you create a community,” Davies says. “That’s how you create ambition for generations to come.”Our Town is a Rose theatre andWelsh National Theatreco-production. The show is at Swansea Grand theatre to 31 January and transfers to the Rose theatre in Kingston, London, 26 February to 28 March, after runs at Venue Cymru, Llandudno, 3 to 7 February and Theatr Clwyd, Mold, 11 to 21 February.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreMichael SheenWalesRussell T DaviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The country legend has spent 50 years roaming between folk, bluegrass, rock’n’roll and Americana, curating her own songbook of deeply humanitarian music. On this first stop of her European farewell tour, she says goodbye to Scottish fans as part of the Celtic Connections festival, offering up a suitably career-spanning set-list accompanied by memories of Gram Parsons, Nanci Griffith, Bill Monroe, Townes Van Zandt and Willie Nelson, to name just a few.But the show hardly feels like an ending. “I turn 79 in April, so there!” she crows, after the rowdy honky-tonk of Two More Bottles of Wine makes the East End sports hall feel like a dive bar. Her voice is still spine tingling, now with a lived-in dustiness that only enriches her storytelling: Red Dirt Girl, her great blues tragedy, devastates now more than ever. It is majestic to watch her conduct three-part harmonies for an earthy, spiritual a cappella of Bright Morning Stars, and her delight in her band is infectious: “It’s alright to cheer the boys!” she urges, after a show-stopping mandolin solo from Eamon McLoughlin. She even throws in a brand-new cover of Johnny Cash’s Help Him, Jesus (“I’ve always longed to do it”), digging into her lower end with real swagger.She plays for almost two hours, pausing only to take a sip of tea, and a roaring performance of Parsons’s Luxury Liner ends with both her fists in the air: “What fun!” After an emotional standing ovation, she can barely rip herself away, and instead offers up Boulder to Birmingham, her majestic ballad about reckoning with Parsons’s death. And just as there’s scarcely a dry eye in the house, she chases it with Chuck Berry’s You Never Can Tell – “just for fun”, she winks. One couple in the crowd leap out of their seats to twist and rock’n’roll down the aisles, and dozens follow suit, twirling arm-in-arm. If this is Emmylou’s legacy – a night chronicling the low lows and rapturous highs of life – it makes it just a little easier to say goodbye.Explore more on these topicsCountryEmmylou HarrisPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

He was a nobleman in Renaissance Italy who murdered his wife and her lover, before shutting himself away in a palace with a second wife and two concubines, amid an atmosphere of flagellation and suspected witchcraft. He was also the composer of vocal music so harmonically experimental that it still sounds as if it could almost be beamed in from another planet. Death of Gesualdo,created by the director Bill Barclayand vocal groupthe Gesualdo Six, tells the story to the composer’s own music, compelling us to look at it and keep on looking.Like their 2023 creationSecret Byrd, it was co-commissioned by St Martin-in-the-Fields, and the dimly lit church setting lent an extra frisson to its premiere here. It starts in 1611, with the composer on his deathbed, then unfolds in flashback. Gesualdo is first seen as a child, represented by a puppet; then the actor Markus Weinfurter takes over. As a young man he’s given a piece of wood that might be a cross, a sword – or a lute, we realise, thanks to a bit of air-guitar-style miming as Gesualdo falls in love with music, a slightly silly episode that is perhaps the staging’s only false note.View image in fullscreenEyes blackened as if gouged out … the Gesualdo Six.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianFive other actors, silent like Weinfurter, play the other characters in Gesualdo’s life – his wives, a jester, a sinister cardinal. Choreographed by Will Tuckett, they move around the singers with stylised gestures that land in tableaux vivants; the music, woven from Gesualdo’s madrigals and his Tenebrae responses, unfurls around them. Costumed by Arthur Oliver, they might have danced out of the Italian Renaissance rooms in the National Gallery across the square. The lighting, coming largely from handheld LEDs carried by the performers, bathes them in an oil-painting glow, and their poses can be tender or extreme – when Gesualdo was caught mid-scream I found myself staring at the roof of Weinfurter’s mouth for what seemed whole minutes. Weinfurter is especially compelling, eliciting some kind of sympathy for his complex character; or perhaps that comes from the final image as the little-boy puppet returns, innocent and uncomprehending.Diary of a degenerate: mapping the music and the madness of Carlo GesualdoRead moreAnd all the while, there is the music. Singing with precision, pure tone and nuanced expression, their eyes blackened as if gouged out, the Gesualdo Six are outstanding – and even more impressive on this occasion given that one of their number was an understudy. Led by the bass Owain Park, the singing weaves a spell that is broken only once, when Gesualdo emerges, ghost-like, from the dark church aisle and a split-second of shouts and screams heralds the moment of the murders. This show is a creepy juxtaposition of beauty and horror, like the music of Gesualdo itself.At the National Centre for Early Music, York, tonight and tomorrowExplore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

That’s partly the point of this stab in that direction by Mark Carey, which asks why Hill has been so thoroughly expunged from our comedy pantheon. The reasons are widely known, of course, and rehearsed again here: the former best-loved man on television traded in a humour many modern viewers find sexist, racist and sad. One might hope for greater insight from a 100-minute play on the subject but, for all the pleasures along the way, it doesn’t have a great deal to add.Carey’s play with songs flashes back through Hill’s life from his last days as a “mad recluse” talking to a visiting solicitor about his will. With all other roles played with spirit by Georgie Taylor, we meet Hill’s dad “the Captain”, who sold “rubber johnnies” for a living, and find Benny writing letters to his auntie from the cafes he frequented in France. Between scenes, a babble of online voices debates his vexed legacy. Taylor takes on an occasional narrator role as a Ben Elton-alike 80s comic, whose generation here stands accused of cruelly – and hypocritically – casting Hill beyond the entertainment pale.But in its closing moments, the play seems to concur with the idea that Hill’s comedy, of old men perving on buxom beauties, had had its day. There are gestures towards a vindication of his oeuvre, notably in one sketch teasing us with a racist east Asian caricature, and listing all the other now-heralded acts who performed this type of material too. But when they might mount a more substantial case for the comic’s defence, neither Hill nor the play get far beyond “a joke’s either funny or it’s not” and allegations of PC gone mad.The play doesn’t dig deep into the personal life of this “saucy boy who never grew up”. What we do get is a vivid reminder of what millions once found hilarious, courtesy of a performance by Carey himself in which Hill remains elusive behind the winking, the smirking and the compulsive quips.At White Bear theatre, London, until 24 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet it worked a treat and taught me the value of making your own funViv GroskopSun 18 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTShareThe Blue Ball, SomersetI was an employee and a customer at this pub as a teenager in the early 1990s. This was one of four or five pubs clustered around the high street in the town where I grew up in Somerset. We gravitated towards the Blue Ball as teenagers, not because they served underage drinkers. They didn’t. And we could only afford to drink lime and soda anyway. No, we loved this place because it had (drumroll) two bars. So we were not only cool enough to go down the pub (never “to the pub”, strictly “down the pub” or, better still, “down the Blue”), but we even had our own bar.Turn to the right and you walked into the bar for saddos and old people (anyone over 20). On the left was our bar: brighter, airier. Although “airier” was relative at this time in history. This was more than 10 years before the indoor smoking ban. So both bars featured a cheerful, unremarkable fug of Superkings (right) and Silk Cut (left).The two separate areas were rarely breached by the opposing sets of clientele. Although if you had a “serious” conversation to navigate (relationship break-up, friendship drama, episodes of parental opprobrium), it was understood that the proper place for a tête-à-tête was in the “elderly” area. These were conversations which would merit perhaps an entire pint of lime and soda.View image in fullscreenThe Blue Ball in Bruton, Somerset.Photograph: Mr Standfast/AlamyAt first I worked halfway between the two bars in the back kitchen as a washer-upper, elbow deep in scalding water, earning money for driving lessons. There was an understanding that if I excelled in this work and proved myself to be trustworthy I might be allowed to try out at bar work once I turned 18 in early summer. (This was 1991.) Thus it came to pass that I began my rehearsals at saying: “Ice and a slice with that?” around the time of the pub’s biggest gamble:Christmasin July.Initially I was sceptical about this pet project of the landlord’s. It was clearly a brazen cash-grab designed to counterbalance the economic effects of customers in the bar to the left who only ordered drinks that cost 15p. Outside it was 20C and one of the driest summers on record. Inside, in the bar to the left, the Christmas decorations had come out of storage, crumpled gold streamers fluttering over the Big D peanuts. A box of party poppers sat next to the bottles of Taboo and Mirage. At the start of the first shift, the barman and I silently pulled our crackers and grimly donned paper hats as the opening beats of Live Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas? intoned over the sound system.And yet it worked a treat. That year had been a fallow year at nearby Glastonbury and there was a pent-up need for fun. The turn-to-the-left bar crowd was just sitting around bored waiting for their A-level results. Suddenly every night was Saturday night. Those legally able to do so immediately upgraded their lime and soda to snakebite and black. By the end of the month the paper hats were like gold dust. That summer taught me the value of life being what you make it. Build it and they will come. Joy is on tap – you just need to give people a reason.Explore more on these topicsPubsThe pub that changed meChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Archive photograph: courtesy of MikaBorn in Beirut in 1983, Michael Holbrook Penniman Jr, otherwise known asMika, was raised in Paris and London. He attended the Royal College of Music, before his breakthrough in 2007 with debut album Life in Cartoon Motion and its No 1 single, Grace Kelly. He went on to sell 20m records, and worked as a presenter and judge on TV shows such as Eurovision and The Piano. Mika now lives in Italy and in Hastings, East Sussex, with his partner. His first English-language album in six years, Hyperlove, is out on 23 January.This was taken in our kitchen inParis. It doesn’t surprise me that I am covered in chocolate. My earliest memories are of being on the floor surrounded by delicious food.I don’t remember who I was at that age, but I know I had a strong sense of when I wanted to go to sleep. I would often eat a lot, then when I’d had enough, tap the person next to me, and stroll off to bed. After finishing that entire bowl of chocolate mousse, it’s likely I would have taken myself off for a rest. Dad used to call me the 90-year-old baby.When I was one, we were evacuated from Beirut because of the civil war. My mum’s father was Syrian and her mother was Lebanese, and she wanted to give her children a better multicultural balance than she’d had growing up in America. Which is why we ended up in Paris, with our sprawling transplanted community. Our apartment was filled with Lebanese aunties with big puffed-up hair, smelling of cigarettes and hairspray. There was always music: a mixture of Nirvana in my sister’s bedroom and the Lebanese singer Fairuz in the living room with the grownups.Most evenings would be taken up with a debrief – all our Lebanese friends and family would gather together and talk about the war. There would be politics, laughter, screaming, and so many tears. But no matter how bad the argument was, there was always music and food.The Gulf war had no effect on our daily lives until my dad got caught up in it – he was there for work and ended up being taken hostage for eight months in the US embassy in Kuwait. Our life turned upside down. Mum kept us going, making sure we were at school and always had food on the table. When Dad came back, it had clearly had an impact on him, whether he would admit it or not. He had a breakdown, lost his job, and we lost everything. That’s why we moved to London. There’s destabilisation that happens when you are moved around a lot as a child. But whether it’s the clothes you wear or the music you make, there’s a cultural fearlessness that comes with being transplanted.Making my new album, I asked myself, ‘What if Hunter S Thompson was to vomit a pop album?’I was about eight when I was thrown out of my school in London; I was dyslexic and didn’t get along with one of the teachers. I had shut down from the world around me – I didn’t go to school for a year. Mum decided to instil in me another type of value system: “Forget school; things go up, things go down. Make something. You’ll be fine.” In my case, I had to figure out how to express myself with music. Songs became my refuge.For five hours every day, I had lessons with music teachers and my mum. She was really tough on me, right from the beginning. It’s not as if she was a “show mom”, but she trained me in the same way you would train a sportsperson.In my teens, music became even more of an obsession. I would get £5 tickets to the Royal Festival Hall, or the Barbican. I immersed myself in nightlife. I was fascinated by the darkly beautiful and found as much depth in some rave in a vault as I did in the sensual poetry of a Berg opera. I wouldn’t have found any of that in the classroom. I was consumed by the idea that it was my job to write songs. I wasn’t going out getting wasted. Instead, I would sit until 1am at Bar Italia off Old Compton Street, talking to people, sharing stories.Caspar Llewellyn Smith tails singer Mika, from Los Angeles to London and beyondRead moreI wrote Grace Kelly in a momentof anger. I had been brutally rejected by a management company after a few months of writing a collection of songs for them. I wasn’t annoyed with any individuals, but with my situation in general. I thought: “There must be a way of turning this frustration into something that empowers me as opposed to just moaning.” I knew I couldn’t do rage like Nirvana; I just wasn’t born like that, even though I wished I had been. I had to find my own thing, so I sat at the piano. The song was written in a stream of consciousness and I turned my anger into a dangerous sort of joy. I was taking control of how I felt.The success of that song felt like a strange distraction. Not just from making music, but from the life I had lived until that moment. I was always a dreamer, writing songs about imaginary loves, fantasising. Fame took me away from that. Suddenly, I had all these people telling me I had to go out and sell the record so I would get paid. There was a level of noise, and it distorted how I felt about myself, because I was bombarded by other people’s opinions.The press was part of that noise. Attitudes were very different in the 00s, and now you wouldn’t be able to get away with the things journalists said about my sexuality back then. Accusing me of being “brazen” was cowardly. I thought: “Don’t hide behind intellectually coded euphemisms because you think that you’ll get away with it.” At the same time, if my album had been a commercial flop, it wouldn’t have provoked that reaction, so would I rewrite that part of my life? No.Joe Wicks looks back: ‘When I look at that picture, I think about the care and love a kid needs’Read moreIn the decades after, I did some TV presenting and I made a French-language pop album, which I thought was an amazing idea, but my label said, “Really? After doing so much TV work in the UK? Could you be more daft?” But I didn’t want to repeat myself.I am now in an unbelievable timeof creative fun and mess-making – there are no plans to get softer or smoother with age. While making my new album, I asked myself the question, “What if Hunter S Thompson was to vomit a pop album?” Not that I would want to get messed up like him, but I loved his rebellion, and I wanted something that had a sense of burning and yearning. I have also recently worked on a symphonic film soundtrack that involved 260 musicians. Being back in a community was so enriching after being a solo artist for so long.Mum worked with me right up until a few months before she died, in 2020. It remained a very brutally honest relationship, not a sycophantic or gentle one. But she gave me so much. Grief, in all of its beauty and violence, has different chapters, and the secret is to allow it to change forms. What’s also helped is to associate all of that emotion with energy. All of the love and pain are just ingredients. When I think of putting my arms in that bowl of mousse, of smothering chocolate over my face, of understanding what freedom feels like without consequences – that is an energy she gave me. Something I want to relive in everything I do.Explore more on these topicsMikaFlashbackFamilyPhotographyPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Since I first tested sunrise alarm clocks last winter, I’ve come to suspect that there’s no such thing as getting up on the wrong side of bed. What we ought to be worried about is waking up on the wrong side of dawn.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.During summer (and other times of the year, for late risers), the sunrise begins to rouse us before we wake up. The brain kicks into gear and sends signals to initiate all sorts of bodily processes, from metabolism to hormone release, which helps us to feel ready for the day. It’s a fundament of our circadian rhythm – and we miss out on it whenever we wake before it gets light.That is where asunrise alarm clockcan fill the gap. These devices simulate dawn, glowing with increasing brightness in the run-up to your alarm, and for many this reduces grogginess and improves alertness upon waking. I’ve tested more than a dozen models – and I believe the Lumie Bodyclock Glow 150 is the best you can get.View at HealfView at BootsHow I testedI test sunrise alarm clocks by using them to wake me up before dawn over at least a few nights – which is no hardship at this time of year. I’ve risen with the Bodyclock Glow 150 every day for two weeks, which has given me a fuller impression of its performance. As well as using it as a wake-up light, I’ve tested its sunset simulation mode and used it as a reading light before bedtime.What you need to knowView image in fullscreenThe Bodyclock Glow 150 is certified as a Class I medical device.Photograph: Pete Wise/The GuardianView at HealfView at BootsLumie has seven sunrise alarm clock models, from the basic (but very good)Sunrise Alarm (RRP £49.98, now £38.48)to the elaborateBodyclock Deluxe 750DAB (RRP £229, now £176.33), which moonlights as a digital radio.With a £119 RRP (currently£106.49 at Healf), the Bodyclock Glow 150 is around the middle of the range – but in my view, it has all the features that matter. To help you wake up or drift off, there are programmable sunrise and sunset simulations, which progress through a naturalistic colour spectrum from reddish-orange to brilliant white (and vice versa).You can adjust various parameters of these cycles, including their duration, maximum brightness, and – for sunrise mode – the alarm tone that will make sure you’re awake. There are 10 sounds, including birdsong, lapping waves and a shrill beep.The device is controlled via buttons surrounding the digital display, which can automatically dim itself when darkness falls. It works as a reading light/night light, has a tap-to-snooze function, and features a cable management space on its underside.Lumie is uniquely placed among sunrise alarm clock brands, having invented this category of product in 1992 as an offshoot of its existing Sad lamp range. Its original wake-up light, the Natural Alarm Clock,looked like an Edwardian space weapon, but later models successfully wed Lumie’s rigorous approach to dawn simulation with a more bedside-friendly design.Like most (but not all) Lumie wake-up lights, the Bodyclock Glow 150 is certified as a medical device.SpecificationsMedical certification: UK MDR 2002 and EU MDR 2017/745Light source: LEDSunrise duration: 20, 30 or 45 minutesSunset duration: 20, 30 or 45 minutesDimensions: 19 x 12 x 16cm (WDH)Weight: 0.57kgAlarm sounds: 10Extra features: tap to snooze; auto-dimming digital display; cable management in baseWarranty: three yearsWhat we loveView image in fullscreen‘The sunset simulation created a relaxing ambience as I wound down for sleep.’Photograph: Pete Wise/The GuardianWhere better to start than the sunrise? The Bodyclock Glow 150 has exceptional sunrise simulation – superior to other brands and equal to other great Lumie models such as theBodyclock Spark 100. Waking up before dawn, I experience a sensation that’s genuinely close to being bathed in sunlight because the device glows brighter (and lighter in hue) as your alarm time approaches. It has consistently helped me to wake up feeling more alert, in a better mood and less groggy.This model surpasses the Spark 100 in its selection of wake-up sounds, several of which are lilting. For very reluctant risers and deep sleepers, there’s also a harsher-sounding alarm tone that’s sure to get your cortisol pumping. You can adjust the sunrise (or sunset) duration, too, with 20-, 30- and 45-minute periods to choose from. I found myself using a 30-minute sunrise most days, but switching to 20 minutes when I had limited time available for sleep.The sunset simulation created a relaxing ambience as I wound down for sleep, with the light steadily growing dimmer and graduating from white to reddish-orange as the minutes marched on. However, I tend to read in bed until I conk out, so I preferred using a steady, low-light setting for as long as I needed it instead.Controlling the Glow 150 is straightforward and intuitive, with every option configurable via five buttons on the front of the device (plus an extra one tucked away in the base that toggles the digital display’s automatic night-time shut-off).As with most sunrise alarm clocks, the Glow 150 spends most of the day just sitting at the bedside, telling the time and acting as a lamp. It does a nice job of it, too, with a highly legible digital display and a finely adjustable bedside lamp mode that offers the ideal mellow lighting for bedtime reading.Another plus: it’s lightweight and compact. I went on a short holiday while testing it and had no problem fitting it inside mysuitcase, carrying it and setting it up in my hotel room. This is the sort of thing you may actually find yourself doing if you become habituated to using a wake-up light.What we don’t loveThis is a nicely designed alarm clock, but I’ve tested models with greater bedside appeal (including some cheaper ones). Available only in black, this blobject will suit some bedrooms better than others. If other colours were offered, the Glow 150 would be able to blend more easily into a wider range of interiors.There’s also slightly less adjustability with this model than with some competing sunrise alarm clocks, especially in terms of the sunrise length, where the choice of three durations may feel limiting to some.My only full-blown reservation is with the steep price (from £106.49 at the time of writing), but think of it as a real investment in your quality of sleep.Lumie Bodyclock Glow 150: should I buy it?Sunrise alarm clocks don’t suit everyone, but for many people – myself included – dawn simulation makes a significant difference to the experience of waking up before sunrise. The Bodyclock Glow 150 is the best model I’ve tested, and although it’s expensive, it could prove precious to many who feel groggy in the mornings. Lumie offers a 45-day trial on its wake-up lights, but bear in mind that you’ll need to have all the original packaging (and pay for postage) if you wish to return it within that period.View at HealfView at BootsFor more, read themost-hyped sleep aids, testedExplore more on these topicsSleepThe FilterInteriorsHomesGadgetsHealth & wellbeingreviewsShareReuse this content"

CanEmma Joyceavoid them for a whole week?Get our weekend culture and lifestyle emailByEmma JoyceSun 18 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 19.16 ESTShareI’ve been eating ultra-processed foods (UPFs) all my life. Breakfast as a child was often Coco Pops, Rice Bubbles or white toast slathered in spreadable butter. Dinners usually involved processed sauces, such as Chicken Tonight or Dolmio, and my lunchboxes always contained flavoured chippies or plasticky cheese.I don’t blame my parents for this. Now I’m a parent too, I have cartons of juice and flavoured yoghurt as part of my parenting arsenal. Packaged foods are omnipresent in our lives. But, unfortunately, some of these foods are very bad for our health.In 2025,a global report linked UPFs to multiple adverse health outcomes, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and depression. Alongside the US and the UK, Australia is one of thehighest consumersof UPFs. A fact that feels unsurprising but still alarming.It spurred me to accept a challenge to ditch UPFs for a week.View image in fullscreenWhen seeking to avoid ultra-processed food, steer clear of products with a long list of ingredients, advise experts.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian‘It’s possible’Before I begin I know it won’t be easy. My pantry is stocked with UPFs, from allegedly healthy crackers to chocolate and biscuits. I’m not even confident I can go a day without them, let alone a working week – especially as the rest of my household won’t be joining me.Feeling ambitious, I call Prof Mark Lawrence from Deakin University to help me understand the difference between processed food andultra-processed food. A rough rule of thumb, he says, is to avoid products with a long list of ingredients. Steer clear of the middle supermarket aisles, and don’t buy products made with “chemical-sounding” ingredients. “Those are a big clue that it’s ultra-processed,” he says.Ultra-processed foods: the 19 things everyone needs to knowRead moreLawrence adds: “This isn’t poor behaviour on behalf of most people. These products are now so engineered into our food systems … It’s really difficult to avoid them.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningDoes he think I can do it? It helps if you have some spare time and are food literate but, he says: “It’s possible.”Seeking reassurance, I ask Dr Phillip Baker at the School of Public Health at the University of Sydney for more tips. He says to avoid ingredients that I’d never cook with at home. Sir, I say silently, this is how I am in this predicament.‘I’ve snacked on every fruit I can find’Before I get started, I familiarise myself withthe Nova classification system, which lists food by its level of processing. Level one includes fruit, vegetables, nuts, milk, coffee, tea, pasta and rice. Level two is “processed culinary ingredients” including butter, honey and oils. Three is processed foods, such as canned fish, freshly made bread and cheeses. Four is UPF territory – processed bread, ice-cream, chocolates, energy drinks, chicken nuggets, pastries and sweetened juices. So basically everything I have in my fridge and freezer.View image in fullscreenUltra-processed foods have long been Joyce’s bread and butter, but now she is determined to be more discerning.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianTo give myself a good chance of avoiding UPFs, I stock up on rye bread from a bakery. It costs more than twice as much as a loaf of processed supermarket bread. I also buy butter made from 100% milk, as my usual spreadable one contains emulsifiers, added colours and flavourings. The butter, like the bread, is $10. This exercise is starting to feel expensive – and it’s not even day one.My first day starts well. I have avocado on toast instead of Vegemite. I’m working from home, so I snack on raw nuts instead of dark chocolate. I’m feeling perky and proud of myself.At lunch, I eat mushrooms on toast with grated cheese. As the week progresses I realise one of the downsides of eating like this is it takes so much longer to prepare food – and there’s more washing up. I wouldn’t have this problem, I think, if I just unwrapped a sandwich from the cafe.By dinnertime, I’ve snacked on every fruit I can find in the house. I’m still hungry but determined not to fail. I pick up my child from daycare. We play, snack on (more) fruit, and I start preparing spaghetti bolognese, which passes the no-UPF test.Avoiding UPFs has become my whole personality, and I miss the spontaneity of going out for mealsEmma JoyceFor a side, my partner pops a plastic-wrapped, undeniably ultra-processed garlic bread in the oven for himself. The buttery garlic scent is so, so tempting, but I resist. Success.‘The mental effort is starting to add up’Day two is an office day and I soon come up against my first real UPF hurdle. When I order a takeaway coffee, I have to pause: is oat milk OK? The barista knows my usual order, so when I ask to look at the ingredients on their alternative milk cartons, we get chatting.“Almond milk is the worst,” he says. Most alternative milks are classified as UPFs, but this one has maltodextrin, vegetable gums and sunflower lecithin. All big no-nos. Disappointed, I order a batch brew instead. It’s fruity and smooth, but it doesn’t have that creaminess I wanted from the oat. Dairy milk would have been fine too, but I forgot this was an option.Back at my desk, I battle my urge to get a chocolate biscuit from the kitchen and make do with a banana.View image in fullscreenJoyce takes a closer look at  the items in her parenting arsenal.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianOne of the things Lawrence said earlier starts to resonate: “It’s not only the direct effect of these products [that is an issue], it’s the secondary effect of displacing nutritious foods.” A banana is more nutritious than a Mint Slice. I don’t need an expert to tell me that, but what Lawrence was saying does help me reframe my food cravings.In an ordinary week, lunch would be takeaway, but not knowing what’s gone into them means it’s off the cards. I go to the supermarket to stock up on produce instead – strawberries, blueberries, cheese, cucumber, carrot, an additive-free granola and rice crackers. I spend at least 10 minutes reading the packets of rice crackers.It comes to around $50 – a lot for lunch – but as I can use some of it for breakfast and lunch tomorrow, I figure it’s cheaper than buying takeaway. My homemade healthy lunches and treats make me feel unbelievably smug. The mental effort, though, is starting to add up.Later in the week I find myself in a fluster over rice bran oil listed in a frozen curry. Does this count? I can’t quite remember. I’m on the verge of tears. I’m so ready to quit. Suddenly my child needs me, my partner’s asking me a question and I don’t have time to figure out the answer. I put the curry back in the freezer.On Wednesday morning, I’m in better spirits. Breakfast is granola with blueberries and cow’s milk, which tastes sweeter than I remember. A colleague shares dates and nuts with me for a mid-morning snack and lunch is a delicious, filling, home-prepared salad. Things are looking up!For dinner, I eat the butter chicken curry I was concerned about yesterday. Theoretically, I could have made this myself, which means it’s not a UPF. But it has many ingredients. I’ve downloaded apps (Yuka and OpenFoodFacts) which help me assess packaged foods – but even they allow things I’ve previously ruled out. Which rules do I listen to?The jam hurdleBy the end of the week, my preplanned, no-UPF mornings feel almost routine. I pack snacks for the office, look forward to my black coffee, and I barely notice the open packet of Mint Slices.By Friday lunch, I’m faced with a dilemma: should I join colleagues at a cafe, something I’ve avoided all week? Almost everything on the menu feels risky, but I go anyway. I need social connection. Avoiding UPFs has become my whole personality and I miss the spontaneity of going out for meals.The sourdough crumpets pass the no-UPF test. Even the butter is OK. But the jam, which arrives in a tiny jar, contains pectin, a gelling agent. Absolutely a UPF.I’m hungry, I eat the jam.It’s like a smack of sugar, a hit of something my body has been craving all week. But I’m sad that I’ve failed.View image in fullscreenThe mental effort of trying to avoid UPFs is taking its toll on Joyce.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian‘I aim for balance’I recall something dietitian Evangeline Mantzioris, Associate Prof from Adelaide University, said to me earlier: “Pick one ultra-processed food that gives you the most joy and eat that one, then don’t eat the others that don’t give you as much joy.”Maybe the all-or-nothing approach wasn’t the right way to do this?After work, I’m invited for drinks. “Is alcohol UPF?” I frantically search on my phone.Turns out fermented beer, wine and cider is OK. I order a glass of wine, relaxing my shoulders for the first time. I realise the ultimate treat is simply taking a break from thinking about everything I consume. It’s actually easy being UPF-free when I’m cooking for myself, I think. I just need time, enough forethought and the budget. UPFs are everywhere, in places I didn’t anticipate, and avoiding them entirely is too difficult to do alone. Why is it this hard?Over the weekend I let go of the zero-sum approach and simply order what makes me feel good, trying to limit my UPF intake rather than overthink it. I keep my no UPF mornings, but I’m back to drinking oat milk in my coffee. I aim for balance, and to follow Mantzioris’s advice: “Enjoy it when you do have it.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkFoodDiets and dietingUltra-processed foodsAustralian lifestyleHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It may even convert you to the joys of tofu itself, should you still be on the fence about the stuff, because its creamy softness is the perfect foil for the intensely savoury, tingly seasoning involved here. It’s also ready in mere minutes.Prep10 minCook7 minServes22 garlic cloves1 small knob fresh root ginger4 spring onionsSalt250g plain tofu(I like a soft one, but see step 3)2 tsp cornflour, or potato or tapioca starch1 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns2 tbsp neutral oil40g pork mince, or beef mince, or a plant-based alternative1 heaped tbsp Sichuan chilli bean paste(also called spicydoubanjiangortoban djan, see step 8)½ tbsp fermented black beans, drained1 tsp chilli flakes, drained if in oil (drizzle this on top, if you prefer)85ml water1 A note on the accompanimentsIf serving this with rice, which is how it’s generally eaten (though you could have it with noodles instead), put that on to cook. It’s also nice with some steamed green vegetables or a cucumber salad on the side. Prepare any accompaniments, and all the ingredients before you begin, because this is a dish that comes together quickly.2 Prep the vegView image in fullscreenPeel and finely chop the garlic, and peel and finely grate the ginger – you’ll need roughly a tablespoon’s worth. Trim off and discard the whiskery ends from the spring onions, and any very dry bits off the tops, then divide them into white and green parts, slice both on the diagonal into roughly 2cm lengths and keep them separate.3 Prep the tofuBring a large pan of salted water to a boil. Cut the tofu into roughly 2½cm chunks – I like the creamy richness of soft or even silken tofu, while others prefer the slight chew of firmer varieties, but any kind should work here, as long as it’s unflavoured. Mix the cornflour (or potato/tapioca starch) and a tablespoon of cold water to make a paste.View image in fullscreen4 Blanch the tofuTurn down the heat under the boiling water, then gently slip in the tofu, keeping the pieces as intact as possible. Simmer gently for a minute, then turn off the heat. Meanwhile, toast half the peppercorns in a dry pan until aromatic, then grind to a powder and set aside.View image in fullscreen5 Flavour the oilPut a wok or a medium frying pan on a medium-high heat, then add the oil. Once it starts to smoke, add the remaining whole peppercorns and fry, stirring, until aromatic; take care not to let them burn. Scoop out and discard the peppercorns, leaving the infused oil in the pan. (You can flavour the oil in advance, if need be.)View image in fullscreen6 Add the minceAdd the meat and fry until brown and crisp – it’s used in such small amounts here that you’re unlikely to miss it if you choose to leave it out.View image in fullscreenAlternatively, soya mince, rehydrated if required, or other plant-based alternatives, or even finely chopped, sauteed mushrooms or aubergines will work well, too.7 Fry the aromaticsView image in fullscreenScoop the mince out of the pan with a slotted spoon, leaving as much oil behind as possible, and transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain. Turn down the heat slightly, then fry the garlic, ginger and spring onion whites for a minute or so, stirring constantly and taking care that they don’t catch and burn.8 Add the flavourings and thickenerView image in fullscreenStir in the bean paste (this is easily found in Chinese supermarkets or online; miso paste, preferably red, makes a decent if not perfect substitute, though if you use that, you’ll need to add a little more chilli), fermented black beans and chilli, fry for 20 seconds, then pour in 85ml cold water and bring to a simmer. Stir in the cornflour paste until well combined.9 Stir in the tofu and serveView image in fullscreenCarefully drain the blanched tofu so it doesn’t break up, then tip it into the wok along with the fried mince. Spoon the sauce over the tofu and meat, disturbing the tofu as little as possible so as to keep it intact, and cook until the sauce thickens. Gently decant into a serving bowl, sprinkle with the reserved ground pepper and spring onion greens, and serve with plain rice.Explore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassMain courseTofuChinese food and drinkPorkMeatRicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The chips areverynice, all crunchingly crisp and yieldingly fluffy in all the right places. All 12 of them were perfect, in fact, stood aloft in their silver serving vessel. “A-giddy-up and giddy-up and get awaaaay,” sings Francis Rossi as I perch on a velvet, pale mustard banquette that’s clearly so very expensive that I shudder every time my greasy paws so much as skim close to touching it.View image in fullscreenThe Core fried chicken at Corenucopia, London SW1 is served with a side of Oasis.Clare Smyth, of three Michelin-starredCorefame, is letting her hair down with this new project,Corenucopia, where she’s cooking a less pricey, more comfort food-focused menu. Expect seafood vol-au-vent, chicken kiev, Barnsley chop and trifle. There’s even a separate potato menu that comes to the table in its own frame, and offers pommes anna, dauphinoise, croquettes, fondant, hasselback and so on. If you order that dover sole, which, incidentally, comes battered and stuffed with lobster mousse, it turns up with its own vinegar menu, also gilt-framed. Balsamic? Barrel-aged sherry? Champagne? “Malt, please,” I said, aware that this was the request of a drab traditionalist.But, while Corenucopia’s decor is determinedly posh, its soundtrack pounds with British dad rock, ranging from the aforementioned Quo to Oasis to Clapton to the Stones. If that sounds a bit confused, well, fans of Core seem to be remarkably clear on the matter, because Smyth’s new joint is currently jam-packed with Michelin-chasing types dying to try her new, relaxed, groovy, “pocket-friendly” outpost. Still, while Core costs £265 per person before wine and service for the seven-course “Seasons” tasting menu, Corenucopia offers starters such as a crispy veal sweetbread for £32 followed by turbot with vin jaune sauce for £64, and desserts such as a profiterole (singular) with Tahitian vanilla cream filling at £22. Add a fig leaf or mezcal negroni, a splurge off the spud list, a glass or two of wine with the savoury courses, followed by a 2010 Château Suduiraut sauternes to go with your profiterole, and you might as well have gone to Core.View image in fullscreen‘A plump little treasure trove’: Corenucopia’s mushroom pie.Even so, the food at Corenucopia is a delight. This is cosseting, decadent, calories-be-damned cooking. Grilled olives on skewers with eel and timut pepper? Absolute bliss. An ornate smoked salmon paté topped with dill jelly and served with mini buttered crumpets? Wonderful. The same goes for the pithivier-style mushroom pie filled with ceps, portobello, parmesan, spinach and smoked egg yolk – a plump little treasure trove that I ate with some crisp brassicas enlivened with horseradish, parmesan and lemon. The hasselback potatoes cooked in beef fat were a joy, too, though at £8.50 plus service, to serve just three of them seemed more than a tad ungenerous. That battered dover sole with the lobster mousse, meanwhile, is more than mere gimmick, and comes with very good, earthy crushed minted peas alongside those triple-cooked chips.For pudding, we went for the sherry trifle made with Bristol cream and red berries that came topped with whipped cream, but it lacked the stodge and heft of a true sherry trifle, and was more a bowl of light, jammy cream. In fact, I regret not opting for the sticky toffee pudding made with rum and treacle and served with jersey cream, or for Smyth’s spin on tiramisu, an “Irish-misu” made with Jameson’s-fuelled Irish coffee.View image in fullscreenThe sherry trifle at Corenucopia is ‘more a bowl of light, jammy cream’.Obviously, Smyth is not the first highfalutin chef to open a relaxed restaurant. Gordon Ramsay perfected that move decades ago, making his name with the hyper-expensive and très exclusiveRestaurant Gordon Ramsay, where Smyth herself first came to attention, before broadening his reach with numerous less stuffy ventures. So much so that, by 2026, people with bumbags are now queueing for his Pub & Grill at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Corenucopia is many, many steps back from the likes of that, not least because it is still in a Michelin-adjacent Chelsea bistro with red-trousered guests and a chunky wine list. Even if Liam Gallagher is gargling through Supersonic as you’re eating fried chicken with caviar, you’re still not putting elbows on tables.Service-wise, meanwhile, there is a strong sense that any front-of-house person who begins by calling the diners “folks”, or squatting by the table to take their order, or tries to do so without a pen and paper, would be taken outside and shot. Does lobster bisque thermidor actually need the Riverboat Song by Ocean Colour Scene as its soundtrack? No. Do you have any allergies, madam? Yes, Britpop.Corenucopia by Clare Smyth18-22 Holbein Place, London SW1, 020-8016 5752. Open lunch Fri-Sat, noon-2.30pm, Sun 12.30-3.30pm. Dinner Weds-Sat, 6.30-9.30pm, Sun 6-9pm.

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told to Eve NortonSun 18 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTShareAlex, 76We’re always letting our hands wander under restaurant tables, or on the escalator in the TubeBeth and I met online 20 years ago, emailing back and forth for a good while before our first date – but once we met in person we only waited a few days to have sex. I brought dinner over to her place, but both of us were too distracted to eat.It really surprised me how eager somebody could be to go to bed with me – and how open-minded Beth was sexually. By that point in my 50s, I struggled to maintain an erection naturally but it never diminished her enthusiasm in bed, or mine. For me, orgasming is just one small part of sex; with the right person, just being naked together is pure joy.Growing up with a single mother in the 1950s, I did not learn much about sex at home and I lost my virginity at university to the girl I ended up marrying. My sex life with my first wife was pretty active for a long time, but then gradually she became more withdrawn and sex became less and less frequent, and eventually ceased.As a friend told me: ‘Alex, you kept a lesbian happy in bed for a quarter of a century!’By the point she came out as a lesbian, I’d sort of guessed that it was going to happen. Getting divorced was difficult but it didn’t hurt my confidence. As a friend told me: “Alex, you kept a lesbian happy in bed for a quarter of a century!”Sex with Beth felt radically different right from the start – more of a shared adventure. In the beginning we’d do it every day. Now, it’s maybe a couple of times a month, but it’s still incredible. We’re always letting our hands wander under restaurant tables, or on the escalator on the underground. Hardly anybody clocks it because nobody expects seventysomethings to be cheekily feeling each other up in public.As you grow older, you have to make certain adjustments; we have much less penetrative sex than other forms of touching. I now have chemical assistance to maintain erections, and we sometimes go shopping together for her preferred lubricant. You can imagine the stares the two of us get from other shoppers while strolling round a sex emporium. But, honestly, I’d brave far worse than a few funny looks to go to bed with Beth.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

NonsenseI’ve always been sexually curious; I came of age during the 1960s and remember marking the pages inThe Joy of Sexto share with my teenage boyfriend.When Alex and I first slept together, I realised he had less experience than me sexually, and we discussed his struggle to maintain an erection. If he had closed down about that, I might have wondered if it was because he found my body off-putting, but because we spoke about it, it never bothered me.I have friends who have got divorced because they found it so hard to speak to their partner about vaginal dryness, erectile dysfunction or other changes happening in their bodies. You’vegotto discuss it. Then the fun can begin.Sometimes I’ll wait for him outside the shower, and give him a quick blowjob before he’s off to workThis is how we do it: ‘After 50 years together, I’m more orgasmic than ever’Read moreAs liberated as my upbringing might have been, I’d always been taught that sex meant intercourse. What nonsense. I was married to someone else for decades before, and I know my way around the block when it comes to sex, and even though Alex and I have probably only had full intercourse perhaps 10 times in our two decades together, I’ve never been more fulfilled by a partner in bed.These days Alex and I generally masturbate together, interspersed with oral sex. Sometimes I’ll wait for him outside the shower, and give him a quick blowjob before he goes off to work – and remind him he’s probably the only person in his 9am meeting who just got one, so that he can savour the memory while he’s in the office.Sex is less frequent now than in our 50s and 60s, but when it does happen it’s mindblowing. I’m a real fan of cruise sex – I call it “shagging with a view”. Nobody has enjoyed a night at the Premier Inn Milton Keynes more than we have.

We’d been exploring Surabaya when we heard about an island off the coast called Madura that could be reached via ferry. It didn’t turn up in any of the tourist guides, which appealed to us, being adventurous types. We knew Madura wouldn’t be touristy, but expected there’d be some streets to explore and somewhere to sit down and have a cup of tea.As soon as Madura came into sight, we realised our visit may not have been a great idea. We were expecting to see houses and buildings dot the shore, as well as the hawkers who’d typically crowd around piers in Indonesia with food and wares to sell. There was none of that. It was just a pier next to a tiny village.After disembarking, we set off walking and within 100 metres ran out of houses, surrounded only by rice paddies and farmland. There was nothing to do and nowhere to go, and not even a tree to seek shade under.The kindness of strangers: a Los Angeles bus driver got everyone onboard to sing me happy birthdayRead moreFeeling a little defeated, we sat down at a bench by the side of the road, the sun beating down on us. Before long a young woman in a kebaya and sarong came past. Clearly noticing how out of place we looked, she asked in English if she could help us. We asked her when the next ferry back to Surabaya was coming and she answered that it wasn’t for several hours.She said it was far too hot for us to wait outside all that time – and invited us to her family home.She took us in, sat us down and then returned with a tray of gloriously refreshing cold drinks. We noticed she wasn’t partaking and when we asked why, she explained it was Ramadan and she’s not supposed to be eating or drinking until sunset. We felt uncomfortable drinking when she couldn’t, but she assured us it was OK.She then invited her two brothers, both of whom were studying engineering, to come and speak with us. For the following hours we all sat around the table having a lovely conversation about the world and the things they wanted to do in life. When we finished our first drinks, she brought out more, and kept entertaining us until it was time to bring us back to the pier for the return ferry.For the rest of my life, her wonderful hospitality has been my model of the Muslim faith. I am grateful to her for giving me that wonderful view of human nature, and more optimism about people in general. It was a great gift, one that has stuck with me throughout my life.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

I sort of believe in God, and find immensespirituality in nature, butthinkChrist was simply a good man, whereas my husband believesit.He respects my beliefs and has never imposed his on me.The problem I have is with thechurch we attend.I often feelafraudasI don’t share the beliefs of therest of the congregation.

I suggested we try the Quakers,a space where I could feel free to be myself,butmy husband was clearly not comfortable with the setup.We do enjoy shared interests, buthave quite different jobsand, despite our best efforts, ourfriendship groupssadlydon’t seem to mixwell. Church feels like just anotherdifference.We arein our50s andmet after difficult first marriages. I’d like to share my husband’s enthusiasm for church, butpart of me worries that I can’tcarryon like this for decades. I adore my husband – he is kind,funny and attractive, and there is no one with whom I’d rather spend my time. Just not in a Church of England pew.Then don’t. I appreciate you feel like a fraud, but lots of people go to church who don’t believe in all of it; you’re probably in more like-minded company than you realise. My interest is in why you feel youhaveto go?I went to UK Council for Psychotherapy-registered psychotherapist Jacquie Keelan, who said it’s “understandable your letter felt a bit despairing given the feelings you express about the church you go to: alienated, meaningless, fraud. It’s a world away from the spiritual home you’re searching for.” But Keelan urged you to realise you don’t have to “carry on like this for decades”. Plenty of couples don’t share religious beliefs and don’t go to each other’s places of worship. As Keelan said, “Making our own choices in life is an integral part of becoming autonomous adults. I wonder why it feels so weighty and even insurmountable now to reconcile your beliefs and your husband’s?”You said your husband was not comfortable at the Quakers. And? You’re uncomfortable in his church for him; can’t he sit in discomfort for you?Keelan and I felt there were pluses here. “You’ve negotiated eight years together after difficult marriages,” she said, “and found ways to reconcile differences while enjoying shared interests. It might be helpful to reflect on how you managed that, and apply that wisdom to your current concerns.”You said you tried the Quakers, but your husband was uncomfortable. And? You’re uncomfortable in his church for him; can’t he sit in discomfort for a morning for you? Does he know how you feel? I wondered if this was really not so much about church, but actually about you: your needs, your beliefs, your desire for somewhere you can “be yourself”.

Typically, people are drawn in by a social media ad, which is either a direct copy of a legitimate one from a reputable company, or created by AI.“They’ll look at where the popular holiday destinations are, and if there’s one that is up and coming they’ll tailor the scam,” he says.Nationwide said the average loss to people is about £3,500.What it looks likeThe hook is a credible-looking ad on social media for two weeks in the sun, or a winter break skiing. The reason it looks like the real thing is that it has probably been copied from a genuine travel site, however the price quoted will be significantly less than you might expect to pay.View image in fullscreenToo good to be true holidays deals are just that. Most often they will take your hard-earned cash and leave you high and dry.Photograph: peangdao/Getty Images/iStockphotoAfter clicking on the ad, you will be asked to fill in your details and then be contacted on a chat app, such as WhatsApp, later. Or you may be able to click through directly to the chat from the ad.Winters explains: “The offer will look like a bargain, an incredibly good value holiday. They might even give you some time pressure – as in ‘this is a one-time only deal’ or ‘you’ve got to sign up to it in the next 24 hours to qualify for this price’, and ‘we’ve only got x amount of tickets at this amount’.”The fraudsters will ask for payment through bank transfer, and then, typically, cease contact, although some will still answer inquiries to lend some sort of legitimacy to the fraud. But, ultimately, the holiday does not exist.What to doWhen booking a holiday, make sure that you start the process on a reputable website, and not via a chat app. A good tip is to check the URL of the site in your browser. Be aware of the tactics of criminals. Urgency, and the fear of missing out on a deal, are big ploys to make victims act quickly and without thinking through decisions.“Fraudsters know when peak periods are,” says Winters. “They know when people will be shopping for holidays. And, crucially, they know when they’ll be vulnerable to ‘too good to be true’ offers.”Being asked to pay via bank transfer is a significant red flag as you will not have the section 75 protections that come with using a credit card.If you think you have been defrauded, contact your bank immediately. After that, contact Action Fraud, the central hub for fraud and online crime.Explore more on these topicsMoneyScam watchScamsConsumer affairsConsumer rightsShareReuse this content"

Here, experts on hormonal and metabolic health explain how to stay wellSarah PhillipsSun 18 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 00.01 ESTShareGet to know your hormones“Most people would like to have more energy and be leaner,” says Prof David Ray, an endocrinologist at the University of Oxford who also provides NHS services. “There is a connection between how we choose to live, what our bodies look and feel like, and the hormones that are going around the body. What endocrinologists deal with is disorders of either a lack of hormones, or too much of a hormone.”Hormones impact almost all bodily functions, from skin, to the gut, to our moods. “During an average day, the hormones in our body will vary depending on what time it is and what we’re doing,” he says. “For example, have we recently had something to eat or are we hungry? Are we having a stressful day or a calm and quiet day?”Be mindful of your metabolic rate“Metabolic rate refers to metabolism, which describes how the body uses different components from the foods that we eat and turns those into all the various things that it needs to fuel the body, build proteins and other essential molecules,” says Dr David Cavan, a consultant endocrinologist specialising in diabetes and weight management at University Hospitals Dorset and the London Diabetes Centre, and author ofA Guide to Weight Loss Injections, published on 29 January. “If you have a very slow metabolic rate, then you will use up less energy and gain weight more than if you have a faster metabolic rate, in which case you’re burning the energy up more quickly.“Insulin regulates glucose metabolism and levels of sugar in the blood,” Cavan continues, “but if we have too much insulin in our body, it can lead to weight gain, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. Critically, because insulin is a fat storage hormone, high levels of insulin actually slow down the metabolic rate, and you get into a vicious cycle. The slower your metabolic rate, the less energy you use [and] the more you can store.”According to Cavan, it is no surprise that the huge increase in obesity, type 2 diabetes and related conditions in the last 30 years has happened at the time that our food environment has been transformed by ultra processed foods high in energy, sugar and refined carbohydrates – leading to elevated insulin levels. Matters are made worse by the reduced physical activity characteristic of modern lifestyles – which means that while we consume more energy, we use up less.Don’t rely on weight loss jabs aloneWeight loss injections influence the levels of hormones that affect metabolism in a number of ways, says Cavan: “They slow down the rate at which food is absorbed from the gut, and affect the brain and satiety. The net effect is that insulin levels will begin to come down and help people to lose the excess fat that they are storing.”At present, “they are very restricted on the NHS, so most people are buying them privately through online pharmacies”, says Cavan. “Some people seem to get quite a lot of support, others get none at all. I would encourage people, if they are buying them online, to make sure that they’ve got access to good quality information about how to increase the dose and manage side effects.”Up your proteinView image in fullscreenEggs are ‘a natural fast food.’Photograph: Posed by model; GMVozd/Getty Images“If you have metabolic syndrome – which is characterised by being overweight, and brings an increased risk of pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and sleep apnoea, the underlying problem is too much insulin,” says Cavan. “The trouble is, every time you eat carbohydrates, whether it is sugar or starch, it increases insulin. Moving away from carbohydrates is tackling the root cause and is so important. That is why I encourage my patients to base their meals on protein and vegetables first and foremost, rather than carbohydrates.” Cavan suggests a focus on natural or minimally processed proteins including meats, fish, cheese, pulses, tofu, plain Greek yoghurt and eggs. “So many people are still under the impression that eggs are unhealthy, even though it is more than 20 years since the advice changed,” he says. “Eggs are very nutritious, high in protein, contain almost zero carbohydrates and are very filling. It is a natural fast food.”Dr Anjali Amin, an endocrinologist at Imperial College healthcare NHS trust, has researched the effect of protein on appetite regulation and says that a high protein diet may be helpful in the control of our appetites: “It is not going to boost metabolism but, from an appetite and energy perspective, it is the macronutrient that makes people feel most full.”Get lifting“It is not just about what you put into your body – it is what you do with all that energy you are consuming,” says Amin, which is why exercise, especially resistance training, is advisable to improve muscle mass. This is helpful once women enter menopause, she explains. “Their levels of oestrogen decline which impacts bone health. Resistance training helps strengthen muscle and bone.”“Very simple strength training to maintain your muscle bulk is helpful,” agrees Cavan, “and that can be as simple as doing some squats or press ups.” This is “particularly important for people on weight loss injections, because we know that about40% of the weight lost is muscle”. Exercise isn’t the route to weight loss itself though, as Cavan explains: “I say to people, ‘If you want to lose weight, then exercise does not do it. Focus on what you eat,’” which many of his patients find surprising. There are some caveats: “I encourage people to walk as much as they can, because moving does burn off more energy than if you’re sitting down.” If people are very overweight, there is a real risk of injury through exercise, and it can also increase appetite, Cavan adds.Work in an inefficient office“Studies have shown that if we sit down for longer than an hour, our metabolism goes into a sort of ‘sleep mode’ to conserve energy, like a computer,” says Cavan. “I encourage people not to sit down for longer than an hour: get up, move around. If you work in an office, make it as inefficient as possible, so you’ve got to get up or walk to the other side. Literally any excuse to get on your feet can really help.”View image in fullscreenResistance training can help improve muscle mass.Photograph: Posed by model; skynesher/Getty ImagesSort out stressDealing with stress plays an important role in managing weight. “Cortisol is the body’s stress hormone and it has metabolic effects,” says Cavan, “not least on pushing up your glucose and insulin levels, so it worsens metabolic health. Any type of stress can increase cortisol levels, be it emotional or work-related, which adds to metabolic ill-health.” Stress can also lead to comfort eating, he says: “It drives hunger and we can crave sugar if we are stressed. Poor sleep adds into that, because when we sleep, cortisol levels naturally go right down, which is key to a healthy metabolism. But if your sleep is disturbed, or if you’re not sleeping, they stay up, promoting poor metabolic health.”Prioritise sleep“Circadian rhythm is fundamentally tied to the regulation of energy metabolism,” says Ray. “People often don’t realise how much sleep is necessary for adults: between seven and nine hours a night. If you consider yourself, or ask your friends if they are getting seven to nine hours sleep a night, you’ll find that at least 50% won’t be. This is an immediate, highly prevalent cause of poor health and can lead to an increased risk of disease. If you’re not sleeping well, and you’re very tired during the day, that affects the kind of food you choose to eat and how full you feel after eating, which can lead to weight gain that further disturbs sleep. The heavier you are, the worse you sleep, and there are hormonal consequences that flow from that.”“We all know the consequences of trying to live against our circadian clock,” Ray continues. “If you’ve ever had jetlag or worked a night shift, do you remember how horribly disruptive it is on how you’re thinking, your appetite, what you want to eat and when you want to eat? Aboutone in fivein the UK work some form of shift; as in, working outside core work hours – either early starts, late finishes or a night shift. And we know that increases, dramatically, the risks of obesity and diabetes. We can take healthy individuals and deprive them of a good night’s sleep for between one and three nights, and we see that their energy metabolism drastically shifts very much closer to the metabolism we see in people with type 2 diabetes.”Exercising early, in natural light, can have a positive impact on circadian rhythm. “Try to ensure that you get enough physical exercise, ideally in external light,” says Ray.View image in fullscreenUse hormone tech cautiously.Photograph: SimpleImages/Getty ImagesDine early“If your body is busy digesting food, it is going to be difficult for it to get into sleep mode, so eating late at night is not a good idea,” says Cavan. “There are also metabolic health benefits to time-restricted eating, by having a prolonged fast overnight. That is a very effective way of pushing your insulin levels down low,which helps burn off excess fat. You don’t need to go for days without eating. But try to have your evening meal as early in the evening as possible, no later than 7pm, and you can go into a fasting state before going to bed.”Watch out for signs of an imbalanceAmin says to look out for “unexplained changes” that could be the sign of a hormonal issue: “Persistent fatigue, weight changes without trying, heat or cold intolerance, irregular periods, difficulties getting pregnant or sexual dysfunction, hair loss or unusual hair growth.Diabetes, which may indicate there is a problem with the hormone insulin, can often present with thirst or excessive urination.”Treatment can initially focus on lifestyle. “Type 2 diabetes can respond well to diet and lifestyle interventions; ensuring a healthy, balanced diet and regular exercise, may have an impact on the hormone insulin,” says Amin. Other treatments include hormone replacement therapy but there are also medications that modify hormone action rather than replacing it – and very occasionally, there are surgical interventions for some hormonal conditions, too.Use hormone tech cautiouslyThere has been a rise in home testing tech related to hormones – but how useful is this? “It is great that it increases awareness of hormonal conditions,” says Amin, “but I think it has the potential to oversimplify a very complex system, and you can take things out of context. I use wearable technologies such asglucose monitors a lot with my patients who have diabetes, and they arehelpful to understand the changes in glucose thatpatients get on a daily basis. But in somebody who does not have diabetes, they actually haven’t been shown to have any scientific benefit. In fact,they could promote unnecessary health anxiety and you can end up restricting foods that might actually be quite good for you.”Explore more on these topicsHealthThe expertsHealth & wellbeingDiabetesSleepfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With the beach just a few steps away and infinite skies, there is a genuine sense of holidaying at the edge of the world. Sagres is steeped in history – it was the gateway to the unknown world during Portugal’s Age of Sail and has a spectacular windswept fortress, dramatic cliffside scenery and a chilled-out, surfy vibe. A member of Design Hotels, Memmo Baleeira has rooms in crisp shades of cream, shell and taupe. The restaurant serves fish and seafood straight off local boats and there’s a large lawned area around the pool that is ideal for kids.

ThePounda Paouis one, set on a hillside above the sea, with rooms linked by shady paths and leafy sitting areas, and a pool terrace with glorious sea views. A car is essential (the nearest village, Argalasti is a few minutes’ drive away); half the fun of a visit to Pelion is following the quiet country roads to hilltop villages with excellent tavernas, or small coves with barely anyone else there. The village of Chorto, around 15 minutes’ drive (or a two-mile hike), has a good selection of tavernas, although dinners at Pounda Paou – home-cooked, hearty dishes including slow-cooked meats, vegetable stews and handmade pastries – are not to be missed.From £399pp a week B&B,ionianislandholidays.comElounda, CreteView image in fullscreenThe Innside Elounda, which opens in MayElounda’s transition from sleepy fishing village to five-star haven has been one of the biggest changes on Crete, but in spite of numerous glitzy hotels, the area remains extraordinarily beautiful. The village is a patchwork of tavernas and stone houses clustered behind a harbour that opens on to the vivid blue lagoon that separates the mainland from Spinalonga island. The opening of the newInnsideEloundaon 1 May means this gorgeous slice of Cretan coastline will now be affordable (once again) for mere mortals.

Cooking classes, horse-riding and quad-biking are all on offer, along with visits to Essaouira’s picturesque medina, with its art galleries, cafes and stalls selling everything from Berber rugs to leather goods. Haggling is still expected, but it’s less of a competitive sport than elsewhere, while the town’s rooftop bars are ideal for sundowners.

Maybe the UKgovernment in its new consultations on road safetyshould add the question of hiding speed cameras to their list of concerns. I’m a driver, but also a pedestrian and cyclist and get fed up with seeing cars zooming down local roads at way more than 20 or 30mph. There are flashing lights that tell drivers what speed they’re doing, but there’s no penalty for going over at those points.Amy, CornwallSend new questions tonq@theguardian.com.Readers replyIt’s high time the government put its foot down.EddieChorepostNo. People slow down when they see one.EGriffI’ve an idea – why don’t the authorities dig lots of holes in the road to encourage drivers to slow down (the encouragement being avoidance of severe and expensive damage to tyres, wheels and suspension). We could call them “potholes”. Oh – hang on …DocLobster1960Speeding is antisocial behaviour, so why not make the people who do it pay into the coffers for the good of society?I don’t care whether cameras are hidden or not, people should just abide by the speed limits. It’s not as if speed limits are designed as a punishment.GoldgreenI got a speeding ticket in Wales on my first visit there after they introduced a 20mph limit, I opted to take the speed awareness course and found it to be invaluable. I suggest that all learner drivers take this course as you learn so much. I’ve been driving for 35 years and some of the things I learned have stuck with me today. It would be good if we were made aware before we started driving. I actually enjoyed the course.lozbagsOf course there should be no warnings about fixed speed cameras. Mind you, this gives local residents an advantage.Tony Firshman, by emailThe issue of whether speed cameras should be visible was decided by the Blair government (and the then transport minister John Spellar). Speeding motorists avoided them and continued speeding afterwards. This resulted in “crash migration”.Road safetyhas always been the Cinderella issue of policy and sadly, will continue to be, due to the moral bankruptcy of our politicians.Howard Bramwell, by emailNo, cameras are there to slow drivers at dangerous places. However, the camera technology must be so cheap now that every (30mph) sign could have a camera behind it. I really struggle to do 20, though, because I have a muscle memory for driving in villages at 25-30mph.James M Bartlett, by emailI don’t think there is clear evidence of what is more efficient in bringing accidents down, as the approach varies between countries. In Germany, speed cameras are usually hidden, behind bends or road signs. Mobile cameras are common. Sometimes, you have road signs warning of cameras (“Radar”), but they are usually quite a bit before the cameras.Mustbe6to20Speed cameras don’t need to be hidden. They need to be ubiquitous. The want to be in every cat’s-eye in the country and round every bush and corner. Just get them in, save the lives instead of regretting them and force people to slow down.Really start the war on the motorist, and while you’re at it, make pedestrian crossing lights change immediately when someone presses the button. That’ll be the real signal for the war to begin.Andrew Riley, by emailVisible. There’s a stretch of A road in north Norfolk which had two speed cameras. One has been removed – people still brake as they approach it. Visible still works best, even when it’s no longer visible.RosiesDadIt has always struck me that the use of average speed cameras (as opposed to so-called “safety cameras”) is much more effective at keeping vehicle speeds down to the speed limit. These use automatic numberplate recognition (ANPR) to check the time between cameras, so virtually all drivers stay at the speed limit but then speed up after passing the last camera (presumably to make up for the time they think they have lost while sticking to the speed limit). As ANPR spreads more widely (so we can catch the bad guys up to no good), it can’t be beyond the technology to use their data to better effect by catching speeders too.shropshirelassoNo need to hide them, they are meant to stand out, so if you are going too fast you can still slow down, but if you are going at a ridiculous speed that you don’t notice them, you then have no complaints. Like shooting fish in a barrel. Yes, there are some sneaky ones, but they are not necessary imho. Idiots end up getting caught out anyway.DamianleahI am all in favour of overt and covert ones. I am also all in favour of the police using roadside/bridge cameras to catch speeders. Further, I would welcome a tripling or more of the fines and points received, along with all drivers having to undertake a speed awareness course every five years in order to keep your licence – and don’t forget, holding a licence is a privilege and not a right.Iama driver who does far too many miles each year, and I have probably driven for more than 800,000 miles, and I have not been caught speeding. Oh, I’m not going to say I am some sort of saint, and I know I have exceeded the limit on many occasions, but if I had been caught, I would have deserved the penalty.SallycyclesSome people btl are claiming that hidden cameras wouldn’t work as a deterrent. But they would once you’ve been caught, fined and accumulated a few points. Insurance goes up and the risk of losing one’s licence should focus the mind pretty quickly. I’m sick of being tailgated when driving at the speed limit.DropinjimSigns that tell you the speed you are doing (or a smiling face if you are doing the speed limit) are far more effective and for a greater distance afterwards at slowing people down than speed cameras. Having said that, average speed cameras seem to be a good direction to go, obviously better on long singular roads than towns with lots of roads leaving and joining, although it could still work.duncandavisWouldn’t a visible deterrent be better than letting people speed or get into an accident and have to deal with the aftermath?PatriiickYes, especially in school zones. A 2025 study in New York City showed that speed cameras reduced injuries by 16%, and collisions by 30%. Even better, Toronto Metropolitan University found that speed cameras reduced “the number of speeding vehicles by 45% in urban school zones”.RP Orlando, by emailI have a, perhaps controversial, take on this. Hide the speed cameras, but don’t issue any fines to those who breach the limit. Just points on the licence. This would take away the argument from many that speed cameras are a cash cow and not a safety feature.Niels, by emailIf you want to generate revenue, hide the cameras. If you want people to slow down, make them highly visible. I know very few people who haven’t been caught by a speed trap. I was going to go back to where my so-called offence took place but decided to take the cheap way out, a £100 speed awareness course that taught me nothing. I do know it was a dual carriageway with a barrier to stop pedestrians crossing the road – and a speed limit that dropped from 40 to 30 with no discernible reason. They have these cameras in Italy. They are the size of a wheelie bin and are bright orange. Guess what – no one speeds past them. The police also have radar guns but where it is important that people don’t speed, pedestrian crossings etc, the cameras do a perfect job.iptravellerIn Surrey, where I learned to drive, cameras were hidden, painted grey. When I started driving farther afield, I was amazed that anyone in the counties which had already adopted yellow painted cameras was ever caught speeding. They were so visible compared to the ones we had in Surrey. Now there are the warnings on GPS and satnavs. No excuses.WordChazerOften local authorities only put cameras at high accident sites. Average speed checks are located to stop street cruising, with limited effect. Previously I was a transport planner and had geographic information system access to all the locations and police metadata on the Stats19 forms. It is sobering to overlay all the slight, serious and fatal accidents, for all years. There is no discernible pattern – distribution of data points is everywhere. Zero accidents should be the aim. Not difficult to black box all new cars and stop speeding.As a pedestrian, cyclist and driver I agree. I honestly believe drivers for their licence should walk down a dark country lane, cycle down an A road, deal with stupidly bright headlights. Driving is seen as a right but it’s not it’s a privilege.funkymentalistSpeed limit signs should be clearly visible, close enough together, and not faded, nor obscured by vegetation. They should not be contradictory, as they sometimes are when temporary signs are reached before permanent signs. When that has been achieved, speed cameras should be hidden.FromageBleuCould just make cars unable to exceed speed limit. Very easy to do. Or fit them all with black boxes.SeamusheaneyisbrownFrom July 2024 all new cars sold in the EU [and Northern Ireland] are required to have speed limiters.WantageNo. I don’t think speed cameras should be hidden. That does not deter people speeding, it just gives them a ticket. The whole point is to slow people down.Another aspect of road safety that bugs me a great deal is tailgating. This is a very serious offence in Florida. (I don’t know about the rest of the US.) It is up there with drink-driving, and in my opinion it should be because it is very dangerous, and causes some of the worst accidents on motorways.Hopefully with AI, they can invent a camera which picks out vehicles tailgating. And I wish the police would give that issue as much attention as speeding, at least on motorways.AndyPandy1968If [drivers] don’t know where speed cameras are (and there could be one anywhere) they’ll slow down. Currently they speed until they see a highly visible camera.TenaroGView image in fullscreen‘Simply putting up a sign does not make people slow down.’Photograph: David Pardoe/Getty ImagesIt is better to drive for the current road conditions, not the speed limit. Speed limit signs encourage drivers to drive at that speed and cannot react to it raining or being icy – or react to rare events, like someone turning right into a seldom used road (I would argue a no-right turn sign would be better than dropping the speed limit to 50 or 40mph).Most times when you moderately exceed the speed limit, nothing happens; it is unlikely to cause an accident, unless there is a speed trap which causes sudden braking. However, it remains true that the energy of a crash is proportional to the square of the speed. There is more than double the energy crashing at 30mph over 20mph (50% speed increase).There is no point driving at 30mph on a housing estate, a half a mile at 30mph takes 1 minute, at 20 takes 1.5 minutes. You just get to the next queue 30 seconds sooner. The average speed in London due to congestion is 7 to 20mph.On a dual carriageway, the capacity (vehicles per hour) can be increased by reducing the speed: peak capacity 20mph for cars and 30mph for buses and lorries.Rob333No. I see one, I slow down. I mean, ahem, I maintain that safe speed I was already doing, obviously! You could hide them and potentially make more revenue but that grapevine is waaaay bigger than anything Marvin sang about. Word spreads so quickly that people, at least locals, would know all about the secret cameras quicker than Shaw Taylor could say keep ’em peeled.catchytitleHow do speed cameras work?Read moreI was once cautioned for signalling to drivers that a speed camera was coming up.I thought, what’s your problem? Speed cameras are about improving road safety and I’m getting all the cars to slow down. They should have given me a medal and a gold clock, not a caution.CharismataEh? They are meant to make the roads safer. Which they don’t do if you don’t know they are there. Simply putting up a sign does not make people slow down, we know this from repeat experience. Practically, it would also be daft to hide them as you would need so many signs, eg to notify that cameras are present, then to notify that cameras are not. I’m very suspicious of the mentality that thinks they should be hidden to “catch people out”. It’s the same mentality that insists on prison for non-dangerous offences and, at its most extreme, capital punishment. Both things confer only brutality upon society and the resultant pressure on social and health services while probably not reducing crime. Believers of demonstrably ineffective punitive systems are a true menace, preferring we all suffer under such systems so they can get a sense of “vengeance”. This to me is more sociopathic than many of the criminals and certainly more so than most speeding drivers.WyrdsisterSpeed cameras are very expensive to install, maintain and operate, which is why they are only placed where deaths have occurred. If visible, then most drivers slow down at them proving that they work as intended, while drivers ignoring them correctly get fined. This is why you see many other physical methods for restricting speeds such as humps, tables, cushions and chicanes. Any road without cameras or physical controls will always see drivers that speed.swelyThousands of speeding fines could be cancelled after ‘technical issue’Read moreWith an electric car there is so little feedback that I always use the speed limiter. It doesn’t require many people doing this to bring everybody into line, literally! I’ve worked in the auto industry and had to look at overall safety issues. The statistics are as clear as they are for smoking when it comes to speeding – just don’t do it.ForlornehopeYes to secret cameras to reduce speeding but why stop there? Why not also introduce secret number plate recognition cameras to tackle the industrial-scale dumping of household goods all over our pavements?Britain’s cities, especially working-class communities, are being turned into public dumps where illegal fly-tipping by the middle-class and small businesses is out of control. If your vehicle is used for illegal public dumping, you should have your driving licence revoked for 12 months and then be forced to resit your driving test. Let’s take back control of our pavements!whitman100In reply to whitman100: Most people don’t want to live in the surveillance society you describe. We know it doesn’t stop crime. It simply changes it.WyrdsisterThey seem to catch enough people anyway in their bright yellow condition. Seems fairer with that much warning.unclestinkyClearly, having signs decreases the speed in any specific camera’s location. However, it also provides tacit permission to speed elsewhere.I think the obvious solution to this paradox is to require car manufacturers to begin turning off car safety features at 30mph. Start small – passenger airbags turn off at 31mph, driver ones at 50. By the time a car hits 71, an ejector seat should be ready to fire the driver into the ceiling. It would be interesting to learn how many drivers would be willing to risk their own health rather than that of others as they speed “perfectly safely”.Hugh B, by emailThe recent road safety review ignored the elephant in the room, ie speed. Road traffic deaths [in Great Britain] have averaged around 1,600+ for the last several years; if that figure applied to air or rail travel, fleets would be grounded and networks shut down until the matter was investigated. Because road traffic deaths happen in small numbers per incident, they are hardly noticed, often barely making local media, marked only by sad little shrines of flowers by the side of a stretch of road.So … my thoughts (not vote winners)1. Review all speed limits; 20mph where conditions are hazardous, 30 up to 40 on the outskirts of towns/villages (30 can go on too long)2. Greater use of 50mph limit; it’s a big jump 40 to 60.3. Increase the limit to 80mph on motorways.Once that’s done, remove the requirement for cameras to be visible and allow local councils to share unpersoned mobile digital cameras and install far more average speed cameras.Then, allow some leeway (say 10%) and then prosecute everyone who speeds, increase the fines and the number of points. There will be a huge outcry which will settle down when death numbers start to fall dramatically (which they will!) As I said, not a vote winner but an effective strategy to deal with the current ludicrous situation where people think it’s OK to break the law a little bit.Phillip Tanswell, by emailWhat about a road reflector containing radio-frequency identification (RFID) set to the proper (safe) speed limit? This would communicate with the vehicle passing above. The driver would be alerted and if speed is not adjusted the onboard computer does it for them.

At a given moment, an elder turned to me and asked if I had ever traced my ancestry back inCuba. I looked at her with a mix of irony and cynicism then briefly explained that trying to put together my genealogy would be like assembling a puzzle that is missing most of the main pieces.The reason? Some of my ancestors are included in the statistics related to the slave trade, that shameful process in which millions of human beings were trafficked and deprived of any connection to their environment of origin. The first step was to change their names.That brief exchange was the catalyst that led me to begin working on Sweet Thing, a multidisciplinary attempt to reconstruct an uncertain past where I use sugar as a symbolic motif by adding it to a fragmented family album from what remains. It includes archival photographs, contemporary images from my visits to the places my parents were born and conceptual self-portraits I’ve created in my studio.View image in fullscreenI still remember that narrow ribbon of earth winding down from my grandfather’s house towards the old Triunvirato plantation – the same fields where an enslaved woman called Carlota, who led an uprising in 1843, raised her voice against chains. In the silence of that road, it feels like a place that has been frozen in timeView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen1/ Colonial records suggest an annual death rate of about 5% among the enslaved population in Cuba’s sugar plantations, in addition to the about 102,000 deaths before arrival on Cuban soil. Some of my ancestors survived. 2/ Across the centuries of colonial rule, tools of torture and public punishment became common instruments of control. Shackles and iron collars bit into flesh to break spirits; whipping posts and carts carried victims through town squares and branding irons marked bodies as propertyView image in fullscreenIt is virtually impossible to state precisely how many ships took part in the transatlantic slave trade, or to give an exact tally of the people moved between African, European and Cuban ports. Using the best available compilations, roughly 879,800 people were shipped to Cuba, and about 766,300 disembarked; About 12.9% of them died in transitThe visuals are often blurred – not as a technical fault but as an honest mimicry of how recollection falters and softens at its margins.Unlike traditional genealogical records, my process is non-linear. Missing documents and eroded narratives force me to construct memory through place and imagery.View image in fullscreenThere are sites where the sole reason for their existence was related to a purely economic interest in maintaining the labour force close to the source of exploitation. When that source was no longer exploitable, these sites were forgotten and doomed to disappear over time.

School was a distant promise: he only got inside a classroom when he was grown, going to night school after the day’s work was done. 2/ When I asked my father specific questions about his elders, he very often answered: “I don’t remember.” I think most of those answers were etched on his bodyExplore more on these topicsCotton Capital: ongoing seriesSlaveryCubaAmericasAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

If, as is expected, China is granted planning permission this month to build a new embassy complex at Royal Mint Court, it will employ over 200 people. All are expected to be Chinese nationals, in line with Beijing’s normal policy, from the lowest kitchen porter to the ambassador, with residences provided on site.China blocks Nvidia H200 AI chips that US government cleared for export – reportRead moreAs is the case now with its smaller existing embassy on Portland Place, north of Oxford Circus, among them will be a handful of undeclared officers from its ministry of state security (MSS) and military intelligence. According to one former MI6 officer, “they will be acting as ‘radars’, highlighting contacts of potential interest, getting to know people,” all of which are routine intelligence tasks.Yet it will not be easy for any of them to engage in the “serious business of espionage”, the former officer argued, not least because any embassy would be a “magnet for attention and surveillance”. A single site, officials have argued, makes that task easier, allowing MI5 to monitor the activities of Chinese officials, if needed, as they conduct themselves across the UK.It is also a psychological warning, subtler than the embassy-monitoring techniques used by China and Russia in their own back yard. British diplomats who have worked in Beijing or Moscow already operate on the premise they are watched and monitored digitally 24 hours a day. “You have to assume your life is not your own,” said John Foreman, a former UK defence attache to Moscow in the run-up to the start of the war in Ukraine.“I’d chat to my opposite number in Beijing and we’d try to work out who of the two of us was most followed,” Foreman said. Every time he left the British embassy in the Russian capital he would be tailed. If it was on foot, by a couple of people; if it was by car, “there could be as many as four, because I was a defence attache”.Russian agents would “point thinly concealed listening devices at you if you sat in a cafe,” the former attache said. They would also track planned movements on his phone, adding that “they were quicker to find you if you used a Russian app rather than Google”. The whole aim was to put pressure on people, to the point where they lost their judgment. “Some people got so intimidated they wouldn’t leave the embassy, which was the point.”Critics of the planned Chinese embassy argue that it is the greater size of the new development that poses key problems. “More state employees from the People’s Republic of China equals more Chinese interference,” said Luke de Pulford, the executive director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, pointing to a US decision to shut a Chinese consulate in Houston in 2020 as an example.The diplomatic mission in Texas, comprising of 60 employees, was shut suddenly on US orders in July 2020 towards the end of the first Trump administration amid accusations that it was a base for planned intellectual property theft, in particular of medical research during the coronavirus pandemic, and that it was a location for the coercion of Chinese citizens wanted in their homeland.A second concern was highlighted in the Daily Telegraph last week. Publicly available floor plans for the embassy had been heavily redacted, but the newspaper obtained the full floor plans, revealing 208 previously blacked-out rooms, including a “hidden chamber” near high speed internet cables running through the adjacent street. The cabling, the newspaper suggested, could be at risk of being tapped underground.Mark Carney in China positions Canada for ‘the world as it is, not as we wish it’Read moreIt is understood that the full plans were well known to the security services as part of the planning process, now led by the communities secretary, Steve Reed. Insiders add that even though the Royal Mint Court site is roughly between London’s two financial districts in the City and Canary Wharf, the concerns about cabling are exaggerated. “Traffic can be re-rerouted and, if necessary, cabling removed,” an official said.However, recent espionage incidents in the UK demonstrate that China does not run key intelligence operations out of embassies. Much of Beijing’s spying activity is conducted from China – from where it has hacked into global phone networks, in theSalt Typhoon episode. Pressure placed on researchers at Sheffield Hallam University to halt research about human rights abuses in Chinawas conducted in Beijing.Three recent attempts by China to interfere in the Westminster parliament have all been conducted outside the embassy. Christine Lee, an Anglo-Chinese lawyer, was accused oftrying to covertly cultivate “relationships with influential figures”in 2022 and subject of an MI5 warning. A parliamentary aide, Christopher Cash, was accused ofpassing sensitive information about Westminsterto a friend, Christopher Berry, based in China, though a prosecution of the two collapsed.Two recruitment consultants based in China, Amanda Qiu and Shirly Shen, were accused by MI5 of using LinkedIn to try to recruit MPs and peers to obtain “non-public and insider insights” and, ultimately, insider information. “The embassy is only a small part of the total espionage threat from China; we need to be more alert to where the real dangers are coming from, when to be permissive and when to be assertive,” a former senior Whitehall official said.Explore more on these topicsChinaEspionageAsia PacificMI5analysisShareReuse this content"

He said the NUP had planned similar attacks “everywhere”.Human Rights Watch accused the government of “brutal repression” of the opposition ahead of the vote.Another key opposition leader, Kizza Besigye, who ran four times against Museveni, was abducted in Kenya in 2024 and brought back to a military court in Uganda for a treason trial that is ongoing.African election observers, including a team from the African Union, said on Saturday that “reports of intimidation, arrest and abductions” had “instilled fear and eroded public trust in the electoral process”.Explore more on these topicsUgandaYoweri MuseveniBobi WineAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They stayed in their houses because they thought the fire would stop at the edge of the forest,” said John Guzmán, 55, surveying the scene in Penco, where smoke blanketed the sky in an orange haze. “It was completely out of control. No one expected it.”Although the total number of homes burned nationwide remained unclear, one municipality of Concepción in Biobío reported 253 homes destroyed.View image in fullscreenMembers of a family watch as their home burns to the ground in Penco, Chile, 18 January 2026.Photograph: Pablo Hidalgo/EPAJuan Lagos, 52, also in Penco, said: “We fled running, with the kids, in the dark.” The fire engulfed most of the city, burning cars, a school and a church.Charred bodies were found across fields, in homes, along roads and in cars.“From what we can see, there are people who died ... and we knew them well,” said Víctor Burboa, 54. “Everyone here knew them.”Matias Cid, a 25-year-old student who lives in Penco, described fast-moving flames burning through the night and devouring homes.“We had to leave with the shirts on our back. If we had stayed another 20 minutes we would have burned to death,” Cid told AFP.All but one of the fatalities so far were in Penco, Vera said.Lirquén, a small port town, was also hit hard, with many people saving themselves by rushing to the beach, said resident Alejandro Arredondo, 57.“There is nothing left standing,” he added as he surveyed a burning landscape of metal and wood that used to be people’s homes.Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

If, as is expected, China is granted planning permission this month to build a new embassy complex at Royal Mint Court, it will employ over 200 people. All are expected to be Chinese nationals, in line with Beijing’s normal policy, from the lowest kitchen porter to the ambassador, with residences provided on site.China blocks Nvidia H200 AI chips that US government cleared for export – reportRead moreAs is the case now with its smaller existing embassy on Portland Place, north of Oxford Circus, among them will be a handful of undeclared officers from its ministry of state security (MSS) and military intelligence. According to one former MI6 officer, “they will be acting as ‘radars’, highlighting contacts of potential interest, getting to know people,” all of which are routine intelligence tasks.Yet it will not be easy for any of them to engage in the “serious business of espionage”, the former officer argued, not least because any embassy would be a “magnet for attention and surveillance”. A single site, officials have argued, makes that task easier, allowing MI5 to monitor the activities of Chinese officials, if needed, as they conduct themselves across the UK.It is also a psychological warning, subtler than the embassy-monitoring techniques used by China and Russia in their own back yard. British diplomats who have worked in Beijing or Moscow already operate on the premise they are watched and monitored digitally 24 hours a day. “You have to assume your life is not your own,” said John Foreman, a former UK defence attache to Moscow in the run-up to the start of the war in Ukraine.“I’d chat to my opposite number in Beijing and we’d try to work out who of the two of us was most followed,” Foreman said. Every time he left the British embassy in the Russian capital he would be tailed. If it was on foot, by a couple of people; if it was by car, “there could be as many as four, because I was a defence attache”.Russian agents would “point thinly concealed listening devices at you if you sat in a cafe,” the former attache said. They would also track planned movements on his phone, adding that “they were quicker to find you if you used a Russian app rather than Google”. The whole aim was to put pressure on people, to the point where they lost their judgment. “Some people got so intimidated they wouldn’t leave the embassy, which was the point.”Critics of the planned Chinese embassy argue that it is the greater size of the new development that poses key problems. “More state employees from the People’s Republic of China equals more Chinese interference,” said Luke de Pulford, the executive director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, pointing to a US decision to shut a Chinese consulate in Houston in 2020 as an example.The diplomatic mission in Texas, comprising of 60 employees, was shut suddenly on US orders in July 2020 towards the end of the first Trump administration amid accusations that it was a base for planned intellectual property theft, in particular of medical research during the coronavirus pandemic, and that it was a location for the coercion of Chinese citizens wanted in their homeland.A second concern was highlighted in the Daily Telegraph last week. Publicly available floor plans for the embassy had been heavily redacted, but the newspaper obtained the full floor plans, revealing 208 previously blacked-out rooms, including a “hidden chamber” near high speed internet cables running through the adjacent street. The cabling, the newspaper suggested, could be at risk of being tapped underground.Mark Carney in China positions Canada for ‘the world as it is, not as we wish it’Read moreIt is understood that the full plans were well known to the security services as part of the planning process, now led by the communities secretary, Steve Reed. Insiders add that even though the Royal Mint Court site is roughly between London’s two financial districts in the City and Canary Wharf, the concerns about cabling are exaggerated. “Traffic can be re-rerouted and, if necessary, cabling removed,” an official said.However, recent espionage incidents in the UK demonstrate that China does not run key intelligence operations out of embassies. Much of Beijing’s spying activity is conducted from China – from where it has hacked into global phone networks, in theSalt Typhoon episode. Pressure placed on researchers at Sheffield Hallam University to halt research about human rights abuses in Chinawas conducted in Beijing.Three recent attempts by China to interfere in the Westminster parliament have all been conducted outside the embassy. Christine Lee, an Anglo-Chinese lawyer, was accused oftrying to covertly cultivate “relationships with influential figures”in 2022 and subject of an MI5 warning. A parliamentary aide, Christopher Cash, was accused ofpassing sensitive information about Westminsterto a friend, Christopher Berry, based in China, though a prosecution of the two collapsed.Two recruitment consultants based in China, Amanda Qiu and Shirly Shen, were accused by MI5 of using LinkedIn to try to recruit MPs and peers to obtain “non-public and insider insights” and, ultimately, insider information. “The embassy is only a small part of the total espionage threat from China; we need to be more alert to where the real dangers are coming from, when to be permissive and when to be assertive,” a former senior Whitehall official said.Explore more on these topicsChinaEspionageAsia PacificMI5analysisShareReuse this content"

The war of words that laid waste to the 2026 Adelaide writers’ festivalRead moreAbdel-Fattah was invited to participate in the 2026 Adelaide writers’ week by the festival’s artistic director, Louise Adler, before the board of Adelaide festival sought to intervene and overturned the decision. Adler, the daughter of Holocaust survivors, is a respected figure within Australian publishing and a prominent progressive Jewish voice. She publicly resigned over the intervention afterpenning an opinion piece published by the Guardian.The newAdelaide festivalboard has sinceissued an “unreserved” public apologyto Abdel-Fattah – which she accepted – and has promised she will be invited to Adelaide writers’ week in 2027.Premier ‘surprised’ at invitationThe release of the premier’s letter came after Abdel-Fattahthreatened defamation action against Malinauskasover his public comments about her.In a statement released on Instagram on Wednesday, Abdel-Fattah accused the premier of making harmful public statements about her and said she refused to become a political punching bag.“We have never met and he has never attempted to contact me,” she wrote.She accused Malinauskas on Tuesday of going “even further” than previous statements supporting her removal from the festival by linking her to the Bondi atrocity and allegedly suggesting, by way of analogy, that she was “an extremist terrorist sympathiser”.In his letter, Malinauskas claimed the board had concerns about the inclusion of Abdel-Fattah prior to the Bondi attacks, and pointed to the resignation of Tony Berg, a businessman and a governor on the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce, in October over his concerns about the program.Typically, boards do not get involved in the editorial or production decisions of arts organisations, which are considered operational matters.Though the letter acknowledges that “Adelaide Festival is independent from the government” and the premier is prevented under law from issuing a ministerial direction about its programming, Malinauskas stressed that the government “fundamentally opposes the inclusion” of the author in the 2026 program and “reserves the right to make public statements to this effect”.“I am surprised at the decision by Adelaide Writer’s Week to give a platform to this author and deeply concerned that the Board is not prepared to remove her appearance from the program, particularly in light of the current circumstances, the national mood and the need for social cohesion following the Bondi terror attack,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPeter MalinauskasAdelaide festivalAntisemitismIslamophobiaSouth Australian politicsAustralian booksnewsShareReuse this content"

He said that security in the high north is a priority for all Nato allies in order to protect Euro-Atlantic interests,” a Downing Street summary of the calls said. “He also said that applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is wrong.”The firm stance could place Starmer on a collision course with the US after Trump said he would place sanctions on eight European nations, including the UK, that have deployed troops to Greenland in response to US threats over its future.A joint statement by the affected countries on Sunday said Trump’s threats “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral”.On Monday, Starmer will use an emergency Downing Street statement to reiterate the UK’s disappointment at the threat of US tariffs.Calling off a planned event outside London focused on the cost of living, the prime minister was instead due to fully line the UK up with European opposition to Trump’s plan, which has caused shock waves throughout the EU and Nato.At a Downing Street press conference on Monday morning, Starmer will echo the sentiment with robust language of his own. But he is not expected to push for reciprocal tariffs or other retaliatory measures.Starmer is also expected to stress the importance of UK ties with allies like the US, with officials hoping his unexpectedly good relationship with Trump thus far, which has seen the UK evade some earlier US tariffs, could help instigate a climbdown by the White House.Every major UK party has condemned Trump’s threat to apply 10% tariffs from 1 February on the UK, France, Germany,Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Finland, rising to 25% on 1 June if a deal to buy Greenland has not been reached. This includes Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, which is most closely aligned with the US president.A graph showing the trade in goods to and from the US with countries Trump has targeted with fresh tariffsBut Starmer will face pressure to push back harder against Trump, in an acceptance that a normal relationship with his administration is effectively impossible.The Liberal Democrats are pushing for an emergency Commons debate and for the scrapping of a pharmaceuticals deal with Washington, while some Labour MPs want a more overtly Europe-leaning stance.Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, who was the government minister tasked with media interviews on Sunday, refused to be drawn on the prospect of responses like retaliatory tariffs, saying that rather than “shout and yell”, the aim was to have serious but private talks with the US administration.But she said there would be no climbdown on the central point: “Our position on Greenland is non-negotiable. We’ve made that very clear and we’ll continue to make that clear. President Trump’s position on Greenland is different. Notwithstanding that, it is in our collective interest to work together and not to start a war of words.”Asked to confirm that the UK would never accept the US idea of annexation, Nandy told Sky News: “Yes, of course. The prime minister was very clear that we believe that this decision on tariffs is completely wrong. The future of Greenland is for the people of Greenland and the people of the kingdom of Denmark to determine and for them alone.“We’ve been consistent about that. That is a view that we’ve expressed to our friends and allies in the American administration.”Starmer has consistently sought to engage with and, if needed, openly court and flatter Trump, most notably in early 2025 when he used a visit to the White House tooffer the US presidentan unprecedented second state visit to the UK.He has subsequently met Trump at several global summits and fielded numerous calls from him, someseemingly madeon the spur of the moment by the US president. Trump regularly says he likes Starmer, an affection the prime minister privately admits hecannot fully explain.UK officials insist this has brought benefits, in terms of trade arrangements with the US and also in allowing Starmer to act as a bridge between Washington and other Nato members over Ukraine and the importance of US support and security guarantees against Russia.But there has been an awareness that the capricious US leader could blow up relations at any point.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandKeir StarmerDonald TrumpDenmarkEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The EU, he said, showed “readiness to defend ourselves against any form of coercion”.Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said Trump’s tariffs would be a mistake, and the Dutch foreign minister, David van Weel, described the US president’s threats to allies as “blackmail”, as reaction from European leaders continued to pile up.The anti-coercion law, which has so far never been used, enables the EU to impose punitive economic measures on a country seeking to force a policy change.According to diplomatic sources, the EU was also consideringreactivating a package of counter-tariffsagainst €93bn US goods, which were drawn up in response to Trump’s previous economic threats but suspended after the two sides struck a trade deal last summer. The measures would impose duties on US cars, industrial goods, food and drink.The ambassadors of the EU’s 27 member states were meeting on Sunday in an emergency session after Trump threatened tariffs on the six EU nations plus the UK and Norway.But the EU remains far from agreement on retaliatory measures against Trump. “At present, there is no question of deploying the ACI [anti-coercion instrument] or any other trade instrument against the US,” an EU diplomat said. The €93bn counter-tariffs are suspended until 6 February and several sources stressed the desire for dialogue with the US.A second EU diplomat said the situation was seen as very serious: “There was a clear and broad understanding that Europe and the EU cannot start reneging on key principles in the international order, such as territorial integrity.” In a joint statement, those countries said their Danish-led military exercise Arctic Endurance was in a commitment to strengthening security “as a shared transatlantic interest” and “poses no threat to anyone”.Trump had accused the countries, which have all deployed troops to Greenland in the last week, of playing “a very dangerous game” and said they would be subject to 10% tariffs from 1 February, increasing to 25% from 1 June.In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump said the tariffs would be levied “until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase ofGreenland”, a largely autonomous territory that is part of Denmark.The threats to Greenland have cast a long shadow over Nato and thrown into doubt theEU-US trade dealthat the bloc signed with Trump last August. The leader of the European parliament’s largest group, the centre-right European People’s party, Manfred Weber, tweeted on Saturday that “approval is not possible at this stage”, a conclusion Socialist and Green MEPs had already reached.Ratification of the deal, which would reduce EU tariffs on some US goods to zero, had been expected by February.Macron said on Saturday that Europewould not change coursein its opposition to a US takeover of Greenland, declaring: “No intimidation or threat will influence us – neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations.”In a joint statement, the EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and António Costa said tariffs would “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral”. The pair, who had been in Paraguay signing a trade deal with four South American countries in the Mercosur bloc, are understood to have been blindsided by Trump’s latest threats.Meloni, oneTrump’s strongest EU allies, told journalists in Seoul that she had spoken to him “and told him what I think”, describing the proposed sanctions as a “mistake”.The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, who bonded with Trump over theirshared love of golf, said European countries stood united in support of Denmark and Greenland. “Tariffs would undermine the transatlantic relationship and risk a dangerous downward spiral,” he wrote on X.Germany’s deputy chancellor, Lars Klingbeil, said his country would always extend a hand to the US in the search for common solutions, but “we will not be blackmailed, and there will be a European response”.A spokesperson for the Bundeswehr said on Sunday the reconnaissance mission to Greenland had been completed as planned, after the German newspaper Bild reported that German troops were flying home.Speaking for the British government, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said Trump’s decision on tariffs was “completely wrong” but shedeclined to sayif the UK would retaliate with its own countermeasures.Spain’s leader, Pedro Sánchez, said a US invasion of Greenland would make Vladimir Putin “the happiest man on Earth” by legitimising the Russian president’s attempted invasion of Ukraine and sounding the “death knell for Nato”.Sánchez’sinterview to La Vanguardia, published on Sunday but apparently conducted before Trump’s latest threat, reflects the broad European support for the Danish territory.After the Trump broadside, the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, tweeted: “China and Russia must be having a field day.” She went on: “If Greenland’s security is at risk, we can address this inside Nato. Tariffs risk making Europe and the United States poorer and undermine our shared prosperity.”Kallas warned against the dispute “distract[ing] us from the our core task of helping to end Russia’s war against Ukraine”.Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, who wasin Washington last weekfor talks about Greenland, said Trump’s announcement came as a surprise, after the “constructive” talks held with the vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio. “The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the president refers, is to enhance security in the Arctic,” Rasmussen wrote.Trump’s latest threat underscores allies’ seemingly impossible job to appease Trump without ceding Greenland to the US. Trump criticised the motives of countries that deployed troops to Greenland in the name of enhanced security while also mocking Denmark for not doing enough to defend the territory. “China and Russia want Greenland, and there is not a thing that Denmark can do about it. They currently have two dogsleds as protection, one added recently,” he wrote.Trump’s tariff threat is an attempt to divide Europe and quash opposition over GreenlandRead moreDenmark announced last week that it was increasing its military presence on the island, while troops from the seven other countries targeted with tariffs went to Greenland on a short scoping mission designed in part to show the US that European Nato members were serious about Arctic security.The threats represent an “existential crisis” for Nato, said one former official at the transatlantic alliance. Robert Pszczel, now a senior fellow at the Centre for Eastern Studies in Warsaw, wrote on X: “Pretending that we are not dealing with an existential crisis for Nato is no longer possible nor desirable.“Threats made by the current US administration towards allies of the [US] and the use of economic blackmail are direct violations of article one and two of the North Atlantic Treaty,” he wrote, referencing parts of the agreement on peaceful settlement of disputes among allies and promoting “peaceful and friendly international relations”.The head of the European parliament’s trade committee, Bernd Lange, said the EU needed to activate its anti-coercion instrument, a law that allows wide-ranging economic sanctions in response to hostile actions from another state.The anti-coercion instrument, originally conceived in response to China, allows the EU to take wide-ranging punitive measures against a country seeking to use economic coercion, such as tariffs or investment restrictions.Lange, a German Social Democrat, said Trump was using trade as an instrument of political coercion, adding: “The EU cannot simply move on to business as usual.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionGreenlandDenmarkEuropeUS foreign policyTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It now feels as if Donald Trump’s threat to impose 10% tariffs on eight fellow Nato states for sending troops last week to support Greenland’s sovereignty may be one of those clarifying moments in which Europe had no option. Successive European leaders condemned Trump’s blackmail and intimidation on Sunday and they sounded as if they meant it.The chair of the Danish parliament’s defence committee, Rasmus Jarlov, can hardly claim to speak for Europe, but he captured a mood in saying: “Every insult, threat, tariff and lie that we receive strengthens our resolve. The answer fromDenmarkand Greenland is final: We will never hand over Greenland.”He added: “We pray that our true allies will stand with us because we are going to need it.”So far there is every sign that all eight countries targeted by Trump will spring to Denmark’s defence. Even leaders of other European countries close to Trump such as the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, called his decision a mistake.Graph of US tariffs on European countriesIn their joint statement the eight made no threat of reprisals such as imposing counter-tariffs on the US, but they warned his move risked a dangerous downward spiral and that a trade war would be a matter of time.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is exploring the activation of the EU’s anti-coercion instrument in his discussions with fellow European leaders, the Élysée briefed. France will also raise the question of the validity ofthe EU-US tariff agreementconcluded in 2025.Keir Starmer, his fate increasingly tied with Europe, has not yet said if the UK will retaliate, but the benefits of Brexit are rapidly evaporating. His trade agreement with the US,announced with fanfare last year, has not yet been signed. The indefinite postponement risks weakening his position in the Labour party. He has rebuffed those who argue for the UK to join the EU customs union,by saying it would be impossibleas it would undermine the UK trade deal with the US. With no trade deal, and an extra 10% blanket tariffs on UK imports, that argument looks threadbare.Moreover in the wider – and perennial – Churchillian choice for the UK between the values of the open sea, represented by the US, and those of Europe, the case for the open sea has been dealt yet another blow. When Bronwen Maddox, the director of Chatham House, the voice of the UK foreign policy elite,declared last week that the western alliance was over, one can be sure similar views are being expressed privately in the UK Foreign Office.For those such as the national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, who have made it an article of faith that the UK relationship is based on public quiescence and private influence, these are trying times.Yet for months European leaders, especially Starmer’s entourage, hoped Trump’s threat to invade Greenland was either an outlandish fantasy, to be deposited in his locker of empty threats, or else could be assuaged by a compromise such as giving the US military greater access, and more bases, as permissible under existing defence agreements such as the 1951 Greenland defence agreement.Denmark’s political leadership went to the White Houselast week with a version of this offer, but got nowhere. Trump, it seems, is not interested in sovereign US bases on Greenland. He wants ownership.Since nothing any longer is preposterous, the risk of a military confrontation between Europe and the US is not minuscule. “If the United States decides to militarily attack another Nato country, then everything would stop,”argued Mette Frederiksen, Denmark’s prime minister, on 5 January. “That includes Nato and therefore post-second world war security.”The former UK permanent secretary Simon McDonald, speaking on the BBC’s Broadcasting House radio show, agreed. “There’s no way back, when one ally turns against another militarily, that’s the end of the alliance. The people who most obviously benefit from that are Presidents Putin and Xi.”Closing US access to itsNatobases in Europe becomes the end point. Yet since the US pursuit of Greenland is based on the need to monitor and counter Russian and Chinese threats in the Arctic, the loss of cooperation from Scandinavia, Iceland and the UK would ultimately not serve the US national interest, a point the US military would doubtless make to its commander in chief.That is not to say there are no quixotic voices. McDonald said the 1917 purchase of the Danish West Indies, now the US Virgin Islands, might be a precedent. “Buying territory is a standard diplomatic procedure, and it feels to me as if that is the way forward.” But his is a lonely voice, partly because it sets a disastrous precedent.In Trump’s mind, everything, including Greenland and a seat on his version of the UN security council the“board of peace”, should be for sale. Not only is might right, but wealth, regardless of how it is acquired, equals legitimacy.For Europe, forged by a different set of values, that would be the equivalent to signing its own death warrant.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandNatoDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropeForeign policyDenmarkanalysisShareReuse this content"

Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had also urged restraint, according to Axios, citing the risks to regional stability.“It was really close,” a US official told Axios, adding that the order to strike never came.In a social media post on Friday, Trump thanked Tehran’s leaders, claiming they had called off scheduled executions of 800 people, including that ofErfan Soltani, 26, the first Iranian protester sentenced to death since the unrest began.Soltani, a clothing shop employee, was arrested in Karaj, a city north-west of Tehran, after participating in protests and was due to be executed on Wednesday, according to rights groups. Since his arrest, his family had received little news about his condition besides a brief, scheduled visit before his expected execution.Over the weekend, Soltani’s family were able to visit him and establish that he was alive. “I am relieved to know my cousin Erfan is alive,” said Soltani’s cousin Somayeh, who lives in Germany. “However, I am worried because I received news that he has been tortured under custody and hasn’t received medical attention yet.“I appeal to the international community to please bring attention to his detention conditions. I also appeal to European politicians to please sponsor his case to demand medical assistance for Erfan. I am also deeply worried for the thousands of other protesters in custody.”At least 5,000 people have been killed in protests in Iran, including about 500 security personnel, an Iranian official in the region said on Sunday, citing verified figures and accusing “terrorists and armed rioters” of killing “innocent Iranians”.During a speech on Thursday, Khamenei acknowledged for the first time that thousands of people had been killed, “some in an inhuman, savage manner”. He blamed the US for the death toll, railing against Trump, whom he called a “criminal” for his support of the demonstrations, and calling for strict punishment of the protesters.On Sunday, monitors said some internet access had been restored in Iran. “Traffic data indicates a significant return to some online services including Google, suggesting that heavily filtered access has been enabled, corroborating user reports of partial restoration,” Netblocks said in a social media post.An Iranian official who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue told Reuters some of the heaviest clashes and highest number of deaths had been in the Iranian Kurdish areas in the country’s north-west. Kurdish separatists have been active there and flare-ups have been among the most violent in recent periods of unrest.The Human Rights Activists news agency said 24,348 protesters had been arrested in the crackdown.No protests have been reported for days in Iran, where the streets have returned to an uneasy calm. Instead, some Iranians chanted anti-Khamenei slogans from the windows of their homes on Saturday night, the chants reverberating around neighbourhoods in Tehran, Shiraz and Isfahan, witnesses said.AFP, Reuters and AP contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Those who support it and continue to host it even now will not be granted a foothold in Gaza. Period.“The prime minister must stand firm on this, even if it requires managing a dispute with our great friend and President Trump’s emissaries.”View image in fullscreenBezalel Smotrich has criticised Turkey and Qatar’s involvement in the White House’s Gaza plan.Photograph: Ronen Zvulun/ReutersOn Sunday, in an apparent attempt to calm tensions and assess his next move, Netanyahu convened a meeting with coalition partners.The prime minister’s central challenge is containing his far-right allies, whose continued participation in the government is key to his political survival and who never agreed to a US-brokered ceasefire struck last October.Netanyahu himself objected to the plan on Saturday, citing how some of the appointments were “not coordinated with Israel and were contrary to its policy”, without specifying who. He told his foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, to contact the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.Israel has previously objected strongly to any Turkish role in postwar Gaza, with relations between the two countries having deteriorated sharply since the war began in October 2023.Trump appoints Blair, Kushner and Rubio to Gaza ‘board of peace’Read moreIn addition to naming Turkey’s foreign minister to the executive board, Trump has invited the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to join the overarching board of peace, along with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, the former UK prime minister Tony Blair and the president of Argentina, Javier Milei. Pakistan’s prime minister Shehbaz Sharif has also received an invitation to join, Pakistan said on Sunday.The White House said Trump’s plan would include three bodies: the board of peace, chaired by Trump; a Palestinian committee of technocrats tasked with governing Gaza; and the Gaza executive board, which would play an advisory role.The Palestinian technocratic committee held its first meeting in Cairo on Saturday.A draft charter sent to about 60 countries by the US administration calls for members to contribute $1bn in cash if they want their membership to last more than three years, according to the document seen by Reuters.“Each Member State shall serve a term of no more than three years from this Charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the Chairman,” states the document, first reported by Bloomberg News. “The three-year membership term shall not apply to Member States that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force.”The US said this week that the Gaza truce plan had entered a second phase, shifting from implementing a ceasefire to the disarmament of Hamas, whose attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 triggered the Israeli offensive in Gaza.The focus of the second phase has shifted from simply stopping the fighting to establishing transitional governance, demilitarisation and reconstruction in the territory – a dramatic escalation of diplomatic ambition amid persistent violencefrom the Israeli military.At least 451 Palestinians have been reported killed since the ceasefire took effect in October last year. Life in the enclave remains precarious. While airstrikes and gunfire have slowed, they have not ceased. At the same time, recent storms have compounded the crisis, causing deaths and flooding in displacement camps already stretched beyond their limits.Strong winter winds caused walls to collapse on to flimsy tents housing displaced Palestinians last Tuesday, killing at least four people. On Saturday, a27-day-old babyin Gaza died from severe cold, bringing the number of children in the region who have died of hypothermia since the start of the current winter season to eight, according to the Palestinian health ministry.AFP contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsraelGazaPalestineIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It came despite US calls to halt the advance.The government appeared to be extending its grip on Kurdish-run areas after the Syrian president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, issued a decree declaring Kurdish a national language and granting the minority group official recognition.The army advanced after implementation of a March 2025 deal – intended to integrate Kurdish forces into the state – stalled.Syrian forces expel Kurdish fighters as US strikes Islamic State targetsRead moreGovernment troopsdrove Kurdish forces from two Aleppo neighbourhoodslast week and on Saturday took control of an area east of the city.For days, Syrian troops had amassed around a cluster of villages that lie just west of the winding Euphrates and had called on the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) stationed there to redeploy their forces on the opposite bank of the river. They have been clashing over strategic posts and oilfields along the Euphrates River.SDF fighters withdrew from the area early on Saturday as a gesture of goodwill – but then accused Syrian troops of violating the agreement by continuing to push further east into towns and oilfields not included in the deal.The SDF said on Saturday that Damascus had “violated the recent agreements and betrayed our forces”, with clashes erupting with troops south of Tabqa. The army meanwhile urged the SDF to “immediately fulfil its announced commitments and fully withdraw” east of the river.View image in fullscreenKurdish fighters stand near burning tyres at the entrance to the city of Tabqa on Saturday.Photograph: Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty ImagesSyrian state media reported on Sunday that Kurdish-led forces destroyed two main bridges over the Euphrates River in the Raqa region. “The SDF [Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces] organisation detonated the new Alrashid bridge in Raqqa city,” said the Sana news agency, quoting the Raqqa information directorate.It earlier reported that another bridge leading to Raqa city was blown up by Kurdish fighters.Brad Cooper, who heads the US military’s Central Command, said in a written statement that Syrian troops should “cease any offensive actions in areas” between the city of Aleppo and the town of Tabqa approximately 160km further east.France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Iraqi Kurdistan leader Nechirvan Barzani also called for de-escalation and a ceasefire.The initial withdrawal deal included the main town of Deir Hafer and some surrounding villages whose residents are predominantly Arab. The SDF withdrew on Saturday and Syrian troops moved in relatively smoothly, with residents celebrating their arrival.“It happened with the least amount of losses. There’s been enough blood in this country, Syria. We have sacrificed and lost enough – people are tired of it,” Hussein al-Khalaf, a resident of Deir Hafer, told Reuters.The Syrian Petroleum Company said that the nearby oilfields of Rasafa and Sufyan had been captured by Syrian troops and could now be brought back online.SDF forces had withdrawn east, some on foot, towards the flashpoint town of Tabqa – downstream but still on the western side of the river and near a hydroelectric dam, a crucial source of power.But when Syria’s army announced it aimed to capture Tabqa next, the SDF said that was not part of the original deal and that it would fight to keep the town, as well as another oilfield in its vicinity.View image in fullscreenSyrian soldiers ride a tank as they replace Kurdish forces in Maskanah in northern Syria.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesSyria’s army said four of its troops had been killed in attacks by Kurdish militants, and the SDF said some of its own fighters had been killed but did not give a number. Both sides traded blame for violating a withdrawal deal.US-led coalition planes flew over the flashpoint towns, releasing warning flares, according to a Syrian security source.The US has had to recalibrate its Syria policy to balance years of backing for the SDF – which fought against Islamic State – against Washington’s new support for the Syrian president, whose rebel forces ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad in late 2024.To try to end the fighting, US envoy Tom Barrack travelled to Erbil in northern Iraq on Saturday to meet with SDF commander Mazloum Abdi and Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani, according to two Kurdish sources. There was no immediate comment from Barrack’s spokesperson.The latest violence has deepened the faultline between the government led by Sharaa, who has vowed to reunify the fractured country after 14 years of war, and local Kurdish authorities wary of his Islamist-led administration.The two sides engaged in months of talks last year to integrate Kurdish-run military and civilian bodies into Syrian state institutions by the end of 2025, repeatedly saying that they wanted to resolve disputes diplomatically. But after the deadline passed with little progress, clashes broke out earlier this month in Aleppo and ended with a withdrawal of Kurdish fighters. Syrian troops then amassed around towns in the north and east to pressure Kurdish authorities into making concessions in the deadlocked talks with Damascus.Kurdish authorities still hold Arab-majority areas in the country’s east that are home to some of Syria’s largest oil and gas fields. Arab tribal leaders in SDF-held territory have told Reuters they are ready to take up arms against the Kurdish force if Syria’s army issues orders to do so.Kurdish fears have been deepened by bouts of sectarian violence in 2025 when nearly 1,500 Alawites were killed by government-aligned forces in western Syria and hundreds of Druze were killed in southern Syria, some in execution-style killings.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Reassured, Shirzad took to the streets, ignoring his family’s warnings and joining the growing crowds.View image in fullscreenSiavash Shirzad.Photograph: courtesyAuthorities started shooting, but no help came. On 8 January, the internet was shut off andIranwent dark, Shirzad was shot at a protest in Tehran and died of his wounds hours later, leaving behind a 12-year-old son.“Siavash hoped until the very end that Trump’s help would arrive,” his cousin said, speaking anonymously for fear of repercussions. “We told him: ‘Don’t go, it’s dangerous.’ But he gave a firm answer: ‘Trump said he supports us, I’m going.’”On Tuesday, Trump urged Iranians to keep protesting and to “take over your institutions”, telling them “help is on its way”, as reports grew that a strike on Iran was imminent. But just a day later, Trump abruptly did an about-face, telling reporters that he had received assurances that Iranian authorities would not execute anyone, walking back from military intervention in Iran, at least temporarily.In Iran, protesters despaired. Despite Trump’s reassurances, killings of demonstrators continued.The streets of Tehran were empty, except for pickup trucks with armed security forces patrolling where tens of thousands had marched just days before. Protests continued in provinces outside the capital, but getting an accurate picture of their scale was difficult amid the communications blackout.“Mass arrests are taking place. As soon as Trump’s attention moves elsewhere, the executions will start,” a resident of Tehran said in messages forwarded to the Guardian via an activist.9:37What are we hearing from inside Iran? | The LatestIran doubled down on the prosecution of protesters, with state TV on Thursday airing footage of forced confessions and Iran’s chief justice interrogating detained protesters. Rights groups warned that protesters would probably not receive fair trials and that they had grave concerns over the conditions in which detainees are held.“Past patterns in Iran demonstrate that periods of widespread unrest are accompanied by heightened abuses inside detention facilities, where these groups are particularly vulnerable to extrajudicial killing, enforced disappearance, torture, and other forms of ill-treatment,” more than 30 rights groups wrote in a jointletteron Thursday.View image in fullscreenErfan Soltani.Photograph: Erfan Soltani/Facebook/ReutersHowever, the authorities refrained from executing protesters, most notably cancelling the death sentence of the 26-year-old protesterErfan Soltaniand announcing no hangings would take place. Trump seemed pleased, sharing news that Soltani’s execution would not take place.Iranians in the diaspora felt betrayed. For two weeks they watched a brutal crackdown on the streets of Iran. Messages from family came infrequently, if at all, and Trump’s statement that “help is on the way” seemed their only lifeline.“As someone living in the diaspora, this feels like a slap in the face,” said Elham, an Iranian living in Sydney. “Iranians have been let down before. This time, there was a sense it was going to be different.”Iran internet shut down graphicTo many Iranians abroad, Trump’s about-face felt like a victory for the Iranian regime. Instead of helping topple the Iranian government as protesters demanded, he was going to negotiate with them. The comments on Wednesday by the foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, on Fox News, urging the US to engage in diplomacy only furthered their fears.View image in fullscreenIranians living in Australia attend a rally in Sydney in support of protests in Iran on 17  January.Photograph: Flavio Brancaleone/Reuters“If Trump gives the regime a lifeline, it will be such a profound betrayal from which ordinary Iranians won’t recover. It will be the end of hope. Many talk of Trump’s unpredictability, but using innocent lives for political theatre is intolerable,” said Elham.Senior Iranian cleric calls for protester executions in defiance of Trump claimsRead moreEven as US forces pulled back from bases in the Middle East and indicators of a US strike gathered, it was unclear what Trump planned to do in Iran. Though unprecedented, nationwide protests had not threatened the short-term stability of the Iranian state, which has well-armed and trained security forces.A strike on Iran could trigger retaliation on Israel and the US, without necessarily shielding protesters from harm. Other Iranian analysts warned that US intervention could further the accusation that protests are foreign-backed, without giving meaningful benefit to the demonstrators’ aims.Nonetheless, Iranians abroad and inside the country hoped that the world would do something to help, even if they were unsure of what.View image in fullscreenIranian people attend a rally in Toronto in solidarity with protesters in Iran on 13 January.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“The people of Iran believed him. They placed their trust in his words. If he fails to act against this brutal regime, that trust will be broken and the people of Iran will not forget who stood with them, and who turned away,” said Azam Jangravi, an Iranian based in Canada whose close friend was killed in protests in Isfahan last week.Though Trump appeared to walk back from the brink of a strike, the US has said it had not completely ruled out intervention. Trump “has made it clear all options are on the table to stop the slaughter,” the US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, told the UN security council on Thursday.A US aircraft carrier was heading to the Middle East and military assets were being redeployed to bolster Israeli air defences – two indications that a US strike on Iran was still possible.In Iran, many protesters feel as if they are in limbo. Cut off from the rest of the world and under the heavy boot of authorities, they are unsure if they should take to the streets again.“The protests have come to a pause, people are waiting to see what Trump will do,” said Alborz, a Tehran resident, in messages forwarded to the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsIranDonald TrumpAyatollah Ali KhameneiProtestMiddle East and north AfricaTrump administrationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While Rosindell is notably lower profile than Jenrick, the departure of another sitting MP is a blow to the Tories.Tory defectors: who has already joined Reform UK and who may follow?Read moreIn his statement, Rosindell said he had been a long-term advocate for the rights of Chagossians removed from the island of Diego Garcia in 1971 to allow the construction of a large UK-US airbase.Both Labour and the Conservatives “have been complicit in the surrender of this sovereign British territory to a foreign power”, he wrote, criticising the decision earlier in January to order Conservative peers to not vote down the bill setting out the Chagos deal.He said: “Sadly, I now believe that the Conservative party is irreparably bound to the mistakes of previous governments and unwilling to take meaningful accountability for the poor decisions made over so many issues.“Following a conversation earlier this evening with Nigel Farage, I have therefore agreed to join Reform UK as its seventh member of parliament. It is clear to me that Reform UK is now the only political movement that is genuinely willing to fight for the best interests of the United Kingdom.”He added: “Radical action is now required to reverse the damaging decisions of the past and to forge a new course for Britain – one that firmly places the interests of the British people first.”The 59-year-old is the third sitting Tory MP to defect, the East Wiltshire MP, Danny Kruger, havingsigned up to Reformin September.The former cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi, who is no longer an MP, wasannounced by Farageas another defector on Monday. Jenrick’s departure after months of secret talks with Farage was forced on Thursday after Badenoch’s team learned of his plans and he was sacked from his shadow ministerial role and lost the party whip.A Tory party source told the Press Association that Rosindell had threatened to defect for months but denied he was doing so until as recently as Saturday.“The Conservative party supported Rosindell throughout his many troubles,” the source said. “And he’s responded by stabbing his friends, colleagues and activists in the back. Reform are welcome to him.”In a statement, Farage said of Rosindell: “Andrew is a great patriot. The Tories’ lies and hypocrisy over theChagos Islandsbetrayal has tipped him over the edge, and we are delighted to welcome him to our ranks.”After Jenrick’s move, Farage announced that the deadline for any other defectors to join his party would be 7 May, the date of elections to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, and to councils aroundEngland.Explore more on these topicsReform UKEnglandChagos IslandsConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

He added that recent events – namely an Islamistattack on a synagoguein Manchester and what he described aswidespreadantisemitismfollowing the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 – had led him to believe that British Jews should be given the option of sanctuary in the US.Western alliance hangs in balance as Europe stiffens itself against Trump’s threatsRead moreSome supporters ofIsraelin the UK cast mass demonstrations there against the Israeli response to the 2023 attack, in which tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians were killed in Gaza, as motivated by antisemitism.In aUS television interviewin late 2023, Garson himself called protesters in New York and Los Angeles who opposed the Israeli response “marauding mobs” and accused them of “masquerading as protesters” to shout “antisemitic chants baying for Jewish blood”.In the new interview with the Telegraph, Garson said he could see “no future” for Jews in the UK and placed much of the responsibility on to British prime minister Keir Starmer, accusing him of allowing antisemitism to grow.Garson, a former British barrister who practiced in London before relocating to the US in 2008, told the Telegraph: “The UK is no longer a safe place for Jews. I have spoken to the state department as to whether the president should be offering British Jews asylum in the US.”He went on to say that such a proposition is attractive because “it is a highly educated community”. “It is a populous that speaks English natively, that is educated and doesn’t have a high proportion of criminals,” Garson said.He added: “When I look at what is going on with Jews in Britain, and when I look at the changing demographics, I don’t believe – and I have discussed this with people in theTrump administration– that there is a future for Jews in the United Kingdom.“For me, that is particularly sad.”Israelis demonised as a ‘vehicle for hatred of Jews’, says UK terror laws watchdogRead moreGarson said he raised the idea of the US acting as a refuge for British Jews with Trump’s special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, Yehuda Kaploun, in his role as a board member of the US Holocaust Memorial Council. Trump appointed Garson to the council in May after dismissing board members who had been appointed during Joe Biden’s presidency.Trump previously hired Garson to pursue a$50m lawsuitagainst investigative journalist Bob Woodward that wasdismissed.A 2025 survey conducted by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research found that feelings of safety in the UK’s Jewish community havedeclined sharplyin recent years. It found 35% of Jews felt unsafe in Britain in 2025, compared with 9% in 2023 before the Hamas attacks and the protests in Britain against the Israeli assault on Gaza.Perceptions of antisemitism had also intensified, with 47% of British Jews seeing it as a “very big” problem – up from just 11% in 2012.In October, the Trump administration hadannouncedthat it planned to restrict the number of refugees it admits into the US in 2026 to just 7,500 – and those spots would be mostly reserved forwhite South Africans. It wasn’t immediately clear how British Jews would factor into that figure should the US grant them refuge.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS immigrationAntisemitismJudaismReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

The bill will still return to the Commons for its report stage and third reading as planned.Withdraw Hillsborough law amendment, urge Liverpool and Manchester mayorsRead moreThe government has performed a series of recent U-turns on controversial policy areas, includingfarmers’ inheritance tax,digital ID cardsandbusiness rates for pubs. A government spokesperson said the decision was intended “to make sure the bill is the strongest it can possibly be, without compromising national security”.The campaign group Hillsborough Law Nowsaid in a post on X: “We welcome the government listening to the campaign, families, MPs and supporters by withdrawing their security services amendment.“We shall engage further with government to ensure the bill fully applies to the security services whilst not jeopardising national security.”The new legislation has been prompted by the campaigning of families bereaved in the 1989 disaster at Sheffield Wednesday’s Hillsborough stadium where 97 people died as a result of a crush at the FA Cup semi-final betweenLiverpooland Nottingham Forest.In the aftermath of the disaster, South Yorkshire police mounted a concerted effort to blame Liverpool supporters, alleging misbehaviour at the match. After a 27-year battle by families to establish the truth, an inquest in 2016 found that the men, women and child wereunlawfully killed due to gross negligence manslaughter by the South Yorkshire police officer in command, and that a catalogue of failings by police and the ambulance services contributed to their deaths. The inquest jury also concluded that no behaviour by football supporters contributed to the disaster.Speaking on Sunday before the amendment was pulled, MPs who opposed it argued that it could do real harm to Labour’s reputation with campaign groups. Ian Byrne, the MP for Liverpool West Derby, said that promises made to those who lost their loved ones at Hillsborough would be broken if the amendment was included, which he described as “untenable and unacceptable”.“Families of people who were killed at Hillsborough went to the Labour party conference and were on the stage with the prime minister,” said Byrne. “Commitments were made to them in person and there was a lot of political capital made out of them. And now that promise to them must be delivered.”Byrne, who was at Hillsborough with his father on the day of the disaster, said that as a survivor he had expected the prime minister to keep his word for the law to be “implemented without being watered down”.The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who was born in Liverpool, called the proposed law with the amendment included “a Hillsborough law, but not the Hillsborough Law”.Labour MPs could rebel over Hillsborough law after talks with families break downRead moreMcDonnell warned of a risk of “almost permanent damage to the Labour party” and added: “We need a few experienced, calm heads to come together and think. We’re now in a situation where we’re hoping the government just pauses tomorrow and doesn’t try to force the bill through, because at the moment it’s looking like a complete car crash.”Paula Barker, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree, said the government’s insistence on the amendment would feel like “the ultimate betrayal” to the people of Liverpool.“Let’s just get it right the first time,” she said. “Let’s stop ripping the party apart because, quite frankly, that’s what’s happening. The frontbench is ripping our party apart.”A government spokesperson said: “This legislation will right the wrongs of the past, changing the balance of power to ensure the state can never hide from the people it should serve and putting a legal duty on officials to respond openly and honestly when things go wrong.“The bill will make the police, intelligence agencies and the whole of government more scrutinised than they have ever been, but we can never compromise on national security.“We will continue to work with all parties to make sure the bill is the strongest it can possibly be, without compromising national security.”Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterLabourLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

They were met by hundreds of counterprotesters, who covered Lang in aerosol string, doused him in water in freezing cold temperatures and chased him off to jeers. However, images of Lang and one of his five supporters bleeding after scuffles with demonstrators were eagerly shared online as evidence of violent chaos in Minneapolis.The city’s mayor, Jacob Frey, said on Sunday that any military deployment would be “ridiculous” and only exacerbate tensions in Minnesota’s largest city, where the Trump administration has already sent 3,000 immigration and border patrol officers who have been confronted by largely peacefulprotests.“That would be a shocking step,” Frey told NBC News. “We don’t need more federal agents to keep people safe. We are safe.”Confrontations between federal officers and protesters in the city intensified after the killing of Good, which theTrump administrationhas called justified.Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, told CBS News on Sunday that Frey should set up “a peaceful protest zone” for demonstrators. The aim of the protesters, however, is not to simply voice their dissent but to make life difficult for the immigration enforcement officers, by jeering them and blowing whistles to alert their immigrant neighbors to their presence.Trumphasrepeatedlyinvokedan unrelated scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending in immigration agents. The president and administration officials havesingledoutthe state’s community of Somali immigrants.ICE agents are targeting other immigrant communities in the Twin Cities as well. On Sunday, agents entered a St Paul house and removed an elderly man who was wearing only underwear and a blanket as onlookers shouted at them to leave. The man was a member of the Hmong community, which came to the region from Laos starting in the 1970s after siding with the US in the Vietnam war. About one-third of the US Hmong population are immigrants, according to thePew Research Center.If active-duty troops are deployed, it is unclear whether the Trump administration would formally invoke the Insurrection Act, which gives the president the power to deploy the military or federalize state national guard troops to quell domestic uprisings. Even without invoking the act, a president can deploy active-duty forces for certain domestic purposes such as protecting federal property, which Trump cited as a justification forsendingmarines to Los Angeles last year.In addition to the active-duty forces, the Pentagon could also attempt to deploy newly created national guard rapid-response forces for civil disturbances. “The Department of War is always prepared to execute the orders of the commander-in-chief if called upon,” said Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell, using the Trump administration’spreferredname for the department of defense.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the order, which was first reported by ABC News.As Minnesotans joke the federal invasion of their state in winter echoing Napoleon’s doomed invasion of Russia and share images of ICE officers slipping on ice, the soldiers subject to deployment specialize in cold-weather operations and are based in Alaska, the officials said.Trump sent the surge of federal agents to Minneapolis and neighboring St Paul early this month, as part of a wave of interventions across the US, mainly to cities run by Democratic politicians, includingLos Angeles,ChicagoandPortland, Oregon, all in states that voted against him in the previous three presidential elections.Trumpcalledthe deployments necessary to protect federal property and personnel from protesters. But this month he said he wasremovingthe national guard from Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, where the deployments have faced legal setbacks and challenges.Local leaders have accused the president of federal overreach and of exaggerating isolated episodes of violence to justify sending in troops. Minnesota’s governor,Tim Walz, who, along with the Minneapolis mayor, is reportedly thetargetof a federal criminal investigation for allegedly impeding immigration raids, has mobilized the state’s national guard to support local law enforcement and the rights of peaceful demonstrators, the state’s department of public safetyannouncedon Saturday.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryMinnesotaMinnesota ICE shootingMinneapolisTrump administrationDonald TrumpICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)newsShareReuse this content"

He suggested that the officer was cleared by the publicly available video evidence.“Is the FBI conducting an investigation into that agent, into the shooting?” Blanche was asked, in response to criticism from Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz.‘Make no mistake, this is an occupation’: ICE’s deadly presence casts long shadow over MinneapolisRead more“Look, what happened that day has been reviewed by millions and millions of Americans because it was recorded on phones,” Blanche said. “The department of justice, our civil rights unit, we don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody putting his life in danger. We never do.”“The department of justice doesn’t just stand up and investigate because some congressman thinks we should, because some governor thinks that we should,” Blanche said. “We investigate when it’s appropriate to investigate and that is not the case here.“We are not going to bow to pressure from the media, bow to pressure from politicians, and do something that we never do – not under this administration, not under the last administration. So no, we are not investigating.”Blanche was not asked what made this case different from that of Floyd, which the previous Trump justice department investigated. Nor was he challenged on his suggestion that video of the incident left no doubt that the officer had acted in self-defense.Forensic analysis of the video fromthe New York Times,Bellingcatand other outlets has demonstrated that Trump’sclaimthat Good “ran over” the ICE agent who shot her at point-blank range as she drove past him is false.Earlier on Sunday,Kristi Noem, who oversees ICE as Trump’s head of homeland security,insisted to CBSthat there was no ned for an investigation, since “everybody can watch the videos and see that” Ross “got attacked with a car that was trying to take his life”. Noem said that a standard, internal review by the agency would suffice.The deputy attorney general’s claim that the justice department’s civil rights division “never” responds to public outrage over killings by law enforcement officers is contradicted by the fact that, during the first Trump administration, the US attorney in Minnesota and the FBIannouncedthree days after George Floyd was killed that it was “conducting a robust criminal investigation” with the department’s civil rights division.The next day, 29 May 2020, then attorney general William Barrcalled“video images of the incident that ended with the death of Mr Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers … harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing”. The department of justice and the FBI, he added “are conducting an independent investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated”.That investigationledtoconvictions, in 2022, of four Minneapolis police officers for federal civil rights offenses. The officer who choked Floyd, Derek Chauvin,pleaded guilty.Three of the other officers were also convicted of “deliberate indifference to” Floyd’s “serious medical needs when they saw him restrained in police custody in clear need of medical care and willfully failed to aid him, resulting in bodily injury to and the death of Mr Floyd”. Witnesses to the shooting of Good this month, including one who recorded video,saidfederal officers prevented a man who identified himself as a physician from treating her and blocked ambulances when they arrived.Since Trump returned to office last year,hehasrunroughshod over the traditional independence of the justice department, appointing partisan leaders, directing prosecutors to open criminal investigations against his enemies and drop charges against his allies, and even issuing pardons and commutations to political supporters charged or convicted by prosecutors appointed by him.Six years after George Floyd, we must stand against an ICE killing in Minneapolis | Austin SaratRead moreThe day that Good was killed, Harmeet Dhillon, the Republican activist who now leads the justice department’s civil rights division,sharedTrump’s false claim that Good “violently, willfully and viciously ran over the ICE officer” on X.A day later, Trump’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, posted astatementthat made no mention of Good’s death but warned Minnesota protesters that “obstructing, impeding, or attacking federal law enforcement is a federal crime”.After a wave of federal prosecutors in Minnesota and Washington DCresigned in protestover the justice department’s decision not to hold a civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of Good, Blanche and the FBI director, Kash Patel, visited Minneapolis to meet with prosecutors and federal immigration officers.Amid reports that the justice department isinvestigating Renee Good’s widow, Becca, for allegedly impeding the ICE agent, Ross, by taunting him moments before he opened fire, Blanchepromisedto “prosecute anyone attacking or obstructing” ICE officers. Patelpostedthat the FBI was “cracking down on violent rioters” in the city, a term Trump administration officials routinely apply to peaceful protesters in Minneapolis who object to their neighbors being detained or shot by federal officers.Explore more on these topicsMinnesota ICE shootingTrump administrationGeorge FloydICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinneapolisMinnesotaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Brock – of South Charleston,Ohio– is white.He was convicted of murder, felonious assault and kidnapping Wednesday. He is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison at his sentencing hearing.A message seeking comment was left with his attorney.Brock’s attorney said the shooting was in self-defense and the scammer had made threats against him and his family. Brock testified during the trial that he felt threatened when the driver arrived at his house.But prosecutors said Hall was unarmed and posed no threat when Brock shot her. Investigators said the driver was unaware of the scam call that Brock had received with threats and demands for money.Clark county prosecutor Daniel Driscoll told reporters after the verdict that both families lost loved ones because of the scam.“The really sad part about this is that we know there are still criminals out there,” he said. “We know that the scammers, the folks who started this, haven’t been brought to justice.”Associated Press contributedExplore more on these topicsUS crimeOhionewsShareReuse this content"

And Cassidy had since publicly expressed confidence Trump would not make any endorsements as he sought re-election in November’s midterms.Nonetheless, Trump published a post on his Truth Social platform saying should Letlow “decide to enter this Race, [she] has my Complete and Total Endorsement”.“RUN, JULIA, RUN!!!!” Trump’s post concluded.Cassidy was amongsevenRepublican US senators who broke loyalties to their party by voting to convict the president at his second impeachment trial after his supporters carried out the 6 January 2021 US Capitol attack.Then in February, Cassidy voted in alignment with his party,joining51 fellow Republicans to confirm Kennedy as the Trump administration’s health secretary. Cassidy has since repeatedly spoken out about anti-vaccine maneuvers that are in line with Kennedy’s philosophies, including Louisiana’s decision to prohibit the promotion of mass vaccination against preventable diseases.Speaking out against Trump’s snub Saturday, Cassidy said on X: “I’m proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.”Letlowwona special election for the Louisiana-based US House seat in 2021 which her husband, Luke, had previously won before his death from Covid-19. She became the first Republican woman elected to Congress from Louisiana.Commenting on social media about the endorsement, Letlow said she was honored to have Trump’s trust. “My mission is clear,” she posted, “to ensure the nation our children inherit is safer and stronger”.Candidates for Cassidy’s seat have until 13 February to file.The timing of a potential Cassidy-Letlow electoral showdown is conspicuous. In 2024, Louisiana lawmakersapproveda shift to a closed party primary system from an open – or “jungle” – system for certain elected positions, including Cassidy’s seat.Under an open primary, two candidates from the same party can face each other in a runoff if no one receives more than 50% of the vote in the primary. By comparison, the new system all but ensures each of the major parties has a candidate in the runoff. In his case, Cassidy could only qualify for the runoff if he wins his primary, when the old system would have allowed him to make the runoff even if he finished second to a Republican in the primary.Accordingto the New York Times, Trump called Senator John Thune, the majority leader, on Friday and said he was likely to endorse Letlow. Thune reportedly encouraged the president to support Cassidy, noting long-term consequences and the fact that Trump was beginning to push a major healthcare bill which Cassidy would have jurisdiction over as the chairperson of the Senate health committee.Explore more on these topicsRepublicansDonald TrumpUS politicsUS SenateTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump financial products raise questions about potential presidential conflicts of interestFive exchange-traded funds have been launched by Trump Media, owner of the president’s social media platform Truth SocialLauren Arataniin New YorkSun 18 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 08.02 ESTShareThe word “Truth” was plastered all around the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday morning. At 9.30am, when the market opened, a small crowd stood on the balcony above the trading floor to ring in the day.The group was celebrating the launch of five exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that are tied to Truth Social, Donald Trump’s social media platform that has spun into a menagerie of products over the last few years.Under a parent organization, the Trump Media and Technology Group, Truth Social has been joined by astreaming platform, anuclear fusion energycompany and a growing slate of financial services products.The ETFs are just the beginning of what will probably be a whole range of new financial products, especially related to crypto, rolled out this year all as the presidentcontinues to call backback to his promise to make the US the “crypto capital of the world”.The Trump Media ETFs, which were officially launched on the stock exchange at the end of December, are being branded as “America First” funds, a kind of antithesis to the “woke” environmental, social and governance (ESG) movement that was popular in investment, particularly at the end of Trump’s first term.Each of the five ETFs has a specific theme that centers Trump-branded patriotism: American-based companies, real estate in Republican-voting states, energy production and infrastructure, security and defense, and technology, including bitcoin.ETFs – which are portfolios of assets, trading as a single investment vehicle – have rapidly risen in popularity in recent years. In 2025, new investments in ETFsreached$1.4tn, with a total of $13tn invested in the industry.The “America First” ETFs are being managed by Yorkville America, a branch of Yorkville Advisors, an investment company based in New Jersey that haspartneredwith Trump Media in helping the company roll out its financial products. In 2024, Yorkville Advisors was involved in a $2.5bn fundraising round by Trump Media, and last year the investment company agreed to provide a $5bn line of credit to Trump Media and Crypto.com to form a new crypto treasury.It’s a huge bet that Trump’s brand will be able to draw sustained financial interest. So far, the evidence has been mixed.Truth Social, which the president still uses to fire off daily declarations and diatribes, has far fewer users than the social media giants that it was supposed to compete against. Trump Media, which is trading on Nasdaq, ballooned to over $60 per share in March 2024, during Trump’s presidential campaign, but is now trading closer to $14 per share. While Trump’s $Trump meme coin, which he promoted last January, soared in price to $45 a token around his inauguration, it has since dropped down to $5 a token.The companies are also wading in uncharted waters around potential conflicts of interest that might arise when a sitting president is tied to such deep financial stakes.Much of the company’s new ventures have launched over the last year, coinciding with Trump’s return to the White House, raising concerns among government ethics watchdogs about potential conflicts of interest that these new deals could create.Before his inauguration, Trump put all his Trump Media shares into a revocable trust headed by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Typically, US presidents put their financial interests into a blind trust, managed by an independent third party.“The thing that’s guarding the president from getting involved in conflicts of interests and propping up the presidency are ethics norms,” said Kedric Payne, a former attorney at the office of congressional ethics. “That’s it. So if there are no ethics norms, there is no mechanism set up where you could have officials or agencies that are in charge of making the president comply with norms.”In alettersent to the US treasury on Tuesday, the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren requested that the office of the comptroller of the currency delay its review of a bank charter of World Liberty Financial, Trump Media’s digital asset company, which is trying to become a regulated crypto bank.If the charter is approved, “for the first time in history, the president of the United States would be in charge of overseeing his own financial company”, Warren wrote.Ethics watchdogs are especially concerned that people or companies looking to curry favor with Trump’s can simply invest in one of his company’s products. “The concern is if large investors purchase that financial product to win favor with him,” said Payne, senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center.Questions have already been raised about Trump’s relationship with leaders in the crypto industry. Trump pardoned former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who invested $2bn in World Liberty Financial, and the SEC paused a federal investigation into Justin Sun, another crypto billionaire who bought $200m worth of Trump’s crypto token. (Sun has repeatedly maintained his innocence.) And while the Biden administration was investigating Trump Media partner Crypto.com, the inquiries stopped once Trump became president.“There is absolutely no connection between the decision” and Crypto.com’s political activities, the company hassaid, adding that “any assertion to the contrary is entirely inaccurate”.Meanwhile, the White House has said that “neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest”.Trump was not at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday morning, leaving the iconic bell ringing to Yorkville America.He had rung the bell once before, though, after Time Magazine named him person of the year, in 2024. Standing on the balcony that day as CEOs chanted “USA! USA!” from below, Trump smiled as he gave them a message. “We’re with you all the way!” he said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpEthicsCryptocurrenciesTrump administrationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

New England have won their last nine divisional round games.Maye finished 16 of 27 for 179 yards, but had an interception and fumbled four times, losing two in cold conditions as snow and rain fell throughout the game. One of Maye’s fumbles set up Houston’s first touchdown.“Just proud of the guys,” Maye said. “Battled the elements. This is New England. This is what we’re trying to embrace and we want to embrace all season long. Props to our defense, played a hell of a game. We’ve got to protect the football better, but we made enough plays to win it.”Carlton Davis III had two interceptions for New England. Craig Woodson added an interception and fumble recovery.“They bring it every week,” Maye said of his defense. “It’s fun to watch. And we could help them out some more, but just proud of the guys. Enjoy this one, and we’re back on the road.”The eight combined turnovers – Woody Marks also lost a fumble for Houston – were the most in a playoff game since 2015 when the Cardinals and Panthers combined for eight in the NFC championship game.Broncos quarterback Bo Nix out for season with broken ankle in playoff winRead moreThe Texans have lost in the divisional round in three straight seasons under coach DeMeco Ryans.

The intervention drew a round of applause and cheers from sections of the crowd.Western alliance hangs in balance as Europe stiffens itself against Trump’s threatsRead moreThis week Donald Trump threateneda 25% tariff on a slew of European countries, including the UK, unless the US is allowed to buy Greenland. On Saturday, Trumpsaid he would placea 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland beginning on 1 February unless his demands are met. He added the tariff will increase to 25% on 1 June.European leaders have pushed back on Trump’s demands. “Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer,said. “Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”Sunday’s heckle was not the first time sports fans have shown their displeasure with Trump’s foreign policy.Canadian fans have booedthe Star-Spangled Banner at basketball and ice hockey games in the last year, after Trump threatened to make his neighbor a “51st state” and raised tariffs on Canadian goods.Trump has also been booedby fans in the US.

And that was true, until injury time in the final, when a video assistant referee decision contrived to produce perhaps the most ludicrous finale to any major final in history.Senegal won it, but that is a tiny detail in the denouement that erupted. There was a walk-off in protest, a missed Panenka and a brilliant winning goal from Pape Gueye. When the final whistle went, players from both sides collapsed to the turf. For Morocco, extending the 50-year wait since their last Cup of Nations, this was agony.Regragui calls Thiaw ‘shameful’ after Africa Cup of Nations final descends into chaosRead moreThe chaos began two minutes into injury time when Abdoulaye Seck was penalised for a slight push on Achraf Hakimi as he headed against a post. Ismaïla Sarr nodded in, but the whistle had already gone. Four minutes later, El Hadji MalickDiouf was penalised, following a VAR review, for a slight pull on Morocco’s Brahim Díaz as he defended a corner. For Senegal, already convinced there was a plot against them, that was too much and the majority of their players stormed off.Sadio Mané seemed notably reluctant to go, and it was he who eventually ran down the tunnel to bring them back from the dressing-room after Claude Le Roy, a veteran French coach of eight African teams including Senegal, had materialised on the touchline to broker a solution alongside El Hadji Ousseynou Diouf; you know it’s a bonkers situation when Diouf is acting as a peacemaker.View image in fullscreenSenegal’s Idrissa Gueye calls players to walk off the ptich.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/APIn total, 15 minutes passed between the award of the penalty and it being taken. Díaz, having scored five in the tournament, stepped up. Who knows what must have gone through his mind as he waited for that fateful quarter of an hour? He had arguably been the player of the tournament and here was a chance to seal it, to end his country’s wait for a Cup of Nations.View image in fullscreenBrahim Diaz kicks misses his penalty.Photograph: Sébastien Bozon/AFP/Getty ImagesHe kissed the ball, placed it on the spot, walked back, puffed out his cheeks and tried a Panenka – and duffed his shot straight at Édouard Mendy who caught it calmly. In the stands there was pandemonium, and the advertising hoardings in front of the Senegal fans collapsed, prompting the deployment of at least 100 riot police.A cagey game suddenly burst open. Four minutes into extra time, Neil El Aynaoui was dispossessed on halfway and the ball worked to Pape Gueye who surged through and lashed a shot into the top corner – a stunning goal, only rendered more remarkable by the absurd circumstances.Senegal v Morocco: Africa Cup of Nations final – liveRead moreSenegal’s actions, obviously, were inexcusable and there will almost certainly be sanctions against their coach, Pape Thiaw, and perhaps some of the players. It’s arguable the game should have been awarded against them. But context perhaps offers some explanation.Senegal hadprotested about a lack of securitywhen they arrived at Agdal station in Rabat on Saturday morning, complained about a ticket allocation of around 2,800 in a 69,500-capacity stadium, changed hotel insisting the accommodation they were initially offered was inadequate, and been unhappy at being asked to train at the Mohammed VI complex in Salé just outside Rabat, seemingly for fear of being spied upon.View image in fullscreenPape Gueye hammers Senegal’s winning goal in the fourth minute of extra time.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesAlthough it is true that there was a large crowd at the station, many of them seeking selfies, it wasn’t entirely clear whether Senegal’s complaints were genuine or part of some broader strategy; certainly Cameroon and Nigeria in the previous two rounds had felt Morocco had enjoyed the benefit of various refereeing decisions and this may have been a pre-emptive strike against any skulduggery.Such was the concern around officiating and the possibility one side or other might protest that Jean-Jacques Ngambo of DR Congo was only confirmed as referee for the final at around 10pm on Saturday night. More disruptive for Senegal was probably the fact that their right-back Krépin Diatta was ruled out at the last minute by sickness, replaced by Antoine Mendy. With their captain, Kalidou Koulibaly, and the midfielder Habib Diarra missing through suspension, that meant three of their back four were aged 21 or under. In terms of their defending, they were magnificent. Diatta seemingly tried to warm up before accepting he was too ill to play and, clearly distressed, was escorted off by sympathetic teammates.The final, it is fair to say, was a slow-burner. Senegal’s policy throughout this tournament has been not to overcommit, not to take too many risks in possession, assuming that eventually one of their array of high-class forwards, a set play or a mistake would create something. Which was not much different to Morocco’s approach, just with slightly more of the ball. Senegal had marginally the better of the first half, Morocco the second, Ayoub El Kaabi skewing one glorious chance wide. Díaz is not the only Moroccan who will have sleepless nights.View image in fullscreenMorocco’s players are overcome with emotion after losing the final.Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/ReutersExtra time was an entirely different issue. Forced to attack, Morocco fired cross after cross into the box. Nayef Aguerd thudded a header against the bar, Youssef En-Nesyri sent a diving header a fraction wide and Senegal made block after block. And, at the other end, Cherif Ndiaye somehow missed an open net from six yards. It was all hilarious, hysterical drama, all the intrigue of the tournament packed into its final 45 minutes.But Senegal held on. There will be repercussions for their walk-off – there must be – but history will record that they won their second Cup of Nations in Morocco, and that despite conceding a 98th-minute penalty when the scores were level. But the best football rarely makes much sense.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Senegal football teamMorocco football teamAfrica Cup of Nationsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But Olga Danilovic had other ideas, rallying to win six straight games and beat the American 6-7, 6-3, 6-4. Williams served for just shy of 15 minutes in the penultimate game, determined to stay in the match before she finally succumbed to a third break point.Emma Raducanu recovers from slow start to ease through at Australian OpenRead more“At 4-0 I felt good. It’s the biggest lead I’ve had since I’ve been back. In a lot of ways I’m having to relearn how to do things again,” said Williams, who will continue her campaign in doubles. “I’m really proud of my effort today because I’m playing better with each match, getting to the places that I want to get to. Right now I’m just going to have to keep going forward and working on myself and working to control my errors.“Those are things that come with playing extra matches, like getting your feet in the right position, choosing the right shots, all of those things I’m still learning. It’s weird but it’s super exciting to have played that well and to get myself in that position and come very close.”At 45, ranked No 576 and playing thanks to a wildcard entry, Williams became the oldest player to compete in singles at theAustralian Open, surpassing the mark set by Japan’s Kimiko Date, who was 44 when she lost in the first round in 2015.Williams was given a standing ovation by the crowd as she entered the arena. “It was an amazing journey on the court today,” said Williams, who left the stadium with a smile and a wave.Williams entered the tournament on a five-match losing streak since the first and only win in her most recent comeback to the tour at Washington last year. On Sunday, she won the first set and had command of the third until Danilovic went for broke at John Cain Arena.“These things don’t happen every day and playing againstVenus Williamsis something that I cannot take for granted, but there were a lot of nerves,” Danilovic said. “At 0-4, I said to myself, ‘Just play, just take everything out and play point by point’. I’m happy I managed to get this one but it was such a pleasure playing against a legend.”Williams was 17 when she first played the Australian Open in 1998 – before Danilovic was even born – reaching the quarter-finals in just her fourth grand slam event. She has never won the Australian Open singles title but she made the finals in 2003 and 2017 and lost both times to her sister, Serena. She has also won five doubles titles in Melbourne, including four with Serena.Among the other Americans in action on Sunday, Frances Tiafoe overpowered Jason Kubler 7-6, 6-3, 6-2 and Michael Zheng fended off Sebastian Korda 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 6-7, 6-3 in an all-US first-rounder. Zheng, a college star at Columbia who advanced through qualifying to make his tour-level debut, will next face Corentin Moutet, who was booed after his underarm serve on match point in a 6-4, 7-6, 6-3 win over Tristan Schoolkate.Former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova withdrew because of a shoulder injury before her scheduled first-round match, giving a place in the main draw to Taylor Townsend, the lucky loser from qualifying, to take on Hailey Baptiste.

The US president was handed the award at the World Cup draw in Washington DC in December with the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, telling Trump: “We want to see hope, we want to see unity, we want to see a future. This is what we want to see from a leader and you definitely deserve the first Fifa Peace Prize.”Since then, the US has launched airstrikes across Venezuela andcaptured the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro,and his wife, Cilia Flores, and flown them to the US, where he was put in jail. Maduro appeared in court on 5 January,pleading not guilty to drugs, weapons and “narco‑terrorism” charges. Trump has alsothreatened to invade Greenlandbecause he said the US needs the territory “very badly”.Geopolitical football: Iran? Trump? How the game can stand strong in a fractured worldRead moreThere was unease withinFifaat the time of Trump receiving the award with the governing body not disclosing any details of the selection process. Now, though, that has shifted to “deep embarrassment”, according to one senior Fifa source. Multiple officials have expressed their unease about the way it was handled.A highly placed official, who declined to go on the record, admitted that staging theWorld Cupin the US is going to be a “very delicate” and “difficult” period, in the months leading up to the tournament as well as during the competition itself.It is understood that Infantino has been left to deal with the “political matters” concerning Trump for the World Cup as others fear it may tarnish their reputations. “Involving myself in the politics surrounding this World Cup is something I stay far away from. My job concerns football on the pitch and nothing else,” a Fifa source said.Fifa, however, doubled down on its decision to give Trump the peace prize, and said it did not comment on “hearsay”. A spokesperson said: “Fifa strongly supports its annual peace prize, an award to recognise exceptional actions for peace and unity. Fifa notes the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize recipient [the Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado]has given her medal to President Trump.“Fifa has strong relations with President Trump, along with leaders from fellow co-hosts Canada and Mexico.

The club are braced for empty seats in their stadium for the visit of Dortmund.Spurs have just brought the formerAjax manager, John Heitinga, on to Frank’s staff to replace the assistant, Matt Wells, who left before Christmas to become the head coach at Colorado Rapids. Heitinga took the session on Sunday, with Frank in his normal overseeing role. Frank said he had driven Heitinga’s appointment, despite the suggestion the Dutchman could replace him on a caretaker basis if the board decides to make a change.The situation is precarious. The directors have been reluctant to dismiss Frank as they are mindful of the problems he has faced – not all of them have been of his own making during what was always likely to be a transitional season.Vinai Venkatesham, the chief executive, wrote an open letter to supporters before the West Ham game, the tone of which was calm and reassuring, the overriding message being a call for patience.Yettoxicity and disaster followedwhen the West Ham substitute, Callum Wilson, scored a stoppage-time winner, sparking mutiny among the home crowd. The fans booed at various points of the game, including when Frank substituted the winger Mathys Tel, whom they had wanted to stay on. The ill-feeling bubbled over after Wilson’s goal, with sustained booing at the final whistle and leaving the board with a decision to make.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

Backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham will start the AFC championship game next weekend.Denver one win from Super Bowl after surviving Buffalo in overtime thrillerRead more“Stiddy’s ready,” Payton said after returning to the postgame lectern to discuss the injury following Denver’s 33-30 victory.Payton said Nix got hurt on a keeper where he lost two yards and was tackled by safety Cole Bishop. Nix was limping after the play, but there was no indication that he suffered such a serious injury.On the next play, Nix threw a deep pass to Marvin Mims Jr. that drew a 30-yard pass-interference flag and got the Broncos well into field-goal range. Nix then took a knee to center the ball for Wil Lutz’s game-ending 23-yard field goal.Payton said Nix will have surgery Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama.“He’s such a strong, faith-based guy,” Payton said. “He’s sitting in the hallway with his family and coming over and we’re all talking to him. He knows that God’s got a plan for him and he said he had [a broken ankle] in high school and then he said he had one at Auburn.“And I said I didn’t realize that. I said if I had known that I wouldn’t have drafted you,” Payton joked.The locker room had cleared out and reporters were waiting in an interview room for Nix when Payton returned and delivered the news.Nix, the 12th overall pick out of Oregon in the 2024 NFL draft, tied Russell Wilson’s NFL record with two dozen victories in his first two seasons. Saturday’s victory was his first in the playoffs. The Broncos lost last year at Buffalo but Nix led Denver to the AFC’s top seed this season.“He’s a tough cookie,” Payton said. “And this team all year has lost key players and will rise up for the next challenge.”Explore more on these topicsDenver BroncosBuffalo BillsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

In his programme notes theAston Villamanager turned to caps lock. “THIS MATCH IS CRUCIAL,” he said, spying an opportunity after Arsenal and Manchester City dropped points, with a golden chance to return to second and cut the leaders’ advantage to four oints.Everton, however, had other ideas and, as the hour mark approached, Thierno Barry pounced on an Emiliano Martínez fumble after a Pau Torres lapse to condemn Villa to a punishing defeat. They are almost unheard of around here, this only a third home league defeat since the start of last season.For David Moyes, whose side recovered from the setback of Jake O’Brien’s first-half header being disallowed because an offside Harrison Armstrong was deemed to be interfering with play, this was a major triumph. Up in the stands Thomas Tuchel was surely impressed with James Garner who again excelled in midfield and, from an England perspective, he outshone Ezri Konsa, Ollie Watkins and Morgan Rogers, who on his 100th Villa appearance should have done better with a couple of chances.Newcastle struggle to find cutting edge in drab stalemate with WolvesRead moreJack Grealish, collar up, enjoyed this third appearance at Villa Park since leaving for Manchester City and at full time he embarked on a lap of appreciation, lauding the Holte End and blowing kisses to the Trinity Road Stand before signing autographs at the mouth of the tunnel. “It must have been a tough situation for him to come back here today,” Moyes said, alluding presumably to hislast appearance here with City, when he was involved in a heated exchange with Martínez and security shepherded him down the tunnel.For Villa, this threatened to be a frustrating afternoon from the moment Merlin Röhl clinked a post inside 11 seconds and things went from bad to worse when their captain, John McGinn, was forced off with an injury after 18 minutes. McGinn’s departure seemed to disrupt Villa, already missing another trusty pillar in Boubacar Kamara, who Emery conceded could be out long-term with a knee injury. The former Everton midfielder Amadou Onana, a £50m Villa signing, was absent with a hamstring injury.Villa seemed to quickly run out of ideas and the galling thing was that in Turin, two days after Donyell Malen was permitted to join Roma – a player who operated as a super-sub for much of his time at the club – scored 26 minutes into his Serie A debut, his goal helping to win a game being played almost in parallel to Villa’s disappointing defeat. Villa wasted chances, Rogers spooning over close to the penalty spot on five minutes and Evann Guessand, who replaced McGinn, bumbling his effort when released through one-on-one with Jordan Pickford after reading Youri Tielemans’s typically superb splitting through ball.View image in fullscreenJake O’Brien finds the net for Everton but the goal was ruled out for offside.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersTowards the end of the first half Guessand, to his credit, sent a header against the crossbar from a dainty Tielemans cross, leaping above his marker Vitaliy Mykolenko at the back post. Pickford was beaten. The Everton goalkeeper later pulled off a fine save to keep out a speculative first-time Rogers effort with a little more than 20 minutes of normal time to play. By that point, though, Villa trailed after a catalogue of errors culminated in Barry’s goal.The chain started when Ezri Konsa’s simple pass bounced off Torres’s right leg and into the path of Dwight McNeil, who sent a curling left-foot shot towards goal. Martínez sprawled to his right and looked to have claimed the ball with both hands but instead spilled it, presenting Barry, preferred to Beto, with the chance to nonchalantly dink in.Moyes was delighted with Barry’s “exquisite finish” and heaped praise on Garner. “Jimmy was probably as good as anybody,” the Everton manager said. “I thought he was immense. I don’t think he’s out of place with some of the best players in thePremier Leagueat the moment. I think it was a huge day for two or three players who really stepped up.”Moyes was glad that O’Brien’s disallowed header, at the end of a short‑corner routine, proved a footnote. “We’ve had quite a period where there’s very few decisions gone for us, whether it be getting people sent off, or hitting each other, or pulling hair or something else,” he said, referencing Michael Keane’sred card against Wolvesand Idrissa Gana Gueye’s dismissal for confronting Keane in November. “So there has been an awful lot going against us recently. That was another one today.”Villa required a lift but from where? Guessand was their only naturally forward-thinking player on a bench that also contained two goalkeepers, four defenders and two teenage academy midfielders, with the 18-year-old George Hemmings introduced for his home debut. Everton were also thin on options, again naming only eight substitutes. But, as in a ruthless victory at Nottingham Forest before the turn of the year, a solid defensive display proved the platform for success. When Villa opened the door, Everton seized their opportunity, Barry lifting his clever finish over a desperate Martínez.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Hewas fired on 5 Januaryafter the Browns finished a 5-12 season.New York Giants reportedly closing in on John Harbaugh as next head coachRead moreStefanski replaces Raheem Morris, who was fired alongside general manager Terry Fontenot after an 8-9 campaign in his second season leading the franchise. He will report to newly appointed team president Matt Ryan, who also holds most of the Falcons’ major passing records.“We’re thrilled to land a lead-by-example leader in Kevin Stefanski, who brings a clear vision for his staff, our team and a closely aligned focus on building this team on fundamentals, toughness and active collaboration with every area of the football operation,” Ryan said in a statement.Falcons owner Arthur Blank brought Ryan on as his second-in-command and the leading decision-maker for the franchise.“Coach Stefanski is a team-first leader who puts a premium on accountability for everyone and a player-driven culture,” Ryan said. “His experience in Cleveland and Minnesota has given him a great understanding of the importance of working in sync with scouting, personnel and the rest of the football staff to maximize talent across the roster and in doing everything possible to put our players in the best position to succeed.”Stefanski was named AP Coach of the Year in 2020 after leading the Browns to an 11-5 record, their first playoff appearance since 2002 and their first postseason win since 1994. He was honored again in 2023 when the Browns finished 11-6 and made the playoffs, but those were his only two winning seasons with Cleveland.The coach climbed the ranks in Minnesota for 14 years with the Vikings before being hired by Cleveland in 2020. He overlapped with Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins in 2018 and 2019.“I’m beyond thrilled to be charged with leading this iconic franchise,” Stefanski said. “I am grateful to Mr Blank and Matt Ryan for trusting me to coach this football team and there are many talented players on our roster that I cannot wait to coach. We share a vision for this football team that I believe will make Falcons fans everywhere proud.”Denver one win from Super Bowl after surviving Buffalo in overtime thrillerRead moreStefanski inherits a roster that includes four players who were named All-Pros in 2025. Bijan Robinson was named a first-team running back and second-team all-purpose player. Tight end Kyle Pitts Sr, right guard Chris Lindstrom and safety Jessie Bates III each earned second-team honors.But he also has to weather some uncertainty at quarterback. Shortly after signing Cousins to a four-year, $180m deal in 2024, the Falcons drafted Michael Penix Jr in the first round of theNFLdraft. Cousins lost the starting job after underperforming midway through the 2024 season. Penix finished his rookie season and started the 2025 campaign as the starter before going down with a season-ending knee injury.Cousins stepped in for the last nine games, leading the Falcons to a 5-4 record and four straight wins to close out the season. Penix’s recovery is expected to linger into training camp.Stefanski has experience with quarterback uncertainty. The Browns had rotating quarterbacks throughout most of his tenure after trading former first-overall pick Baker Mayfield and acquiring Deshaun Watson. Joe Flacco, Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders each made starts in 2025.The Falcons also have several other staffing decisions ahead of them, including general manager.“We will get to work immediately putting together a first-class coaching staff and working hard to get to know all the great people that are so important to getting us all where we want to go,” Stefanski said.Explore more on these topicsAtlanta FalconsNFLCleveland BrownsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The bill will still return to the Commons for its report stage and third reading as planned.Withdraw Hillsborough law amendment, urge Liverpool and Manchester mayorsRead moreThe government has performed a series of recent U-turns on controversial policy areas, includingfarmers’ inheritance tax,digital ID cardsandbusiness rates for pubs. A government spokesperson said the decision was intended “to make sure the bill is the strongest it can possibly be, without compromising national security”.The campaign group Hillsborough Law Nowsaid in a post on X: “We welcome the government listening to the campaign, families, MPs and supporters by withdrawing their security services amendment.“We shall engage further with government to ensure the bill fully applies to the security services whilst not jeopardising national security.”The new legislation has been prompted by the campaigning of families bereaved in the 1989 disaster at Sheffield Wednesday’s Hillsborough stadium where 97 people died as a result of a crush at the FA Cup semi-final betweenLiverpooland Nottingham Forest.In the aftermath of the disaster, South Yorkshire police mounted a concerted effort to blame Liverpool supporters, alleging misbehaviour at the match. After a 27-year battle by families to establish the truth, an inquest in 2016 found that the men, women and child wereunlawfully killed due to gross negligence manslaughter by the South Yorkshire police officer in command, and that a catalogue of failings by police and the ambulance services contributed to their deaths. The inquest jury also concluded that no behaviour by football supporters contributed to the disaster.Speaking on Sunday before the amendment was pulled, MPs who opposed it argued that it could do real harm to Labour’s reputation with campaign groups. Ian Byrne, the MP for Liverpool West Derby, said that promises made to those who lost their loved ones at Hillsborough would be broken if the amendment was included, which he described as “untenable and unacceptable”.“Families of people who were killed at Hillsborough went to the Labour party conference and were on the stage with the prime minister,” said Byrne. “Commitments were made to them in person and there was a lot of political capital made out of them. And now that promise to them must be delivered.”Byrne, who was at Hillsborough with his father on the day of the disaster, said that as a survivor he had expected the prime minister to keep his word for the law to be “implemented without being watered down”.The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who was born in Liverpool, called the proposed law with the amendment included “a Hillsborough law, but not the Hillsborough Law”.Labour MPs could rebel over Hillsborough law after talks with families break downRead moreMcDonnell warned of a risk of “almost permanent damage to the Labour party” and added: “We need a few experienced, calm heads to come together and think. We’re now in a situation where we’re hoping the government just pauses tomorrow and doesn’t try to force the bill through, because at the moment it’s looking like a complete car crash.”Paula Barker, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree, said the government’s insistence on the amendment would feel like “the ultimate betrayal” to the people of Liverpool.“Let’s just get it right the first time,” she said. “Let’s stop ripping the party apart because, quite frankly, that’s what’s happening. The frontbench is ripping our party apart.”A government spokesperson said: “This legislation will right the wrongs of the past, changing the balance of power to ensure the state can never hide from the people it should serve and putting a legal duty on officials to respond openly and honestly when things go wrong.“The bill will make the police, intelligence agencies and the whole of government more scrutinised than they have ever been, but we can never compromise on national security.“We will continue to work with all parties to make sure the bill is the strongest it can possibly be, without compromising national security.”Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterLabourLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Villa face Fenerbahce in the Europa League on Thursday, ­hoping to secure their place in the last 16 before a trip to Newcastle.“We are doing a fantastic season,” Emery insisted. “When we played atEverton[in September], we drew and we were worse than now.“Of course, today we lost a very good opportunity and we are in front of other teams who are competing to be in the position we are. We lost the opportunity to be second in the league, something really fantastic. But after feeling our frustration at losing this match, we must try and recover our good, positive way.“Football is to win, to lose, or to draw. When you are losing you are sad, like we are now, when you are winning you are happy but mostly we have had more time happy than sad.”A disappointing afternoon for Villa was underlined by their ­captain, John McGinn, being forced off after 18 ­minutes with a knee injury. Villa entered the game without Boubacar Kamara, who has a knee injury that Emery has said could be long term, and Amadou Onana was also absent because of a hamstring problem.Asked if McGinn’s injury would alter their focus in the transfer market, Emery said: “Onana and [Ross] ­Barkley are coming back in one or two weeks. We have enough players to get the performance we need. Of course we must replace some players who are leaving.“Of course when some players are getting injured it’s not good, but it’s ­football and we have to accept it. It is an opportunity for another player to play.”Explore more on these topicsAston VillaUnai EmeryEvertonnewsShareReuse this content"

There was the potential to go fifth in thePremier Leaguewith a win for the Magpies but instead they toiled on their way to a point.With two-thirds of possession, Newcastle must have expected to come away with more but they possessed neither the creativity nor finishing ability. Wolves were worthy of the draw, which moves them three points away from Derby’s worst tally of 11, a total many home supporters feared at Christmas would not be overcome.Aston Villa’s title hopes hit after Thierno Barry fires resolute Everton to victoryRead moreThe two teams kicked off with confidence growing; Wolves were four unbeaten in all competitions after a traumatic start to the season and Newcastle had won three Premier League games in row. The visitors controlled the game early on, maintaining possession and testing for the gaps in the home defence but, apart from two misdirected headers from the ineffective Nick Woltemade, they lacked an immediate threat.“We needed more in attack,” Eddie Howe said. “I was generally happy with the attitude, the endeavour, the effort from the players I thought was there but the quality was missing. I think in games like that, you’re looking for one moment of individual brilliance that wins us a game or a set play. All the way through, I thought it could come, even to the very last kick, but it wasn’t to be.”Wolves got to enjoy playing in front of a crowd who did not arrive fearful. Rob Edwards has created order with the set-up and they are more difficult to break down while offering danger on the counter. Jackson Tchatchoua used his speed to get down the right but two crosses in quick succession were blocked before any danger could arise.For all the composure Newcastle showed when building attacks, they lacked a spark in the final third. Too much ponderous football on the edge of the Wolves box made it easy for the home back five to defend. Space was at a premium but Newcastle did not know how to create more. Crosses came and went but Newcastle failed to test José Sá in the first half.A key component of Wolves’s mini‑resurgence has been the teenager Mateus Mané, who had the first shot on target with a clever volley when his back was to goal. He is the only player who brings the energy in midfield alongside the diligence of André and João Gomes.Mané was allowed to drift on to the left wing to put pressure on Kieran Trippier, who was playing his third game back after a two-month injury layoff, but the defender stayed strong at the cost of a cut to the head, caused inadvertently by the Wolves teenager’s boot.Despite the forlorn nature of Woltemade’s performance, it was Wolves who moved to change a striker first. Tolu Arokodare, after 65 minutes or so of graft, was withdrawn for Jørgen Strand Larsen.View image in fullscreenMateus Mané brought energy to the Wolves midfield.Photograph: Brett Patzke/WWFC/Wolves/Getty ImagesFresh from a hat-trick in the FA Cup thrashing of Shrewsbury, the Norwegian must have been eager to show he can do it in the Premier League, especially against a team that were contemplating spending £60m on him in the summer, but there will be no attacking reinforcements for Newcastle this month. “I don’t think we’ve got the financial ability to do that,” Howe said.Newcastle continued to dominate, eventually sending on Yoane Wissa for Woltemade as part of a triple substitution to liven things up. Most of Newcastle’s plan centred around corner kicks but the delivery was not up to scratch, especially against a side with plenty of height and something different was required after 70 minutes without a shot on target. A Trippier free-kick from 30 yards rippled the outside of the net to continue the blunt theme.Wolves’s own attacking credentials were diminishing, unable to counter in the way that irritated the Newcastle defence before the break. The marauding Yerson Mosquera enjoyed breaking forward from right centre-back to keep lifting the crowd but a chance for a Wolves winner never arrived.Sá finally proved his alertness in the 85th minute to save from Bruno Guimarães and Joelinton but had they beaten the goalkeeper the victory would have been fortunate.A month ago Wolves may have folded but they showed how far they have come, while Newcastle proved how far they need to go to be Champions League contenders.“I think [with] the quality of the team that we’re up against, the quality of the players that they’ve got, it was a really solid, spirited performance,” Edwards said. “It’s another step forward. It’s a clean sheet against the top team. It’s a couple of clean sheets in a row in the league. We look more resilient. I think there’s more belief there. That’s hard to turn around from the position that we were in.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He has been involved in the club’s transfer plans for this month having brought in Brennan Johnson from Tottenham, and Palace expect him to turn things around after a run of 10 games without a win in all competitions.Glasner’s disenchantment with the club’s inactivity in the transfer market since their FA Cup win was brought to a head by the impending sale of Guéhi to City. The England defender missed the trip to the Stadium of Light as a result but was understood to be completing his medical in Manchester on Sunday ahead of his £20m move to join Pep Guardiola’s side.Glasnerrevealed before the Sunderland gamethat he would be leaving at the end of his contract in the summer – an announcement that is believed to have caught Parish by surprise. But it was his claim that “we feel that we’re being abandoned” when told Guéhi would not be part of his squad at 10.30am on Friday morning that angered the hierarchy at Selhurst Park.“Your heart gets torn out twice in a season, one day before a game,” Glasner said as he also referenced Eberechi Eze’s club-record sale to Arsenal in August. It’s tough to survive. That’s how it feels right now. We feel that we’re being abandoned. There’s no support. “Everybody’s disappointed. We’ve been playing with 12 to 13 players for weeks now. On the bench I had just kids.”View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi was completing his move to Manchester City so did not play for Crystal Palace at Sunderland.Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty ImagesIt is understood that Palace feel they have acted in the club’s best interest by accepting the offer for Guéhi, given he was out of contract in the summer and would have been able to leave for free. Glasner had threatened to resign on the last day of the summer transfer window, when it seemed Guéhi was going to move to Liverpool with no time for Palace to sign a replacement for their captain.Asked whether he needed more support from the board after the Sunderland game, Glasner said: “I don’t need any support.Crystal Palaceneeds it. Crystal Palace are fine to end the season like this – with Oliver Glasner, with another manager, I don’t know, I don’t care. They are fine with this. OK, they can do it if they want to play a more successful season. For me, it feels like we just wait until all the players are back. It will be OK, 42 points at the end, it’s all good, it’s fine. It doesn’t matter how we are acting. It’s just my feeling.”Juventus are expected to return with a new offer for Jean-Philippe Mateta in the coming days, although they want the France striker on a loan deal that would include an obligation to make the move permanent at the end of the season. Mateta has fewer than 18 months left on his contract at Selhurst Park and is keen on joining the Serie A side.It is understood that Palace, who are still in talks with Angers over a move for the 19-year-old forward Sidiki Cherif, floated the idea of including Jonathan David in the deal but Juventus want to keep the Canada striker and he has no interest in moving to south London after arriving in Serie A from Lille last summer.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

Butt added: “Haaland would pick Martínez up and run with him. You know when you see a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler.”Responding after the derby to Scholes’s comments, Martínez said: “No, honestly, he can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don’t care.“And I think for me, I respect the relations [former players] when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television, but when you see here face to face, no one says anything in your face. So for me, I don’t really care what they say. I just put the focus on my performance, the performance of the team and I give everything to this club until my last day. It doesn’t give me anything. My motivation is my family. That’s it.”Scholes later replied on Instagram, saying: “Someone’s had a good game, was really happy for you … Tea, no sugar pls.”The win moved United up to fifth, one point behind Liverpool in fourth and Martínez highlighted how the relentless backing from supporters had helped. “I feel amazing,” he said. “I think we deserve to win this game.“We were better on the pitch and I think we gave everything today. And when you give everything and you see the result, it’s an amazing feeling and I’m so happy. It’s about the connection [with the fans], it’s about how we represent them on the pitch.View image in fullscreenNicky Butt (right) and Paul Scholes ridiculed Lisandro Martínez’s height before the Manchester derby.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA“If they see us fighting like today, they will be with us.“But if sometimes our performance wasn’t the best because they expect from us good attitude, tackles, the DNA, the blood ofManchester United. And I can really understand because sometimes it’s like: ‘What are we doing here?’ And today, that is the standard for this club.”While Scholes or Butt are not thought to have been at the derby, both attended the FA Cup defeat against Brighton at Old Trafford last Sunday. United beat City with second‑half goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu in Michael Carrick’s first game as the interim head coach.Martínez said the 44-year-old was a contrast to Ruben Amorim, who was sacked two weeks ago. “So different, so different,” he said. “Different mentality, different guy. He knows what this club really means. He sent us that message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything. He is a big legend. He wants to help the club and I think we were in a tough situation and today was the best moment to change that.”In 12 years at United, from 2006, Carrick claimed every major honour including five league titles and the Champions League. Of their first training session on Wednesday, Martínez said: “He was quiet. He was smiling. He was really confident. And that helps a lot. When you have a coach like Michael Carrick, who really knows, who really can share with you the energy of the club and what it means, it’s so different.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedPaul ScholesnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m glad he’s managed to give me one for a change.”Higgins beat thereigning world champion, Zhao Xintong,and the current world No 1, Judd Trump, both in final frame deciders, to reach the final but the Scot said he was well below his best on Sunday. “I was just useless,” he said. “Take no credit away, Kyren was by far the better player. He was totally dominant – it wasn’t even a 10-6 match.”Higgins went 1-0 up with a break of 58 but despite establishing a 63-point lead in the second frame, he missed three simple pots and Wilson cleared up to level.Wilson found some momentum to go 3-1 up and although Higgins used all of his experience to take the next two frames, back-to-back century breaks from the Englishman gave him a 5-3 lead heading into the evening.A break of 71 narrowed the gap but Higgins’s attempt at a risky double backfired as Wilson mopped up to restore his two-frame advantage.View image in fullscreenKyren Wilson broke his cue at the start of the campaign and said he was ‘very lost’ after an early exit at the UK Championship.Photograph: John Walton/PAWilson was far from fluent but he was able to pull away with Higgins unable to capitalise on his opponents’ errors. A 78-break – Wilson’s only 50-plus break of the night – put him 9-5 ahead and although Higgins refused to go down without a fight, the 34-year-old got over the line.Wilson broke his cue at the start of the campaign and admitted he was “very lost” and “very close to … a mental breakdown” during his last-32 defeat by Elliot Slessor at the UK Championship last month.“I thought at the UK, ‘I’m gone’, I honestly didn’t know if I was ever going to be back in the winner’s enclosure,” the2024 world championsaid.Explore more on these topicsSnookerJohn HigginsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Catalan side, who hit the woodwork four times and had two goals disallowed, now lead their rivals Real Madrid by only a point at the top of La Liga after Álvaro Arbeloa’s side beat Levante on Saturday.Sociedad, now unbeaten in four games under their new American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo, had Carlos Soler sent off late on but managed to hold on.In a frantic start to a compelling game at the rainy Reale Arena both teams had goals ruled out. The hosts had the ball in the net inside 30 seconds when Mikel Oyarzabal headed home a Gonçalo Guedes cross, but had strayed offside. At the other end Barcelona’s Fermín López drilled home from range but Dani Olmo had committed a foul in the buildup and it was ruled out.Lamine Yamal also found the net but the goal was ruled out for an extremely tight offside, before Real Sociedad took the lead against the run of play when Oyarzabal lashed in a Guedes cross with a blistering volley inside Joan García’s near post.Lamine Yamal was felled just inside the area before half-time but although the referee pointed to the spot, a VAR review showed the teenager was offside again and it was cancelled.Barcelona turned up the pressure in the second half and Real Sociedad were left depending on their goalkeeper Álex Remiro and the frame of the goal to keep the Catalan side at bay. Olmo crashed a shot against the post from López’s cross and then Remiro denied the Barça midfielder with a fine near-post save. Remiro then tipped substitute Robert Lewandowski’s header against the crossbar with the save of the night.Another Barça substitute, Marcus Rashford, eventually pulled the champions level, heading home Lamine Yamal’s cross after 70 minutes. However the hosts immediately regained their advantage, with the Barça goalkeeper García erring as he saved Soler’s shot. The midfielder was able to gather the rebound and cross for Guedes, who fired in Sociedad’s winner.Alexander Sørloth’s towering header secured a narrow 1-0 victory forAtléticoMadridagainstAlavésto maintain their distant pursuit of the leaders, Barcelona. Diego Simeone’s side stay fourth with 41 points, level with Villarreal, who sit third with a game in hand, after their 2-0 loss to Real Betis on Saturday.In what was a largely uninspiring affair at the Metropolitano, Atlético dominated possession but struggled to find penetration against a disciplined and compact Alavés defence. The first half, marked by its ill-tempered nature, featured fouls aplenty and few moments of quality. The home side’s best chance came in stoppage time before the break when Thiago Almada’s shot from close range was blocked on the goalline by Víctor Parada.The winner arrived three minutes into the second half as Pablo Barrios whipped in a precise cross from the right wing, allowing Sørloth to rise above the defence and head the ball into the net off the post. The Norwegian’s goal proved decisive in a match that offered little else in excitement other than an Álex Baena curling strike from just inside the box in the 70th minute that ricocheted off the right post.In Italy, Niclas Füllkrug keptMilanin touch with theSerie Aleaders, Inter, with the only goal in a 1-0 win against Lecce, his first for the club since joining on loan from West Ham.The 32-year-old glanced in Alexis Saelemaekers’s hooked cross in the 76th minute, finally breaking the deadlock after being frustrated byLeccewho drop into the relegation zone on goal difference.Wladimiro Falcone was excellent in the Lecce goal, denying Samuel Ricci and Christian Pulisic with two phenomenal saves, but he could do nothing to stop Füllkrug.View image in fullscreenNiclas Füllkrug’s header beats Wladimiro Falcone in the Lecce goal to secure three points for Milan.Photograph: Claudio Villa/AC Milan/Getty ImagesPaulo Dybala starred forRomawith a goal and an assist in a 2-0 win atTorino,which boosted his team’s Champions League hopes.Dybala laid on Donyell Malen, who signed on loan from Aston Villa on Friday, for a classy close-range finish midway through the first half before ensuring a third straight win for fourth-placedRomain the 72nd minute. The Argentina international’s brilliantly guided finish from Devyne Rensch’s cross was his first goal in nearly three months and helped put Roma on 42 points.The 32-year-old was excellent coming in from the left in a win that was revenge for elimination from the Coppa Italia by Torino on Tuesday, and moved Roma three points ahead of fifth-placed Juventus in the battle for Champions League football.Without a win until just before Christmas,FiorentinabeatBologna2-0 to record a deserved third victory in six matches thanks to goals in the first half from Rolando Mandragora and Roberto Piccoli.The three points could prove crucial in the Serie A relegation battle and were a fine way to pay tribute to the American media mogul Rocco Commisso, who died on Saturday at the age of 76 and was remembered with a minute’s silence before kick-off.During pre-match preparations, Fiorentina players wore T-shirts with a picture of Commisso and the message “Thanks Rocco”, in tribute to a man who just missed out on giving the Tuscan club a first major trophy since 2001.He also invested in a new €120m training centre and redevelopment of the Stadio Artemio Franchi in Florence, works which are still ongoing ahead of Fiorentina’s centenary next season.In Germany,Eintracht Frankfurthave fired their head coach, Dino Toppmöller, after a string of bad games and poor defending, the club said on Sunday.The decision was based on analysis of the team’s performance over the past few weeks, including the first three games of 2026, the club said in a statement. Germany’s Bild newspaper said a crisis meeting had been held on Saturday to discuss Toppmöller’s future, the day after Eintracht’s 3-3Bundesligadraw against struggling Werder Bremen.“It’s always the same. We didn’t perform well from start to finish,” the sporting director, Markus Krösche, was quoted as saying. “We can’t go on like this.”View image in fullscreenDino Toppmöller watches on during the draw against Werder Bremen.Photograph: Action Press/ShutterstockToppmöller’s contract was extended last year until mid-2028. The 45-year-old took over as head coach in 2023. “I would have loved to continue working with this team and continue to face the challenges that lie ahead. But I accept the decision,” Toppmöller said in the statement from the club.VfB Stuttgartconceded an 83rd-minute equaliser to settle for a 1-1 draw at home toUnion Berlinand miss their chance to move into the top three. Sebastian Hoeness’s team thought they were cruising to their fourth win in the last five league games when Chris Fuehrich put them in the lead in the 59th minute but Union struck seven minutes from time through the substitute Jeong Woo-yeong to snatch a point.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballLa LigaBarcelonaReal SociedadAtlético MadridAlavesSerie AnewsShareReuse this content"

Following a few phases of forward play the Glasgow backs then worked it through the hands for Smith to dot down.Saracens, though, struck back quickly after Glasgow were pinged for going offside and Farrell made a straightforward kick. Horne looked to extend Glasgow’s advantage with a clever kick and chase down the short side of the scrum before being tackled close to the line by Max Malins. Saracens’ Juan Martín González was adjudged to have slapped the ball away in the resultant play and was shown a yellow card.Tempers then frayed in the dead-ball area between both sets of players after Saracens had successfully repelled the Glasgow maul to win the put-in. But the home side were well in the ascendancy by this point and scored two tries in as many minutes to underline their superiority.Horne was the creator of the first, his neat pass picking out Steyn who had ran the perfect diagonal line off his wing to score under the posts. The next try – Glasgow’s third – was set up by a rampaging carry from Jack Dempsey who then released Horne to score.The home side were temporarily reduced to 14 men at the start of the second half when Kyle Rowe was shown a yellow card after being adjudged to have come in too high on Rotimi Segun as he and Steyn combined to bundle the winger into touch.The home team finished on top and Steyn was stopped just short of the line, with Saracens’ Noah Caluori shown a yellow card in the aftermath. Glasgow, though, would not be denied and the maul drove over Stephen with the clock in the red.Meanwhile, Marcus Smith’s late penalty securedHarlequinsa surprise 27-17 victory away to two-time winnersLa Rochelleand a top-two finish in Pool 3, while the French side were eliminated.View image in fullscreenMarcus Smith helped edge Harlequins to victory in France.Photograph: Lionel Hahn/ShutterstockLa Rochelle needed only a losing bonus point to book their place in the last 16 at fellow two-time winners Leicester’s expense but were undone by a late Quins flourish.Quick GuideChampions Cup last-16 tiesShowBordeaux Bègles v LeicesterGlasgow v BullsLeinster v EdinburghBath v SaracensNorthampton v CastresHarlequins v SaleToulon v StormersToulouse v Bristol(Ties to be played on 3-5 April)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“The club and myself lost big tonight, it’s unacceptable,” said the La Rochelle head coach, Ronan O’Gara, a two-timeChampions Cupwinner with Munster as a fly-half. “It’s especially unacceptable when you see the number of opportunities we had to stay in the competition.

It was the fourth kickoff return for a touchdown to open a playoff game since 2000 and the longest postseason kick return in franchise history.Darnold, who had been listed as questionable because of an oblique injury, guided the Seahawks on two more scoring drives before San Francisco got on the board with the first of its two field goals.After he flopped in his playoff debut last season with the Minnesota Vikings by taking nine sacks in a 27-9 loss to the Los Angeles Rams, Darnold completed 12 of 17 passes for 124 yards and connected with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a touchdown in the star receiver’s playoff debut.The 49ers (13-6) were never competitive in the second-most lopsided playoff loss in franchise history. San Francisco lost 49-3 to the New York Giants in the divisional round in the 1986 season.The Niners were missing three injured All-Pros: tight end George Kittle, linebacker Fred Warner and defensive end Nick Bosa.San Francisco’s Brock Purdy completed 15 of 27 passes for 140 yards with an interception and a lost fumble against the Seahawks’ “Dark Side” defense. Seattle also recovered a fumble by tight end Jake Tonges.“They’re unbelievable. They’ve stepped up every single game for us,” Darnold said. “Can’t say enough great things about that defense. It was tough in training camp and OTAs going up against them. But I’m glad they’re on our side.”Walker’s three rushing touchdowns tied him with Shaun Alexander for the most in a playoff game in franchise history.Explore more on these topicsNFLSeattle SeahawksSan Francisco 49ersUS sportsWest CoastShareReuse this content"

McMillian wrested the ball away from Brandin Cooks at the Broncos 20-yard line when a field goal would have won the game for Buffalo.Broncos quarterback Bo Nix out for season with broken ankle in playoff winRead moreThe Broncos (15-3) will face either New England or Houston for the AFC title next Sunday at Empower Field at Mile High, where top-seeded Denver have won 14 of their past 15 games.“We played a really good football team,” Nix said. “They played really well tonight. They gave us a great shot on a short week after a tough game last week, so hat’s off to them. We found a way to win again and our defense made stops and I’m just proud of our guys. I’m just proud of this organization. I’m proud of the way we compete, we fight.“We’re just never out of it and I think that’s just the character piece. It wasn’t always pretty, we had a good lead and they came back and it wasn’t looking good, but the fourth quarter and overtime, we just found a way to win.”Broncos coach Sean Payton lamented Denver’s sputtering offense and 1-for-4 performance in the red zone: “We weren’t good in the red zone. But we were good enough when it mattered.”The Bills (13-6) were flagged for pass interference twice on Denver’s final drive.Former Broncos kicker Matt Prater nailed a 50-yard field goal with five seconds left in regulation, knotting it up at 30-all. That came after Nix’s 26-yard touchdown throw to Marvin Mims Jr with 55 seconds left had given Denver a 30-27 lead.View image in fullscreenDenver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix celebrates after a touchdown during the second half of Saturday’s game.Photograph: Justin Edmonds/Getty ImagesAllen, who hadn’t turned the ball over in his previous six playoff appearances, threw two interceptions and lost two fumbles. PJ Locke also picked off Allen.“Extremely difficult,” a teary-eyed Allen said afterward. “I felt like I let my teammates down.”The Bills failed once again to reach the Super Bowl with Allen under center even though Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson weren’t standing in his way this time as that trio of franchise quarterbacks all missed the postseason party.Payton insisted the game should have ended earlier in overtime when a Denver defender was held in the end zone before Allen escaped from the end zone on second-and-9 from his 8.Coming off the first road playoff win of his career, Allen’s first three turnovers helped Denver built a 23-10 lead before he threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Keon Coleman and a 14-yarder to Dalton Kincaid to give Buffalo a 24-23 lead early in the fourth quarter.Allen also fumbled the ball at the Denver 23 late in the fourth quarter but right tackle Spencer Brown recovered the loose ball, setting up Prater’s 31-yarder for a 27-23 Buffalo lead.Also in the second half, Allen threw an interception when Locke cut in front of wide receiver Curtis Samuel, who appeared to be wide open for what would have been a 43-yard touchdown.View image in fullscreenA tearful Josh Allen responds to questions during a news conference after Saturday’s game.Photograph: RJ Sangosti/APThe Broncos scored 10 points in the final 22 seconds of the first half to take a 20-10 lead into the locker room, and they got their third takeaway just two plays into the second half on Bonitto’s strip-sack of Allen that was recovered by Malcolm Roach at the Bills 17, leading to Lutz’s short field goal to make it 23-10.Nix’s 29-yard TD pass to Lil’Jordan Humphrey broke a 10-all tie and then Bonitto stripped Allen of the ball after a long scramble up the middle. Devon Key recovered for Denver with two seconds left before halftime and Lutz’s 50-yarder as the half expired made it 20-10.The Broncos’ other touchdown in the first half came from an unlikely source. They went ahead 10-7 when Nix threw to tackle-eligible Frank Crum, a second-year pro from Wyoming, Allen’s alma mater. He caught the short pass and tumbled into the end zone for a 7-yard score.James Cook ran for 117 yards on 24 carries but lost a fumble.When the Broncos lost to the Bills 31-7 in Buffalo last playoffs, Payton said, “We have to figure out how to get these games at home.”They did it by leading the league in sacks (68), tying a franchise record with 14 regular-season victories, winning 11 one-score games and having 11 comebacks.“We weren’t ready last year,” Payton said. “But we were ready today.”Explore more on these topicsNFLDenver BroncosBuffalo BillsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

That DNS block in Malaysia is pretty lightweight – easy to bypass with a VPN or DNS tweak,” Grok’s account onXsaid in response to a question from a user.Grok’s ability to allow users to create sexually explicit images, including images of children, has created a global outcry over recent weeks, with regulators and politicians around the world launching investigations.Indonesia and Malaysiabecame the first two countries to announce blocks on the technology, with Malaysia’s regulatory body saying last Sunday it had “directed a temporary restriction” on access to Grok, effective as of 11 January 2026. Officials in the Philippines have said they too plan to ban the technology.Blocking access to Grok is not straightforward, however. The technology not only exists across multiple platforms, including a standalone app and website, but is also integrated across X, which, along with Grok, is owned by Elon Musk’s xAI.View image in fullscreenThe protest group Everyone Hates Elon advertises a boycott of X in London.Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/ReutersOver the past week, X users, and even Grok itself, have advised people on how to bypass restrictions. This includes using a VPN – many of which are available for free – or changing domain name system (DNS), the protocol on the internet that turns address names into IP addresses that load websites.When the Guardian tried to use Grok inIndonesia, its website was working even without a VPN, though the Grok app did not work. Grok was also still responding to Indonesian accounts on X, where it functions as an integrated chatbot. X has not been subject to a ban.Even if governments could completely restrict Grok, though, this is not a real solution, said Nana Nwachukwu, an AI governance expert and PhD researcher at Trinity College Dublin.“Blocking Grok is like slapping a Band-Aid on a weeping wound that you haven’t cleaned,” she said. “You block Grok, and then you go around shouting you’ve done something. Meanwhile, people can use VPNs to access the same platforms.” Or, they could simply turn to one of the many other platforms that offer the same functions, including “smaller, general purpose AI systems that are largely unknown”, Nwachukwu added.Governments should instead focus on law enforcement and investigating individuals who use such tools to break the law, she added. “Platforms are required by law to provide information to law enforcement when a crime has been committed,” Nwachukwu said. “If we see people being arrested, people being tried in courts, people being jailed for these offences, that’s a sign that this is a real crime.”X should build accountability into its platform – and clean itself up, said Nwachukwu: “All of those offending images should be removed from the platform.”Tech companies’ access to UK ministers dwarfs that of child safety groupsRead moreOn Wednesday, X announcedadditional safeguardsin response to continued public anger, saying it would stop the @Grok account on X from “allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis”, including paid subscribers. However,the Guardian foundthat it was possible to get around such restrictions by using the standalone version of Grok, easily accessible through a web browser, to create short videos in which clothes are removed from images of real women.This could then be posted to X’s public platform, where it could be viewed by users around the world within seconds.Musk’s company also said that, in jurisdictions where such content is illegal, it will geoblock the ability of all users in those locations to generate images of real people in bikinis, or similar attire, in Grok on X, adding that “xAI is implementing similar geoblocking measures for the Grok app”.Experts warn users may still be able to get around such “geoblocks” through a VPN. It is also not clear in which countries such restrictions will be implemented.In Malaysia, the communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, has said restrictions on Grok would only be lifted once the ability to produce harmful content had been disabled, according to local media reports.Dr Nuurrianti Jalli, a visiting fellow at the media, technology and society programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the threat of blocking Grok could be a useful way to apply pressure to companies to respond quickly, adding that it “shifts the debate from ‘individual bad actors’ to questions of platform responsibility, safety by design, and accountability when safeguards fail”. It could also “slow the spread of abuse, reduce casual misuse and create a clear boundary around what authorities consider unacceptable”, she said.In Indonesia, Grok has been used to create nonconsensual sexualised images of singers and celebrities, including one of the country’s most popular girl groups, JKT48, while in Malaysia, women report similar abuses, including cases where the tool has been used to remove their hijabs, according to Malaysian media.Some women resorted to publicly telling Grok on X that they do not authorise it to “crawl, take, process or edit” any of their photos.Jalli said governments should push for greater transparency “about how safety measures are implemented, how abuse reports are handled and what enforcement steps are taken when harmful content is generated or circulated”.The Malaysian communications and multimedia commission and the ministry of communications did not respond to a request for comment. Indonesia’s ministry of communication and digital affairs also did not respond.Nwachukwu said safeguards should be built into the AI system, rather than “gates” built around it. “Both the [geographic] restriction from X, [and] the restriction from the government is gated access, and gates can be broken down,” she said.Additional reporting by HidayatullahExplore more on these topicsGrok AIXAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingInternetElon MuskMalaysiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maybe the UKgovernment in its new consultations on road safetyshould add the question of hiding speed cameras to their list of concerns. I’m a driver, but also a pedestrian and cyclist and get fed up with seeing cars zooming down local roads at way more than 20 or 30mph. There are flashing lights that tell drivers what speed they’re doing, but there’s no penalty for going over at those points.Amy, CornwallSend new questions tonq@theguardian.com.Readers replyIt’s high time the government put its foot down.EddieChorepostNo. People slow down when they see one.EGriffI’ve an idea – why don’t the authorities dig lots of holes in the road to encourage drivers to slow down (the encouragement being avoidance of severe and expensive damage to tyres, wheels and suspension). We could call them “potholes”. Oh – hang on …DocLobster1960Speeding is antisocial behaviour, so why not make the people who do it pay into the coffers for the good of society?I don’t care whether cameras are hidden or not, people should just abide by the speed limits. It’s not as if speed limits are designed as a punishment.GoldgreenI got a speeding ticket in Wales on my first visit there after they introduced a 20mph limit, I opted to take the speed awareness course and found it to be invaluable. I suggest that all learner drivers take this course as you learn so much. I’ve been driving for 35 years and some of the things I learned have stuck with me today. It would be good if we were made aware before we started driving. I actually enjoyed the course.lozbagsOf course there should be no warnings about fixed speed cameras. Mind you, this gives local residents an advantage.Tony Firshman, by emailThe issue of whether speed cameras should be visible was decided by the Blair government (and the then transport minister John Spellar). Speeding motorists avoided them and continued speeding afterwards. This resulted in “crash migration”.Road safetyhas always been the Cinderella issue of policy and sadly, will continue to be, due to the moral bankruptcy of our politicians.Howard Bramwell, by emailNo, cameras are there to slow drivers at dangerous places. However, the camera technology must be so cheap now that every (30mph) sign could have a camera behind it. I really struggle to do 20, though, because I have a muscle memory for driving in villages at 25-30mph.James M Bartlett, by emailI don’t think there is clear evidence of what is more efficient in bringing accidents down, as the approach varies between countries. In Germany, speed cameras are usually hidden, behind bends or road signs. Mobile cameras are common. Sometimes, you have road signs warning of cameras (“Radar”), but they are usually quite a bit before the cameras.Mustbe6to20Speed cameras don’t need to be hidden. They need to be ubiquitous. The want to be in every cat’s-eye in the country and round every bush and corner. Just get them in, save the lives instead of regretting them and force people to slow down.Really start the war on the motorist, and while you’re at it, make pedestrian crossing lights change immediately when someone presses the button. That’ll be the real signal for the war to begin.Andrew Riley, by emailVisible. There’s a stretch of A road in north Norfolk which had two speed cameras. One has been removed – people still brake as they approach it. Visible still works best, even when it’s no longer visible.RosiesDadIt has always struck me that the use of average speed cameras (as opposed to so-called “safety cameras”) is much more effective at keeping vehicle speeds down to the speed limit. These use automatic numberplate recognition (ANPR) to check the time between cameras, so virtually all drivers stay at the speed limit but then speed up after passing the last camera (presumably to make up for the time they think they have lost while sticking to the speed limit). As ANPR spreads more widely (so we can catch the bad guys up to no good), it can’t be beyond the technology to use their data to better effect by catching speeders too.shropshirelassoNo need to hide them, they are meant to stand out, so if you are going too fast you can still slow down, but if you are going at a ridiculous speed that you don’t notice them, you then have no complaints. Like shooting fish in a barrel. Yes, there are some sneaky ones, but they are not necessary imho. Idiots end up getting caught out anyway.DamianleahI am all in favour of overt and covert ones. I am also all in favour of the police using roadside/bridge cameras to catch speeders. Further, I would welcome a tripling or more of the fines and points received, along with all drivers having to undertake a speed awareness course every five years in order to keep your licence – and don’t forget, holding a licence is a privilege and not a right.Iama driver who does far too many miles each year, and I have probably driven for more than 800,000 miles, and I have not been caught speeding. Oh, I’m not going to say I am some sort of saint, and I know I have exceeded the limit on many occasions, but if I had been caught, I would have deserved the penalty.SallycyclesSome people btl are claiming that hidden cameras wouldn’t work as a deterrent. But they would once you’ve been caught, fined and accumulated a few points. Insurance goes up and the risk of losing one’s licence should focus the mind pretty quickly. I’m sick of being tailgated when driving at the speed limit.DropinjimSigns that tell you the speed you are doing (or a smiling face if you are doing the speed limit) are far more effective and for a greater distance afterwards at slowing people down than speed cameras. Having said that, average speed cameras seem to be a good direction to go, obviously better on long singular roads than towns with lots of roads leaving and joining, although it could still work.duncandavisWouldn’t a visible deterrent be better than letting people speed or get into an accident and have to deal with the aftermath?PatriiickYes, especially in school zones. A 2025 study in New York City showed that speed cameras reduced injuries by 16%, and collisions by 30%. Even better, Toronto Metropolitan University found that speed cameras reduced “the number of speeding vehicles by 45% in urban school zones”.RP Orlando, by emailI have a, perhaps controversial, take on this. Hide the speed cameras, but don’t issue any fines to those who breach the limit. Just points on the licence. This would take away the argument from many that speed cameras are a cash cow and not a safety feature.Niels, by emailIf you want to generate revenue, hide the cameras. If you want people to slow down, make them highly visible. I know very few people who haven’t been caught by a speed trap. I was going to go back to where my so-called offence took place but decided to take the cheap way out, a £100 speed awareness course that taught me nothing. I do know it was a dual carriageway with a barrier to stop pedestrians crossing the road – and a speed limit that dropped from 40 to 30 with no discernible reason. They have these cameras in Italy. They are the size of a wheelie bin and are bright orange. Guess what – no one speeds past them. The police also have radar guns but where it is important that people don’t speed, pedestrian crossings etc, the cameras do a perfect job.iptravellerIn Surrey, where I learned to drive, cameras were hidden, painted grey. When I started driving farther afield, I was amazed that anyone in the counties which had already adopted yellow painted cameras was ever caught speeding. They were so visible compared to the ones we had in Surrey. Now there are the warnings on GPS and satnavs. No excuses.WordChazerOften local authorities only put cameras at high accident sites. Average speed checks are located to stop street cruising, with limited effect. Previously I was a transport planner and had geographic information system access to all the locations and police metadata on the Stats19 forms. It is sobering to overlay all the slight, serious and fatal accidents, for all years. There is no discernible pattern – distribution of data points is everywhere. Zero accidents should be the aim. Not difficult to black box all new cars and stop speeding.As a pedestrian, cyclist and driver I agree. I honestly believe drivers for their licence should walk down a dark country lane, cycle down an A road, deal with stupidly bright headlights. Driving is seen as a right but it’s not it’s a privilege.funkymentalistSpeed limit signs should be clearly visible, close enough together, and not faded, nor obscured by vegetation. They should not be contradictory, as they sometimes are when temporary signs are reached before permanent signs. When that has been achieved, speed cameras should be hidden.FromageBleuCould just make cars unable to exceed speed limit. Very easy to do. Or fit them all with black boxes.SeamusheaneyisbrownFrom July 2024 all new cars sold in the EU [and Northern Ireland] are required to have speed limiters.WantageNo. I don’t think speed cameras should be hidden. That does not deter people speeding, it just gives them a ticket. The whole point is to slow people down.Another aspect of road safety that bugs me a great deal is tailgating. This is a very serious offence in Florida. (I don’t know about the rest of the US.) It is up there with drink-driving, and in my opinion it should be because it is very dangerous, and causes some of the worst accidents on motorways.Hopefully with AI, they can invent a camera which picks out vehicles tailgating. And I wish the police would give that issue as much attention as speeding, at least on motorways.AndyPandy1968If [drivers] don’t know where speed cameras are (and there could be one anywhere) they’ll slow down. Currently they speed until they see a highly visible camera.TenaroGView image in fullscreen‘Simply putting up a sign does not make people slow down.’Photograph: David Pardoe/Getty ImagesIt is better to drive for the current road conditions, not the speed limit. Speed limit signs encourage drivers to drive at that speed and cannot react to it raining or being icy – or react to rare events, like someone turning right into a seldom used road (I would argue a no-right turn sign would be better than dropping the speed limit to 50 or 40mph).Most times when you moderately exceed the speed limit, nothing happens; it is unlikely to cause an accident, unless there is a speed trap which causes sudden braking. However, it remains true that the energy of a crash is proportional to the square of the speed. There is more than double the energy crashing at 30mph over 20mph (50% speed increase).There is no point driving at 30mph on a housing estate, a half a mile at 30mph takes 1 minute, at 20 takes 1.5 minutes. You just get to the next queue 30 seconds sooner. The average speed in London due to congestion is 7 to 20mph.On a dual carriageway, the capacity (vehicles per hour) can be increased by reducing the speed: peak capacity 20mph for cars and 30mph for buses and lorries.Rob333No. I see one, I slow down. I mean, ahem, I maintain that safe speed I was already doing, obviously! You could hide them and potentially make more revenue but that grapevine is waaaay bigger than anything Marvin sang about. Word spreads so quickly that people, at least locals, would know all about the secret cameras quicker than Shaw Taylor could say keep ’em peeled.catchytitleHow do speed cameras work?Read moreI was once cautioned for signalling to drivers that a speed camera was coming up.I thought, what’s your problem? Speed cameras are about improving road safety and I’m getting all the cars to slow down. They should have given me a medal and a gold clock, not a caution.CharismataEh? They are meant to make the roads safer. Which they don’t do if you don’t know they are there. Simply putting up a sign does not make people slow down, we know this from repeat experience. Practically, it would also be daft to hide them as you would need so many signs, eg to notify that cameras are present, then to notify that cameras are not. I’m very suspicious of the mentality that thinks they should be hidden to “catch people out”. It’s the same mentality that insists on prison for non-dangerous offences and, at its most extreme, capital punishment. Both things confer only brutality upon society and the resultant pressure on social and health services while probably not reducing crime. Believers of demonstrably ineffective punitive systems are a true menace, preferring we all suffer under such systems so they can get a sense of “vengeance”. This to me is more sociopathic than many of the criminals and certainly more so than most speeding drivers.WyrdsisterSpeed cameras are very expensive to install, maintain and operate, which is why they are only placed where deaths have occurred. If visible, then most drivers slow down at them proving that they work as intended, while drivers ignoring them correctly get fined. This is why you see many other physical methods for restricting speeds such as humps, tables, cushions and chicanes. Any road without cameras or physical controls will always see drivers that speed.swelyThousands of speeding fines could be cancelled after ‘technical issue’Read moreWith an electric car there is so little feedback that I always use the speed limiter. It doesn’t require many people doing this to bring everybody into line, literally! I’ve worked in the auto industry and had to look at overall safety issues. The statistics are as clear as they are for smoking when it comes to speeding – just don’t do it.ForlornehopeYes to secret cameras to reduce speeding but why stop there? Why not also introduce secret number plate recognition cameras to tackle the industrial-scale dumping of household goods all over our pavements?Britain’s cities, especially working-class communities, are being turned into public dumps where illegal fly-tipping by the middle-class and small businesses is out of control. If your vehicle is used for illegal public dumping, you should have your driving licence revoked for 12 months and then be forced to resit your driving test. Let’s take back control of our pavements!whitman100In reply to whitman100: Most people don’t want to live in the surveillance society you describe. We know it doesn’t stop crime. It simply changes it.WyrdsisterThey seem to catch enough people anyway in their bright yellow condition. Seems fairer with that much warning.unclestinkyClearly, having signs decreases the speed in any specific camera’s location. However, it also provides tacit permission to speed elsewhere.I think the obvious solution to this paradox is to require car manufacturers to begin turning off car safety features at 30mph. Start small – passenger airbags turn off at 31mph, driver ones at 50. By the time a car hits 71, an ejector seat should be ready to fire the driver into the ceiling. It would be interesting to learn how many drivers would be willing to risk their own health rather than that of others as they speed “perfectly safely”.Hugh B, by emailThe recent road safety review ignored the elephant in the room, ie speed. Road traffic deaths [in Great Britain] have averaged around 1,600+ for the last several years; if that figure applied to air or rail travel, fleets would be grounded and networks shut down until the matter was investigated. Because road traffic deaths happen in small numbers per incident, they are hardly noticed, often barely making local media, marked only by sad little shrines of flowers by the side of a stretch of road.So … my thoughts (not vote winners)1. Review all speed limits; 20mph where conditions are hazardous, 30 up to 40 on the outskirts of towns/villages (30 can go on too long)2. Greater use of 50mph limit; it’s a big jump 40 to 60.3. Increase the limit to 80mph on motorways.Once that’s done, remove the requirement for cameras to be visible and allow local councils to share unpersoned mobile digital cameras and install far more average speed cameras.Then, allow some leeway (say 10%) and then prosecute everyone who speeds, increase the fines and the number of points. There will be a huge outcry which will settle down when death numbers start to fall dramatically (which they will!) As I said, not a vote winner but an effective strategy to deal with the current ludicrous situation where people think it’s OK to break the law a little bit.Phillip Tanswell, by emailWhat about a road reflector containing radio-frequency identification (RFID) set to the proper (safe) speed limit? This would communicate with the vehicle passing above. The driver would be alerted and if speed is not adjusted the onboard computer does it for them.

The fightback begins hereThe Friends of AttentionSun 18 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 13.47 ESTShareIn the last 15 years, a linked series of unprecedented technologies have changed the experience of personhood across most of the world. It is estimated thatnearly 70% of the human population of the Earth currently possesses a smartphone, and these devices constitute about95% of internet access-points on the planet.Globally, on average, people seem to spend close tohalf their waking hourslooking at screens, and among young people in the rich world the number is a good deal higher than that.History teaches that new technologies always make possible new forms of exploitation, and this basic fact has been spectacularly exemplified by the rise of society-scale digital platforms. It has been driven by a remarkable new way of extracting money from human beings: call it “human fracking”. Just as petroleum frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergents into the ground to force a little monetisable black gold to the surface, human frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergent into our faces (in the form of endless streams of addictive slop and maximally disruptive user-generated content), to force a slurry of human attention to the surface, where they can collect it, and take it to market.Fracking (of the Earth and of our minds) produces tectonic instability, toxicity and the despoliation of our landscapes, natural and social. We now know that the heedless exploitation of our external environment has been so relentless and irresponsible that human survival on Earth has been placed in actual jeopardy. The new “gold rush” into theinnerenvironment of the human psyche is well on its way to effecting parallel, if even more insidious destruction.The stakes are existential. And that is because, rightly understood, our actual human “attention” – the thing the frackers want, in the form of our eyes on their screens – is nothing less than our ability to care, our ability to think, our ability to give our minds, time and senses to ourselves, the world and each other. To commodify that is to commodify our very beings. The problem isn’t “phones”, and it isn’t “social media”. The problem is human fracking, a world-spanning land-grab into human consciousness – which big tech is treating as a vast, unclaimed territory, ripe for sacking and empire.That’s the bad news. Thegoodnews is that novel forms of exploitation produce novel forms of resistance. What fills the coffers of thesix largest corporations on the planetis nothing other than the stuff of our humanity. Which is to say this new fight for our attention stands in a long line of clashes between those who are willing to reduce people (their labour, their eyeballs) to cash value and those who insist on a higher view of human flourishing. This history is long and complex, and often painful. But it tells us this much: we can fight back. Indeed, we must.We must insist that human attention is ours, and we will use it to make the worlds we want to live inSo what is to be done about this new kind of human exploitation that is harming us – harmingchildrenandadults,compromising our deliberative politicsand ourpsychological wellbeing? Regulatory efforts are piecemeal and actively thwarted by the powerful interests in play. Psychopharmacological fixes for the ever-expanding damage merely monetise the destruction in a complementary way and render us better able to submit to conditions that are palpably at odds with human flourishing. How to confront a problem that is both unspeakably intimate and unthinkably extensive?The answer is clear: we, the actual people of this planet, must come together in decisive solidarity; we must say no to the human frackers, and do so by insisting, in new ways, that human attention is human, and it is ours, and we will use it to make the worlds in which we want to live. In other words, we need amovement.Think that sounds quixotic? Well, keep in mind that’s how actual change actually happens. And it can happen fast. The environmental movement as we know it did not exist in 1950, but by 1970 it was a global force. In 1946 Reynolds Tobacco was using doctors to promote cigarettes. Fewer than 20 years later, the American Medical Association and the US surgeon general publicly averred that smoking caused lung cancer.And the changes get much bigger than that. Precious few do-gooders devoted themselves to environmental politics in 1925. That’s because “environmental politics” wasn’t even a thing. It took a cultural shift (and the work of advocates such as Rachel Carson) across the mid-20th century to establish the physical environment – the unity of land, water, and air that produces shared life – as a politically tractable object around which diverse groups could organise. This is to say that the very structures of politics, not just our beliefs and hopes, are themselves emergent forms. New things come into being, and old things pass away.Where attention is concerned, there are mounting signs that we are reaching an inflection point. People of all sorts, Maga Republicans and Mamdani progressives, hipsters in Portland and evangelicals in Arkansas– people who don’t agree aboutanything– all actually do agree that something is totally wrong with a world in which everyone spends nearly all their time scrolling endlessly through the algorithmic feeds of their social media, a world where military-grade technology and trillion-dollar corporations take aim at children, and feed them whatever it takes to keep them hooked.You can only abuse people so much, and then, eventually, they turn, they rise, they insist onsomething else. Already politicians on theright and the leftare identifying this issue as one that moves the electorate. In 30 years, we will look back, and this era – the wild west of the tech princes’ smash-and-grab into our hearts, souls and relationships – will be difficult to explain to our grandkids. “How did you all let that happen?” they will ask. And we’ll have to say: “It’s hard to explain: it happened before we noticed; it was so much fun, especially at first; it took us time to figure out what was going on … ”But we are figuring it out. We write as representatives of a fast-growing and increasingly well-organised movement, focused on pushing back against the human frackers, and giving shape to a new politics of human attention. At the heart of our efforts? The formation of broadcoalitionsdevoted to the politics of human attention, the practice of diverse forms ofstudythat call forth the life-giving powers of the mind and senses, and the promotion ofsanctuary spacesfor the protection and cultivation of the kinds of attention that make life good. We call this workattention activism.Our claim? That all of us already have the tools to resist the frackers, because all of us already have things we do and care about that put us beyond the reach of the algorithms. We all already know the deepest truth: that true human attentionisn’tthe click and swipe of screen time. True human attention is love, curiosity, daydreaming and taking care of ourselves and others.Yes, new technologies give rise to new kinds of exploitation and resistance. But new forms of exploitation can even give rise to genuinely new forms of politics. You couldn’t brutalise an industrial proletariat before the factory system. Steam engines set the conditions of possibility for this development. They weren’t themselves a “problem”, of course; they gleamed and were precise and powerful. Who could see them operate without awe? But they also created a world in which it was possible to aggregate and extract physical labour from human beings in a revolutionary way. Along the way, they created a new kind of political subject,Homo economicus, a person who had been reduced, in the calculus of modernity, to “labuor value”. Actual revolutions followed – and a new kind of politics was born which reflected a new world of industrial labour, and new forms of labour solidarity, such as unions and workers’ parties.The new system of human fracking is turning all of us into attentional subjects in a powerful new way.Homo attentusis the end user of every networked system – economic, political, expressive. With this new form of life comes, as we have discovered, appalling new vulnerability. But we are on the brink of understanding the new power that has come into our hands in the fracklands. We believe a new kind of politics beckons. What will it look like? It is hard to say. And there are reasons to be fearful. But if we, the people, can take up the banner of a new kind of freedom movement – a movement for the true freedom of attention itself, what we callattensity– and deploy our truly human attention in new ways, with a new understanding of the stakes, we can defy the frackers, and insist on creating, together, a human world.D Graham Burnettis professor of history atPrinceton University.Alyssa Lohis a film-maker.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Since I first tested sunrise alarm clocks last winter, I’ve come to suspect that there’s no such thing as getting up on the wrong side of bed. What we ought to be worried about is waking up on the wrong side of dawn.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.During summer (and other times of the year, for late risers), the sunrise begins to rouse us before we wake up. The brain kicks into gear and sends signals to initiate all sorts of bodily processes, from metabolism to hormone release, which helps us to feel ready for the day. It’s a fundament of our circadian rhythm – and we miss out on it whenever we wake before it gets light.That is where asunrise alarm clockcan fill the gap. These devices simulate dawn, glowing with increasing brightness in the run-up to your alarm, and for many this reduces grogginess and improves alertness upon waking. I’ve tested more than a dozen models – and I believe the Lumie Bodyclock Glow 150 is the best you can get.View at HealfView at BootsHow I testedI test sunrise alarm clocks by using them to wake me up before dawn over at least a few nights – which is no hardship at this time of year. I’ve risen with the Bodyclock Glow 150 every day for two weeks, which has given me a fuller impression of its performance. As well as using it as a wake-up light, I’ve tested its sunset simulation mode and used it as a reading light before bedtime.What you need to knowView image in fullscreenThe Bodyclock Glow 150 is certified as a Class I medical device.Photograph: Pete Wise/The GuardianView at HealfView at BootsLumie has seven sunrise alarm clock models, from the basic (but very good)Sunrise Alarm (RRP £49.98, now £38.48)to the elaborateBodyclock Deluxe 750DAB (RRP £229, now £176.33), which moonlights as a digital radio.With a £119 RRP (currently£106.49 at Healf), the Bodyclock Glow 150 is around the middle of the range – but in my view, it has all the features that matter. To help you wake up or drift off, there are programmable sunrise and sunset simulations, which progress through a naturalistic colour spectrum from reddish-orange to brilliant white (and vice versa).You can adjust various parameters of these cycles, including their duration, maximum brightness, and – for sunrise mode – the alarm tone that will make sure you’re awake. There are 10 sounds, including birdsong, lapping waves and a shrill beep.The device is controlled via buttons surrounding the digital display, which can automatically dim itself when darkness falls. It works as a reading light/night light, has a tap-to-snooze function, and features a cable management space on its underside.Lumie is uniquely placed among sunrise alarm clock brands, having invented this category of product in 1992 as an offshoot of its existing Sad lamp range. Its original wake-up light, the Natural Alarm Clock,looked like an Edwardian space weapon, but later models successfully wed Lumie’s rigorous approach to dawn simulation with a more bedside-friendly design.Like most (but not all) Lumie wake-up lights, the Bodyclock Glow 150 is certified as a medical device.SpecificationsMedical certification: UK MDR 2002 and EU MDR 2017/745Light source: LEDSunrise duration: 20, 30 or 45 minutesSunset duration: 20, 30 or 45 minutesDimensions: 19 x 12 x 16cm (WDH)Weight: 0.57kgAlarm sounds: 10Extra features: tap to snooze; auto-dimming digital display; cable management in baseWarranty: three yearsWhat we loveView image in fullscreen‘The sunset simulation created a relaxing ambience as I wound down for sleep.’Photograph: Pete Wise/The GuardianWhere better to start than the sunrise? The Bodyclock Glow 150 has exceptional sunrise simulation – superior to other brands and equal to other great Lumie models such as theBodyclock Spark 100. Waking up before dawn, I experience a sensation that’s genuinely close to being bathed in sunlight because the device glows brighter (and lighter in hue) as your alarm time approaches. It has consistently helped me to wake up feeling more alert, in a better mood and less groggy.This model surpasses the Spark 100 in its selection of wake-up sounds, several of which are lilting. For very reluctant risers and deep sleepers, there’s also a harsher-sounding alarm tone that’s sure to get your cortisol pumping. You can adjust the sunrise (or sunset) duration, too, with 20-, 30- and 45-minute periods to choose from. I found myself using a 30-minute sunrise most days, but switching to 20 minutes when I had limited time available for sleep.The sunset simulation created a relaxing ambience as I wound down for sleep, with the light steadily growing dimmer and graduating from white to reddish-orange as the minutes marched on. However, I tend to read in bed until I conk out, so I preferred using a steady, low-light setting for as long as I needed it instead.Controlling the Glow 150 is straightforward and intuitive, with every option configurable via five buttons on the front of the device (plus an extra one tucked away in the base that toggles the digital display’s automatic night-time shut-off).As with most sunrise alarm clocks, the Glow 150 spends most of the day just sitting at the bedside, telling the time and acting as a lamp. It does a nice job of it, too, with a highly legible digital display and a finely adjustable bedside lamp mode that offers the ideal mellow lighting for bedtime reading.Another plus: it’s lightweight and compact. I went on a short holiday while testing it and had no problem fitting it inside mysuitcase, carrying it and setting it up in my hotel room. This is the sort of thing you may actually find yourself doing if you become habituated to using a wake-up light.What we don’t loveThis is a nicely designed alarm clock, but I’ve tested models with greater bedside appeal (including some cheaper ones). Available only in black, this blobject will suit some bedrooms better than others. If other colours were offered, the Glow 150 would be able to blend more easily into a wider range of interiors.There’s also slightly less adjustability with this model than with some competing sunrise alarm clocks, especially in terms of the sunrise length, where the choice of three durations may feel limiting to some.My only full-blown reservation is with the steep price (from £106.49 at the time of writing), but think of it as a real investment in your quality of sleep.Lumie Bodyclock Glow 150: should I buy it?Sunrise alarm clocks don’t suit everyone, but for many people – myself included – dawn simulation makes a significant difference to the experience of waking up before sunrise. The Bodyclock Glow 150 is the best model I’ve tested, and although it’s expensive, it could prove precious to many who feel groggy in the mornings. Lumie offers a 45-day trial on its wake-up lights, but bear in mind that you’ll need to have all the original packaging (and pay for postage) if you wish to return it within that period.View at HealfView at BootsFor more, read themost-hyped sleep aids, testedExplore more on these topicsSleepThe FilterInteriorsHomesGadgetsHealth & wellbeingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Bullying is not strengthEditorialTariff threats over the Arctic island expose the limits of coercive diplomacy. Europe’s united response and pushback shows fear is fadingSun 18 Jan 2026 12.59 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShareFor all Donald Trump’s bluster about restoring American strength, his attempt to bully European allies over Greenland reveals a deeper weakness: coercive diplomacy only works if people are afraid to resist.Increasingly, they aren’t. And that is a good thing. Bullies often back down when confronted – their power relies on fear. Mr Trump’s threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Europeans unless they acquiesce to his demand to “purchase” Greenland has stripped his trade policy bare. This is not about economic security, unfair trade or protecting American workers. It is about using tariffs as a weapon to force nations to submit.The response from Europe has been united and swift. That in itself should send a message. France’s Emmanuel Macron says plainly “no amount of intimidation” will alter Europe’s position. Denmark has anchored the issue firmly inside Nato’s collective security. EU leaders have warned that tariff threats risk a dangerous downward spiral. Even Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, seen as ideologically close to Mr Trump, publicly called the tariff threat a “mistake” – adding that she has told him so.What Mr Trump did not reckon with was that intimidating Europe would carry institutional consequences. The European parliament is nowmovingto pause ratification of the EU-US trade deal that European leaders were pressured by the US to accept last summer. The three largest parliamentary blocs in Strasbourg – conservatives, social democrats and liberals – are marching together. In Brussels, this is not theatre. The EU runs trade policy, not individual capitals, as Britain found out during Brexit. Mr Trump can threaten governments; he cannot browbeat European institutions designed to withstand coercion.The UK is speaking up. Though outside the EU, the country issued ajoint statementwith allies saying that Mr Trump’s threat risks a “dangerous downward spiral” and “undermines transatlantic relations”. On his own Sir Keir Starmer was reduced to pleading for better behaviour. Britain is like Greece to America’s Rome – with the added trauma of having once been Rome itself.But there are signs of a rules-based system being built without the US. Canada, one of America’s closest allies, is hedging its bets. The country’strade dealwith Beijing shows how middle powers shift when Washington becomes erratic. Diversifying away from Mr Trump’s America is the right route to take. The US president ought to drop his tough talk and get on with bolstering Greenland’s defences and, if necessary, building proper commercial partnerships that benefit both the US and the island’s population.Some point to Richard Nixon’s “madman theory” as a historical precedent. But there is a difference between unpredictability that creates leverage and recklessness that destroys trust. Nixon shocked the system in 1971 because the system was coming apart. Today we have disorder, but Mr Trump shocks the system because he seems to enjoy the spectacle. That matters because coercive foreign policy requires domestic legitimacy. Polling shows amajorityof Americans think Mr Trump’s presidency a failure. A president who lacks consent at home cannot credibly demand submission abroad. What he projects instead is desperation. Mr Trump believes influence comes through ultimatums and coercion. But power, in the real world, rests on trust, predictability and persuading others to follow. Yet allies arepushing back. The more Mr Trump resorts to bullying, the more the world will learn how to live without him.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionGreenlandEuropean UnionEuropeeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Public trust in science also needs to be shored upSun 18 Jan 2026 12.58 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 21.31 ESTShareIt is true that science is self-correcting. Over the long term this means that we can generally trust its results – but up close, correction can be a messy process. The Guardianreported last weekthat 20 recent studies measuring the amount of micro- and nanoplastics in the human body have been criticised in the scientific literature for methodological issues, calling their results into question. In one sense this is the usual process playing out as it should. However, the scale of the potential error – one scientist estimates that half the high-impact papers in the field are affected – suggests a systemic problem that should have been prevented.The risk is that in a febrile political atmosphere in which trust in science is being actively eroded on issues from climate change to vaccinations, even minor scientific conflicts can be used to sow further doubt. Given that there is immense public and media interest in plastic pollution, it is unfortunate that scientists working in this area did not show more caution.The questions raised are mainly about the measurement of quantities of micro- or nanoplastic in the human body. In particular, one method, pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, may have either been used or interpreted incorrectly. There is still robust evidence via other methods – such as electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy – that these small-scale plastics are in our organs. What is in doubt now is how much.Many, though not all, of the studies in question were conducted mainly by medical researchers, and published in medical journals. It is possible that there was a lack of rigour or technical expertise in chemistry. Some scientists have noted thatthis is a young field, and best practices are still being established.But extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and public interest in this field means that results will be seen as extraordinary in the wider world, whether or not researchers think they are. Until clear and widely agreed standards are established for these plastic measurements, great care – and perhaps wider consultation and peer review – should be taken before results are published, and reported in the media. Hopefully the spotlight trained on the field last week will prompt reflection and future caution.There is, of course, along-established playbookfor magnifying and misrepresenting scientific conflicts – with attempts to discredit the science of global heating a case in point. This is not fair, but it is the world we live in. Scientists are confident that there will be some consensus on the scale of plastics in our bodies soon – probably within a few years. But even when the science becomes clearer, this row will probably be referenced by bad actors to discredit future results. After all, the plastic industryis downstream of the fossil fuel industryand employs many of the same lobbying techniques.Concerns about plastic pollution have thus far transcended traditional political boundaries. Hopefully that will remain true. More worrying than the situation in Europe is the Trump-captured scientific system in the US. Last yearan executive orderentitled Restoring Gold Standard Science warned that strict criteria will be used to disqualify studies from being used as evidence for government policy.Many are concernedthat evennormal debatesand differences of view between researchers could be used to reject wide swathes of well-agreed fact. In effect, science’s treasured self-correcting method could be turned against it.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsOpinionPollutionHealthDonald TrumpUS politicseditorialsShareReuse this content"

Well, at least now we know it’s the other; not an invasion that would have sent young men home to their mothers across Europe in coffins, but insteadanother trade war, designed to kill off jobs and break Europe’s will. Just our hopes of an economic recovery, then, getting taken out and shot on a whim by our supposedly closest ally, months after Britainsigned a trade dealsupposed to protect us from such arbitrary punishment beatings. In a sane universe, that would not feel like a climbdown by the White House, yet by comparison with the rhetoric that had Denmark scrambling troops to Greenland last week it is.That said, don’t underestimate the gravity of the moment.Keir Starmer has tried everything to avoid being forced to choose between Europe and the US, and for a country that has burned too many international bridges lately that was the right instinct. He has swallowed any amount of personal mortification and public disquiet in the process, only to discover that whatever Britain gives, Trump always demands more. For this president, you are either all in or all out. Though Britain joined an American military operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker suspected of sanctions busting only days ago, that didn’t protect us from presidential wrath when we alsosent a single officerto Greenland last week, in symbolic solidarity with our (and at least in theory the US’s) Nato ally Denmark. You can’t ride two horses, it turns out, when one is a mad bucking bronco.All of which means that the old western alliance is effectively dead, and the US under this president is no longer an ally. Anyone expecting Starmer to say so on Monday morning, still less to threaten the closure of American military bases across the country in retaliation, needs however to face reality.Europe’s first instinct will be to try for some negotiated fudge that saves face, jobs and (particularly in Ukraine, where US security guarantees remain critical) lives, with Denmark’s foreign minister due in Downing Street shortly to discuss options. Though no deal with Trump is to be relied upon, doing them still buys time, no bad idea when dealing with a 79-year-old president increasingly unpopular at home, whose power could be constrained by Democrat advances in this autumn’s midterms. In the longer term, however,Europeurgently needs an escape plan.Any woman ever trapped in a relationship with an abusive man will recognise something in the posture of the US’s smaller, less powerful allies over the past year. The first time he lashes out, you tell yourself that it can’t be what you think it is; that it won’t happen again. Before long, you are tiptoeing over eggshells around him, trying not to say or do anything that makes him explode. But since an angry man will find excuses to be angry, eventually it becomes clear that the only answer is to leave. Yet to get away safely from a vindictive man takes some planning.All those smaller democracies reliant on the US, whether they like it or not – for their defence, for the prosperity of which it has long been the engine, for whatever grudging concessions towards Ukraine’s future security can be extracted even from this White House, or just as a bulwark against whichever more malign superpower would otherwise be pushing them around – need time to build alternative structures before burning down the old ones. Good things could arise from those ashes, including the acceptance on both sides of the Channel that Brexit has died along with the old world order, and that Britain must quickly form some new kind of political, military and trade alliance with its neighbours (though probably one thatfalls short of EU membership, which could take a decade to renegotiate). A far tougher sell, however, for a country where public services are already on their knees, will be the requirement to spend billions more on defence and billions less on everything else – unpalatable choices no British prime minister will make until forced to.For what makes this process infinitely more complicated than ending a marriage is the need to separate president and country. Trump cannot last for ever, and so long as there is any chance of him being succeeded by someone more capable of being reasoned with in 2028, a conclusive final breach with the US makes no sense. The epoch-defining judgment call western governments thus have to make isn’t about the US under Trump, but about whether the US itself is lost to us, for a generation or more. Until that is resolved, the only strategy is to play for time; but plan, all along, for escape.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionTrump administrationEuropeNatoUS foreign policyUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Kristi Noem, secretary of homeland security, maligned Good as having committed “domestic terrorism”. Good’s killing became a national flashpoint as protests erupted demanding justice for the mother of three.Good’s killing is no anomaly. AWall Street Journal investigation revealed13 instances of ICE firing into civilian vehicles since July 2025, with at least eight people shot and two killed. ICE detentions are notorious for theirinhumane conditions;32 people died in ICE custodyin 2025 alone, matching a record set two decades prior in 2004.That a white woman can be killed on camera, with impunity, and be demeaned and ridiculed in her death for standing up for her neighbors shows just how far down the road of violence the nation has gone.It is a road most Americans do not want to continue on –recent polling showsthe majority disapprove of how ICE operates. But to truly stop the damage requires going further – it means eradicating the security logic that ever made people think that arming a secret police onan ethnic cleansing missioncould ever make them safe.Formed in 2003, during the embarrassing and disastrous national excesses of the post-9/11 era – when the nation launched two ill-fated forever wars, and demonized Muslim immigrants – ICE’s mandate was overwrought and ill-considered. Its formation was part of the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) which – as illustrated by its name – formally adopted the idea that immigrants were an inherent security threat to Americans.The casting of non-white immigrants as threats is not itself new – it defines the nation’s immigration system from the first act in 1790, which limited naturalization to “free white persons”, to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, to the whites-only racial quotas for migration that came soon after.In the wake of the civil rights movement and the abolition of racial quotas with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, the United States went from 86% white to just under 60%. And, while immigration law was race-neutral, its policies turned to criminalize increasingly Black and brown immigrants.In 1986, Ronald Reagan coupled the country’s only amnesty program with a seven-fold increase in border enforcement – beginning an arms race that would shape border violence for decades.But it was Bill Clinton’s 1996 signing of theIllegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act (IIRIRA)set the stage for our current mass deportation system, by making deportation easier, and making more people deportable, even for nonviolent crimes. IIRIRA stripped many immigrants of the ability to argue their cases in front of a judge and closed pathways by which undocumented people could become documented.Then came ICE. Mandated with targeting100% of people who are “deportable”, the agency has long been unfettered by the (already limited) regulations placed on police or prisons in the criminal legal system. People in ICE detention arenot entitled to a lawyer or the due process protectionsafforded to people within the criminal legal system.Even before thesupreme court authorized ICE to racially profilethis past September, the agency had along documentedhistory of racial profiling and racism. US citizens have been caught in its net – including in one harrowing case where a man namedDavino Watsonwas detained for 1,273 days, despite repeatedly telling officers that he was a citizen. He never received compensation.From the start, ICE has been a racial project, with its armed operatives targeting Black and brown people. Its categorical mission and lack of oversight are reminiscent of slave patrolstasked with hunting down fugitives.In the wake of Good’s killing, politicians have claimed that ICE needs better training. The problem, as they see it, is the ramp-up of ICE under Trump, with a $75bn increase in funding. But Jonathan Ross has been with ICEfor a decade. Ross wasn’t one of the subpar new recruitswho can’t run a mile and a half; according to testimony he gave in December,obtained by Wired, he was a firearms trainer, team leader, and elite member of its special response unit – a Swat team.Seen from this vantage, Good’s killing is not a “mistake” but a reflection of how the agency is designed to operate. Take it from the border czar, Tom Homan, who said: “There will be more bloodshedunless we decrease the hateful rhetoric.” In other words, Homan, who received an award for his service under Obama, after introducing the idea of family separation, is telling citizens that exercising their constitutional right to speech will prompt government agents to gun them down.Abolishing an agency thatteargasses two-year-oldsand shoots mothers in the street isn’t radical. It is basic human decency. Yet Democratic leadership has refused to back the call todefund ICE, with thinktanks suggesting “abolish ICE” goestoo far.“Abolish ICE” does not go far enough. We need to move away from a systempredicated on violencein favor of one that centers people’s humanity. We need to ensure that every human in the United States facing a legal process – including deportation – has access to a lawyer. We need to expand our legal pathways rather than truncate them. And we need to divest from the logic that violence makes us safer – Renee Good’s killing, the killing ofKeith Porterby an off-duty agent, and the deaths of Parady La, Luis Beltran Yanez-Cruz, Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres and Geraldo Lunas Campos,who all died in immigration custody already this year– prove without a doubt that it will not, regardless of the passport you carry.Heba Gowayed is an associate professor of sociology at Cuny Hunter College and Cuny Graduate Center and author of the book Refuge: How the State Shapes Human PotentialVictor Ray is the F Wendell Miller associate professor of sociology at the University of Iowa and author of the book On Critical Race Theory: Why It Matters & Why You Should CareExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionMinnesota ICE shootingUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Now we must halt destruction before it more powerfully startsSun 18 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 09.39 ESTShareIn spring 2004, Gen Anthony Zinniuttered about Iraqthe dreaded words in US politics: “I spent two years in Vietnam, and I’ve seen this movie before.” A year after George W Bush’s declaration of “mission accomplished” – when the war had hit itspeak popularity at 74%– the invasion had descended into quagmire, marked by a raging insurgency, the Abu Ghraib torture scandal and US casualties nearing 1,000. For the first time, a majority of Americansjudged the wara “mistake”. In this, they echoed what millions of Americans, predicting fiasco, had been saying since before its start.By the summer of 2005, withIraqexploding in civil war, public support further eroded. Vietnam comparisons abounded. Running against the war, Democrats had blowout wins in the 2006 midterms. The new Congress empaneled the bipartisan Iraq study group, which concluded that the war had to end. Its fate was sealed by the election of Barack Obama, who made good on his pledge to withdraw US troops (though US forces later returned to take on the Islamic State).By 2019, 62% of American adults – and a staggering 58% of Iraq/Afghanistan veterans – judged the Iraq war “not worth fighting”. These numbers belie what feels like a deeper, bipartisan consensus that Iraq was a “stupid war”, never to be repeated. Something like an “Iraq syndrome”, similar to skittishness about major military interventions following Vietnam, had taken hold.With the capture of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, we may be witnessing the opening scenes of a dismal sequel, now to the movie called Iraq. Propelling Trump’s aggression is his gleeful defiance of traditional constraints to war-making, whether international treaties, global norms, congressional consent or the opinion of historic allies. Bush had his own unilateralism, wrapped in cowboy bluster. But his administration secured congressional approval for the Iraq war and at least tried, though failed, to win the same from the UN security council.Trump rejects even a whiff of constraint. “I don’t need international law,”he boasts. He dares the world to stop or even slow him.We desperately need an antiwar movement to at least try. At stake is whether we accept a new era of impunity – not, in the near term, of American power per se, but of a largely unpopular leader, claiming God-like omnipotence, to kidnap and kill, bully and bomb without limit.Here the Iraq syndrome may offer some hope. Perhaps the only limit Trump sees is his pledge, vital to part of the Maga base, to avoid “stupid wars”. This hardly makes him a prince of peace. He clearly revels in violence and coercion. “Stupid wars” are for Trump simply those America can’t easily win, measured by prohibitive costs in (exclusively) American blood and treasure.Hence his reluctance so far to commit “boots on the ground”. Instead, Trump punches down, using military strikes on the high seas against haplesscivilians, special ops, one-off bombings, naval blockades and lethal threats to an expanding list of weak foreign states. America, his administration insists, is not actually at war with Venezuela, even as it kidnaps its leader and heclaims to run the country.Democratic leaders have rightly invoked Iraq to frame the current danger. “I fought in some of the hardest battles of the Iraq war,” the senator RubenGallego wrote. “Saw my brothers die, saw civilians being caught in the crossfire all for an unjustified war. No matter the outcome, we are in the wrong for starting this war in Venezuela.” Some traditional Maga loyalists, fromSteve BannontoMarjorie Taylor Greene, have likewise warned of another Iraq.Trump is at a perilous crossroads. Certain that Maga will never abandon him, he may choose a maximalist course of sizable deployments to Venezuela, or even Cuba, in a bloody bid for “regime change” and the seizure of oil and land. Or he may, mindful of Iraq, pursue supremacy with minimal losses by using threats and remote killing. It’s the difference between imperialism hard and imperialism lite, united in the naked lust for oil profits. Trump could also reverse the current escalation, spinning whatever outcome as victory.Which scenario prevails may depend on the existence of robust, visible and broad-reaching opposition to war. The antiwar movement of the early 2000s can be instructive.The movement did not in itself account for the dramatic shift in public opinion on the Iraq war and, at a slower pace, US policy. The war’s utter failure broke Americans’ faith in it. Antiwar activists take little comfort in being vindicated. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, many of them civilians, and more than 4,500 US military personnel died in the conflict.But antiwar protest helped catalyze the turning by steadily appealing to Americans’ hearts and minds. Stepwise, events on the ground validated protesters’ steady narrative of the war’s deceitful origins, disastrous course and intolerable costs, including to Iraqis. As the war worsened, the movement gained greater salience.The brave stand of the Gold Star mother Cindy Sheehan, demanding to know from Bush “for what noble cause” her son died, had great emotional resonance. New voices, including veterans of the Iraq war, spoke out. Burgeoning antiwar sentiment trickled up to the political class.In late 2005, the Democratic representative John Murtha – a Vietnam war veteran and vocal war hawk – sent shockwaves by demanding a US withdrawal. Murtha, who had visited severely wounded soldiers and read his constituent mail, concluded that the“American public” was “way ahead”of Congress in wanting the troops home now. The antiwar movement had led the way.A main lesson from the antiwar movement – widely judged as a failure for not stopping the US invasion – is that steadfast protest can help erode the perceived legitimacy of a war and hasten its end.The task for today’s antiwar resistance, much as the antiwar movement faced in 2002 and 2003, is to stop war before it more powerfully starts. It won’t be easy. Just building an effective coalition will be a challenge.The left, sure to lead a new antiwar movement, cannot alone restrain Trump. Only a bipartisan groundswell can. Trump sees the left as an enemy, to be attacked, not listened to. From his own ranks, he demands total loyalty, lashing out at even mild dissent. (After angry phone calls from Trump, Republican senatorsbacked off from effortsto have a war powers resolution guide Venezuela policy.) Antiwar Republicans, facing their own struggles, should be encouraged, not questioned.Progressives may bristle at making bedfellows with Maga loyalists, even just on the issue of war. Universes separate them, including on Iraq. Leftists generally decry the Iraq war as part of a neo-imperialist project, using 9/11 as a pretext and willful deceit about weapons of mass destruction, for renewed US hegemony. The war failed because Iraqis expelled a clumsy and brutal occupier. For America Firsters, the war was a well-intentioned, but overly ambitious, exercise in “nation building”. It failed because an ungrateful people proved themselves unworthy of the gift of freedom. The war was not so much wrong as wrong-headed. Its authentic victims were the US soldiers sacrificed to Bush’s “globalism”, not the Iraqis.Neither side has the luxury of requiring broad-ranging affinity as a condition for alliance. The anti-Iraq war movement made decisive electoral and policy inroads only when a sliver of Republicans – who supported the war by a large majority until its bitter end – defied Bush.Progressives may also wince at “imperialism lite” – in which Trump’s aggression is limited, but not fundamentally challenged – as the best achievable goal. Absent Americans in body bags, much of the country will likely shrug at Trump’s imperial ploys. But even a restrained Trump is a dangerous Trump.Wins are relative, as the left’s own history shows. In the 1970s and 1980s, a North American “solidarity” movement took hold. A main goal was to prevent the United States from engaging in full-bore military interventions to overthrow popular leftwing governments, like in Nicaragua, or suppress socialist insurgencies, like in El Salvador. Heeding both the “Vietnam syndrome” and this protest, Ronald Reagan used proxy forces, covert action and foreign security services, who ran death squads and employed torture, to pursue his anti-communist ends. Tens of thousands of civilians died. Still, the US left helped to forestall even greater bloodshed, and could claim qualified success. Something similar may be the current hope.Against this sobering realism, there is a way to dream bigger, grounded in its own realism. The anti-Iraq war movement was profoundly right that the time to stop a war isbeforeit starts. Once unleashed, the destruction is hard to turn back, as “endless war” proved. The tendency of empire is to overreach. Aggressors claim the mantle of virtue, while promising swift and decisive victory. That was the lesson of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars: in December 2002 and May 2003, respectively, Bush declared them over, though they had hardly begun.Trump may, as his critics joke, “chicken out” on tariffs and select other issues. But with violence, including on America’s streets, his tendency is to double down. So much can go wrong, following from the opening salvos of imperialism lite. That should be enough, if the disaster of the Iraq war holds any lesson, to call the current madness off. May a new antiwar movement make the case.What’s giving me hope nowThe anti-Trump resistance is rapidly incorporating antiwar messaging – including a critique of imperialism – into its pushback against Trump’s authoritarianism. The nationwide protests last weekend, following the killing of Renee Nicole Good, were billed as: “No Kings, No ICE, No War.” It’s so important to see unchecked aggression at home and abroad as parts of the same authoritarian system we have to dismantle. Many people in the United States remain deeply committed to the US constitution, the welfare of their neighbors and common standards of decency. Even some Trump supporters are souring on his strongman act. We are poised for a democratic renewal, if we work for it.Jeremy Varon is the author of Our Grief Is Not a Cry for War: The Movement to Stop the War on Terror (University of Chicago Press, 2025)Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationFighting BackIraqVenezuelaDonald TrumpProtest (US)ProtestUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But it can be helped to find its way thereSimon TisdallIndependent media, civil society, the rule of law – these are the things that Iranians truly need. And there are ways for the west to help secure themSun 18 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 09.26 ESTShareSoon after becoming president in 2017, Donald Trump ordered an attack on an Islamic State (IS) underground complex in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province. The strike involved thefirst-ever usein combat of a GBU-43 massive ordnance air blast (Moab) “bunker buster” bomb – the US’s most powerful conventional weapon. The bombing killed about 90 insurgents but failed to crush IS. It also made zero long-term difference to the US’s losing battle with the Taliban.Yet that was not the point. Inexperienced Trump, who had famouslyavoided military service, was keen to show he was in charge, a commander-in-chief unafraid to make tough calls and send troops into harm’s way. He craved a big bang – a spectacular demonstration of unmatched US power. Like a teenager who unexpectedly obtains the keys to the family gun cabinet, he could not resist the temptation to play with all those shiny new Pentagon weapons.Trump’s latestthreats to bomb Iran, prompted by the recent, terrible events across the country, suggest his mindset is unchanged. It’s naive to think he genuinely cares about the killing and brutalisation of unarmed Iranian demonstrators when, on his orders, gun-toting federal militias abuse American citizens in similar ways in Minneapolis and other cities. It’s plain Trumpdoesn’t give a damnabout democracy in the US,let alone in Iran(or newly colonised Venezuela).On the contrary, Trump sees an opportunity to impose US hegemony on ahistorically defiant, ill-led, energy-rich country that Democrats from Jimmy Carter to Joe Biden failed to subdue or co-opt. It’s a chance to play at being supreme leader. Trump does not want a settlement with the mullahs. He wants a capitulation – and regime change on his terms. Yet he also wants instant gratification and quick results. As his lopsided meddling in Ukraine and Israel-Palestine shows, Trump lacks strategic vision, consistency and staying power.As the White House considered military options last week, it became clear that strikes on supposed nuclear facilities, missile defences and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) bases would not deliver the immediate headline success Trump covets. Military action wasopposed by Gulf leaders, fearful of Iranian retaliation and regional chaos. Even Trump’s close ally Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom he recklessly bombed Iran in June,urged caution– perhaps because missile strikes on Israeli cities could damage his re-election prospects.Nor was regime decapitation – the tactic pursued in Venezuela, whose leader, Nicolás Maduro,was abducted– a convincing alternative. Trump claimed in June that US and Israeli forces could easily have killed Iran’s (real) supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But his assassination would not guarantee change – and could set it back. Iran has a “deep bench” ofpossible successors, including Khamenei’s son, cut from the same hardline, theocratic cloth.For all these reasons, and despiteassuring Iranian demonstratorsthat “help ison its way”, “bomber” Trump appears to have backed off – for now.Iran’s murderous, incompetent and corrupt clerical regime, installed after the 1979 revolution, has undoubtedly lost all legitimacy and must be replaced, as previously argued here. Its crimes are legion, its failures endemic. They did not begin with this month’s vicious repression. Nor will they end there, absent radical change. But externally imposed regime change isnot the way to achieve it, or to secure the west’s long-term aim – a stable, peaceful, prosperous, unthreatening Iran.Military intervention would onlymake matters worsefor its longsuffering people. The focus instead must be on ensuring the country’s obscurantist, “divinely ordained” governing system – a religious relic designed to suit the revolution’s leading fanatic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini – is jettisoned by peaceful means. Centres of regime power, such as the Guardian Council, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, internal security agencies and corrupt state monopolies, must be disbanded, too.Surveys suggest a majority of Iranianswould welcomea secular constitution and free, fair and fully democratic elections. The anachronistic post of supreme leader should be scrapped. Universal human rights, especially women’s rights, must be written into law. And individuals responsible for past and present crimes must face justice, in Iran or via the UN and international courts. In short, the theocracy must be demolished.How might this be achieved without even greater violence? Western countries could increase direct economic and financial pressure on the regime and its leaders through sanctions, tariffs, bans and boycotts. Diplomatic contacts should be suspended and Tehran embassies, such as Britain’s,shuttered indefinitely. Any talks on sanctions relief and nuclear issues that normalise this rogue regime should be frozen.If thepolitical will exists, cyber operations and hybrid ops to disable missile defences, cripple security forces’ communications and disrupt regime revenues could be set in motion. It’s been done before. “Ghost” tankers carrying Iran’s oil exports could be seized. More coercive pressure could be applied to China, Russia and North Korea to curtail trade and aid.In any event, Britain and its allies must do more to support Iran’s fractured opposition and identify future leaders. Western tech companies could provide ways for ordinary people to circumvent internet and information blackouts. Use of soft-power tools, such as Persian language broadcasts, should be expanded, rather than shortsightedly cut. All possible means must be employed to help strengthen Iranian civil society, independent media and therule of law.Trump promised Iranians last week that life will change. It was not his promise to make, and cannot be delivered at the point of a gun. The impetus for fundamental reform must ultimately come from within. But the US president, who claims he’sguided by morality, now has a clear moral obligation to break his habit of opportunistic, short-term grandstanding and back his words with sustained, practical and constructive, nonviolent assistance.Dropping big bombs on people is easy. Forging a safe and peaceful future for the betrayed and orphaned children of Iran’s failed revolution is much, much harder.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpAyatollah Ali KhameneiMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Their peak period lasted until the early- to mid-1990s.In 2008, therecame a rupture– due to “management and business disputes” rather than anything musical – which opened the way to the choice that now confronts their remaining fans: whether to go and seea new vehiclefor the band’s former lead singer called “UB40 featuring Ali Campbell”, or stick with the outfit that still trades under its original name, and includes his estranged brother Robin. For the time being, there seems to be space for them both.Given their staunchly anti-Tory roots, I’m not sure any of the musicians involved would appreciate comparisons that involve such politicians asRobert Jenrick, Nigel Farage and Kemi Badenoch. But the drama currently gripping the people and parties vying for leadership of the British right fits the UB40 model like a glove.Here, after all, is the story of two estranged groupings that now have almost exactly the same worldview: a deep attachment to Brexit, the secular religion of Thatcherism and a modern fixation with immigration and the wider culture wars. Their battle is driven by animosities that seem to be as much personal as ideological. But with every defection from theConservativesto Reform UK, the sense of blurring has been accompanied by a mounting feeling that there can be only one winner. Politics is not like the market for ageing reggae acts: at the key points on the ideological spectrum, there tends to be room for just one viable force.Last week’s drama – Badenoch’s discovery of Jenrick’s planned defection, hisbrisk sacking, and the same day’s Farage-Jenrick press conference – took the battle for supremacy to a new level. Over the weekend there have been no end of stories and briefings, includingJenrick’s claimthat he had left the “Tory posh party” and realised it is “out of touch with the people I grew up around in Wolverhampton” (he is, let’s not forget, a privately educated formercorporate lawyer), and reports that the plan for his defection included the suggestion that he is “the new sheriff in town”. Farage, meanwhile, tried to steady the nerves of Tory-sceptic alliesby insistingthat his party isn’t a “rescue charity for every panicky Tory MP”, and saying there would be no more defections after 7 May, while Badenoch said Jenrick’s sacking is part of “cleaning out the rubbish” from hers.What these rather camp pronouncements – note Farage’s less-than-exacting deadline – actually underline is that this is a feud within the same political family. And it may well end with a reconstitution of Conservatism. A kind that mixes hard-right, authoritarian, nativist ideas with the usual belief in laissez-faire economics, but a reconstitution nonetheless.Farage’s political roots, let’s not forget, are stereotypically Tory. His first political epiphany came in 1978, when Thatcher’s ideological guru Keith Joseph came to Dulwich College – and, according to Michael Crick’s peerless Farage biography One Party After Another, lectured his audience about how people and the market could look after themselves. Farage became a Tory member the following day, and finally departed in 1992, but he remains a cultural Tory to the soles of his feet, as evidenced by his association with no end of Conservative totems and institutions: the City of London, mustard-coloured trousers,members’ clubs,foxhunting.In 2013,he saidthat he was only the British politician “keeping the flame of Thatcherism alive”; in 2022, hegreetedLiz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng’s great ripping-up of fiscal orthodoxy – the credo of the blessed Margaret gone kamikaze – as “the best Conservative budget since 1986”. Note also the substance of a piecehe publishedin Saturday’s Daily Mail. Reform, he said, was now a “centre-right alliance” that would fix Britain by being “shamelessly pro-business and pro-entrepreneur and putting in place measures that will make wealthy people want to return here and businesses want to invest”. Those are not so much the words of a populist as the kind of boilerplate rhetoric Thatcher disciples have been coming out with for at least four decades.In the case of his lieutenant Richard Tice, the sense of ingrained Toryism is even stronger. Hisown websitesays he only called time on his longstanding Conservative membership in 2019. He may have flirted with the nationalisation of British Steel and Thames Water, but aspeech he gave late last yearat the London HQ of Bloomberg bigged up fiscal conservatism, cited the City of London’s liberalising deregulatory big bang as the best inspiration for modern economic policy and looked ahead to a “flatter tax system”: as stereotypically Tory a set of messages as could be imagined.So what drives his and Farage’s animus towards the party they once supported? One answer could be the wondrous political opportunity they have spent years working towards: a fight with a drastically weakened Conservative party, and a chance to remake rightwing politics in their own image. But there is also a story to be told about the years when the Conservative party was remodelled by David Cameron and George Osborne. Much of what happened back then amounted to a visceral insult to hard-right conservatism: the deal with the Liberal Democrats, the embrace of social liberalism – and, running through everything, the capture of the Tories by theOxbridge-educatedNotting Hill set.The people in charge of Reform are not from that layer of Tory society at all. Farage did not go into higher education; Tice has a degree in quantity surveying and construction economics from the University of Salford. Neither are urbane metropolitans: as Jenrick’s “posh” attack on his former colleagues shows, part of their mission appears to be to get conservatism back to the demotic belligerence of the Thatcher period, and forget all about the attempt at “modernisation” that eventually followed it.Since 2016, of course, many Tories have moved in the same direction, which invites an obvious question: what exactly is the difference between them? On Friday morning, the new shadow justice secretary Nick Timothy was presented with a different version of the same point by the BBC’s Justin Webb, who pushed him on a couple of specific issues: Jenrick’s opposition to illegal immigration and “the rise of Islamism, as he would see it, as a threat”, both of which are positions that meant he could effortlessly slide into his new life as a Reform politician. Did Timothy and Jenrick differ on either of those? “If you want the real deal, then … you vote Conservative for those things,” he said. Metaphorically speaking, he was agreeing that there are two bands with the same songs, but insisting that the Tories just play them better. That does not sound like a winning script.And so the feud continues, between two foes who have a lot more in common than they admit. That is not to deny the dire dangers of aReform UKgovernment, nor that there are still Tories who are keenly aware of them. But UK conservatism has been shifting rightwards for a decade now, and if Farage and his ever-increasing band of ex-Tory colleagues become its new standard-bearers, that may not signify an ideological rupture, but something both ardent rightwingers and UB40 fans both long for: a reunion.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsRobert JenrickOpinionReform UKConservativesUB40commentShareReuse this content"

Each January we are invited to reinvent ourselves as fitter, more productive, more virtuous, with the rollover of the calendar offering us a clean slate and a chance to correct our flaws.While reasonable goals for modest self-improvement can be healthy, when these resolutions are perfectionistic, they become all-or-nothing tests of our self-worth. Make a mistake, miss a day at the gym, and the whole project collapses in a spiral of self-reproach. But the problem is not your willpower – it is perfectionism itself.Perfectionism has a good public face but it frequentlymasks painful private struggles.In the therapy room it is a foe to be vanquished if our patients are to live happier and more authentic lives. The challenge is that perfectionism tends to masquerade as diligence and achievement. Who wouldn’t want to do things properly, to high standards, to the best of their ability?Perfectionists thus generally wish to rid themselves of the negative consequences of this trait – anxiety, depression and burnout – butnotto lower their standards. This is hardly surprising given that perfectionism is often rewarded and praised and thus positively reinforced. Yet beneath the surface, it is often less about excellence than about fear.I’m a recovering perfectionist. Here’s how I embraced the joy of ‘good enough’Read morePerfectionism is associated with the pursuit of quality but it is more accurately characterised by a fear of failure. Healthy striving – a flexible wish to improve and to do a good job – is not the same as perfectionism, which tends to be rigid, driven by anxiety and unrelenting self-criticism. It thrives on shame – any flaw or mistake is taken as evidence of personal defectiveness. And because perfection is unattainable, the perfectionist is condemned to chronic dissatisfaction and fear of exposure.This fear of failure can paradoxically result in behaviours that limit success. Procrastination is strongly associated with perfectionism. If something cannot be done perfectly, it is safer not to do it at all. And the belief that a task must be done perfectly can induce overwhelm, leading to paralysis and avoidance.Furthermore, perfectionists struggle to finish tasks as they are never deemed adequate. These problems are captured in the warning, commonly attributed to Voltaire, to not to let the “perfect be the enemy of the good”.Even when perfectionism results in high achievement, it brings only fleeting satisfaction. A nagging fear often remains that the work is not as good as others think and that its flaws will soon be discovered.This was the case for Julie*, a 37-year-old academic, who sought therapy for chronic exhaustion and escalating anxiety related to her work. She was well regarded by colleagues and consistently received positive feedback, even winning awards for her research. Yet Julie described feeling that she was “only one mistake away” from being exposed as inadequate. She spent hours rewriting lectures and replayed minor missteps late into the night.The therapist noticed that Julie framed her self-worth only in terms of her performance –I am only acceptable if I perform perfectly.Together, they traced this belief back to childhood experiences in which positive attention from her parents had been closely tied to achievement. Mistakes had not been punished overtly but they had been met with disappointment and disconnection. Over time, Julie had developed an internal representation of this dynamic, an inner “voice” that constantly harassed her about perceived failures and drove her to work harder.Therapy with Julie was tricky because she was desperately afraid of lowering her unrelenting standards. She was also invested in “doing therapy perfectly” and feared disappointing the therapist. This put her in a challenging position given that the goal of therapy was for her to be more self-compassionate, flexible with her standards and prepared to tolerate “failures”.Over time, and with the support of a therapist who recognised her value as a person, Julie was able to differentiate between “good enough” and perfect. As she cut back on her excessive work habits, she noticed that her colleagues still respected her and her students continued to benefit, even when a lecture wasn’t perfectly prepared.The pressure of perfection: five women tell their stories | Guardian readers and Sarah MarshRead moreShe began sleeping better and there was a gradual reduction in her anxiety. She was surprised to find that her connection with her students and other staff improved as a result, and that work became a happier place for her.Sadly, perfectionists like Julie face an uphill battle in the modern world. Social media provides an endless stream of flawless bodies, exemplary parenting and productivity hacks. Students absorb the message that missteps can derail their future. KPIs rule the workplace. Being simply “good enough” can feel like a moral failure. Appropriate experimentation and learning from mistakes are thus discouraged, at the expense of innovation, curiosity and creativity.None of this is an argument against standards, care or responsibility. The challenge is to reclaim healthy striving from perfectionism’s grip. Healthy striving accepts limits and understands that error is integral to mastery. In The Gifts of Imperfection, Brené Brown emphasises that healthy striving is self-focused: “How can I improve?” and distinct from perfectionism which is other-focused: “What will they think?”The antidote to perfectionism would be to treat the new year not as a demand for transformation but as an invitation to experiment, set modest and attainable goals, be compassionate and encouraging when you hit a road bump, pivot when needed, and accept that our flaws deepen our humanity.*Julie is a fictitious amalgam to exemplify many similar cases that we see.

GLP-1 drugs will only make them richer – and strengthen the hold they have over usSun 18 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 12.08 ESTShareFifty years ago, I started thinking about the demand for women to look a certain way and the rebellions against the narrow ways in which we were supposed to display (and not display) our bodies. For a while, there was a conversation about the strictures. Some young women refused to conform. Some women risked being in the bodies they had rather than embodying the dominant images of beingMadonna or the whore. But troubled eating abounded, even if it wasn’t always visible, stoked by the food and diet industries and their bedfellows in the beauty and fashion industries. These industries targeted appearance as crucial to girls’ and women’s identity and their place in the world.Today, a new kind of troubled eating is stalking the land, entirely induced by the newGLP-1 weight-loss drugsproduced by pharmaceutical companies and promoted by their willing agents on social media. It is totally understandable that people want relief from obsessive and invasive thoughts about their bodies and food. The explosion of GLP-1 drugs has provided a kind of psychological peace for many who feel less frightened of their appetites.GLP-1 drugs have captured the public’s imagination, while priceshave been droppingand online doctors in supermarkets prescribe quite freely. The reach will be ever greater as thepill version of the drug, as opposed to the current jab form, hits the marketplace. The notion of managing appetite, of the desire for food, of mouth hunger, of wanting to quell the food chatter that constitutes internal and often obsessive thoughts about eating and not eating, is the promise. So too is the longing for bodies to be transformed. To be slimmed down and disciplined. Having the right kind of body, by which is meant, the acceptable and admirably thin body, will become something to be bought through these drugs.The meanings of troubled eating – which is to say why and how it has become so widespread – will be bypassed and erased. The beauty, food and fashion industries that help to provoke the distress will be able to continue peddling their products without censure.The “GLP-1 face”, with the intense cheekbones caused by rapid weight loss after using these drugs, requires costly interventions from clinicians who seem to have no difficulty re-plumping emaciated faces. The Hippocratic oath of “first, do no harm” has slithered away.The WHO learned to love ‘anti-obesity’ jabs in 2025. I don’t fully agree, but I get it | Devi SridharRead moreNever mind that doctors know about muscle loss. Never mind the many people who can’t get on with these meds facing a new kind of discrimination – as others tut about their weight and ask why they aren’t on the drugs. Never mind the studies that show the drugs do nothing to re-educate people’s appetites and that most peopleregain all the weight lostwithin two years of stopping taking the drug.GLP-1 drugs provide relief in the short term and that is to be welcomed. But the heartache and pain that is implicit in the search for a sustainable and reliable body is still elusive. The food, fashion, pharmaceutical and cosmetic surgery industries are still laughing all the way to the bank.The food industry is run on the ethics of greed. Ultra-processed “non-food foods” are an important part of the business model – the high-salt, high-sugar, high-saturated-fat concoctions, which give taste and no substance except to further stimulate appetite, have free rein. They hook people by overstimulating taste receptors, with relief only coming at the end of the packet.Now this same industry, which has been the biggest factor in the obesity epidemic, has developed divisions to reformulate foods to serve those who now find themselves with scant appetites, labelling the new food “GLP-1 friendly”. Food scientists talk excitedly about how to combine intensity and flavours with protein-rich foodstuffs to entice those whose appetites have shrunk and whose desires for food are alarmingly (for the food companies) suppressed. They don’t want to lose market share.GLP-1 drugs only stop cravings for food as long as they are being taken. For them to have a real place in helping people, we need a deeper understanding of how troubled bodies and troubled appetites have come to be so prevalent. Wherever we look, at whatever stage in life, we can see anxiety around food and bodies, fuelled by the industries that both create and benefit from this distress.A good place to start is at the very beginning of life, allowing babies and parents to relish their hunger and the satisfaction of it. Anxiety too often infuses pregnancy, and the postpartum period can be fraught when it comes to nursing.Inadvertently, a new parent’s desire to get back into pre-pregnancy clothes and back to a measured kind of eating can make feeding oneself and feeding an infant fraught. The cycle of troubled eating and fear of one’s appetites begins very young. We need a whole-body approach, starting at the beginning of life and welcoming the changes as our bodies grow.Wouldn’t it be wonderful for our experience of food to be pleasurable, wholesome and unconflicted? Such relish would contest the power of all of the industries hellbent on inducing body anxieties. That would be really worth aiming for.Susie Orbach is a psychotherapist, psychoanalyst and social critic.

Plymouth’s pubs and streets became vivid backdrops for Cook’s work.Photograph: Courtesy of ourberylcook.com © John Cook“Beryl Cook wasn’t painting caricatures,” she said. “She was documenting communities and identities that were actively marginalised with affection, mastery and honesty. Her work from the 1970s to 2000s captures working-class joy, body positivity and queer culture.”The exhibition comes at an apt time: 2026 is the centenary of Cook’s birth and it is half a century since a Sunday Times feature launched her into the public consciousness after her first exhibition at an arts centre inPlymouth.It also coincides with the Devon city – better known for its naval history than its art –bidding to become the UK city of culture.View image in fullscreenBowlers Off the Hoe.Photograph: Courtesy of ourberylcook.com © John Cook 2025Cook, who died in 2008 aged 81, moved to Plymouth in 1968 and the city became her primary subject, its pubs, streets and lido vivid backdrops for her work.The Pride and Joy show features more than 80 paintings, alongside rarely seen sculptures, textiles, and access to Cook’s personal archive of photographs, sketches and correspondence.An “identity and representation” section highlights how she painted those who were “othered” and looked down upon whether through attitudes toward gender, class, sexuality or body shape.Walkup flagged up a little-known 1972 painting called Bar Girls, which features two women with pints of beer. “It may not seem unusual today but in those days there were still some pubs that refused to serve women if they were unaccompanied by men. Here we have two women enjoying a full pint and each other’s company.“She’s not making fun of her subjects at all – she’s painting people occupying spaces unapologetically. She celebrates her subjects and we think there’s something so important and radical and joyous in that.”In a “process and practice” section, Cook’s meticulous methods of working are revealed. She mined media – from local television news to newspapers – for subjects and inspiration.The “influences and impact” section highlights how Cook drew on sources ranging from “saucy” seaside postcards to the work of Amedeo Modigliani and Pieter Bruegel the Elder.Jemima Laing, the deputy leader of Plymouth city council, said Cook put the place on the cultural map. “For over 40 years she painted our sailors, our shoppers, our pubs, our people, always with warmth, humour and genuine affection. While critics dismissed her, the public loved her, and now it’s time for long-awaited and hugely deserved critical recognition,” she said.View image in fullscreenSailors and Seagulls.Photograph: Courtesy of ourberylcook.com © John Cook 2025Laing said larger than lifesize sculptures of some of her characters would be popping up across the city: “They’re Plymouth’s love letter to an artist who never stopped celebrating us.”Julian Spalding, a writer and former museum director, said he was delighted Cook was being feted. “She’s one of the glories of British painting, a modern William Hogarth and Thomas Rowlandson rolled into one,” he said.“I once asked her if she’d ever wanted to paint something that upset her. She said: ‘No. If I thought it would make any difference, I might. But I don’t.’ It’s joy that drove her to create.”Beryl Cook: Pride and Joy opens atthe Box in Plymouthon Saturday 24 January 2026 and will run until 31 May.Explore more on these topicsExhibitionsArtPaintingPlymouthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

As its first show comes to the stage, he explains his plan to bring big productions back to his homelandSun 18 Jan 2026 05.01 ESTShareSince Thornton Wilder wrote Our Town in 1938, it is said that not a day has passed when the Pulitzer prize-winning show hasn’t been performed. “Every time I read it, I come away with the feeling of having been woken up,” saysMichael Sheen, star of the upcoming touring production of Wilder’s play about a close-knit community in small-town America. “With this urgent sense of ‘I have to not waste this.’”Transposing the heart of the American classic to Wales, this new production also marks the launch of Welsh National Theatre, a hugely ambitious company formed – and financed – by Sheen in response to the collapse of the former National Theatre Wales. “Opening night is going to be more than just the opening night of a play,” saysRussell T Davies, the show’s creative associate. “I think in 10 years, we’ll be having a marvellous celebration that all began with Our Town.”Welsh directors are working in studio spaces, which limits the sort of stories we’re telling in WalesMichael SheenThe creation of Welsh National Theatre is a galvanising statement of intent, particularly given the increasing number of theatres in Wales facing cuts and closures. Aiming to champion big stories on big stages, the new venture stands up against the continual devaluing of the arts, with a recent cross-party report finding that Wales spends less on culture thanalmost every other European nation(the only country lower is Greece). Alongside the closure of National Theatre Wales, recent years have seen significant cuts to beloved institutions including Welsh National Opera, Theatr Clwyd and Theatr Na nÓg. Despite an abundance of talented writers and performers in Wales, the theatrical ecosystem has not been blossoming with hope.View image in fullscreen‘It was an emergency situation’ … Michael Sheen.Photograph: Felicity McCabe/The GuardianNow into that picture bursts Welsh NationalTheatre, a company fuelled by the desire to create large-scale platforms for Welsh talent, at home and internationally, and to influence and expand the Welsh canon. Sheen says he wanted to “go back to basics” with a company that blends a community focus with grand, global ambition, “to attract and build an audience, and use that as an engine to address the more infrastructural problems. Like directors being able to take a step up to bigger stages and playwrights being able to write the plays they want to write, rather than having to be too limited by practicalities.”The new company’s opening season sees Our Town followed by Owain & Henry, a new play by Iphigenia in Splott’s writer Gary Owen. A co-production with theWalesMillennium Centre, the show will once again star Sheen, this time as Owain Glyndŵr, the 15th-century Welsh separatist who raised a rebellion against King Henry IV. Matthew Rhys will then lead Mark Jenkins’s Playing Burton, a thorny tribute to the great Welsh actor Richard Burton. “You build upwards,” Sheen says of his plans for the company, “looking at rediscovering Welsh plays, but also looking for world drama that could be adapted for Wales.”The idea to launch Welsh National Theatre with Our Town began with the actor’s desire to give a larger platform to the show’s director, Francesca Goodridge, also artistic director of Cardiff’s Sherman theatre. “One of the challenges we have in Wales is for Welsh directors to work on main stages,” says Sheen. “They’re working in studio spaces and the knock-on effect is that writers write plays for smaller casts. That limits the sort of stories we’re telling in Wales.” The pair met on Nye, Tim Price’s grand tale of the NHS, which Goodridge co-directed with Rufus Norris for the show’s revival, and in which Sheen played Labour politician Aneurin “Nye” Bevan. Sheen had seen Goodridge’s work before on Richard Mylan’s unflinching show about drug addiction, Sorter, at Grand Theatre Swansea, where Our Town will open, as well as on Patrick Hamilton’s nihilistic thriller Rope, at Theatr Clwyd. “He said: ‘I love what you do, and I’d love to see it on a bigger scale,’” Goodridge says, and laughs. “I was like: ‘Yeah, me too.’”Sheen describes Goodridge’s plays as “terrific, but I could see she was theatrically straining at the leash. So I said: why don’t we do something together? By me being in it, it can be on a main stage.” He means this entirely without ego. Sheen is simply, as Davies notes, “a man who makes things happen”.View image in fullscreenFrancesca Goodridge directs actor Matthew Trevannion.Photograph: Helen MurrayFor Goodridge, who is drawn to large ensemble and movement-led pieces, transposing the essence of Wilder’s fictional Grover’s Corners to Wales seemed obvious; the community already felt familiar to her. “You’re seeing two mums gossiping in the garden,” she says. “The kids who start to fancy each other in school. The guy delivering the milk. The routines. It feels like where I grew up.” Goodridge was raised in Fforestfach, Swansea, on the same street as her sister and uncle. “If we were out of milk, I’d go two doors up,” she says. “This play is purposefully saying: we’re an ordinary town. Then in the third act, it tells you that everything you’d thought was mundane is actually what builds all the extraordinary moments of your life.” It is about the details you miss, the things you forget to pay attention to, but which collectively make up a life worth living. “The smell of my mum’s kitchen,” Goodridge says. “Watching my niece grow up.” She hopes audiences will “leave wanting to call the person they love”.As the Welsh cast have been exploring the American play, the fit has felt just right. “I think it’s perfect for a Welsh accent,” says Sheen, “because the language is quite lyrical, quite sing-songy.” Davies, who directed Sheen in a local youth theatre production aged 24, when the actor was in his teens, has been liaising with the Wilder estate to “ease the production into a bit more of a Welsh idiom,” he says. “They protect the play beautifully, so they obviously don’t want things changed too much.” His initial suggestions of switching words to better fit cultural norms – like changing baseball for rugby – were gently dismissed, “because that’s what Wilder wrote”, Davies says, “and I was never there to trample on his words.” What they decided, Davies says, is that it feels “like a Welsh community in America, like we have in Patagonia”.A head of drama at ITV said, people don’t like the Welsh – so I’ve always quietly fought that fightRussell T DaviesThey started to think more imaginatively about how this adaptation might work. “We’ve got the beauty of being able to use our own language,” says Goodridge. One significant decision to help the play fit the Welsh cast has been to translate the hymns. “Hearing them all sing like a big Welsh choir,” Goodridge smiles, touching her neck, “your hair stands on end.” The show has a cast of 18 Welsh actors, a rare and wonderful thing. In the 90s, Davies remembers, he was told to take Welsh characters out of his writing. “A head of drama at ITV said people don’t like the Welsh,” he recalls. “So I’ve always quietly fought that fight. But it takes someone who’s not quiet, like Michael, to lead the way.” Now, being involved in such a grand Welsh story, Davies says, gives him “immense pride”.The play can be misread as twee, with its stage manager (Sheen) open-heartedly introducing the town’s jumble of characters. But to see only that is to miss the play’s muscle. “Wilder’s using this stereotypical idea of small-town life in order to tell a story that is much steelier and harder to be confronted by,” says Sheen. The events of the play end just before the first world war and Wilder was writing it just before the second world war. “The rivers are rising and there’s a sense of something coming,” Sheen says, “of people suffering and it not being addressed. I think Wilder was warning people about the rise of fascism, saying all this could get washed away. But I don’t think the point of it is to say it’s tragic.” When a core character dies, Sheen says, “the point is to go: how did they live?”As Goodridge and Sheen started considering staging the show, National Theatre Wales was in the process of crumbling, after Arts Council Wales took away 100% of its funding. “There was a lot of discontent within the Welsh artistic community,” Sheen says, remembering the rehearsals for Nye where all the Welsh actors were discussing their opinions on “what had happened and why, and what should happen now”. His own production ofThe Passion, staged across his home town of Port Talbot with more than 1,000 local volunteers, would be the final production in National Theatre Wales’s 2011 opening season. The organisation had been struggling for some time, but its closure still left a huge absence in Welsh theatre. It was unclear whether anything would be able to rise from its ashes.I paid for whatever needed paying for, did whatever was needed to get the ball rollingMichael Sheen“No way was I going to get involved,” says Sheen, “but I got a sense of an emergency situation. It was such a tortuous journey to get a national theatre in Wales in the English language in the first place. It felt like a window of opportunity and once that window closed, it would be much harder to get that momentum going again.”There was no public money available; the Arts Council wouldn’t fund something untested. “I realised that ultimately I had to do it,” Sheen says, matter-of-factly. “I’m the one who can open doors, and I don’t need to be paid.” The actor is known for putting his money behind causes he cares about, including recently spending £100,000to pay off £1m of debtfor people in south Wales. Fronting his own money for National Theatre Wales, he “paid for whatever needed paying for, did whatever was needed to get the ball rolling”.The company got a little transitional funding that had previously gone to National Theatre Wales, set up as a completely new company – “the previous organisation brought a lot of baggage with it,” Sheen says – and secured funding for the opening season from the Colwinston Charitable Trust. They also made partnerships with BBC Studios and Bad Wolf, the production company behind Doctor Who. Sheen doesn’t want them to be vulnerable by relying too heavily on one funding source. “We’re looking for funding from all sorts of places,” he says, “and I’m still underwriting stuff. That’s the way we’ll keep moving forwards.”View image in fullscreenSheen and Goodridge with the Our Town ensemble.Photograph: Helen MurrayDoing what he can to make this company possible seems to be a basic instinct to Sheen. He has a clarity of vision that appears to whittle down to the idea that if he thinks something should be done, and he has the ability to do it, he will throw himself into it entirely. This translates into his wider understanding of community, which forms the centrifugal force behind much of what he does with his money and time. “As I’ve got older,” Sheen says, “it’s become clearer to me that at some point in your life, you’re going to need help, and at that point, one has to hope that help will be there. That is what community is. We all need help at some point, so we should all think about giving it at some point as well.”This opening show has also been made possible through its co-production with the Rose theatre in Kingston, south-west London, where Our Town will finish after touring Wales. Sheen partly modelled this on the success of Nye, co-produced by the National Theatre and Wales Millennium Centre. That play demonstrated “the real appetite”, Sheen says, for a big story on a big stage, with its size only manageable through the collaboration of multiple theatres. “Co-producing is essential at the moment,” says the Rose’s artistic director Christopher Haydon. “The finances of the industry generally mean it’s incredibly hard for any theatre to produce on their own.” Co-production also enables greater ambition, Haydon points out. “It’s one of the largest shows the Rose has put on in a long time,” he says.“Scale is important,” Goodridge agrees. “We have big stories to tell.”‘It’s an outrage’: stars join fight against cuts as Welsh arts go into meltdownRead moreBefore it gets to London, passing Llandudno and Mold on its way, Our Town will open at the Grand theatre in Swansea. “When you read a play, you read it in your own accent,” says Goodridge. “So you see your own community. In my head, this has always been a Swansea town.” The Grand, close to where Goodridge grew up, and Sheen’s closest theatre now, runs without an artistic director; instead the councilbooks touring shows. Starting the production and the new company there matters, says Davies: “Now you can be 15 years old living in Swansea and seeing things happening on your doorstep. See the rehearsals are just down the road on the seafront. See local actors are in it. Friends of your mums and dads are in it.”This is part of the hope of Welsh National Theatre: to build talent and belief and possibility. “That’s how you create a community,” Davies says. “That’s how you create ambition for generations to come.”Our Town is a Rose theatre andWelsh National Theatreco-production. The show is at Swansea Grand theatre to 31 January and transfers to the Rose theatre in Kingston, London, 26 February to 28 March, after runs at Venue Cymru, Llandudno, 3 to 7 February and Theatr Clwyd, Mold, 11 to 21 February.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreMichael SheenWalesRussell T DaviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Rookie – a police proceduralIn an era of TikTok and YouTube, teens have never watched old-school television less – yet zoomers love this broadcast drama seriesAlaina DemopoulosSun 18 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 09.05 ESTShareHannah Leef knows she should be studying for midterms this week. But she has to also make time to watch her all-time favorite episode of The Rookie, an ABC procedural drama about Los Angeles cops. (That would be season two, episode eight.) The 15 year old, who lives in New England, calls the show her “hyperfixation”.Leef first watched the entire series, which is currently in its eighth season, in three weeks. “Which is, like, not healthy,” she admits. She keeps up with new episodes while constantly rewatching the series – which she’s done 10 times now. She’s hooked “about 12 or 13” of her friends on The Rookie, and one of them ploughed through the entire series in a week: “She did not sleep.”Leef is not alone in her adoration. As the Los Angeles Timesreportedlast week, the network procedural has an unlikely fan base in young people. According to Nielsen data, it was themost-streamedshow among young people under 18 for all broadcast television series last year, beating out Abbott Elementary and High Potential (but not streaming only shows like Stranger Things). Dwayne Johnson recently took his preteen daughter, another superfan, on a tour of the show’s set. Creator Alexi Hawley, who declined a request to comment for this article, told The Times that he’s used to parents telling him how much their kids love the series.It’s an unlikely success story. In an era of TikTok and YouTube, teens have never watched old-school television less. According to Nielson data, 90% of kids’ TV time comes from “non-traditional” options (mostly streaming services). The Rookie is the type of police procedural that’s been a network stalwart for generations – and yet zoomers love it.But the Rookie’s official TikTok page has over 2.9m followers (for comparison the official accounts for The White Lotus and The Last Of Us both have less than 150,000, Stranger Things has 8.1m). Many teens discover the show on social media first. Jade Amirah Lewis, a 16-year-old from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, first encountered the show on YouTube, where she watched a few clipped scenes. “I noticed it actually has a vibe sort of like The Office,” Lewis said. “It’s very comical in some situations, but it also pans to more serious tones. You have time for every emotion in the show.”Lewis, who wants to be an FBI agent when she grows up, finds its procedural format comforting. Most of the drama gets wrapped up in a tight hour. “Then you get to see it all over again next week,” Lewis said. “It’s a nice cycle.”Fronted by gen X actor Nathan Fillion – who starred in Firefly, an early-aughts space drama that aired before these Rookie fans were born – the show centers around John Nolan, a divorced, middle-aged dad who uproots his life to become a LAPD officer. The oldest in his class, Nolan navigates generational divides with his fellow rookies while they serve on the force. There’s a long, slow-burn romance between a rookie and her training officer but it’s far from a rom com: in season two a killer kidnaps a cop, counting down the days until he murders her while the rest of the crew races to the rescue.View image in fullscreenSuperfan Jada Amirah Lewis.Photograph: Jada Amirah LewisKatie Campione, a senior television and labor reporter at Deadline, says that the show’s popularity fits into a larger trend of younger audiences gravitating toward long running shows, many of which are decades old: Gilmore Girls, New Girl, Grey’s Anatomy, Criminal Minds.“You get to spend hundreds of hours with the same characters and get to know them,” Campione said. “You just don’t see that a lot nowadays on TV.”Mariah Smith, another young fan, runs a Rookie fan account on TikTok that boasts over 60,000 followers. Now 22, the Memphis college student started watching the series when she was 19. For years, she has never made plans on Tuesday nights, when the show airs. Smith has season tickets to her beloved NBA team, the Grizzlies. But when they played on Tuesdays, she’d sell the tickets, so she could watch the show. (The Rookie recently changed time slots from Tuesday nights to Mondays, creating more NBA conflicts, a nightmare for Smith.)But even though it’s an appointment-to-view show, it doesn’t necessarily take up too much brainspace, “It’s easy to pay attention to it and do something else at the same time, whether that be scrolling on your phone or something else,” says Campione.One of the most surprising things about the show’s popularity among young people is the show’s positive portrayal of the police. Younger Americans are themost likely to distrust law enforcementand network police procedurals have long been criticised as “copaganda” intended to subtly shape viewers’ attitudes.Hawley, the showrunner, said that the police murder of George Floyd changed how he portrayed cops. “I tried to approach from a place of having cops trying to do the right thing,” Hawleytold the Guardian in 2021of the show’s earlier seasons. After Floyd’s murder, “It felt like being solely aspirational wasn’t good enough any more, that we were showing a version of policing that was alien to many people.” Consultants from Color of Change, a racial justice organization were brought on as advisers.In one plot line, a racist cop who profiles suspects of color should be fired – but instead, he gets a slap on the wrist and stays on the force. It’s no happy ending, but it is realistic. “The show is trying to start these conversations about how people feel that law enforcement has failed them,” Campione said. “These are topics that a lot of people wish were being tackled in real life to a more substantial degree.”‘The uprisings opened up the door’: the TV cop shows confronting a harmful legacyRead moreThe Rookie airs after Leef goes to bed, so she wakes up early the next morning and watches it before doing anything else. For her birthday, her best friend gave her a painted vinyl record with a track on it that’s played during an emotional scene in the series. She hung it on her wall, because she does not have a record player. (“I don’t think anyone has record players,” she said.) She forgets the song title, she tells me, but thinks it’s either Breathe Freely by Uncle Leo or If I Ain’t Got You by Alicia Keyes, both of which are on the soundtrack.Eric Winter, who plays Sergeant Tim Bradford on the show, runs a rum brand called Palm Republic. Sometimes, he does promotional meet and greets to market his product. Leef really wants her dad to go to one. Sadly, she would not be allowed inside: “You have to be 21 or older.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Allen listens, confused then hurt, for almost two minutes as a presumed husband on the other end asks to open up the relationship. Fans made the obvious connection to Allen’s own marriage to David Harbour, the cop from Stranger Things (who is perhaps equally well known for histasteful Brooklyn townhouse). The two dabbled in polyamory, goes the tabloid story, only to have Harbour break the rules and hurt Allen in the end.The album is good – pretty and catchy, with an appealing edge of anger. But public reaction went beyond appreciation for the work. The breakup became the object of gruesome rubbernecking. It was a juicy story about one of the oldest topics: infidelity, betrayal, an affair.I watched with interest, since I was about to publish a novel, The Ten Year Affair, which is a comedic take on the same topic. The book has a dual timeline structure and sends up the well-worn tropes: the sleazy hotel room, the champagne bucket, the escalating lies told to spouses. The structure is experimental; the timelines converge and diverge, beginning, toward the end, to blur. In fiction anyway, infidelity is infinitely iterative, a way to frame and explore contemporary life, a setup with implicit stakes – a shared home and maybe children.Someone once joked to me that the Odyssey is an affair story: Odysseus spent all that time with Circe, after all. Man meets wife; man cheats on wife. It’s a story we’ve been telling for a long time. In recent years we have seen the reprisal of the academic affair novel (Julia May Jonas’s satirical rompVladimir; Emily Adrian’s sly and witty Seduction Theory); the rise of the polyamory novel (Raven Leilani’s electricLuster, in which a young Black woman navigates the messiness of moving in with her boyfriend and his wife); and the throuple blockbuster (Sally Rooney’sConversations With FriendsandIntermezzo).A recent entry I enjoyed was Andrew Miller’s Booker-shortlistedThe Land in Winter. Set in rural England in 1962, it captures the tone and texture of the era. The story follows two couples: country doctor Eric and his posh wife Irene; and Oxford dropout turned gentleman farmer Bill and his wife Rita, a former nightclub dancer. Both women are pregnant and strike up a friendship, visiting each other in the bleak, empty days of a record-cold winter. Meanwhile, Eric is having an affair with a rich woman named Alison. “Was this thing he had with her a vulgar bourgeois nonsense,” he thinks, “Or was it the one thing in his life that felt like life, that he was in fact proud of?”The book is retrospective, a historical novel about a culture on the precipice of change. At the other end of the tonal spectrum is Miranda July’s hilarious, quirkyAll Fours. One of the most celebrated books of the past few years, it may also be fairly described as a perimenopause novel. It tells the story of an unnamed narrator who leaves her husband and child at home in LA to take a cross-country road trip, only to find herself holed up in a cheap motel a few towns over pursuing an affair with a young Hertz employee named Davey. The narrator’s crisis has been triggered by reaching her mid-40s and realising her sex drive might decline. Her grandmother, she keeps remembering, “put herself in a trash bag” and jumped out of the window of her apartment when she hit 50.Polyamory emerges as a big theme, an idealised fix-all for the problem of monogamy that ends up creating problems of its ownFor much of the book, the narrator comes as close as you can to cheating without technically doing it. She and Davey take walks together, lie next to each other in the motel room, make chaste but intense physical contact, and in one harrowing scene, observe each other in the bathroom. The reader waits for the moment the narrator will finally go for it but, ultimately, something stranger happens. Instead of sleeping with Davey, she sleeps with an older woman, a friend of Davey’s mother with whom Davey had an ambiguously abusive sexual relationship when he was a teenager. The move is thrillingly bizarre and dark – instead of the young man she’s obsessed over for 200 pages, this odd, older woman.Other recent examples are less subversive. InLiarsby Sarah Manguso, a woman named Jane discovers that her husband John has cheated, and responds with the expected rage. The story of their disintegrating marriage is told in short, brutal fragments: “Those days, when John ignored or dismissed me, my mind told me I felt bad because I gained weight or because of a bad book review. I refused to look at the real reason.”Similarly,The Möbius Bookby Catherine Lacey reads like a postmortem. Half of it is nonfiction and the other half fiction. The gimmick is that it may be flipped over and started from either side. In the fiction half, lines about love and sex come off as stilted or constructed. This seemed to me a clever way of making a point about the language of fiction, its limits and its tendency toward banality. “There you go with your romantic one-liners,” one character says to another.But ultimately, both The Möbius Book and Liars boil with a resentment that undermines their innovation. The authors’ judgments are on every page. The cheating man in The Möbius Book is not given a name, but referred to disdainfully as “The Reason”. Both books refuse to see the conflict from any angle but anger; both refuse to plunge any deeper. Reading them, I wondered, is it the novelist’s job to moralise?Lauren Elkin’sScaffoldingis less judgmental. It takes desire seriously – its main character, Anna, is a psychoanalyst with a particular interest in Jacques Lacan. It is also formally inventive, following a couple living in an apartment in Belleville, Paris, as well as a couple who lived there decades before. Both couples grapple with the push-pull of independence and stability, of home and freedom. Both grapple with affairs.The two narratives rhyme in places, or echo each other. Elkin uses the dual structure as a way of speaking to the universality of these problems, their intractability, and to relate them to everyday life. Placed within a world of home repairs and wall calendars and glasses in the sink, the problems of longtime monogamy are presented as ordinary features of life.Each generation writes their own novels of domestic repression. As millennials settle into marriage, and as those marriages fray, we will surely only see more. The millennial version tends to explore new relationship models, with polyamory emerging as a big theme, an idealised fix-all for the problem of monogamy that ends up creating problems of its own. Promisingly, it also tends to centre women and allows them to be fallible, funny and dynamic.The enduring appeal of the genre might be as simple as voyeurism, but I think it also has to do with ever-evolving perspectives on longing, ageing and fear of death. “The most interesting part of infidelity isn’t will they or won’t they,” remarks a character in Scaffolding. “It’s everything else around it.”The Ten Year Affair by Erin Somers is published by Canongate.

The fightback begins hereThe Friends of AttentionSun 18 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 18 Jan 2026 13.47 ESTShareIn the last 15 years, a linked series of unprecedented technologies have changed the experience of personhood across most of the world. It is estimated thatnearly 70% of the human population of the Earth currently possesses a smartphone, and these devices constitute about95% of internet access-points on the planet.Globally, on average, people seem to spend close tohalf their waking hourslooking at screens, and among young people in the rich world the number is a good deal higher than that.History teaches that new technologies always make possible new forms of exploitation, and this basic fact has been spectacularly exemplified by the rise of society-scale digital platforms. It has been driven by a remarkable new way of extracting money from human beings: call it “human fracking”. Just as petroleum frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergents into the ground to force a little monetisable black gold to the surface, human frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergent into our faces (in the form of endless streams of addictive slop and maximally disruptive user-generated content), to force a slurry of human attention to the surface, where they can collect it, and take it to market.Fracking (of the Earth and of our minds) produces tectonic instability, toxicity and the despoliation of our landscapes, natural and social. We now know that the heedless exploitation of our external environment has been so relentless and irresponsible that human survival on Earth has been placed in actual jeopardy. The new “gold rush” into theinnerenvironment of the human psyche is well on its way to effecting parallel, if even more insidious destruction.The stakes are existential. And that is because, rightly understood, our actual human “attention” – the thing the frackers want, in the form of our eyes on their screens – is nothing less than our ability to care, our ability to think, our ability to give our minds, time and senses to ourselves, the world and each other. To commodify that is to commodify our very beings. The problem isn’t “phones”, and it isn’t “social media”. The problem is human fracking, a world-spanning land-grab into human consciousness – which big tech is treating as a vast, unclaimed territory, ripe for sacking and empire.That’s the bad news. Thegoodnews is that novel forms of exploitation produce novel forms of resistance. What fills the coffers of thesix largest corporations on the planetis nothing other than the stuff of our humanity. Which is to say this new fight for our attention stands in a long line of clashes between those who are willing to reduce people (their labour, their eyeballs) to cash value and those who insist on a higher view of human flourishing. This history is long and complex, and often painful. But it tells us this much: we can fight back. Indeed, we must.We must insist that human attention is ours, and we will use it to make the worlds we want to live inSo what is to be done about this new kind of human exploitation that is harming us – harmingchildrenandadults,compromising our deliberative politicsand ourpsychological wellbeing? Regulatory efforts are piecemeal and actively thwarted by the powerful interests in play. Psychopharmacological fixes for the ever-expanding damage merely monetise the destruction in a complementary way and render us better able to submit to conditions that are palpably at odds with human flourishing. How to confront a problem that is both unspeakably intimate and unthinkably extensive?The answer is clear: we, the actual people of this planet, must come together in decisive solidarity; we must say no to the human frackers, and do so by insisting, in new ways, that human attention is human, and it is ours, and we will use it to make the worlds in which we want to live. In other words, we need amovement.Think that sounds quixotic? Well, keep in mind that’s how actual change actually happens. And it can happen fast. The environmental movement as we know it did not exist in 1950, but by 1970 it was a global force. In 1946 Reynolds Tobacco was using doctors to promote cigarettes. Fewer than 20 years later, the American Medical Association and the US surgeon general publicly averred that smoking caused lung cancer.And the changes get much bigger than that. Precious few do-gooders devoted themselves to environmental politics in 1925. That’s because “environmental politics” wasn’t even a thing. It took a cultural shift (and the work of advocates such as Rachel Carson) across the mid-20th century to establish the physical environment – the unity of land, water, and air that produces shared life – as a politically tractable object around which diverse groups could organise. This is to say that the very structures of politics, not just our beliefs and hopes, are themselves emergent forms. New things come into being, and old things pass away.Where attention is concerned, there are mounting signs that we are reaching an inflection point. People of all sorts, Maga Republicans and Mamdani progressives, hipsters in Portland and evangelicals in Arkansas– people who don’t agree aboutanything– all actually do agree that something is totally wrong with a world in which everyone spends nearly all their time scrolling endlessly through the algorithmic feeds of their social media, a world where military-grade technology and trillion-dollar corporations take aim at children, and feed them whatever it takes to keep them hooked.You can only abuse people so much, and then, eventually, they turn, they rise, they insist onsomething else. Already politicians on theright and the leftare identifying this issue as one that moves the electorate. In 30 years, we will look back, and this era – the wild west of the tech princes’ smash-and-grab into our hearts, souls and relationships – will be difficult to explain to our grandkids. “How did you all let that happen?” they will ask. And we’ll have to say: “It’s hard to explain: it happened before we noticed; it was so much fun, especially at first; it took us time to figure out what was going on … ”But we are figuring it out. We write as representatives of a fast-growing and increasingly well-organised movement, focused on pushing back against the human frackers, and giving shape to a new politics of human attention. At the heart of our efforts? The formation of broadcoalitionsdevoted to the politics of human attention, the practice of diverse forms ofstudythat call forth the life-giving powers of the mind and senses, and the promotion ofsanctuary spacesfor the protection and cultivation of the kinds of attention that make life good. We call this workattention activism.Our claim? That all of us already have the tools to resist the frackers, because all of us already have things we do and care about that put us beyond the reach of the algorithms. We all already know the deepest truth: that true human attentionisn’tthe click and swipe of screen time. True human attention is love, curiosity, daydreaming and taking care of ourselves and others.Yes, new technologies give rise to new kinds of exploitation and resistance. But new forms of exploitation can even give rise to genuinely new forms of politics. You couldn’t brutalise an industrial proletariat before the factory system. Steam engines set the conditions of possibility for this development. They weren’t themselves a “problem”, of course; they gleamed and were precise and powerful. Who could see them operate without awe? But they also created a world in which it was possible to aggregate and extract physical labour from human beings in a revolutionary way. Along the way, they created a new kind of political subject,Homo economicus, a person who had been reduced, in the calculus of modernity, to “labuor value”. Actual revolutions followed – and a new kind of politics was born which reflected a new world of industrial labour, and new forms of labour solidarity, such as unions and workers’ parties.The new system of human fracking is turning all of us into attentional subjects in a powerful new way.Homo attentusis the end user of every networked system – economic, political, expressive. With this new form of life comes, as we have discovered, appalling new vulnerability. But we are on the brink of understanding the new power that has come into our hands in the fracklands. We believe a new kind of politics beckons. What will it look like? It is hard to say. And there are reasons to be fearful. But if we, the people, can take up the banner of a new kind of freedom movement – a movement for the true freedom of attention itself, what we callattensity– and deploy our truly human attention in new ways, with a new understanding of the stakes, we can defy the frackers, and insist on creating, together, a human world.D Graham Burnettis professor of history atPrinceton University.Alyssa Lohis a film-maker.

That’s partly the point of this stab in that direction by Mark Carey, which asks why Hill has been so thoroughly expunged from our comedy pantheon. The reasons are widely known, of course, and rehearsed again here: the former best-loved man on television traded in a humour many modern viewers find sexist, racist and sad. One might hope for greater insight from a 100-minute play on the subject but, for all the pleasures along the way, it doesn’t have a great deal to add.Carey’s play with songs flashes back through Hill’s life from his last days as a “mad recluse” talking to a visiting solicitor about his will. With all other roles played with spirit by Georgie Taylor, we meet Hill’s dad “the Captain”, who sold “rubber johnnies” for a living, and find Benny writing letters to his auntie from the cafes he frequented in France. Between scenes, a babble of online voices debates his vexed legacy. Taylor takes on an occasional narrator role as a Ben Elton-alike 80s comic, whose generation here stands accused of cruelly – and hypocritically – casting Hill beyond the entertainment pale.But in its closing moments, the play seems to concur with the idea that Hill’s comedy, of old men perving on buxom beauties, had had its day. There are gestures towards a vindication of his oeuvre, notably in one sketch teasing us with a racist east Asian caricature, and listing all the other now-heralded acts who performed this type of material too. But when they might mount a more substantial case for the comic’s defence, neither Hill nor the play get far beyond “a joke’s either funny or it’s not” and allegations of PC gone mad.The play doesn’t dig deep into the personal life of this “saucy boy who never grew up”. What we do get is a vivid reminder of what millions once found hilarious, courtesy of a performance by Carey himself in which Hill remains elusive behind the winking, the smirking and the compulsive quips.At White Bear theatre, London, until 24 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

On a vast, empty stage – uncluttered by amplifiers, microphones or any of the usual things that anchor a live performance – the formerTalking Headsfrontman is still full of twitchy energy.Thankfully, there’s no spontaneous combustion. The template for tonight’s spectacle remains the legendaryStop Making Sense tourof 1984–viaAmerican Utopia–where the show is built in increments. It starts slowly with Heaven, from Talking Heads’ 1979 album Fear of Music, a song that has lost none of its existential power.If the 73-year-old singer and polymath is agnostic about the afterlife, he cares passionately about the here and now. The first visual backdrop we see is of the Earth, “the only planet we’ve got”. Over the course of two hours at theBrisbaneEntertainment Centre, what fans get feels like a ticket to watch the world burn.View image in fullscreenSolo songs may not be what most of the crowd have come for, but they don’t disrupt the momentum of a superbly paced and choreographed show.Photograph: Ashlee Sekulich/Frontier TouringOn Heaven, he’s joined by three core members of his band: Ray Suen on violin (later, guitar), Kely Pinheiro on cello (later, bass) and Daniel Mintseris, playing a synthesiser worn around his waist. Afterwards, other musicians file on, with various percussionists also wearing bits of kit.It allows the entire troupe to perform more like a marching band. With nothing tied down, everyone is in perpetual motion. Behind them, video screens project them in a variety of settings. On (Nothing But) Flowers, they’re in an empty department store, then a cornfield; on the heaving funk of Slippery People, they’re being tossed around in the ocean.Paranoia and polyrhythms: Talking Heads’ greatest songs – ranked!Read moreThe band is impressively multiracial and gendered, a theme for the night. “What if we all judged people by their appearances?” Byrne asks rhetorically. There’s an instant reply: “You’re very sexy, David!” Briefly, he breaks character and cracks up, then parries that that is the perfect example of what he’s talking about. Appearances can be deceptive.He also tells us that punk is all about love and kindness these days. I’m not so sure about that – to me, it sounds suspiciously like the hippies who deluded themselves that handing out flowers would beat Nixon. As Trump’s deputy chief-of-goons Stephen Millerreminded us, we now live in a world “governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power”.But we all need a little hope, and Byrne’s humanity is endearing. What’s surprising is his vulnerability. On My Apartment Is My Friend (one of a brace of songs from his new album,Who Is the Sky?), the video screens give us a grand tour of his New York City pad, a place which has seen the best and worst of him. He admits to living alone, and feeling it.View image in fullscreen‘Perpetual motion’: the musicians are constantly on the move.Photograph: Ashlee Sekulich/Frontier TouringOn an older solo song, T-shirt – an ironic paean to another type of identity politics, where branding is a form of bonding – we get pointed slogans. “Make America Gay Again” brings cheers, “Everyone Watches Women’s Sports” laughter. It’s safe to assume Byrne is unlikely to be playing the renamed Trump-Kennedy Centre any time soon.These solo songs may not be what most of the crowd have come for, but they don’t disrupt the momentum of a superbly paced and choreographed show. No one has cause to complain when nearly half the set is made up of Talking Heads classics, with This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody) the first to bring fans to their feet.After Byrne, the star of the show throughout is Pinheiro, whose playing is the fulcrum of everything. Far more than just replicating Tina Weymouth’s original parts, she brings a harder groove to Houses in Motion, with a new double-time coda. Later, she commands the spotlight again, using cello as a lead instrument on Psycho Killer.The most volatile moment of the set is Life During Wartime, arguably the most prescient and unnerving song of the punk/new wave era ever written. “The sound of gunfire off in the distance / I’m getting used to it now,” Byrne sings, as footage of ICE squads and New York City cops facing off with protesters plays behind him.This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco. It’s terrifyingly real.While Byrne plays, at least there’s a little time for dancing and lovey-dovey. Burning Down the House is the closer, and as it explodes, it reminds us to watch out – you might get what you’re after. It’s a spectacular show. But the spectacle is nothing less than the incineration of the American dream.Explore more on these topicsDavid ByrneTalking HeadsBrisbanePop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

I shouldn’t write a book just because it would be published. You ought to go on until you’ve said everything you’ve got to say, and I’ve reached that point.“I won’t stop writing, because I’ve been a journalist all my life, before I became a novelist. So I shall do journalism, reviews and things like that. But in terms of books, this is my last,”he told the Telegraph.Departures(s), which centres on his role as go-between for two anonymised friends, Stephen and Jean, who became lovers but then separated, has been described as a hybrid of memoir, essay and fiction, bringing together many of the themes of Barnes’s work, including memory, love, friendship, ageing and death.The author, who was diagnosed six years ago with a rare type of blood cancer which is managed by taking chemotherapy in pill form daily, said of his illness: “Right now, it’s a score draw.”He added: “But as long as it continues to be stable, it just contributes to a weakening of the organism. And I’m just used to it,” he said.Widowed aged 62 when his wife, the literary agent Pat Kavanagh, died from a brain tumour in 2008, Barnes recently revealed he had secretly remarried last August to Rachel Cugnoni, a publisher he had known for almost 30 years and who had been his partner for the past eight years.British Library acquires archive of rural life writer and essayist Ronald BlytheRead moreHis first novel, Metroland, was published in 1980 but his breakthrough came in 1984 with his third book, Flaubert’s Parrot, which was shortlisted for the Booker prize. He was shortlisted twice more, for England, England and Arthur & George, before winning the Booker for The Sense of an Endingin 2011. He also writes crime fiction under the name Dan Kavanagh.He told the Telegraph: “I’ve led a lucky life. If you’d told me when I was 30 I’d write lots of books which a lot of people like to read, I’d have been staggered. So I’m very pleased about that.”Asked if he feared death, Barnes, an avowed atheist, replied: “I used to be terrified of death, but after spending about 10 years with a body falling apart or not behaving well, I don’t feel resigned to it. But it’s obviously different when you die in your 80s from dying in your 40s or 50s. But losing your life when you’re just holding on … who can tell?”Explore more on these topicsJulian BarnesFictionnewsShareReuse this content"

The restaurant serves fish and seafood straight off local boats and there’s a large lawned area around the pool that is ideal for kids. Down at the harbour, boat trips head out each day to spot pods of dolphins, and the long-distance Rota Vicentina (Fishermen’s Trail) runs through the town, offering fabulous hiking.Doubles from £105 B&B,memmohotels.comPelion, Thessaly, GreeceView image in fullscreenChorto village on the Pelion peninsula.Photograph: Georgios Tsichlis/AlamyThe gloriously unspoilt Pelion peninsula is home to little more than holiday villas owned by wealthy Athenians, and small, family-run hotels. ThePounda Paouis one, set on a hillside above the sea, with rooms linked by shady paths and leafy sitting areas, and a pool terrace with glorious sea views. A car is essential (the nearest village, Argalasti is a few minutes’ drive away); half the fun of a visit to Pelion is following the quiet country roads to hilltop villages with excellent tavernas, or small coves with barely anyone else there. The village of Chorto, around 15 minutes’ drive (or a two-mile hike), has a good selection of tavernas, although dinners at Pounda Paou – home-cooked, hearty dishes including slow-cooked meats, vegetable stews and handmade pastries – are not to be missed.From £399pp a week B&B,ionianislandholidays.comElounda, CreteView image in fullscreenThe Innside Elounda, which opens in MayElounda’s transition from sleepy fishing village to five-star haven has been one of the biggest changes on Crete, but in spite of numerous glitzy hotels, the area remains extraordinarily beautiful. The village is a patchwork of tavernas and stone houses clustered behind a harbour that opens on to the vivid blue lagoon that separates the mainland from Spinalonga island. The opening of the newInnsideEloundaon 1 May means this gorgeous slice of Cretan coastline will now be affordable (once again) for mere mortals. It will have chic, comfortable rooms stepping down the hillside (most with sparkling sea views), two restaurants, outdoor yoga classes and works by local artisans dotted around the communal spaces. And it is perfectly placed for exploring some of Crete’s ancient sites, including Knossos.Doubles from £92room-only,melia.comTučepi, Dalmatian coast, CroatiaView image in fullscreenThe Makarska Riviera is fringed with quiet beaches and pine forest.Photograph: Dario Bajurin/AlamyIn between Croatia’s glittering islands and big draws such as Dubrovnik and Split, the Makarska Riviera stays happily under the radar – a long stretch of coast fringed with quiet beaches, pine forest and small resorts that attract far fewer crowds than their glitzier siblings. Tučepi is one of them, with traditional stone houses and a handful of hotels scattered along a stretch of pebbly beach, with a palm-lined promenade edged with seafood restaurants and traditionalkonobas(taverns).Villa Andreaopens out directly on to the prom, with 18 comfortable, unfussy rooms (it’s worth upgrading from a classic to a standard room for £17.50 a night).

Cooking classes, horse-riding and quad-biking are all on offer, along with visits to Essaouira’s picturesque medina, with its art galleries, cafes and stalls selling everything from Berber rugs to leather goods. Haggling is still expected, but it’s less of a competitive sport than elsewhere, while the town’s rooftop bars are ideal for sundowners. Back at base, the restaurant serves local dishes – grilled chicken, garlicky prawns, lamb tagine – with aplomb.Doubles from £122 B&B,kasbahdeau.comSalento, Puglia, ItalyView image in fullscreenThe pool at Masseria FontanelleThe Maldives in Italy? It might sound like an exaggeration, but the white-sand beaches and glassily clear seas that roll out along the protected coastline of the Litorale di Ugento natural park really do have that desert island feel.

The underground cavern spa offers restorative treatments, and on summer evenings there’s outdoor cinema, with classic Puglian dishes in the restaurant terrace and a gin bar to explore.

We’d been exploring Surabaya when we heard about an island off the coast called Madura that could be reached via ferry. It didn’t turn up in any of the tourist guides, which appealed to us, being adventurous types. We knew Madura wouldn’t be touristy, but expected there’d be some streets to explore and somewhere to sit down and have a cup of tea.As soon as Madura came into sight, we realised our visit may not have been a great idea. We were expecting to see houses and buildings dot the shore, as well as the hawkers who’d typically crowd around piers in Indonesia with food and wares to sell. There was none of that. It was just a pier next to a tiny village.After disembarking, we set off walking and within 100 metres ran out of houses, surrounded only by rice paddies and farmland. There was nothing to do and nowhere to go, and not even a tree to seek shade under.The kindness of strangers: a Los Angeles bus driver got everyone onboard to sing me happy birthdayRead moreFeeling a little defeated, we sat down at a bench by the side of the road, the sun beating down on us. Before long a young woman in a kebaya and sarong came past. Clearly noticing how out of place we looked, she asked in English if she could help us. We asked her when the next ferry back to Surabaya was coming and she answered that it wasn’t for several hours.She said it was far too hot for us to wait outside all that time – and invited us to her family home.She took us in, sat us down and then returned with a tray of gloriously refreshing cold drinks. We noticed she wasn’t partaking and when we asked why, she explained it was Ramadan and she’s not supposed to be eating or drinking until sunset. We felt uncomfortable drinking when she couldn’t, but she assured us it was OK.She then invited her two brothers, both of whom were studying engineering, to come and speak with us. For the following hours we all sat around the table having a lovely conversation about the world and the things they wanted to do in life. When we finished our first drinks, she brought out more, and kept entertaining us until it was time to bring us back to the pier for the return ferry.For the rest of my life, her wonderful hospitality has been my model of the Muslim faith. I am grateful to her for giving me that wonderful view of human nature, and more optimism about people in general. It was a great gift, one that has stuck with me throughout my life.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

It may even convert you to the joys of tofu itself, should you still be on the fence about the stuff, because its creamy softness is the perfect foil for the intensely savoury, tingly seasoning involved here. It’s also ready in mere minutes.Prep10 minCook7 minServes22 garlic cloves1 small knob fresh root ginger4 spring onionsSalt250g plain tofu(I like a soft one, but see step 3)2 tsp cornflour, or potato or tapioca starch1 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns2 tbsp neutral oil40g pork mince, or beef mince, or a plant-based alternative1 heaped tbsp Sichuan chilli bean paste(also called spicydoubanjiangortoban djan, see step 8)½ tbsp fermented black beans, drained1 tsp chilli flakes, drained if in oil (drizzle this on top, if you prefer)85ml water1 A note on the accompanimentsIf serving this with rice, which is how it’s generally eaten (though you could have it with noodles instead), put that on to cook. It’s also nice with some steamed green vegetables or a cucumber salad on the side. Prepare any accompaniments, and all the ingredients before you begin, because this is a dish that comes together quickly.2 Prep the vegView image in fullscreenPeel and finely chop the garlic, and peel and finely grate the ginger – you’ll need roughly a tablespoon’s worth. Trim off and discard the whiskery ends from the spring onions, and any very dry bits off the tops, then divide them into white and green parts, slice both on the diagonal into roughly 2cm lengths and keep them separate.3 Prep the tofuBring a large pan of salted water to a boil. Cut the tofu into roughly 2½cm chunks – I like the creamy richness of soft or even silken tofu, while others prefer the slight chew of firmer varieties, but any kind should work here, as long as it’s unflavoured. Mix the cornflour (or potato/tapioca starch) and a tablespoon of cold water to make a paste.View image in fullscreen4 Blanch the tofuTurn down the heat under the boiling water, then gently slip in the tofu, keeping the pieces as intact as possible. Simmer gently for a minute, then turn off the heat. Meanwhile, toast half the peppercorns in a dry pan until aromatic, then grind to a powder and set aside.View image in fullscreen5 Flavour the oilPut a wok or a medium frying pan on a medium-high heat, then add the oil. Once it starts to smoke, add the remaining whole peppercorns and fry, stirring, until aromatic; take care not to let them burn. Scoop out and discard the peppercorns, leaving the infused oil in the pan. (You can flavour the oil in advance, if need be.)View image in fullscreen6 Add the minceAdd the meat and fry until brown and crisp – it’s used in such small amounts here that you’re unlikely to miss it if you choose to leave it out.View image in fullscreenAlternatively, soya mince, rehydrated if required, or other plant-based alternatives, or even finely chopped, sauteed mushrooms or aubergines will work well, too.7 Fry the aromaticsView image in fullscreenScoop the mince out of the pan with a slotted spoon, leaving as much oil behind as possible, and transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain. Turn down the heat slightly, then fry the garlic, ginger and spring onion whites for a minute or so, stirring constantly and taking care that they don’t catch and burn.8 Add the flavourings and thickenerView image in fullscreenStir in the bean paste (this is easily found in Chinese supermarkets or online; miso paste, preferably red, makes a decent if not perfect substitute, though if you use that, you’ll need to add a little more chilli), fermented black beans and chilli, fry for 20 seconds, then pour in 85ml cold water and bring to a simmer. Stir in the cornflour paste until well combined.9 Stir in the tofu and serveView image in fullscreenCarefully drain the blanched tofu so it doesn’t break up, then tip it into the wok along with the fried mince. Spoon the sauce over the tofu and meat, disturbing the tofu as little as possible so as to keep it intact, and cook until the sauce thickens. Gently decant into a serving bowl, sprinkle with the reserved ground pepper and spring onion greens, and serve with plain rice.Explore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassMain courseTofuChinese food and drinkPorkMeatRicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The chips areverynice, all crunchingly crisp and yieldingly fluffy in all the right places. All 12 of them were perfect, in fact, stood aloft in their silver serving vessel. “A-giddy-up and giddy-up and get awaaaay,” sings Francis Rossi as I perch on a velvet, pale mustard banquette that’s clearly so very expensive that I shudder every time my greasy paws so much as skim close to touching it.View image in fullscreenThe Core fried chicken at Corenucopia, London SW1 is served with a side of Oasis.Clare Smyth, of three Michelin-starredCorefame, is letting her hair down with this new project,Corenucopia, where she’s cooking a less pricey, more comfort food-focused menu. Expect seafood vol-au-vent, chicken kiev, Barnsley chop and trifle. There’s even a separate potato menu that comes to the table in its own frame, and offers pommes anna, dauphinoise, croquettes, fondant, hasselback and so on. If you order that dover sole, which, incidentally, comes battered and stuffed with lobster mousse, it turns up with its own vinegar menu, also gilt-framed. Balsamic? Barrel-aged sherry? Champagne? “Malt, please,” I said, aware that this was the request of a drab traditionalist.But, while Corenucopia’s decor is determinedly posh, its soundtrack pounds with British dad rock, ranging from the aforementioned Quo to Oasis to Clapton to the Stones. If that sounds a bit confused, well, fans of Core seem to be remarkably clear on the matter, because Smyth’s new joint is currently jam-packed with Michelin-chasing types dying to try her new, relaxed, groovy, “pocket-friendly” outpost. Still, while Core costs £265 per person before wine and service for the seven-course “Seasons” tasting menu, Corenucopia offers starters such as a crispy veal sweetbread for £32 followed by turbot with vin jaune sauce for £64, and desserts such as a profiterole (singular) with Tahitian vanilla cream filling at £22. Add a fig leaf or mezcal negroni, a splurge off the spud list, a glass or two of wine with the savoury courses, followed by a 2010 Château Suduiraut sauternes to go with your profiterole, and you might as well have gone to Core.View image in fullscreen‘A plump little treasure trove’: Corenucopia’s mushroom pie.Even so, the food at Corenucopia is a delight. This is cosseting, decadent, calories-be-damned cooking. Grilled olives on skewers with eel and timut pepper? Absolute bliss. An ornate smoked salmon paté topped with dill jelly and served with mini buttered crumpets? Wonderful. The same goes for the pithivier-style mushroom pie filled with ceps, portobello, parmesan, spinach and smoked egg yolk – a plump little treasure trove that I ate with some crisp brassicas enlivened with horseradish, parmesan and lemon. The hasselback potatoes cooked in beef fat were a joy, too, though at £8.50 plus service, to serve just three of them seemed more than a tad ungenerous. That battered dover sole with the lobster mousse, meanwhile, is more than mere gimmick, and comes with very good, earthy crushed minted peas alongside those triple-cooked chips.For pudding, we went for the sherry trifle made with Bristol cream and red berries that came topped with whipped cream, but it lacked the stodge and heft of a true sherry trifle, and was more a bowl of light, jammy cream. In fact, I regret not opting for the sticky toffee pudding made with rum and treacle and served with jersey cream, or for Smyth’s spin on tiramisu, an “Irish-misu” made with Jameson’s-fuelled Irish coffee.View image in fullscreenThe sherry trifle at Corenucopia is ‘more a bowl of light, jammy cream’.Obviously, Smyth is not the first highfalutin chef to open a relaxed restaurant. Gordon Ramsay perfected that move decades ago, making his name with the hyper-expensive and très exclusiveRestaurant Gordon Ramsay, where Smyth herself first came to attention, before broadening his reach with numerous less stuffy ventures. So much so that, by 2026, people with bumbags are now queueing for his Pub & Grill at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Corenucopia is many, many steps back from the likes of that, not least because it is still in a Michelin-adjacent Chelsea bistro with red-trousered guests and a chunky wine list. Even if Liam Gallagher is gargling through Supersonic as you’re eating fried chicken with caviar, you’re still not putting elbows on tables.Service-wise, meanwhile, there is a strong sense that any front-of-house person who begins by calling the diners “folks”, or squatting by the table to take their order, or tries to do so without a pen and paper, would be taken outside and shot. Does lobster bisque thermidor actually need the Riverboat Song by Ocean Colour Scene as its soundtrack? No. Do you have any allergies, madam? Yes, Britpop.Corenucopia by Clare Smyth18-22 Holbein Place, London SW1, 020-8016 5752. Open lunch Fri-Sat, noon-2.30pm, Sun 12.30-3.30pm. Dinner Weds-Sat, 6.30-9.30pm, Sun 6-9pm.
