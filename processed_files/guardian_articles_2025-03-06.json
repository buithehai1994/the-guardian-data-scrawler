Macron said Russia reacted the way it did tohis speech warning that Russian aggression “knows no borders”because it was true.The European show of unity was marred by Hungary’s prime minister,Viktor Orbán, failing to endorse an EU statement on Ukraine pushing back against Trump’s Russia-friendly negotiating stance.The 26 other EU leaders, including Orbán’s ally Robert Fico, the Slovakian prime minister, “firmly supported” the statement. “There can be no negotiations onUkrainewithout Ukraine,” said the statement, a response to Trump’s attempt to sideline Europe and Kyiv.The European Council president António Costa, who called the meeting, said: “Hungary has a different strategic approach on Ukraine, but that means Hungary is isolated among the 27.”Arriving at the summit, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had originally been scheduled to join by video link, said: “We are very thankful that we are not alone.”Europe can’t just hope for the best with Trump. Ukraine needs all the arms we can send | Frans TimmermansRead moreThe European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, who presented to leaders an €800bn (£670bn) plan to increase European defence spending, said it was “a watershed moment for Europe” and also for Ukraine.Von der Leyen later told reporters that if Trump wanted “peace through strength” this would only be possible with the EU and its member states “because preconditions have to be met”. There were “many examples that show how important the support of Europe is to come to a positive end”, she said citing EU economic, military aid and support to keep Ukraine’s energy system running.Earlier in the day, Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, set the tone of the meeting. “Spend, spend, spend on defence and deterrence,” she said. “That is the most important message, and at the same time, of course, continue to support Ukraine, because we want peace in Europe.”0:47'About damn time': EU parliament president on plans to raise European military spending – videoZelenskyy shook leaders’ hands and was embraced by several around the table at the start of the meeting. It was a stark contrast to the hostility from Washington, where US officials doubled down on the decision tocut intelligence sharing with Ukraine.The US envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said it had been done to show the US was serious about ending the war. “The best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a two by four across the nose. You get their attention,” he said.Separately, Ukrainian opposition leaders confirmed they hadmet members of Trump’s entourage, but they denied seeking to remove Zelenskyy from power.Addressing EU leaders, Zelenskyy said: “The real question for any negotiations is whether Russia is capable of giving up the war,” as he noted Russia was increasing military spending, growing its army and “making no pauses in trying to overcome sanctions”.Zelenskyy later said on social media he planned to visit Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. “After that, my team will stay in Saudi Arabia to work with our American partners,” he wrote. “Ukraine is most interested in peace. As we told POTUS, Ukraine is working and will continue to work constructively for a swift and reliable peace.”2:46'They brought it on themselves': US envoy blames Zelenskyy for intel and aid pause – videoThe EU special summit was called last week after Trump embarked on his direct diplomacy with Vladimir Putin, but before the US president’sbullying encounterwith Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and the suspension of US military aid.EU leaders largely endorse theplan to “rearm Europe”outlined by von der Leyen earlier this week, although the €800bn is highly theoretical, depending on decisions by member states.“Europe must become more sovereign, more responsible for its own defence and better equipped to act and deal autonomously with immediate and future challenges and threats,” the final conclusions state. The EU “will accelerate the mobilisation of the necessary instruments and financing” to boost security and “reinforce its overall defence readiness [and] reduce its strategic dependencies”.Arriving at the summit, von der Leyen told reporters: “Europe faces a clear and present danger, and therefore Europe has to be able to protect itself, to defend itself, as we have to put Ukraine in a position to protect itself and to push for a lasting and just peace.”The commission has said its plan is worth€800bn, including a €150bn loan scheme secured against unused funds in the EU budget, as well as greater flexibilities in the EU’s fiscal rules that could unlock €650bn in new spending.Member states would still have to agree to the €150bn loans scheme, while it is unclear if governments would make full use of the €650bn financial leeway the commission suggests.Some of the money could be used by EU countries to finance military aid for Ukraine. “The best security guarantees are the Ukrainians themselves,” Costa said, although EU diplomats privately acknowledge Europe will not be able to fill the gap left by the withdrawal of US military aid.Pressure is growing on all countries to increase national defence budgets, especially the seven EU Nato members, including Spain and Italy, that are below the 2% target set more than a decade ago. Belgium’s new prime minister, Bart De Wever, said his country was “an extremely poor pupil” and “getting a slap on the wrist that we deserve”.In a seismic shift, Germany’s probable next coalition partners, the CDU-CSU and SPD, have agreed to change the country’s “debt brake” toallow increased spending on defence, heralding billions for armaments production. Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, the fiscal hawk turned defence spending advocate, met von der Leyen and Costa before the summit, although he is not yet at the table.The current German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who represents Germany as coalition talks continue, said there appeared to be growing consensus on changing the German constitution toallow greater defence spending. The unexpected move from Berlin has left Germany’s frugal-minded allies scrambling to understand the ramifications.Scholz gave a cool response to Emmanuel Macron’s proposal to allow European allies to shelter under the French nuclear umbrella, saying Europe should not give up on US involvement. Merz, however, has said he wants to discuss with Paris and London whether British and French nuclear protectioncould be extended to Germany.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeUkraineUrsula von der LeyenDonald TuskViktor OrbánEmmanuel MacronnewsShareReuse this content"

In reality, though, the conditions are often some of the most hellish on tour. Along with the slow conditions because of the dry, dusty desert air, gusty wind can make it incredibly challenging for all players.Emma Raducanu could ‘barely breathe or see through the tears’ after spotting stalkerRead moreFrom the start of the day, it was clear that the windy conditions would make life extremely difficult. Raducanu had begun well, immediately establishing a break lead in the opening games of the match, but the Japanese player handled the challenging circumstances best.While Raducanu tried to dictate the match from inside the baseline, her errors piled up in the unforgiving conditions. Uchijima, who is ranked four places above Raducanu at No 52, produced an excellent performance that illustrated why she has won many matches and risen 99 spots in the rankings over the past year. She remained rock-solid from the baseline across both sets while also serving well in the decisive moments and sweeping up all short balls with her heavy topspin forehand.During her pre-tournament press interviews, Raducanu said she had taken a week off to clear her head and she had initially been unsure about whether she would make the trip to Indian Wells so soon after the stalking incident. She has now lost five of her last six matches since her positive run to the Australian Open third round. Still, considering the events of her last match, when she was overcome with emotion at the Dubai Open after spotting her stalker in the crowd, simply being back on court and able to calmly conduct her business is a positive outcome.As she tries to find her feet again on the tour, Raducanu will hope that the new face in her player box will help. Thursday marked her first match of a trial run with the Slovak coach Vladimir Platenik, who has worked with a number of former top 10 players, including Daria Kasatkina, Belinda Bencic, Dominika Cibulkova and Veronika Kudermetova, in addition to being head coach of the prominent Empire Tennis Academy in Trnava. Raducanu’s previous coach, Nick Cavaday, decided to part ways with her after the Australian Open because of health issues.Earlier on Thursday, the men’s British No 3, Jacob Fearnley, went down to a brutal 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 defeat by the 18-year-old João Fonseca in the final set of his ATP Masters 1000 debut.After a poor opening set, Fearnley played spectacular attacking tennis in the middle of the match, completely out-hitting one of the most destructive ball strikers in the game, and put himself in position for a strong victory. From 3-1 in the third set, though, Fearnley’s nerves simply got the better of him while Fonseca showed the mental toughness and inner belief that complements his shot-making. Fonseca rolled through the final eight games to close out an unforgettable victory on his Indian Wells debut.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One European diplomat said: “We will know very soon if the US has set its face against helping Europe, and what its explanation is.”As the French president,Emmanuel Macron, put it in his patriotic address on Wednesday night: “I want to believe that the United States will remain at our side. But we must be ready if that is not the case.” In saying this, he caught the spirit of the Brussels summit, and the new mood in Germany being led by the chancellor-elect, Friedrich Merz.It is, so far as relations with Washington are concerned, a mood of optimism of the will combined with pessimism of the intellect. It requires Europe to prepare for a severance with the US, and one that may come much sooner than Nato planners had envisaged.Specifically, it requires European nations to upend their economies and throw out their fiscal debt rules that once seemed immutable, even if it risks a confrontation with the bond markets as well as part of their electorates. “Whatever it takes,” theslogan coined by Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, to get Europe through the eurozone crisis, is being revived to get Europe through this security crisis.But in a sense, diplomats say, as with the eurozone crisis this is not just about money, or even transferring resources to spend more on defence over the next four years, critical as this will be. This is about political will, and taking the mental leap of independence from America. One western diplomat said: “Macron was probably right in his talk of European strategic autonomy. We have wasted seven years not building a European defence capability, and now we must make up for lost time.”The first stage is to put Donald Trump on the back foot by showing that Ukraine is not the war party, as claimed by the US vice-president, JD Vance. Kyiv’s proposal for an immediate pause in the fighting covering sea, air and energy installations is backed by Macron and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer. The aim is to flushVladimir Putinout and try to show the White House that the obstruction to a ceasefire and a just deal lies in Moscow and not Ukraine.One European diplomat said: “With Trump only putting pressure on Ukraine to negotiate, no questions have been asked of Putin’s terms for a deal, and no pressure has been applied on him by the White House. It is outrageous.”The second stage is to consider what Europe, probably allied with Turkey, Canada and even Australia, can do to help Ukraine if the US refuses to provide the backstop, or to end the pause on its supply of weapons to Ukraine. Can Europe self-assemble a short-term package of ammunition, weaponry and intelligence that acts as a substitute for what the US supplied and at least buysVolodymyr Zelenskyysome time? European countries insist they can send to Ukraine this year at least 1.5m rounds of artillery ammunition, air defence systems and missiles, drones and other equipment.An additional proposal is to challenge Trump to sell to Europe the arms he is refusing to supply to Ukraine. If Washington rejected such a highly commercial offer it would reveal that Trump’s concern was not the cost to the American budget of helping Ukraine, but something more geo-strategic. The seizure of Russian central bank assets to fund this has not yet been ruled out, diplomats say, but will be discussed later.But either way, it is the speed of irreversible events, notably in Germany as much as Brussels, that have diplomats on the back foot.German concerns about debt, born of historical fears around Weimar-era inflation, arebeing hurled out the window. Merz’s Christian Democratic Union campaigned right up to election day on a promise to make budget savings while Olaf Scholz insisted lifting the restrictive debt brake rules in the German constitution was unavoidable. The SPD badly lost the election, but triumphantly won on the policy when Merz did a post-election volte face.In a bid to push the extra spending through, and knowing they lack the required two-thirds majority to change the debt rule in the newly elected Bundestag, the SPD and CDU are rushing the change through the outgoing Bundestag elected in 2021.It is a head spinning change. It is also deeply ironic that an election triggered largely by acoalition dispute about spending an extra €8bn-€9bn(£6.7bn-£7.5bn) has ended with an agreement to set up an off-the-books €100bn infrastructure fund over 10 years. Moreover, this is all being proposed by Merz, the most staunch Atlanticist in the CDU.But Germany now openly questions where Trump’s loyalties lie, and even if he will be seen in Red Square on 9 May alongside Putin on the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war.Indeed it is unlikely Merz would disagree with the Ukrainian ambassador to London, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who told a Chatham House conference: “We see that it is not only Russia and the axis of evil trying to destroy the world order, but the US is actually destroying it completely.”The Ukrainian envoy, a former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, added that talks between the US and Russia – the latter of which was “headed by a war criminal” in Putin – showed the White House was making “steps towards the Kremlin regime, fully realising that in this case Europe could be a new target for Russia”.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionDefence policyDonald TrumpUkraineJohn HealeyEmmanuel MacronFriedrich MerzanalysisShareReuse this content"

After recovering videos of Zou attacking a further 50 women, police have said this could be one of the worst cases of sexual violence in modern Britain. All of Zou’s victims are thought to be of Chinese heritage.While some may be unaware they were raped, others may have chosen not to come forward. Poon, a trustee at the Chinese Information and Advice Centre (CIAC), explained why this may be. “In Chinese culture, people lock everything up inside,” she said. “They won’t tell anybody, they think this is very shameful. They will hide things, even from their parents. They struggle by themselves.”She added: “It’s not just about shame. Some women fear that if they tell their parents, they will be forced to leave university and return home. Others worry their families will blame them, so they suffer in silence.”Organisations such as CIAC, the Southeast and East Asian Women’s Association (SEEAWA), and Southall Black Sisters, who between them have been campaigning against violence and abuse for nearly 50 years, say that while survivors across the UK often feel isolated, cases like this highlight cultural and linguistic barriers, as well as structural racism within institutions, that prevent women from accessing support or justice.Sarah Reid, the fundraising manager and head of public policy for SEEAWA, said: “There’s just so much unmet need, from language barriers, wanting a woman to talk to if you’re a woman victim, to navigating the police and the health system, as well as being a migrant and having to pay very high fees to use the NHS.“There is a huge enormous cost to study as a student from China, it’s such an investment. Lots of Chinese families and Asian families put so much into it, so if that is tainted, I can imagine that there’s a lot of shame, not just for yourself but to your wider family and community.”Sarah Yeh, the chair of SEEAWA, said: “Rape is stigmatised in all east and south-east Asian cultures. It’s often a case of victim-blaming, as it is in the wider UK community as well. Often women don’t really know their rights, especially if they’re coming to a foreign country. So it’s about building awareness and a greater understanding that there is help out there that they can tap into.”All three organisations regularly receive case referrals from universities and local authorities, but this case underscores the urgent need for increased funding to meet the growing demand for support.Zhenhao Zou: ‘charming’ PhD student who filmed dozens of attacks on womenRead moreZou first caught the attention of police in May 2023 after a woman reported being raped at his apartment. The Metropolitan police later expressed “deep regret” over how they handled the initial report. There were issues with the interpreter and an impatient call handler.Yeh described this as a wider problem of societal neglect. “I understand that one of the women reported to the police and she didn’t have a good experience because the translator wasn’t good so they brushed off her initial complaint,” she said. “It’s stuff like this we really need to work on at a societal level to make sure that people are included, especially people that are coming into our country that haven’t got the experience and culture and understanding of how our legal system works or what protective systems there are in place for us.”Poon pointed to low prosecution rates for rape as a major factor in victims staying silent. “Many Chinese women don’t report sexual assault because they believe nothing will happen. They think: even if I go to the police, will the man be punished? They feel hopeless about the system.”Zou’s case comes months after that ofGisèle Pelicotin France, whose husband drugged her and allowed at least 50 men to rape her while she was sedated, and also filmed the attacks.A spokesperson for Southall Black Sisters said: “Technology has become a powerful tool for perpetrators to abuse women and girls, yet it is still not treated with the urgency it requires. Despite increasing recognition of tech-facilitated abuse … agencies often fail to respond adequately.”Yeh expressed hope that this case could serve as a wake-up call, both for the east and south-east Asian community and for Britain as a whole.“The two women that came forward have shown that it’s possible to prosecute a perpetuator like him,” she said. “I hope it opens up more possibilities now that he’s been found guilty.”Explore more on these topicsRape and sexual assaultUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

You’ll be engrossed for three hoursJack SealeThu 6 Mar 2025 17.00 ESTShareWhat function does a television series have when the disgrace it covers is already in the public domain? The “spy cops” scandal has been the subject of extensive reporting,spearheaded by the Guardian. There is no need to demand a public inquiry, either:one is under way.Yet ITV’s three-part The UndercoverPoliceScandal: Love and Lies Exposed – produced with the Guardian and featuring its journalists Rob Evans and Paul Lewis – more than earns its place. Aside from television simply hitting a wider audience, the way it unfolds narratives using personal testimony has a power a written summary may not achieve. And, as the series uses the tricks, and some of the cliches, of the true-crime documentary to keep viewers happily engrossed for three hours, it gives us the time we need to sit with the story and absorb its importance. Because this injustice asks huge questions about Britain.Over several decades, peaking in the 1990s and 2000s, undercover police officers infiltrated local campaign groups using false identities. You might argue this is an outrage in itself, but the scheme went much further. More than 60 women are now known to have had sexual liaisons, often developing into long-term relationships, with men they thought were political allies. Some even had children with the impostors.Women who fell victim to these conmen – virtually all the undercover officers were male, targeting female activists – appear on camera to tell their stories, although most are disguised with wigs and makeup or their names are changed. Lisa spent five happy years with her boyfriend before a glimpse of his passport suggested he was not who he said he was. When the partner of “Alison” suddenly left her, she remembered finding a debit card with an unfamiliar surname. Helen – which is her real name, because she is the activistHelen Steel, of McLibel fame– was similarly abandoned by the love of her life and wondered if the gaps in his family history might offer an explanation.It is a tale with all the twists, coincidences and courage that the intrigue-hungry viewer would want, told using tested true-crime tradecraft. Genre thrills kick in as the women remember apparently idyllic courtships, followed by creeping doubts, then their transformations into dogged amateur detectives. By the time one of them involves the Guardian and a snowball starts rolling, they have each independently busted the cover of a different professional spy. Then the scandal goes national.The real value of this series, though, is in seeing the faces of the victims and hearing their anguish, which brings new clarity to the depth of the harm done. In photographs and home movies, and in memories of the times their partners accompanied them to siblings’ weddings and parents’ death beds, we are privy to those moments, all irreplaceable, all now tainted.It’s not just the cruelty and professional misogyny that linger. That the women’s experiences were eerily alike underlines that this was an elaborate and expensive state-sanctioned operation. That raises the question of what would drive our government to such extremes. We learn part of the answer when we are told that “Alison” was in a community group that supported the families of Black people killed in contact with the police – and that, as the home secretary, Theresa May was forced tocommission an inquiryin 2014 when it emerged that the Stephen Lawrence justice campaign had beeninfiltrated and undermined.Many of the women were engaged in nothing more subversive than small-scale anti-fascist or environmental campaigns, yet were seen as nuts to be cracked with a sledgehammer. One valid response to this level of official chicanery is hopeless, reclusive terror; another is to be encouraged by how paranoid the spy cops scandal shows those in power to have been. In her interview, Steel reminds us that every significant right and privilege citizens enjoy today was won through protests that began at grassroots level.“Alison”, recalling the day she deduced that her boyfriend was a cop, says: “I felt like I had uncovered something you weren’t supposed to uncover.” Shocking and disgusting as the facts of the case are, this documentary is part of a preciously rare moment when we can lift that lid a little higher.The Undercover Police Scandal: Love and Lies Exposed airs on ITV1 and is available on ITVXExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewPoliceDocumentaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was quiet. Much too quiet. Outside his bedroom window, he could have sworn he heard birdsong.Keir Starmeropened one eye. Cautiously. With an air of trepidation. Then, almost reluctantly, he opened the other. He leaned over to his bedside table and reached for his phone to see what fresh hell awaited him. What disasters the orange manchild in the White House had inflicted on the rest of the world while he had been asleep. It had reached the point where he had come to confuse the daily reality check with his darkest nightmares.Nothing. Well, almost nothing. Just one late-night post on Donald Trump’s social media feed warning the people of Gaza that they would all die if they didn’t release the Israeli hostages. Keir exhaled. That was someone else’s problem. The Middle East was well above his pay grade. Others could take the lead in brokering a peace there. All that was required of him was to say a few tough words condemning Hamas and calling for a two-state solution from time to time.Nothing also from JD Vance since he had declared that the UK and French armed forces were basically a waste of space. Sure, the vice-president had gone on to say he definitely hadn’t aimed his remarks at the French and the British, even though we all knew that was exactly what he had meant. That had left everyone playing diplomatic cover-up because no one could afford to openly embarrass the Americans. The new world order meant sucking up to the bullyboys. There was no way around that. The alternative was a possible escalation in the war with Ukraine. It just didn’t help when the two most powerful men in the US were dim and dangerous.For the last few weeks or so, Starmer felt he had been playing catch-up. Waking up each day to find himself firefighting the latest White House efforts to encourage the Russians to escalate the war in Europe. And every time he had felt he just might be getting ahead of the curve, The Donald and his obsequious sidekick had gone out of their way to make things worse. Hold their beer.But today was a pleasant respite. Almost a return to the normal workings of prime ministerial life. Not exactly a return to the quotidian but as close as it was likely to get in the foreseeable future. He just needed to work out how to square his promise to the Americans not to share military intelligence with Ukraine with his commitment to Volodymyr Zelenskyy to continue to do so. Perhaps it didn’t count if he did it with his eyes shut. Or if he told someone else who would then tell the Ukrainian president.To his surprise, Keir found he didn’t quite know how to do normal any more. So much of his time had been spent on global diplomacy, AKA wrangling the incontinent toddler in the White House and leading the European response, that he had rather forgotten how to do the day job. Inflation, fiscal rules and the state of the NHS suddenly didn’t seem quite as important as they had a month ago.Still, it was good to know he wasn’t the only one out of kilter. Kemi Badenoch didn’t appear to know whether she was coming or going and Nigel Farage had been forced to take Trappist vows after his repeated support for Putin. Now at least one of his MPs was in open revolt, insisting Nige had a messiah complex. Maybe some good was coming out of the war.Nothing to do but to crack on. Fake it to make it. First stop was a quick meeting with the Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin. This could be done with his eyes closed. Dealing with another leader whom he could trust to do what he said was a comparative luxury. One he had come to take for granted in the past. The two men had understood one another perfectly. For their two countries to work as closely as humanly possible while maintaining the illusion that the constraints of the post-Brexit arrangements were no real bother. How to have a single market and freedom of movement without a single market and freedom of movement. Job done.Hours later, Keir was dressed like a toddler in an oversized hi-vis jacket as he visited the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. Here he first took questions from a small group of workers who had been rounded up for his benefit. It was all a bit toe-curling. Close your eyes and it could all have been a bit Alan Partridge. Starmer has spent so much time globe-trotting and schmoozing world leaders in recent weeks that he’s got rather out of practice at dealing with the little people.“I’m here to serve you,” Keir said. “It’s not a privilege for you to be here.” Hmm. It sounded as if he did protest a little too much. Being a major player on the world stage gets to every prime minister in the end. “So ask me any question you like. Just not about football. I support Arsenal. Some of you may support Liverpool.” That last sentence either was meant to be a joke or it was an idiot’s guide to fandom. To ease the tension. No one laughed.The first two questions were about women and apprentices. Starmer was all for both of them. In his mind, the UK is now on a war footing. The passenger ferry that was docked behind him was within days of being converted to an aircraft carrier. More women and apprentices would be needed to create the largest navy the world had ever seen. The gathered audience didn’t seem totally convinced.One worker then asked about Ukraine. As did the reporters from the BBC and Sky. President Trump was committed to peace in Ukraine, Keir said. Mmm. Possibly. Though so far his main interest appears to be a peace that suits Russia.Moving on. The US was a reliable partner. As in reliably unreliable. Short-tempered, easily rattled and pathologically narcissistic. Not to mention half-witted. Few men in history have done more to destabilise the west in such a short time. If a deal is reached, it will have been despite The Donald, not because of him. Though he will undoubtedly expect the Nobel peace prize for his efforts. The rest of us will just have to grin and bear it.Keir burbled on for a few more minutes in statesmanlike terms. It must be a peace that lasts. He was in a prime position to negotiate. He didn’t want to choose between the US and Europe. Churchill and Atlee hadn’t and neither would he. But Winston and Clem hadn’t had to deal with a president like Trump. Everything was for the best in the best of all possible worlds. Until the next eruption from the White House.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe politics sketchLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

There are smiles all round.Over the course of the next hour, Vincent Pearce, a 24-year-old American studying design at the Royal College of Art inLondon, and his fellow volunteer, Tony Woolf, a retired BBC sound engineer, help fix a range of electrical equipment brought in by hopeful owners – from a radio alarm clock to a CD player; a hotplate to a lamp.‘There’s a real joy in fixing something’: the rise of the repair cafeRead moreWoolf says: “It is such a great thing to be involved in. Doing something positive and hopefully helpful … it is just a lovely place to be.”The Fixing Factory in Camden is one of a range of repair options springing up around the UK – from repair shops to pop-up cafes or repair hubs – that is trying to meet the growing demand for fixing rather than throwing away broken possessions.Advocates say the trend has several upsides – from cutting household costs to reducing waste, tackling emissions and creating jobs.Fiona Dear from the Restart Project, one of two groups behind the Fixing Factory in Camden, says: “There is so much resource that goes into making these electrical products that for some, like laptops and phones, up to 80% of their lifetime emissions come before they even get into the customers’ hands. So if you don’t keep them going for as long as possible we are just wasting all those resources.”View image in fullscreenThe Fixing Factory in Camden.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianThe UK has an unenviable record when it comes to e-waste,ranking second worst in the world per capita, behind Norway. Astudy found thatalmost half a billion small, cheap everyday electrical items had ended up in landfill in the UK in just 12 months.Now a new scheme that has transformed “repair culture” in other European countries is to be trialled in the UK.Repair vouchers, which give people 50% off the cost of repairing broken electrical items,will be available from next monthin a trial across north London. If it is successful, advocates hope it will be rolled out nationwide.Dear says: “It’s a really exciting development because this will mean it is cost efficient for people to repair all sorts of products, from kettles to vacuum cleaners, which people can often just think: ‘Oh, why don’t I throw it away and get a new one – they are not that expensive.’ Now there will be a viable alternative.”A similar scheme in Austria, initiated by the climate ministry,has had a huge impact, with 1.5m repair vouchers used at 3,000 repair shops since it was set up in 2022. Experts estimate it has saved about 4,000 tonnes of e-waste.Karin Huber-Heim, director of Circular Economy Forum Austria, says: “It has been a real success story. It is very well known and liked here and has helped establish a thriving repair industry and culture that we want to last long after the voucher scheme has ended.”One challenge that advocates in both the UK and Austria have identified is a paucity of people with the required skills to carry out the repairs.Dear says: “What we’re hearing is that there is loads and loads of demand [for repair services] – but the problem is that many existing shops and set-ups are struggling to get in new repair technicians as older ones reach retirement.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s nothing that is bringing people into repair and so, basically, repairers are retiring, and then they’re closing down their businesses.”In Austria, Huber-Heim says they are considering including repair skills in all their apprenticeships – from solar panel engineering to bicycle mechanics. “We realised that there is no point setting up a separate repair qualification because repairing a solar panel is different to a fridge, [which] is different to a bike.”View image in fullscreenTools of the trade.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianThe UK scheme will launch on 1 April. Repair businesses can sign up online and then customers can go tothe same website, download a voucher and look up which repair shop might be able to help in their area.Boosting repair culture is just one part of the solution to what is a structural problem. Campaigners are also calling for:Products to be designed so repairs are easier.The removal of VAT on parts and labour for repairs.A repair index to help the public choose more repairable and durable products.Discount rates from councils for repair shops.New qualifications to encourage repair training, accreditation and apprenticeships.Back at the Fixing Factory in Camden, a steady stream of people are still coming through the door, clutching broken vacuum cleaners, lamps and kettles.Sarah Howden, head of sustainable consumption at the charity Possible that helps run the programme, says the demand has been so strong the centre is now offering courses to train new fixers – as well as sessions for those that just want to brush up on DIY skills.Howden says this is just the start: they are planning two new Fixing Factories in London in the coming months and have the ambitious target of a repair hub on every high street in the country.“There is a real desire from all sorts of people to be able to repair things rather than throw them away and that helps not just in terms of cost but also the environment.

You can imagine a collective sigh of relief chez Gaga: she has been experiencing what you might call a case of career sea sickness, in which unadulterated commercial triumphs have been followed by very public flops. In the credit column, there’s Die With a Smile, a power-ballad duet with Bruno Mars that went to No 1 in 28 countries and spent 10 weeks as the world’s biggest-selling single. (Released last August, it also appears on Mayhem.) In the debit, there was her starring role inthe disastrous Joker: Folie à Deux, a film that was estimated to have lost Warner Brothers something in the region of $150m (£116m), and which seemed to take both the Gaga-heavy soundtrack and her own, jazz-based“companion album” Harlequindown with it. You might have expected the legions of Little Monsters (as her fans are known) to rally around the latter, but apparently not. Outside of a couple of remix collections, it was the lowest-selling Lady Gaga album to date and her second jazz album to noticeably underperform: a follow-up collection of duets with the late Tony Bennett, 2021’s Love for Sale, failed to replicate the success of its predecessor, Cheek to Cheek.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionView image in fullscreenThe artwork for Mayhem.Photograph: APOne theory is that Gaga’s eclecticism might have succeeded in confusing people. The fact that you never quite know what she’s going to throw out next – electronic dance-pop, soft rock, jazz, country, AOR – should be cause for celebration, but perhaps it has proved a bit much in a world dominated by streaming’s overload, where artists are advised to maintain a clear brand lest they get lost amid the sheer torrent of new music. Maybe what was needed was a bold restatement of Gaga’s original core values. That was precisely what Abracadabra, and indeedits predecessor, Disease, provided: big dirty synths; big noisy choruses; high-camp, fashion-forward videos and, in the case of Abracadabra, a hook apparently designed to remind listeners of the word-mangling intro to 2009’s Bad Romance.All this turns out to be a fair advertisement for the rest of Mayhem, which does a lot of things that anyone who fell hard for Gaga’s debut album, The Fame, might reasonably want her to do. Fizzy electronics battle for space with piano and guitar hooks. Virtually everything seems to have been constructed with one eye on the dancefloor: there are nods to Daft Punk, disco and 80s boogie and house. There are songs gleefully hymning the pleasures of the fleeting clubland hook-up as balm for the soul (Garden of Eden). And there are songs ruminating equivocally on the nature of fame: “Sit in the front row, watch the princess die,” she sings on Perfect Celebrity, both a decent pun and analogous to her “performance art piece enacting the death of celebrity” at the 2009 MTV awards, during which she sang Paparazzi while appearing to bleed out from a gash on her stomach.Lady Gaga: Abracadabra – videoLady Gaga: Disease review – a return to form, and to her classic soundRead moreIt’s consistently well-written, teeming with hooks and liberally sprinkled with intriguing musical left-turns. The Prince-esque electro-funk of Killah suddenly erupts into a double-time beat that’s equal parts clipped new-wave rock and techstep drum’n’bass; the Chic-style disco of Zombieboy is unexpectedly disrupted by a widdly-woo hair metal guitar solo. Equally, it is smart enough to marshal its star’s diversity. LoveDrug indulges Gaga’s love of AOR, but a four-to-the-floor rhythm means it doesn’t jar with its surroundings. Her penchant for old-fashioned power ballads is manifested in Blade of Grass, but the song is smartly tacked on to the end of an otherwise dance-focused album, alongside the similarly minded Die With a Smile. The only obvious misstep is How Bad Do U Want Me?, which starts out great – a homage to early 80s synth-pop, specifically Yazoo – but devolves into a song over which the melodic influence of Taylor Swift hangs a little too obviously.In truth, How Bad Do U Want Me? isn’t a bad song, but there’s something a little craven about it. Moreover, Lady Gaga doesn’t really need to chase current pop trends: Mayhem may be a reversion to core values – to the Lady Gaga of 2008 – but the striking thing is that it doesn’t feel particularly retro. Instead, it seems curiously of the moment: bothChappell Roan’s drag-queen aesthetic and outsider appeal andCharli xcx’s avant-trash place them in Gaga’s lineage.Mayhem can’t replicate the jolt that accompanied Lady Gaga’s arrival, blood-spattered live performances and all, but it doesn’t need to. It’s a reversion to first principles that reminds you how prescient its author was in the first place: she sounds like someone returning to claim a place in a pop world that has come round to her way of thinking.Explore more on these topicsLady GagaAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Still, it is a test of tone and performance to render, with humour, a story that scales so much thwarted life.DirectorThomas Ostermeierand Duncan Macmillan’s new version rather magically balances lightness, wit and melancholy from the off, as characters gather at a country estate in hipsterish modern dress. There is the imperious actor Arkadina (Cate Blanchett) and her lover, Trigorin (Tom Burke), a famous writer who arrives from the city; her brother Sorin (Jason Watkins), whose health is failing, and her overshadowed son, Konstantin (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who aspires to be a writer and, in protest perhaps, disapproves of the middlebrow appeal of his mother’s art. Love’s arrows shoot in all the wrong directions and every cast member reflects the pain of injury alongside the laughs.View image in fullscreenExcellence, integrity, depth … Tom Burke and Emma Corrin.Photograph: Marc BrennerBlanchett may be the glitteriest of castings but this is a powerhouse ensemble that first matches and then outshines her in intensity. Her Arkadina is an actor off-stage, too, her fame an act of will in this household, and she pulls out the emotional theatrics to circumvent pain . The mother of a complicated son, she expresses worry over his first suicide attempt but greater concern that she might be getting a cold-sore.The idea is that she finds real life and her real self impossible to face but it means you are kept at a remove in her most critical moments. Her clashes with Konstantin break through this veneer but she quickly returns to her one-woman cabaret act, tap dancing at one point, and Blanchett brings some bawdy outre fun. There is the same distance with several others in the cast who play both their character and the role of an actor, but this does not impede their most charged moments in the same way.Burke’s Trigorin is excellent – a covert narcissist whose humblebrags are so convincing, his self-centredness so entitled, that even his explanations for infidelity seem reasonable. “I’m a vampire,” he says of himself as a writer, but he is the same as a lover.Watkins lifts the minor part of Sorin and starts off as the best of the cast’s sad clowns, travels further into melancholy with his sense of having lived the wrong life – and then reaches the terrible realisation that it has not been lived at all. Smit-McPhee, in his stage debut, exudes emo-angst and rage towards Arkadina with some killer putdowns of her gen X failings. Emma Corrin, as Nina, brings immense integrity and depth.The play’s love triangles are beautifully accomplished and full of intensity, humour bringing a contrapuntal energy to the characters’ sadness. Tanya Reynolds makes Masha indulgently love-lorn at the start, clearly in mourning over her unrequited love for Konstantin, yet there is such resigned heartache too that her trajectory with Medvedenko (Zachary Hart, excellent) – whom she marries as a substitute – is tragic.“Who wants a bit of Chekhov?” asks Hart, with a guitar slung around his neck. There is an overt sense of performance throughout, which is fitting for a play that grapples with questions about the purpose of art and the value of theatre in a time of crisis. Sometimes coming precipitously close to polemic, it swerves into ruefulness, just about dodging cliche.View image in fullscreenMagnetic … Jason Watkins and Kodi Smit-McPhee.Photograph: Marc BrennerA semi-thrust stage brings intimacy but sometimes there are too many techniques at work, bearing the strained theatricality of the “new forms” that Konstantin is keen to discover. What is remarkable is that these characters are made likable, even lovable. You feel for each of them.Magda Willi’s set design for the Barbican’s huge stage leaves much empty space, with a comical clump of shrubbery at the centre along with folding deckchairs. It feels incongruous but becomes a clever metaphor for characters who feel so stranded within the expanse of the Russian countryside.The music works in interesting ways too, bringing irony in the romantic scenes (The Stranglers’ Golden Brown is repeatedly used). Sometimes reminiscent of Benedict Andrews’ supreme reinterpretation ofThe Cherry Orchard last year at the Donmar Warehouse, it is perhaps not as transformative. But it is no less magnetic, from the shifts within characters to the shift of tone in the last, dark act.

But I will give Netflix, Amazon and co props for this: for nearing a decade now, they have attempted to fill a void left by the theatrical box office, whose hollowed-out market rarely supports the mid-budget adult films – particularly romcoms and erotic thrillers – that routinely entertained non-franchise audiences in decades past. Only occasionally do they succeed, as in the case of Netflix’sDo RevengeorPlayers, but the mission remains worthwhile.Black Bag review – Michael Fassbender and Cate Blanchett intrigue in marital espionageRead morePicture This, a new romcom fromAmazon Prime Video, has promising elements suggesting it could be one of the better entries. Namely: the presence of Simone Ashley, the always luminous breakout star of the Netflix confection that is Bridgerton; Hero Fiennes Tiffin, nephew of Ralph and Joseph and perhaps best known for his role in the Tumblr smutty After trilogy; and the ever-relevant plot of becoming an unsolicited charity case as a single woman at the ripe age of 30. But though the two leads are capably charming – or, in the case of Tiffin, baseline attractive as a nice hometown guy not given much to do – the movie still has the imprint of a tech company’s content assembly line: cheaply made, over-lit, bumpily paced, ludicrously dialed-up characters without much comic payoff.The film, directed by Prarthana Mohan, is an adaptation of the Australian movie Five Blind Dates, produced and distributed by Amazon just last year. The screenwriter Nikita Lalwani transposes the hijinks of a fortuitous/constraining palm reading to Hackney, filmed as if for an Instagram reel (in fact, virality serves as an unsurprising deus ex machina here), in which the 29-year-old photographer Pia (Ashley) runs a portraiture studio that doubles as her spacious (to my Brooklyn eyes) apartment. Picture This admirably sketches out the city life of an independent, ambitious young woman that is neither pitiful nor fully figured out – a solid best friend partnership with Jay (Luke Fetherston, giving lead energy to a supporting performance), a creative career and a fledgling business that takes precedence over any romantic life, not that she’s complaining.But money is tight, the bills are literally mounting and on the occasion of her younger sister Sonal’s (Anoushka Chadha) month-long Indian wedding in the suburbs, her mother (Sindhu Vee) reveals a stash of family heirloom jewelry. The catch? She must get married to access it. The extra catch? She must go on five dates, as dictated by a hammy spiritual guide hired by her mother, in order to meet her soulmate. Ever a skeptic (same), Pia agrees to the deal to appease several forces in her life – including Jay, who would like to get paid for his work in the photo shop – but mostly to keep up appearances in front of the best man, who happens to be her high school ex Charlie (Tiffin).The dates are, as mandated by plot, disastrous, ranging from an icky nepo baby, to an auntie set-up with mommy issues, to Phil Dunster’s wellness guru who insists on strumming a rotation of Jason Mraz songs. Ashley, who could light sparks even out of the fluff of Bridgerton, breezes through a series of cringey encounters, and finds some naturalism and sharp stubbornness in a character many others would play more bumbling, or desperate, or shrill. But even she cannot rise above material that flounders between family drama romance, farce and commentary on meddling elders. In one scene, Pia evinces a much-ballyhooed past independent, rebellious streak, as she remembers a makeshift way to light a joint with a battery from her uni days, only to catch her hair on fire, cut scene. Such is the jolted rhythm and confused tone of this movie.Unfortunately, much of this is rendered in the distinctive glare of the streaming economy – ironic, given that this is a movie about a talented photographer with a supposedly keen sense of lighting – with an overreliance on unnecessary split-screens that serve to distract rather than enhance. Ashley and Fetherston do their best to give some texture, some lived-in quality, to this movie that otherwise looks exactly like what it is. That doesn’t mean it’s not enjoyable, at points – Pia and Charlie’s too-limited one-on-one moments have the requisite chemistry, and Ashley often flashes the vividness and on-screen vitality of a classic romcom star. But like many an app date, it’s neither offensive nor memorable – a drop in the bucket, one in an algorithmic sea of many.Picture This is available now on Amazon Prime VideoExplore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsRomance filmsComedyAmazon Prime VideoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Actors would be ill-advised to take on any Davids, Hollys or DicksStuart HeritageThu 6 Mar 2025 11.47 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 11.49 ESTShareThanks to the unprecedented critical and commercial success of The Substance, horror is having a rare moment of recognition. In fact, you’d be willing to bet that some of Hollywood’s biggest names are currently throwing themselves at all sorts of elevated horror projects just to get in on the action. However, if they are, it might be worth double checking what their character’s name is. Because if it happens to be David, those poor saps will be lucky to make it past the first act.Every now and again a study will fall into our inboxes, bankrolled by an unlikely source, that sheds some light on an area of film so esoteric that nobody has given it a moment’s thought until now. With that in mind, it is my pleasure to announce that Funeral Guide – a price comparison engine for end-of-life ceremonies – has commissioned a study to see which names are most likely to be killed off early in horror movies. This was achieved by combing through IMDb’s top 100 horrors, and seeing which characters didn’t make it to the end credits. As such, actors are not advised to star in anything where their character is called David, Holly or Dick, because these names are practically a death sentence.View image in fullscreenSoon to be not undead … Kiefer Sutherland’s doomed David in The Lost Boys.Photograph: Jane O’Neal/Warner Bros/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockWe’ll begin with David. Dylan Moran’s character inShaun of the Deadis called David, and you will remember that he ends up being torn apart by zombies midway through the film, as punishment for being so insufferable. Similarly, in The Lost Boys Kiefer Sutherland plays David, and he winds up fatally impaled on a decorative set of antlers.If anything, Hollys fare even worse. There is a Holly in The Descent who never really stood a chance, given that she was a newcomer to the group of friends who form the main cast. When she died (throat bitten out by a monster, for those of you keeping score), it was always a matter of when and not if. Even worse, Hollys are so doomed that a dead Holly didn’t even make it into Psycho. To see her death, you actually have to watch the 1990 telefilm Psycho prequel Psycho IV: The Beginning, because she has the rare honour of being the first person who Norman Bates kills while dressed as his dead mother. Also at this point you might be wondering why this survey included Psycho IV: The Beginning as one of the highest rated horror movies on IMDb, to which I say: “Shh you’re overthinking it.”View image in fullscreenGoing down … Nora-Jane Noone as Holly in The Descent.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyThen there are Dicks, such as Dick Baxter in The Fog (a fisherman who gets killed by some fog) and Dick Hallorann fromThe Shining(makes a long and complicated cross-country journey and gets murdered almost immediately upon arrival). This is basically common sense at this point, but don’t be called Dick.While this is all very interesting, it’s also worth pointing out that being a horror David, Dick or Holly isn’t necessarily as bad as it sounds. The main character in An American Werewolf in London is called David, for instance. Does he die? Sure he does, but only right at the very end of the film, after getting a ton of screen time. And in 1984’s The Devil’s Gift – a movie weirdly similar to this year’s The Monkey – the main character is called David and he onlymightdie, after the demon-possessed monkey doll blows up his house while he’s still inside. But do we see him die? No, and that has to count for something.View image in fullscreenWasted journey … Scatman Crothers as Dick Hallorann in The Shining.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamyMeanwhile, there’s a Holly in Smile, who survives the film (but only after themonster took her form to freak out another character in a nutso jump-scare), so that’s worth clinging on to. Sadly, however, there are few if any surviving horror Dicks. The study also points out that priests whose credited character name begins with the word Father are also unlikely to survive to the end of a horror movie, but that’s hardly surprising. Bumping off priests is horror’s bread and butter, and quite frankly any actor who takes on a role like this and is thinking otherwise deserves everything they get.But film-makers, this is all in your hands. All it would take is for you to make a horror movie where there’s a David, a Dick and a Holly, and they don’t get stabbed by antlers or have their throats bitten off by monsters or are blown up by a monkey or eaten by some fog, and suddenly the trend is reversed. The power is in your hands.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsShaun of the DeadThe OmenThe ShiningfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pushing Tin (1999)Cate Blanchett played a pretty generic “wife” role in this interesting, somewhat forgotten US comedy about air traffic controllers from director Mike Newell, whose title is their slang for guiding planes. It was saddled with a terrible ending by its screenwriters, Glen and Les Charles (creators of TV’s Cheers), and blitzed at the box office by The Matrix. Its genesis is amusingly described by its producer, Art Linson, in his memoir What Just Happened? Blanchett plays the wife of hotshot young air traffic controller John Cusack, who has an affair with Angelina Jolie – who is married to Cusack’s workplace rival, Billy Bob Thornton.19. Robin Hood (2010)View image in fullscreenRobin Hood.Photograph: Universal/Everett/ShutterstockBlanchett brings out a sturdy, unshowy north country accent as Marian (nothing so quaint or sexually naive as “Maid” Marian) – a plausibly tough and capable love interest for Russell Crowe as Robin, whose own accent in this film notoriously ranged across the British Isles. She has long, glistening locks and a martial attitude – but, like the sheriff of Nottingham, her character is not allowed to upstage Russell’s Robin in any way. There’s not much for Blanchett to get her teeth into in Ridley Scott’s film, and it’s an example of how her distinctive, severely patrician beauty sometimes got her typecast in mannish or off-kilter roles.18. The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004)For Wes Anderson, Blanchett played a terribly grand British magazine writer – mischievously named Jane Winslett-Richardson – whose commission is to write an in-depth piece about star oceanographer Steve Zissou (played by Bill Murray) and his latest maritime adventure. Zissou of course develops a tendresse for her. Effectively, she plays the droll and exquisite unworldly thoroughbred role that Anderson was later to give to Tilda Swinton; perhaps Blanchett did not find the idea of being an Anderson repertory player congenial enough to continue – but she carries it off well here.View image in fullscreenCoffee and Cigarettes.Photograph: Photos 12/Alamy17. Coffee and Cigarettes (2003)One of the interesting portmanteau-type movies that Blanchett has made. Jim Jarmusch’s indulgent, doodling sketch of a film has big-name cameos in quirky one-on-one encounters with other big-name cameos. Easily the best is Blanchett meeting Blanchett: she plays herself meeting a cousin (played by herself) for coffee, and this relative is fascinated and envious of Cate’s alpha-celeb lifestyle. It’s a minor film in her repertoire, but a revealing glimpse of what it might well have been like for Blanchett having to deal diplomatically with people who can’t quite get over what a big deal she is.16. Rumours (2024)Blanchett can do funny – but is rarely allowed to do so. When she is, the results can be impressive and sometimes even sensational. (See Steve Zissou and Blue Jasmine.) Here, in Guy Maddin’s rarefied absurdist comedy of euro-political breakdown, she plays a German chancellor of Merkelesque seriousness and studied hostess-like charm. She presides over a G7 summit in Germany, dealing with some unspecified crisis, and has to shepherd everyone into signing up to a bland communique that will not commit them to any action (and, meanwhile, the world is coming to an end). Not quite humour with a light touch, but Blanchett gives it class.Cate Blanchett: ‘I think you can smell when something is cynical’Read more15. Notes on a Scandal (2006)Blanchett is rarely upstaged in any movie, though she had to resign herself to being outshone by Judi Dench on her best-ever big-screen form in this delicious psychological thriller. However, Blanchett handles the subordinate role with typical style. She is Sheba, a new art teacher at a state school with liberal-patrician attitudes, who wafts entrancingly about the place and doesn’t need a teacher’s salary. All her colleagues love her, except the pursed-lipped Barbara (Dench), whose reaction is more parasitically envious fascination that evolves into a delusion of friendship. Blanchett’s Sheba must submit to sexual blackmail and finally disgrace, but rises above her ordeal in a way that the more culpable Barbara cannot.14. Lord of the Rings series (2001-2003)Blanchett played Galadriel, queen of the elves, in all three movies of Peter Jackson’s mighty Lord of the Rings trilogy, and it is her voiceover at the beginning that tells us about the mythology of the ring. She is ethereal, blond, queenly and otherworldly, with pointy ears – an interesting caricature of the exotically blue-blooded and at times almost extraterrestrial classiness that Blanchett brings to the movies. She also has a very intense emotional relationship with Ian McKellen’s grey-bearded icon Gandalf.View image in fullscreenThe New Boy.Photograph: New Boy Productions13. The New Boy (2023)It was always on the cards that Blanchett would have to play a cantankerous and scary nun at least once in her career, and she gets it under her belt here, in Warwick Thornton’s weirdly mystical drama set in an orphanage in the 1940s Australian outback. She gives it the full wimple as a fiercely authoritarian nun, Sister Eileen, who runs her remote institution with a rod of iron and has covered up the death of a senior male cleric, faking his signature so she has full control – and then has a crisis with the arrival of an Indigenous youth she calls “New Boy”. A huge performance from Blanchett, perhaps overpowering the film itself.12. Thor: Ragnarok (2017)This Marvel movie from Taika Waititi is a winning comedy in which Blanchett shows she gets the joke as well as anyone else. In days of old, she might have guested on The Morecambe & Wise show, like Glenda Jackson. Here she plays Hela, the goddess of death, tricked out with evil antlers and black garb, like a mirror-image version of Tolkien’s Galadriel. Hela is the sister of Tom Hiddleston’s Loki and she is absolutely hilarious, playing it straight but with a twinkle in the eye: it makes you long for Blanchett to appear in panto.11. Little Fish (2005)A valuable, complex and difficult film in the Blanchett canon, which deserves to be better known. She plays against type as a loser in the game of life: Tracy Heart, a former heroin addict living in a blue-collar Sydney suburb, always teetering on the brink of using again. Heart is desperately trying for a respectable life but keeps getting dragged down by her stepfather (Hugo Weaving), who is still an addict, and her ex (Dustin Nguyen), who is now a dealer. Blanchett is tough, forthright and in command of the screen, perhaps unconsciously elevating her character.10. The Talented Mr Ripley (1999)One of Blanchett’s most alluring early roles: the super-rich, dizzily naive, young Meredith Logue, taking a trip from the US to Europe on a first-class liner and bumping into the plausible low-born conman Ripley (Matt Damon), who road-tests his impersonation of the wealthy Dickie on her before he has to do it for real. Meredith breezily waves away the absurd trappings of inherited wealth – claiming to be “only comfortable around people who have money and despise it”. An unusually absurd figure for Blanchett to play, the epitome of the vain and insecure rich whose delusions make Ripley’s crimes possible.9. The Man Who Cried (2000)Another rich and tasty early role for Blanchett, who showed movie audiences what an extraordinarily seductive and expressive face she had in closeup. Always pushing at the boundaries of theatricality and self-parody, Blanchett plays Lola, a Russian dancer in interwar Paris; she befriends the young immigrant Suzie (Christina Ricci) while pursuing a Sally Bowles lifestyle, yearning for a rich protector of her own. It’s a role she puts over with terrific brio and wit.8. Elizabeth (1998)Playing Queen Elizabeth I in her early years, this was the film that made Blanchett an above-the-title star and set the blue-chip, blue-blood style of her screen career ever since: the queen of the screen but with the heart and stomach of a king. It’s a tough, cerebrally complex account of court intrigue (and the film is far superior to the 2007 follow-up, Elizabeth: The Golden Age), which tracks Elizabeth’s ascent from vulnerable princess and insecure young monarch to iconic Virgin Queen.View image in fullscreenManifesto.Photograph: PR7. Manifesto (2015)One of Blanchett’s most audacious and radical screen adventures – and something to show that Tilda Swinton isn’t Hollywood’s only experimentalist and patron muse. Working with artist and film-maker Julian Rosefeldt, Blanchett creates a movie-installation crossover piece – and another of her portmanteau films. She appears as a number of different personae, all mesmerically and slightly scarily addressing the camera, declaiming philosophical manifestos by the likes of Karl Marx, Guy Debord and Tristan Tzara, and haranguing the audience to wake up to the possibilities of art. An exhilarating multi-performance.6. The Aviator (2004)An Oscar for best supporting actress was Blanchett’s reward for one of her funniest and most attractive performances – as Katharine Hepburn in Martin Scorsese’s The Aviator, with whom the gauche multimillionare Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) falls in love. It took some nerve to impersonate Hepburn, but Blanchett succeeds, in the process absorbing some of her prestige: delivering the drawling Bryn Mawr vowels, the Yankee boho patrician elegance and the frank sexuality.5. I’m Not There (2007)View image in fullscreenI’m Not There.Photograph: Jonathan Wenk/Weinstein Company/AllstarTodd Haynes’s multiple-personality gallery of Bob Dylans was an intriguing buffet of interpretations by actors like Richard Gere, Ben Whishaw and Marcus Carl Franklin. But everyone was blown out of the water by the extraordinarily funny and convincing impersonation by Blanchett: a stylised, theatrical but still beautifully observed rendition with frizzy hair and dark glasses – Blanchett is playing the Dylan that did the “Judas” tour of England. It was a reimagining of the musician that Blanchett conceived with sympathy and wit, a turn with the vigour of pure comedy but the force of high drama.4. Nightmare Alley (2021)This freaky noir melodrama from Guillermo del Toro gave us Blanchett in full Veronica Lake mode: she is wonderful as the shady lady with secrets, sophistication and dark sexual power. She plays Lilith Ritter, a fashionable psychoanalyst in 1930s America, with a curtain of peroxide hair, a vivid slash of lipstick, a palatial art deco consulting room and a super-rich client list. Ritter is intrigued to come into contact with Bradley Cooper’s cheesy nightclub mind-reader Stan, sensing perhaps that he is in the same business as she is, and also feeling attracted to him. It’s another classically theatrical bravura performance.View image in fullscreenCarol.Photograph: AJ Pics/Alamy3. Carol (2015)This was the movie that showed us Blanchett’s ability to inhabit a character who is grand, haughty, but aware of her own vulnerability – a weakness for beauty – and also self-dramatisingly aware that this is a flaw with something tragically magnificent in it. In this adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith novel, she is the unhappy divorcing woman, Carol, who is struck by a coup de foudre on meeting Therese (Rooney Mara), a gamine and beautiful young store assistant, and falls in love with her at that moment. Later, they will have an exploratory lunch in which every moment is erotically charged with promise and in which Blanchett’s Carol is thrillingly dominant.2. Blue Jasmine (2013)Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine is a tragicomedy of a woman’s social descent, whose resemblance to Tennessee Williams’s A Streetcar Named Desire the director always denied. Blanchett plays Jasmine, a former Manhattan socialite and Park Avenue princess who, divorced and broke, has come to stay with her resentful sister in her modest apartment. She dreams of finding a way back into the broad sunlit uplands of wealth and social standing, from which she feels she has been unfairly exiled. Jasmine talks, talks, talks, believing herself capable of charming her way back in, building magic bridges to prosperity in the air – but she is actually gabbling, monologuing, and becoming embittered and crazy. This won Blanchett a best actress Oscar.1. Tár (2022)Here is the most extravagantly haughty and magnificently mad of all Blanchett’s creations on screen: the orchestra conductor Lydia Tár at a Berlin orchestra, a former protege of Leonard Bernstein. Her rock-star prestige and queenly conceit mean that she cannot acknowledge the midlife crisis or crackup that is heading her way, preferring to see it as an imminent epiphany or breakthrough. She is using the mentorship programme for young musicians as a way of pursuing affairs: she is arrogant and cruel – humiliating a bumptious student for presuming to criticise Bach on political grounds, and then terrorising a tiny child outside her daughter’s primary school. The role of Tár brings out the strangely mannish side to Blanchett’s sensuality, her intelligence and breeding, but with a black-comic self-awareness. There could be something Wagnerian in Tár’s lordly deployment of power, although it is Elgar’s Cello Concerto that unlocks her derangement, finally culminating in an unthinkable scene on the conductor’s podium. With the baton in her hand, arms flung out, she is crucified by her own passion and dedication.Black Bag is released on 14 March. The Seagull is at theBarbican, London, from 26 February to 5 April.Explore more on these topicsRankedCate BlanchettfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Black Inc, the publisher of the Quarterly Essay as well as fiction and nonfiction books by many prominent writers, had asked consent from its authors to train AI models on their work and then share the revenue with those authors.Now I have a dog in this race. Actually two dogs. I have published four books with Black Inc, have a fifth coming out next month, and have a contract for a sixth by the end of the year. And I have also been an AI researcher for 40 years, training AI models with data.I signed Black Inc’s deal. Yes, the publisher could have communicated its intent with more transparency and a little less urgency. With whom exactly is it trying to sign a deal? And for what? And why only give us a few days to sign? But all in all, I am sympathetic to where Black Inc finds itself.Small publishers such as Black Inc provide a valuable service to Australian literature and to our cultural heritage. No one starts a new publisher to make big money. Indeed, many small publishers are struggling to survive in a market dominated by the Big Five. For example, Penguin Random House – the world’s largest general book publisher – recently acquired one of Australia’s leading independent publishers, the TextPublishingCompany.‘Sign our own death warrant’: Australian writers angry after Melbourne publisher asks them to sign AI agreementsRead morePublishing is like venture capital. Most books lose money. Publishers make a return with the occasional bestseller. Small publishers like Black Inc nurture new Australian authors. And they publish many works that are worthy but are unlikely to make a profit. I am grateful then for their support of my modest literary career, and of the esteemed company I share, authors such as Richard Flanagan, David Marr and Noel Pearson.But I am outraged.I am outraged at the tech companies like OpenAI, Google and Meta for training their AI models, such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Llama, on my copyrighted books without either my consent or offering me or Black Inc any compensation.I told Black Inc that this was happening in early 2023. They asked how I knew since the tech companies are lacking in transparency on their training data. I told them that ChatGPT could give you a good summary of Chapter 4 of my first book.The tech companies claim this is “fair use”. I don’t see it this way. Last year, at the Sydney Writers’ festival, I called it the greatest heist in human history. All of human culture is being ingested into these AI models for the profit of a few technology companies.To add insult to outrage, the tech companies didn’t even pay for the copy of my book or likely the tens of thousand other books they used to train their models. My book isn’t available freely online. And, as far as I can tell, they trained on an illegal copy in books3, an online dataset assembled by Russian pirates. That’s not fair.Nor is it sustainable. We’re at the Napster moment in the AI race. When we started streaming music in the early 2000s, most of it was stolen. That wasn’t going to work in the long run. Who could afford to be a musician if no one paid for music? Napster was shortly sued out of business. And streaming services such as Spotify started, which paid musicians for their labours.Streaming is still not perfect. Popular artists like Taylor Swift make a good living, but the pennies being returned to struggling musicians for their streams is arguably still inadequate.Publishing needs to go in a similar direction as streaming. And for that to happen, small publishers especially need a strong position to negotiate with the mighty tech companies. I therefore signed Black Inc’s contract. It is, in my view, the lesser of the two evils.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The controversial changes would allow AI developers to train their models on any material to which they have lawful access, and would require creators to proactively opt out to stop their work from being used.It is outrageous that the technology companies argue that AI models being trained on books is no different from humans reading a copyrighted book. It’s not. It’s a different scale. The AI models are trained on more books than a human could read in a lifetime of reading. And, as theNew York Times lawsuitagainst OpenAI argues, it’s taking business away from publishers that is keeping them alive.Imagine a future where these large AI models ingest all of our digital knowledge. Not just books. All of science. All of our cultural knowledge. All of personal knowledge.This is Big Brother but not exactly as Orwell imagined. It is not a government, but a large tech company that will know more about us and the world than a human could possibly comprehend. Imagine also that these companies use all this information to manipulate what we do and what we buy in ways that we couldn’t begin to understand.Perhaps the most beautiful part of this digital heist is that all of this knowledge is being stolen in broad daylight.

Surely it would be easier if men just did more housework?Lucy ClarkDividing household tasks fairly and upending some gender norms along the way is good for everyoneThu 6 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 15.29 ESTShareMany moons ago, when I was much less cynical than I am now, I wrote a story for a newspaper about a marriage in which the man stayed home to look after the kids and household while the woman stayed in her higher-paying job.It was a financial decision that made obvious sense for this couple - they’d both had good jobs but had together decided her career was the more promising in the long term, so he stepped back because they wanted an at-home parent while the kids were little, and because they could afford it. It was deemed “newsworthy” in a soft kind of way, because in the 1990s it went well against the norm – it was a good illustration of what was possible when you start with a negligible gender pay gap, mutual disrespect for gender norms, and ego-free assessment of which career is best going to provide for the family unit.Australian men doing no more housework than they were 20 years ago – still 50% less than womenRead moreThe funny thing was that when I interviewed them both separately, the man told me he now did all the housework, and I believed him. I wanted to believe him – this was something to aspire to. Meanwhile, the woman said “…allthe housework? He said he doesallthe housework?”I’m just guessing, but it’s possible they had a big fight that night.Couples fight about housework. Couples fight about housework so much, it’s one of the main reasons cited for divorce. Couples fight about housework so much that it’s still incredible that men haven’t twigged to the fact that surely it would be so much easier to just do a bit more housework than it would be to go through a divorce.In the three decades since that story, what’s changed?Very little, it seems. The latest Hilda report shows that men are still doing50% less housework than women, even though they think they are doing their fair share. Hilariously, they reported great satisfaction with this arrangement.Women do not want to carry the mental load of what has to be done. Why would we? Why would anyone?You can see how it happens. Women who have children step back from careers for a while, not because they are biologically more suited to parenthood, but because they generally earn less, as evidenced by this week’sgender pay gap report- which is also called the motherhood pay gap because it only gets worse from this point. Women may be brought up to believe they are equal to men, but if they have children, they quickly find out they are not.They then have to do more unpaid, unvalued work and become resentful. This resentment, by the way, is real and understandable because it’s not fair to be automatically expected to do something on the basis of your gender, especially if you never agreed to it. It’s also not fair that at this rate it’s going to be almost another300 years before we achieve pay parity, but that’s another story (it’s the same never-ending story).Because women are forced into being in charge of the unpaid, unvalued and often invisible work, even after they have returned to work, they have to ask for help. Repeatedly. This is sometimes called nagging.Nagging, of course, is not gender specific, and is only a function of who has the greater responsibility and needs help.Womendo not want to be in charge of the laundry. Women do not want to be in charge of the mopping. Women do not want to be in charge of that thick layer of dust that gathers on top of the skirting boards. Women do not want to carry the mental load of what has to be done. Why would we? Why would anyone? No one expects men to actively want to be in charge of it either – most people do not like doing this stuff – but household things have to be done.So what are the solutions that might bring real household change, apart from the absolutely obvious?‘I felt like I was his carer’: why straight women in relationships lose interest in sexRead moreOne suggestion from a social scientist that has stuck with me – from one of the hundreds of articles, studies or books about this subject I have read over the years – was that couples could, instead of being at loggerheads with each other over their household tasks, be united against an unfair world.This requires an unshakeable bedrock of allyship as a starting point; an understanding that it is indeed an unfair world for women and that here, in our house, we can make it right and fair. Work out what needs to be done to keep the household running – factoring in paid, unpaid, unvalued and invisible work – and divide it fairly, hopefully upending some gender norms along the way. Traditional gender norms, by the way, aren’t good for men either.It beggars belief that these things still have to be said – it feels like feminism for dummies, and I think I have written a column like this a dozen times. I’m so tired of it. I thought things would be better for my daughter but at this rate, it won’t even be better for her great-great-granddaughter. My only consolation? The cleanest, tidiest person in my family is one of my sons.

The Pax Americana that long ensured peace, security and freedom in Europe is over. Anyone who still doubted this will hopefully now realise, after the disgraceful treatmentUkraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy enduredlast Friday at the White House, that we can no longer rely on the Americans for our collective security.We must hope for the best, but hope is not a policy. We – theNetherlands, the EU, and all western countries standing with Ukraine – must prepare for the worst. The question is this: how do we keep Ukraine free and independent, and how do we protect our economy, our freedom and democracy, and our borders?This begins with the awareness that our security is already directly threatened by Russia. Trump wants to do business over our heads with this country. It appears that he and Vladimir Putin have dividedEuropeinto spheres of influence like two mob bosses in a low-budget movie. As the saying goes: if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.The Netherlands is not an island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean; we are fully exposed when geopolitical and economic storms brew on our continent. It is the Russian aggression inUkrainethat has made our energy prices rocket. We cannot batten down the hatches and wait for the storm to pass. We are a medium-sized country with significant European and international interests. It is high time we acted accordingly.But political divisions at the heart of our government are leaving us exposed. The biggest party in the coalition governing the Netherlands, the Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, has a history of pro-Kremlin rhetoric. While other parties, such as the centre-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), formerly led by Mark Rutte, are staunch advocates of unwavering support of Ukraine. Combined with an unelected prime minister, Dick Schoof, who serves no specific political party, the coalition government is rudderless and unstable.It is abundantly clear that our national scale is far too small to make a real difference. Today, we need the EU more than ever before. We must also work on closer ties with countries that share our sense of urgency and are not EU members, primarily the UK and Norway, but also Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The EU will also need to take a much firmer stance against member states such as Hungary that spare no effort in promoting Putin’s (and Trump’s) agenda.View image in fullscreenThe Dutch prime minister, Dick Schoof, at The Hague, The Netherlands, 5 March 2025.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/REX/ShutterstockThe most urgent priority now is to support Ukraine. We must fill the gaps that Trump is leaving behind. Financially, this should not be too complicated, but in military terms, this is a different challenge. Russia will now intensify its attacks, so all available military equipment must be sent to Ukraine as quickly as possible. With additional financial support, we can also get the Ukrainian defence industry up and running at full capacity.The Russians are struggling more than it appears at first glance; sanctions are damaging the country, the losses are significant, and the war economy is creating large gaps elsewhere. Sanctions need to be scaled up much further, and all frozen Russian assets in the EU must be transferred to Ukraine immediately.Geert Wilders won’t be Dutch PM, but he can still harm Europe. He must be challenged | Ties DamsRead moreEU member states must wake up and stop squabbling over trivial matters. The same goes for the Schoof cabinet. It is all hands on deck now. This means thinking creatively about European war bonds and finding the fastest possible way to bolster our defence in preparation for a confrontation in which the Americans may leave us to fend for ourselves. This requires investing in areas that the Americans currently cover within Nato. Moreover, it is vital for the overall resilience of Dutch society that defence investments do not come at the expense of our social safety net.In the longer term, we must first establish a partnership that provides the collective security guarantee of Nato without having to rely on the US. Crucial to this is the involvement of Britain and possibly Canada, and European countries that are not members of the EU. Therefore, it should go beyond the EU and perhaps also exclude countries, if these, such as Hungary or the nominally neutral Austria and Ireland, for example, do not want to participate.Second, it is of national security interest to make progress on a genuine energy union. High energy prices constitute the primary economic threat to this continent. This requires much more collective investment in energy networks, renewable energy, and also joint procurement of gas for as long as we need it.The Netherlands can play a leading role in all these areas, but it is not doing so. Because the coalition is deeply divided, the prime minister speaks too hesitantly, too late, and too ambiguously. Because the coalition is not allocating additional funds for Ukraine and is implementing utterly nonsensical cuts to the contributions to the EU, the words of support are literally and figuratively cheap. Because the largest coalition party is at best ambiguous and usually sides with Trump – who is now also siding with Putin – our government is adrift.Fortunately, there is still hope. The rudderless government may be on the brink of despair, but the people are not without hope, and our country is certainly not without prospects. The Dutch people see that the world order is changing. In such extraordinary, dangerous times, they deserve a decisive, united government.Frans Timmermans is the leader of the leftwing alliance of the Dutch Green party and the Labour party (GroenLinks/PvdA)Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He didn’t even expound on his planfor the US to take overthe devastated territory and turn it into a “Riviera of the Middle East”, while expelling 2 million Palestinians to neighboring Arab countries.But Trump is already going down the same failed path as his predecessor, Joe Biden, who sent Israel a virtually unlimited supply of weapons – and failed to use US political cover at the United Nations and billions of dollars in arms as leverage to stop Israel’s war on Gaza. On 1 March, the Trump administration announced it had approved $4bnin new weaponsto Israel under emergency authorities, meaning the deal would bypass even a perfunctory review in Congress. A day later, Benjamin Netanyahubanned all food and other aiddeliveries to Gaza, imposing a new siege that threatens to collapse a fragile ceasefire reached in January.While he goes easy on the Israeli prime minister, Trump this weeksuspended all US military aidto Ukraine, days after Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a dramatic on-camera confrontation in the White House. Trump and his aides say they are using the suspension of billions of dollars in military support, along with apause in intelligence sharing, as leverage to persuade the Ukrainian leader to cooperate with US efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Trump’s sudden cutoff of weapons toUkraineproves that the US president is capable of swiftly ending arms shipments to any American ally. But Trump, like Biden before him, refuses to use that same kind of leverage to force Netanyahu to change his policies toward Gaza. Both Trump and Biden simply decided they don’t want to stop sending billions of dollars in weapons to Israel, depriving themselves of the most powerful influence they have over Netanyahu and his extremist government.Since launching the Gaza war, Netanyahu has shown that he will respond to raw power and leverage, which Trump has decided to use only against UkraineFor a businessman who prides himself on his ability to negotiate tough deals with hardball tactics, Trump is being a weak negotiator. He is refusing to play his strongest cards with the Israeli leader to ensure Netanyahu sticks to the ceasefireTrump supported. Netanyahu also knows how to placate Trump, being sycophantic in ways that Zelenskyy has so far refused to do. After Washington announced the latest $4bn in weapons shipments to Israel, Netanyahuthanked Trumpprofusely and called him “the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House”.Trump is so eager to show his support to Israel that he and his top aides are claiming credit for massive weapons deals that the Biden administration approved in its final days. In announcingthe latest dealthat skirted congressional review, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, claimed that the US administration had approved nearly $12bn in new weapons to Israel just six weeks into Trump’s second term. But more than $8bn of these arms transfers wereinitiated in early Januaryby Biden, who insisted on arming Israel into the twilight of his presidency despite being undermined and humiliated by Netanyahu for more than a year. (Those weapons included 3,000Hellfire air-to-ground missilesworth $660m, andtens of thousandsof heavy bombs, artillery shells and GPS guidance kits and fuses for bombs, totaling $6.75bn.)The latest batch of munitions approved by the Trump administration includesmore than 35,000 US-made, 2,000lb “bunker buster” bombs, which cause enormous casualties when dropped on population centers. In the first month of its war on Gaza, which started after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel, the Israeli militarydropped hundreds of 2,000lbbombs on the territory – an intensity unmatched since the US bombardment of Vietnam. Israel’s extensive use of these bunker buster munitions, along with “dumb bombs” that often kill and wound civilians indiscriminately, probably constitutewar crimes, according to UN experts. At least one US-based human rights group hasasked the international criminal courtto investigate Biden and two of his top cabinet members for “aiding and abetting” Israeli war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza, based on the unfettered flow of US weapons and intelligence support.View image in fullscreen‘Trump’s cutoff of weapons to Ukraine proves he is capable of ending arms shipments to any ally. But he refuses to use that leverage in Israel.’Photograph: Evan Vucci/APWhile Trump has nothing but contempt for international law, he’s been emboldened by Biden and other western leaders who for 15 months ignored and tried to discredit international courts and prosecutors in order to protect Israel while it waged its devastating war on Gaza. Trump’s disdain for therules-based international order, which was put in place after the end of the second world war to manage global conflicts, is partly rooted in seeing that order shattered by both Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Israel’s destruction of Gaza.Netanyahu has also been emboldened by the collapse of the west’s even nominal rhetoric about respect for international law and human rights. Since launching the Gaza war, Netanyahu has shown that he will respond to raw power and leverage, which Trump has decided to use only against Ukraine. With Trump maintaining an uninterrupted supply of weapons to Israel, Netanyahu has little incentive to change course and be less obstinate. Already, the Israeli premier has been working toundermine the ceasefirewith Hamas, which was brokered by the Biden administration and Trump’s incoming Middle East envoy,Steve Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer. The truce took effect a day before Trump’s inauguration on 20 January.As the ceasefire’s first phase expired on 2 March, Netanyahu refused to start the second phase, which requires a complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza and negotiations over a more permanent truce. Instead, Netanyahuwants to change the dealand is pressuring Hamas to accept a six-week extension of the first phase of the ceasefire, with Hamas committing to release more hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, but without an Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal or long-term truce. Netanyahu is worried that his governing coalition would collapse if he agrees to a permanent ceasefire, especially since the far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich,has repeatedly threatenedto resign and bring down the government if Netanyahu ends the war before destroying Hamas.With Trump’s support, Netanyahu is now violating the ceasefire he had accepted by imposing another blockade on Gaza. Israeli officials say theycoordinated the cut-offof humanitarian aid with the Trump administration, which issued a statement thatblamed Hamasfor the suspension of ceasefire talks, even though the group had agreed to move to the second phase. As the Biden administration did for months, Trump put all the blame on Hamas while absolving Netanyahu of responsibility for trying to change the ceasefire terms and drag out negotiations so he can stay in power.Israel’s latest siege deprives Palestinians of basic needs like food, fuel and medicine – and it plunges Gaza back into the worst days of the Israeli military assault, which killedmore than 48,000 Palestiniansand displaced nearly 2 million. The blockade also opens Israel to renewed charges that it is committingwar crimes in Gaza. Both the Geneva conventions and theRome Statute, the founding document of the international criminal court, prohibit using starvation of civilians as a weapon of war, and consider it a war crime. In November, theICC issued arrest warrantsfor Netanyahu and Israel’s former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, on charges of using starvation as a method of warfare and other crimes against humanity.Today, Trump is repeating the failed and morally bankrupt policies of the Biden administration – unwavering support and unrestrained weapons shipments toIsrael, even as Netanyahu backs out of his commitment to the ceasefire that both administrations pushed him into accepting. And Trump risks becoming as deeply complicit in Israel’s war crimes as Biden had been.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionIsraelDonald TrumpUkraineIsrael-Gaza warGazacommentShareReuse this content"

Decades on, I am horrified that an approach that wreaked havoc in the global south is still being pursued in the UK.Britain was of course the trailblazer forprivatising infrastructurein the Thatcher years, and subsequent UK governments went on to use public-private partnerships to fund new schools, hospitals, roads and prisons, with much of the capital being raised overseas. While many countries in the global south have been coerced into selling off their assets, successive UK governments have done so enthusiastically, watering down our regulations and lowering tax barriers – known as “de-risking” in today’s parlance – to attract foreign entities seeking to buy up British assets.And buy up they have. According to thelatest count by the Office for National Statistics, 38% of all turnover of non-financial businesses in Britain went through foreign owned companies. US businesses have been the primary beneficiaries of Britain’s mass sell-off of its assets, with the value of (known) holdings domiciled in the US rising from£242bn to £708bn in the decade to 2023(likely to be far greater if we knew how much they also have of the £630bn or so of further holdings being routed through low-tax regimes like Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK’s own crown dependencies).I don’t think even Thatcher would have imagined that a quarter of British GDP would today be made up of sales of US multinationals like Amazon, Coca-Cola, Goldman Sachs and Uber. What that means is that key decisions are being made elsewhere, intellectual property is often held overseas, profits are extracted and taxes not paid here.As the economist Angus Hanton argues, the UK hasbecome a vassal state, paying economic tribute to theAmerican owners of its assets. Indeed, some have speculated that Donald Trump may spare the UK in hisglobal trade tariff warbecause the UK has already removed most obstacles to US economic supremacy and wealth extraction.Having sold off our public assets, and hollowed out the state’s capacity to directly deliver services and infrastructure, we now rent our public services from the foreign entities that own our buses,water companies, energy networks, prisons,care homes, and provide us with the IT services needed to run the state. There is also a bitter irony that some of these foreign entities are actually state-owned enterprises.The chancellor’s recent endorsement ofairport expansionwill have been music to the ears of the Qatari, Saudi and Chinese governments, who own stakes in Heathrow airport, and the foreign private equity firms that stand toprofit from both HeathrowandGatwick’s growth. But these expansions are more likely to divert money away from high streets, the domestic tourism industry and foundational economies across the UK than they are to produce any “useful” sort of growth.This is especially true in countries where the state has dismantled the rules that protect the public from market failure and help businesses to do the right thing. The UK already has low levels of regulation by international standards. And yet, over the years, successive governments have weakened genuine public protections – from environmental safeguards, to food standards and workers’ rights – and eroded the capacity of UK regulators to enforce the rules. By asking regulators to prioritise economic growth over other important social and environmental priorities, the new UK government risks following the same dangerous path.What UK policymakers forget are lessons being learned the hard way by manydebt-laden countriesof the global south: that today’s “foreign investment” can lay the ground for tomorrow’s extraction and dependency. The optimism of investors seeking new opportunities in the global south in the early part of this century has turned to horror as money has moved to what are seen as safer markets amid the global economic turbulence of recent years – and rising interest rates have meant higher debt servicing costs.Indeed,projections by the ONE campaignshow the net flow of international finance into the global south has actually gone into reverse, with developing countries collectively paying back more to international lenders than they are receiving in new funding. This is what makes the announcements of cuts to the UK’s aid budget – an important resource for softening the impact of liberalisation on the poorest – all the more painful.Arguably the most dangerous aspect of the orthodox approach to economic development has been its wilful negligence ofdangerous levels of inequality. Not only did countries that pursued these economic policies become more unequal but there was also active collusion between political and economic elites to further rig the rules to their mutual benefit. In India, we’ve seenbusinessman Gautam Adani– briefly, in 2022, the world’s second wealthiest man – reaping extraordinary benefits from hisclose tieswith the prime minister, NarendraModi. Soon after the Indian government changed its rules to allow companies with no prior experience in the sector to tender for airports,Adani had six. Adani has been charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in connection witha $250m (£195m) bribery plot. The Adani Group has denied the specific allegations, and more generally said that it has not benefited from political patronage. Those who think the UK is immune to corruption need only look at how the VIP lane worked when governmentcontracts were issuedduring the pandemic response.The UK has seen income and wealth inequality soar in recent years, leaving us looking far more like the US than continental Europe. The consequence of this could not be starker. Earlier this year,a reportfrom King’s College London and the Fairness Foundation warned that growing wealth inequality in the UK could be a “major driver of societal collapse” within the next decade. And even those benefiting from rising inequality think it is dangerous, with more than half of rich peoplepolled by Patriotic Millionairesthinking that extreme wealth is a “threat to democracy”.The new UK government has shown some signs that it is learning the lessons of global worst practice, for example by promising to renationalise railways, create anational wealth fundthat can make strategic investments, and by raising capital gains taxes. But we need a coherent new strategy that doesn’t repeat the mistakes of the past and prevents us sleepwalking into economic disaster. Forty years of liberalisation is enough.Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah is the chief executive of the New Economics Foundation and author ofPower to the People.

A massive 77% are more content with their lives after they hit 40, with two-thirds saying they no longer cared what other people thought, and 59% having attained self-actualisation – or, at least, they say they “now know what really matters in life”. Which is probably about as self-actualised as it gets. That data is all from the high-fibre breakfast treat funded study.The UN, meanwhile, has survey results from the UK, Ireland, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and kicks off cheerfully enough – happiness used to be conceived in a U-shape, when it was bliss to be alive in youth, miserable in middle age, and then picked up again as you got older. Now it’s more of a straight upward trajectory, although that can’t literally be true as it would make babies the saddest people on Earth. Fair play, they do cry a lot.The problem with the UN’s research is that it’s pretty clear about what’s driving this change, and – newsflash – it isn’t pilates.The economist David Blanchflower, co-author with the academic psychologistJean Twenge, is blunt: there’s a “crisis in wellbeing among the young”. They’ve become isolated, they don’t go out, they’re not carefree, they don’t have sex.Separate research has demonstrated, repeatedly, that there’s a mental health crisis in the under-35s, with more than 500,000 excluded from the workforce. The proportion of young people out of work owing to mental health problems has nearly doubled since 2012. It’s possible that people hit peak happiness at 45 just by dint of the tremendous good fortune of not being younger than 45.There are so many explanations for this that crumble as soon as you pick them up. Covid is often thought to have hit the young harder: it disrupted school and warped exam results; those at university paid the price for the best years of their lives without actually enjoying them; those just starting work missed out on the comradeship and knowledge-sharing of offices. Blanchflower contends that the trend started before 2020, however, and didn’t end when normal life resumed – so it must be something else, maybe social media use, cyberbullying, online body shaming.Trying to make sense of that, people in their 40s and 50soften fall back on the snowflake hypothesis. If these features of modern life – which the rest of us manage OK – have overwhelmed one generation, maybe they’re just not robust? Too hung up on identity politics, too easily offended, too ready to protest over offence they’ve taken, too keen to diagnose themselves with things, and then too strident in asking for allowances – just too fragile for the world. I’ve heard variations on this from people who work alongside gen Z and younger millennials for so long I started to take it on trust. I only ever spoke to those young ’uns on the phone, when they seemed like regular, resilient humans. But what did I know? I worked at home.Increasingly, though, these narratives seem more like elevator music – soothing, formless – than coherent melody; it’s just not plausible that digital natives would be so much more affected by online behaviour when they’re so much cannier about it. There are much more obvious explanations, which young people will freely volunteer: student debt, the immense barriers to well-paid work for those without a degree, the fact that even putatively high quality jobs are no longer secure, and the fact that wages have stagnated yet housing costs have done the opposite.Of course there are variations within the generation, but the overall picture is that life is simply much harder. Generational wealth transfer will bake in existing inequalities, and middle class millennials areset to gain most– but real distribution happens through inheritance, which is to say, not when you’re young. More likely, when you’re about 45.Young people face hard-scrabble living standards, a political discourse that says it’s your own fault for buying too many lattes, and a wellness culture that centres individual discipline. It seems the only way to keep yourself sane is to organise collectively. As soon as you do, though, you’re most likely to join the fight against the climate crisis, where you find yourself in the same position: the only generation without blinkers on.Is it really happiness, for the over-40s, if it’s powered by denial (also, according to Weetabix, hiking)? Or is denial what any generation would choose, if their material conditions allowed it? Either way, I suspect the range of and capacity for joy is the same across every age group; we’re the same people, dealing with different facts.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHappinessOpinionYoung peopleHealth & wellbeingMental healthWork & careersIncome inequalityHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

Surely that would make a mockery of all he promisedThu 6 Mar 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 12.50 ESTShareIn his statement to parliament last week, Keir Starmerpledged £13.4bn more spending on defencefrom 2027, rising to 3% of GDP in the next parliament. This additional spending is critical for our future defence. The House of Lords defence committee has pointed out that decades of underinvestment have hollowed out our defences, and that our vulnerabilities, especially in air defences, couldput the UK in peril.The prime minister also promised that the government “will translate defence spending into British growth, British jobs, British skills and British innovation”. Our 70,000Unitemembers working in UK defence companies will certainly hold him to it.The first test of this “brave new world” will be how we replace our ageing RAF fighter jets. The RAF has 24 T1Eurofighter Typhoonsthat need to be replaced. The obvious thing to do is purchase two new squadrons of the upgraded T5 Typhoons. All the UK’s other partner nations in the Eurofighter Typhoon consortium – Germany, Italy and Spain – have recently made similar decisions.But it seems the UK is going in another direction, perhaps purchasing American-made F-35 jets. The Royal Navy already uses F-35s on its aircraft carriers. Unite is not proposing to change that. But replacing British RAF Typhoons with American F-35s would make a mockery of the prime minister’s promise on British jobs and British skills.View image in fullscreenA Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 (above) and an F-35B Lightning II aircraftComposite: NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock, MoD/Crown copyrightUnite research has determined that a UK order of 24 F-35s would only secure two or three months of work in the UK, for about 2,000 workers. An order for 24 Typhoons would secure more than 20,000 jobs for years for workers in BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Leonardo and the UK supply chain.The skills issue is, if anything, even more concerning. Right now, the UK can develop, deploy and control our own fighter jets. And we are part of a vital programme to continue that capacity into the future. The global combat air programme (GCAP) will allow the UK to produce the next generation of fast fighters, beyond Typhoons, known in the UK as Tempest, along with our partners Italy and Japan.As the House of Commons defence committeerecently warned: “Retention of the existing Typhoon manufacturing workforce … until full-scale production of Tempest is under way, must be a priority.” Tempest is planned to enter service in 2035. If we don’t get more Typhoons to assemble in the UK in the interim, it will be too late.The UK is one of the few countries in the world with the capacity, atBAE Systems in Warton, Lancashire, to do final assembly on the most modern fighter jets. At Rolls-Royce we also have the highly specialist capacity to manufacture and maintain what the Americans call afterburners for military jet engines. To retain these critical skills, and the vital military capability that follows from that, we desperately need a new order of Typhoons. If that doesn’t happen, these skills, these jobs and our national sovereignty over our air defences will be lost.The F-35 is not a better aircraft. The Typhoon has better range, better air defences and can carry both British and US-made weapons. RAF Typhoon fighter jets are much better suited to policing Nato’s borders to fight any future Russian threat than F-35s, which were designed as stealth fighters for much shorter missions.The world has changed – it’s time for a radical Labour rethink on the economy | Heather StewartRead moreWe have to also avoid becoming dangerously reliant on American technology. This is all the more important because of President Trump’s recent insistence that he favours some conciliation with Russia to end the Ukraine war, and that the UK and Europe are now on their own when it comes to defending their borders. The way the US president is behaving, he might just have a bad morning one day and decide to deny us access to the data that we would need to go into combat with F-35s. We could be locked out of our own defence system.So, vital decisions for defence beckon. The Labour government’s strategic defence review is due soon. It must include the renewal of the RAF fighter fleet by buying new Typhoons. The alternative would not only endanger thousands of jobs, it would compromise our national security and, after the PM’s announcement, would see this government snatching defeat from the jaws of victory – with a bad choice and another failed promise.Sharon Graham is general secretary of the union UniteExplore more on these topicsDefence policyOpinionUniteRoyal Air ForceMilitarycommentShareReuse this content"

It is more than a decade since the investigation of this, and other wrongful actions, by undercover units was taken over by a judge-led public inquiry. Following revelations that officers had spied on Stephen Lawrence’s family, Theresa May, who was then the home secretary,ordered that inquiry.ITV’s new three-part documentary, The Undercover Police Scandal: Love and Lies Exposed, made in collaboration with the Guardian, emphasises that there was nothing inevitable about this outcome. The series, which features remarkable home-video footage of one officer, Mark Jenner (known undercover as Mark Cassidy), is a gripping and shocking account of the way that five women weretricked into romantic relationshipslasting years. As well as the insidious conduct of individuals, the series sheds light on the systemic nature of the abuse and the tenacity of the women whouncovered the truth.Undercover police, like the intelligence services, have a role to play in protecting the public from dangerous criminals. But the methods of the secret unit that these officers belonged to, the Special Demonstration Squad, were abusive and wrong – as theMetropolitan police admittedwhen it settled a civil case 10 years ago. The women spied on were grossly unsuitable targets. The activists in the film were involved in non-violent leftwing protests.When Mark Stone (in reality Mark Kennedy) wasunmasked in 2011, efforts were made to present him as a “rogue officer”. But this too was false: a tradecraft manual obtained by this newspaper recommended “fleeting” relationships as a tactic. We now know that 50 or more women were manipulated into relationships byat least 25 officers, several of whom had children with partners who did not know their real names (the mother of Bob Lambert’s child learned his identity from the press).Whose idea was all this? Who authorised it in specific cases? Was the officer the sole conduit for intelligence or were conversations bugged? What kinds of discussions with supervisors took place when women began to speak about having children, or suffered bereavements and asked their boyfriends to attend funerals?Despite the inquiry, vast amounts of material remain hidden. Of the four men featured in the series, so farLambertis the only one to have testified at the inquiry. John Dines (known undercover as John Barker), with whom Helen Steel spent two years before he deserted her, has refused to appear. Last year, one officer, Trevor Morris, described the Met’s official apology to the women as “outrageous”.Years of reflecting on what happened have made these women eloquent witnesses as well as skilful detectives. Almost all the undercover officers using these tactics were men, some of them married with children. Their victims derive some satisfaction from having outsmarted the secret state. But nothing can turn back the clock or get back those stolen years and feelings. The officially sanctioned deception and abuse of multiple young women by British police officers was a disgraceful episode. It is not enough to pledge that it will never be repeated. Continued resistance to full disclosure, and accountability, must end.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This malign strategy must be stoppedThu 6 Mar 2025 13.50 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 18.54 ESTShareIt is two months since Justin Trudeau announced his resignation as Liberal party leader and Canada’s prime minister. After a decade in power, Mr Trudeau had become increasingly unpopular. Two out of three Canadians thought he was doing a bad job. The opposition Conservatives led in almost every poll. With the Liberals staring a 2025 general election defeat in the face, Mr Trudeau’sministersforced him out. His successor will be chosen this Sunday.But then cameDonald Trump. Mr Trump wants to strengthen the US at the expense of its neighbours. His hostility to Canada is thus visceral and deep. Without any justification, he promised illegal 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican imports. As a fig leaf for his intentions, he falsely claimed that Canada’s 5,000-mile border with the US was an open door for migrants and drugs. He talked, repeatedly and deliberately, of annexing Canada and making it the 51st state. He mocked Mr Trudeau, referring to him as merely a state governor.It is a malign strategy, at odds with the previous long alliance between the two nations. InCanada, Mr Trump’s aggression has backfired spectacularly. Unsurprisingly, Canadian national feeling has been turbocharged. Canadians are boycotting US goods and cancelling US holidays. The US national anthem has been booed at sports events. Mr Trudeau is quitting, but he has been giving as good as he gets in the fight against Mr Trump.This week, Mr Trump finally brought in the tariffs, in flagrant breach of the North American free trade agreement. Then, following emergency talks with manufacturers that built their businesses around the cross-border terms of that agreement, hesuspendedthose on cars for a month the next day. Stock markets tanked on day one, but rebounded a little on day two.On Tuesday,addressing Congress, Mr Trump again told outright lies about the scale of migration, drug smuggling and trade imbalances with Canada. Yet the chaos continues, with global economic implications. Further tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium are scheduled next week. It amounts to a systematic and wholly unprovoked attack on the economy and sovereignty of a peaceful and prosperous neighbour, for which there is no excuse whatever.Ironically, Mr Trump’s main political achievement is to have revived the Canadian Liberals, who have turned a large polling deficit around and are nowclosing the gapwith Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives. Whether that gap closes even further will depend partly on the choice of Mr Trudeau’s successor, which lies between the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland and the former Bank of England chief Mark Carney.The Trump onslaught also posesa testof judgment and patriotism for all western Conservative parties, and certainly for Canada’s. An election contest that was previously about the incumbent Liberals’ record has been transformed into one about who is best placed to stand up for Canadian sovereignty. Mr Trump’s unpopularity is the central election issue. Mr Poilievre has been slow to adjust. This week he suggested, with all the sensitivity of Liz Truss, that the answer to the tariffs was tocut taxes.Mr Trump has overturned Canadian politics as well as the international order. As a result, in the worldwide battle to protect a rules-based trading system, and to defend an international order based on respect for sovereignty, it is Canada that finds itself in the frontline.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Then my father wrote to the Guardian …, 5 March). Sam’s experiences were very familiar to me, in that they were a reminder of my brother coming out more than 20 years ago.My brother is younger than me and, although our family home was a loving one, I guess that my brother will have viewed our dad and I as being very “male”. We both enjoyed our football, enjoyed socialising, and had groups of like-minded friends; my brother was the polar opposite. As a result, he was terrified of coming out.By the time he took the decision to tell us, I’d moved out and set up home with my girlfriend. One Monday evening, I visited home, and after the usual chit-chat, my brother said he had something he needed to tell us. I could see and sense his fear when he revealed that he was gay.I walked across the room and hugged him tight. He asked if it bothered me, to which I replied: “Why would it? You’re my brother, I’m proud of you.” He’d already told Mum and Dad, and – despite my brother’s apprehension about telling Dad in particular – they had both reacted in the same way that I did.Things haven’t been easy for my brother and, after meeting his partner, he moved to Devon to be with him. They’ve been together for 14 years now, and that’s where he now calls home. I miss him terribly at times, but it makes me happy to know he’s happy. I thank Sam for his beautiful words that reminded me of a moment when my brother made me proud.Name and address suppliedI read Sam Dick’s article with a mixture of feelings. I’m a gay man 10 years older than the writer and I recognised how hard it was growing up in a society full of homophobia; I also recognised the homophobic bullying. However, I didn’t recognise the supportive parents. When I came out to mine in the 90s, they didn’t hide their disappointment. What made it greater was that my only sibling, my younger brother, was also gay. My parents felt as if they’d done something wrong, and my dad fell into a depression. It made for a very complex family dynamic.I now view my coming out to my parents as putting them on a journey to acceptance. Slowly, over time, they saw that me and my brother were happy. They started to tell their friends and family members that we were gay. This made for a more cohesive family unit. However, in my dad’s later life, he revealed to me that he’d wished that I wasn’t gay. Thankfully, I view this as belonging to only him – I don’t have to wear it – and being able to do this has freed me enormously.Now, we live in a culture where film and television give textbook examples for parents in how to respond when their child comes out: the filmLove, Simonand Channel 4’s comedyBig Boysspring immediately to mind. Perhaps if my parents’ generation had had these in their world when I came out then my experience, and that of others, would have been more positive.Name and address suppliedWhat really struck me about Sam Dick’s article was his mother’s comment saying that his life was going to be hard. When I came out to my parents and sister as a gay man at the age of 20 in 2006, I chose to do it separately to each of them. My sister, then 18, supported me immediately: “So you’re my first gay friend!” My mother, reading a book in bed, started crying and said: “I am just so worried about how it’s going to be for you.” My dad, watching TV in the living room, said: “Well, I’d be lying if I said I never suspected it, and your life will be more difficult, but we will support you.”And it’s true. Living in Berlin makes it easier, but I think, no matter how liberal the place where you live, there is always an undercurrent of ignorance and homophobia. I am very aware that I am living in a bubble and that most people in the world have different opinions.Thinking back on these initial, emotional responses from my family still gives me strength and makes me feel extremely safe and lucky to have the family I do, something which many members of the queer community are unable to count on. I applaud Sam and his family, and hope that, in some small way, I can also contribute.Michael AchtzehnBerlin, GermanyI am moved by the exceptionally civilised and human response of Sam Dick’s parents, who stood up for their son when most of world was shaming and blaming people like Sam. Supportive families like Sam’s can and do make a change in wider society as well as to family members. They made my day better.Igor ZvonicEdinburghDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, pleaseclick hereto upload it.

What do you reckon – can I be English?, 5 March). As someone who is white and of mixed first-generation Polish on my father’s side and English/Welsh extraction on my mother’s side, I have mixed feelings on this subject.As a child, I initially had no doubt that I was English until one day in the 1970s when I was asked at school, during an important football World Cup qualifier, which team I supported. When I responded, “Poland”, I was informed by my classmates that I was therefore no longer English.Like many people from different cultural backgrounds, this was against a backdrop of far-right anti-immigrant hatred and misunderstanding. And although my experience was not as extreme as that suffered by many others, I was still very conscious of the potential for hatred and violence, which in my case culminated in some children standing up and saying “Sieg heil” when I entered the classroom.Chillingly, one of my daughters had a similar experience at university, where a student scratched a swastika on the bedroom door in her dorm.However, as a child it was at that point in my life when I started to question my own perception of Englishness and decided that, although I very much wanted to integrate into UK society, I would in future consider myself to be British and not English. British seemed more inclusive and less tribal.Mark SzrejderSolihull, West MidlandsMy wife’s British, I’m German. Brexit caused her to also acquire German citizenship, just in case. Her Scots father was of Ulster extraction and her English mother had southern Irish ancestors. We have three sons. The oldest was born in Dorset; the second one in South Africa. We adopted the youngest 10 years later because his (German) birth mother wasn’t able to take care of him. He couldn’t have become part of our family if we’d stayed in (apartheid) South Africa because of his brown skin. His biological father was most likely from England.So here’s the question: who of our family is “English”? I am definitely not, despite my UK settled status. My wife considers herself British and “passport-German”. She loves all her roots – English, Scots and Irish. Our sons have British and German citizenship. They regard themselves as German as well as British, with a bias on the English part when it comes to football and rugby.Hans GemmerWorthing, West SussexDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

The first, from Bruno Fernandes, probably deniedManchester Unitedtheir victory; the second, from André Onana, definitely denied Real Sociedad theirs.United deservedly got themselves into a first-leg lead when Joshua Zirkzee guided a side-footed shot beyond Alex Remiro that appeared to set them up for a win and potentially even one big enough to virtually see them through.

Which was when a figure in yellow flew to the rescue.Real Sociedad 1-1 Manchester United: Europa League last 16, first leg – live reactionRead moreUltimately, a 1-1 draw is not a bad result for United, and Onana’s sensational save from Orri Óskarsson ensured that they return to Old Trafford level but frustrated. “It could be better, it could be worse,” Ruben Amorim said. It also offered little evidence that United have overcome their most pressing, immediate problems. Instead, it highlighted flaws, leaving them to reflect on the moments when they could have provided the final pass and, in particular, applied the finish.“It is clear we have to be more clinical,” Amorim said. “We’re creating chances. Sometimes you don’t see that in the xG because we manage not to shoot. Sometimes we are missing something.” The manager talked of United’s “anxiousness” to score here, a mental block that needs to be broken, and there is tiredness to deal with too. That, Amorim said, was increasingly evident in the final minutes when his side looked overrun.Quick GuideEuropa League roundup: Roma and nine-man Lazio snatch late winsShowA stoppage-time goal earnedRomaa 2-1 home win overAthletic Bilbaoin the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie asLaziosnatched a late 2-1 win atViktoria Plzen, despite finishing the game with nine men.Roma wasted two decent chances to take a first-half lead. Artem Dovbyk found a way past the Bilbao defence and into the area but lost his footing as he went to shoot and Paulo Dybala thundered a shot off the crossbar.Bilbao took the lead five minutes after the break when Iñaki Williams headed in, but Roma were soon level when Angeliño's shot went in off the post after a cutback from Zeki Celik. Bilbao went down to 10 men five minutes from time after Yeray Álvarez received a second booking and Roma snatched the late winner via Eldor Shomurodov.Plzen fell behind to Lazio after 18 minutes from Alessio Romagnoli's header but the Czechs drew level after the break when the unmarked Rafiu Durosinmi headed home from close range. Lazio had Nicolò Rovella sent off and Samuel Gigot also saw red in added time, but Gustav Isaksen curled a shot into the top corner in the 98th minute to give them victory.Bodø/Glimttook a major step towards the quarter-finals with a 3-0 win overOlympiakosandEintracht Frankfurtsecured a 2-1 win atAjax.Bodø/Glimt were in front after 13 minutes thanks to Konstantinos Tzolakis's own goal, the Olympiakos keeper knocking Jostein Gundersen's header into his own net after the ball bounced down off the crossbar.The hosts doubled their lead when Kasper Høgh tapped in Ole Blomberg's cross and Høgh was on target after the break with another close-range finish. The Norwegian side will fancy their chances of advancing when they head to Greece with a three-goal cushion over last season's Conference League winners.Ajax went ahead in the 10th minute through Brian Brobbey's header but Frankfurt levelled when Hugo Larsson netted with a powerful strike from distance which took a slight deflection off Brobbey. Frankfurt grabbed the winner 20 minutes from time, Ellyes Skhiri finishing off a pass from Ansgar Knauff.Earlier in the evening,Lyonsecured a 3-1 victory atFCSB. Malick Fofana netted twice in the final four minutes to wrap up the win.ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Beyond that there is something deeper, more basic. The game began with United’s players waiting for a long punt in their rough direction, and for much of the opening period that felt like it had set the tone. Soon after, Fernandes looked up, appealed for some movement and struck a long diagonal out of play, which did too. The game was cautious and imprecise. When Beñat Turrientes slipped and his shot dribbled apologetically wide, it was eloquent. As was the fact that the referee, Ivan Kruzliak, immediately pointed at his watch and told Onana to hurry up. They had been playing only 18 minutes and it was already dragging a bit.ThatReal Sociedadhad more possession with little threat at least offered United space into which to run, seen when Noussair Mazraoui released Diogo Dalot. Rasmus Højlund was screaming for it, first time, inside the area but instead Dalot slowed, turned back and went to Garnacho. The chance was lost and the move concluded with Patrick Dorgu slicing over, while Højlund justifiably made his displeasure very visible. “The decision was not the best,” Amorim said. “The important thing is to move on [and] not be still fighting.”View image in fullscreenReal Sociedad’s Mikel Oyarzabal scores from the penalty spot to level the score at 1-1.Photograph: Javier Etxezarreta/EPAThe next time was better too, at least in inception. A superb pass released Dalot, who pulled it back for Fernandes by the penalty spot. Fernandes’s shot was blocked by Aritz Elustondo, Zirkzee’s first follow-up hit Remiro’s legs and his second scuffed wide, something a little comic in how it had all unravelled. What was it Amorim had said? “There are things that are hard to explain.

When Fernandes lifted a pass into the area Dalot dropped his header harmlessly into Remiro’s arms. But at least United were getting chances and those became clearer and more frequent, red shirts beginning to stream through the middle. A smart pass from Fernandes and a neat flick from Zirkzee set up Dorgu to drive the ball across the six-yard box, through four men, Højlund included, only for Garnacho to hit the side netting. Next, Fernandes set up Garnacho for another effort. And then United were away, Dalot supplying Garnacho who drew in three defenders and teed up Zirkzee to sidefoot through Turrientes’s legs and past Remiro.All that had happened within eight second-half minutes and a moment later Garnacho hit the side netting again. “We were in control. We were so near to getting the second, you could feel the stadium was nervous,” Amorim reflected, “but the penalty changed it.” As Fernandes jumped with Nayef Aguerd on 70 minutes he reached out an arm that few here saw but in the video assistant referee room they did. From the spot, Oyarzabal smashed the ball past Onana. It was Real Sociedad’s first shot on target, and suddenly they were in this.Not just in it but chasing victory, led by the substitutes Sheraldo Becker and Orri Óskarsson. As they ran, United faded. Onana brilliantly pushed away a superb Brais Méndez shot and then Real should have gone ahead when Becker’s perfectly weighted delivery reached Óskarsson. Six yards out, he nudged wide with the outside of his right boot. The next time Becker received, the pass was the same; this time, Matthijs de Ligt slipped but somehow scrambled it away. United were on edge and when Oyarzabal’s superb pass set up Óskarsson on 93 minutes, they needed Onana to take off once more, left hand outstretched.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueReal SociedadManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

According to reportingin the New York Times, the delegate was Ignacio Alonso, the president of the Uruguayan Football Association. Uruguay will be one of three South American countriesto host a “centenary celebration match”in 2030. Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, agreed to explore the idea further.AFifaspokesperson told the Guardian it had a duty to consider all requests from council members: “A proposal to analyse a 64-team Fifa World Cup to celebrate the centenary of the Fifa World Cup in 2030 was spontaneously raised by a Fifa council member in the ‘miscellaneous’ agenda item near the end of the Fifa council meeting held on 5 March 2025.

A proposal to stage the World Cup every two years was abandoned but next year’s World Cup in Mexico, Canada and the US will bring an increase from 32 countries to 48, with the number of matches rising from 64 to 104.Spain, Portugal and Morocco are to act as joint hosts in 2030, with centenary matches in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay. The addition of 16 further teams would create substantial logistical challenges for the hosts, not least the duration of the tournament, which would probably run for at least six weeks. Questions over the carbon footprint of such an event would grow larger.The politics of an expanded World Cup reveal the differing priorities of competing nations and confederations. In South America an increase in participating numbers could in effect mean the end of qualifying rounds, which would in turn hit the resources of national associations who receive revenue from those matches, and as many as half of Uefa’s 55 nations would be expected to qualify. In Asia, Africa and Oceania an expansion of places would probably be received positively, with a number of countries likely to make their World Cup debuts as a result.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2030World CupFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Rugby’s version is not a million miles removed: bigger pitch and more bodies involved but plenty of overlap on the content. For Saturday’s pivotal next step in Ireland’s grand slam bid, France have put it up to them before a ball is kicked, with a magnificent seven lumps on the bench, supported by just one back.It worked against Italy, which is not to say it will not end in tears this time out. That’s why it’s called Risk.Ireland’s riposte is less brazen, but only just. The last time they went 6-2 on the bench was against England a year ago – whichdidn’t end too well– and they have an extra bit of jeopardy with the inclusion of their most capped player, Cian Healy, in the replacements. The prop is a veteran of countless contacts and is looking forward to the afterlife already, which he reckons will demand more physical activity simply to avoid falling apart. The plan for Saturday is to limit his engagement to the fag end of the final quarter. The risk is that circumstance might hurry that one up to a critical level if Andrew Porter has to bail out ahead of schedule.The Breakdown | Ireland v France can live up to hype and seize rugby back from stattosRead moreOtherwise Ireland are treading the conventional path with the usual suspects in the starting lineup. Jamie Osborne may not fit that category yet but if this was Ghostbusters then he’d be the first one you’d call. His talent mitigates the absence of the injured Mack Hansen, and his versatility could get him a seat on the plane to Australia with the Lions this summer.“We have a bit of flexibility in Jamie’s position, [with] him covering the majority of positions in the backline,” Simon Easterby, the interim head coach, said. “We felt Caelan [Doris] has done incredibly well to get back to full fitness and done a brilliant job with the medical staff, being able to get himself right from an injury which other players might not have been able to do in a short space of time. We needed to make sure we had good coverage in the back row.“The dynamics of that pack and how France might play the game meant we felt that it was a nice chunky back five of our scrum to come on and make an impact, as well as having someone like Jamie from the start, and he can cover a number of positions.”On the downside Tadhg Furlong and Rónan Kelleher are not back to full fitness yet but Finlay Bealham’s form has been good and Rob Herring is exactly the sort of veteran you need for this environment.“I think Rob gives that little bit more experience and nous in a position which can be pretty tricky,” says Easterby. “What he will allow us to do as well is he’ll have the opportunity to come off the bench with a younger player in Tom Clarkson. It gives him and Tom a nice bit of a connection, along with Cian and his experience on the other side of that.”On the diplomatic front for France, Fabien Galthié lobbed over the top one of those compliments that could be designed to explode on impact. “Ireland today are a team of the very highest quality: one of the two best countries in the world – perhaps even the best – and they’re playing at home,” he said. “To put the task for us in context: since 2020 they have played 31 home matches and lost two – against France in 2021 and New Zealand last November. So it’s true we’re facing a huge challenge but that’s what we’re looking for.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Offered a choice between running over the top of boys in green or getting stuck in full-on warfare, surely he would opt for the former. The return of Damian Penaud on the wing and Emmanuel Meafou to the bench feeds into this. Sticking with Mickaël Guillard reflects how good the Lyon second-row was against Italy, and the impact Ireland will have to deal with when the replacements roll into action. By then Galthié will hope, with Romain Ntamack back in harness, the reward is winning out over the risk.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025Ireland rugby union teamFrance rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The top flight’s nearest competitors, La Liga and theBundesliga, brought in €3.7bn and €3.6bn respectively. It forms part of a wider picture in which revenues in the continent’s top divisions totalled €26.8bn, 17% more than before the Covid-19 pandemic.The median revenue for a Premier League club stood 60% higher than their Bundesliga equivalents and more than three times those in Serie A andLa Liga, in what is essentially a comparison between mid-table sides. This was primarily driven by broadcast money and the disparity looks likely to become more dramatic in the coming years amid a broadly bleak picture for television rights figures across many of the major leagues.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Domestic broadcasting revenues across the board grew by a modest 3% in the five years to 2023, paling in comparison with much greater leaps in commercial, sponsor and gate income. Early data for 2024 points to an 11% rise in gate revenues last year, with income from premium seating a major driver. Crowds were shown to be up 6% on pre-pandemic levels.Premier League clubs’ player wages ate up 49% of their revenue on average. Salaries rose by only 3% around the continent in 2023 and 4.5% across early-reporting clubs in 2024.Uefafeels it is evidence its cost control rules, which will cap spending on wages and transfers at 70% of revenue for next season, are kicking in after being rolled out gradually in the past two years. A 19% increase in non-player wage growth suggests clubs are committing to heavier investment in technical and administrative staff. Total wages among top-division clubs in Europe topped €18bn.The report detailed that Chelsea’s squad at the end of the 2024 financial year was the most expensive ever, its combined transfer cost standing at €1.66bn and surpassing the €1.33m spent by Real Madrid to assemble their 2020 squad. Three other clubs, all in the Premier League, had squads that cost more than €1bn: Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal.Nine English clubs were included in the continent’s top 20 wage bills for 2023-24, City leading the top flight’s contingent by taking second place behind Paris Saint-Germain. Arsenal, United, Tottenham and Liverpool were among eight European sides to take more than €100m in gate revenue in 2023.Explore more on these topicsFinancesPremier LeagueUefaEuropean club footballBusinessLa LigaBundesliganewsShareReuse this content"

It makes English football distinctive from other leagues. It adds jeopardy and excitement. It’s something we all love about the game of football and that has never been under question. We fundamentally believe promotion and relegation is an important differentiator and an important competitive advantage for us, relative to other women’s sport leagues globally.”Doucet added that there was a desire to “make sure that our league works for club investors to allow more investment in the game” but that that would not “change our core principles”.She also said they “wouldn’t be doing our job properly” if they did not consider and review all available options. “Our mission is to build the most distinctive, competitive and entertaining women’s football competition in the world for the players and the fans for today and tomorrow,” she said. “That is one that also supports the entire pyramid.”Doucet, asked whether the backlash on social media against possible changes to promotion and relegation had changed their perspective, said that it had not and the chief operating officer, Holly Murdoch, said they would canvass fan opinion through more formal channels.“Absolutely the fan groups will be part of consultation,” said Murdoch. “What we are talking about today is that we haven’t yet got a proposal to consult on. We are still looking at concepts and options. When that proposal is in a place where we can consult, there will be informal and formal consultation so we can make sure we take everyone on the journey. The governance process is vigorous. We are working really closely with the FA on that.”The clubs are due tovote at the end of the seasonon whether to scrap relegation. But the decision is not totally in the hands of WPLL, with any changes to pyramid regulations for the 2026-27 season needing Football Association board approval by 1 August.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “I think there’s a difference between not having relegation and allowing the league to grow through promotion with no relegation versus having a closed league. If we get presented with a package of changes that’s good for the women’s game overall – and I’m talking about academies, minimum standards, player pathways – and within the context of that there’s a change to the number of clubs in the league brought about through having promotion and no relegation, then we could potentially be supportive. But we need to look at that overall package.”Further details of what is on the table have been elusive, with WPLL unwilling to disclose what is on the agenda or discussed during private shareholder meetings or expand on possible options being put forward.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen’s ChampionshipWomen's footballFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Shane Lowry, likely to be an important part of the European team, was asked last week whether he was aware of ­Bradley’s sentiment. “Oh yeah,” said the ­Irishman. “We have all seen it.”Scottie Scheffler loses to 10-handicap amateur in Arnold Palmer buildupRead moreBradley was asked to address his tub-thumping approach after a ­terrific 69 to open the Arnold Palmer Invitational. “I don’t think the ­Europeans need any more ­motivation to win the Ryder Cup,” said the US captain. “They’re a special group of players and the Ryder Cup means a lot to them. And when the Ryder Cup year and the Ryder Cup comes along, they really seem to come together and play their best golf. So I think that they’re motivated enough to beat us.”More intriguing is the fact this content emerged in the first place. Bradley himself seemed taken aback, a matter one assumes he has raised with television producers. The moment in question was filmed as the US won the Presidents Cup last year. “I thought I was in a locker room with my team,” said Bradley. “You know, that’s what happens in a locker room. I meant no disrespect to the Europeans. This was a time that we had just won the Presidents Cup, I was in the locker room and it was my turn to address the team. And I meant no disrespect, I was more speaking to our guys.“I certainly thought I was in the locker room. But, you know, in the world that we live in I have got to be more aware that there’s always­somebody filming. Again, I meant no disrespect, but we were excited. I had just won, I had just won the Presidents Cup that I hadn’t played in 10 years, it was an exciting moment for me.“I was a little surprised, yeah. But again, I have to know that in this day and age, especially with cell phones, everything’s being recorded. But that’s who I am. That’s me. I’m a pretty excited person. I’m very excited about the Ryder Cup. I think my enthusiasm towards the Ryder Cup showed there. It was meant for our team. Again, no disrespect to the other guys.”View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler plays his second shot on the 1st hole of the Arnold Palmer Invitational from a Bay Hill bunker.

Whether he will be encouraged to play if finishing close to the half-dozen automatic team members is another fascinating element of this Ryder Cup year. “I hope it’s not a tough decision,” Bradley added. “I hope I’m either on the team or it’s not a decision. If I am in the top six, I’ll play. If not, I owe it to the guys to be a captain, although I have some great vice-captains that could help that.” Clear as mud, Keegan.Scottie Scheffler was typically unfazed by a brutally tough day one in Orlando. The world No 1 signed for a 71. Lowry was clear of Bradley before dropping a shot at the last. Rory McIlroy did likewise en route to a 70. Wyndham Clark’s glorious approach set up a closing birdie to claim a two-shot lead at five under. Those to struggle included Cameron Young, who slumped to an 82, and Billy Horschel, who fared just three shots better. Min Woo Lee’s 78 and Viktor Hovland’s 77 further emphasised the scale of grind. A 72 from Ludvig Åberg and 71 delivered by Collin Morikawa were impressive. “I think this is the hardest course we play all year,” said Bradley.

The first steak I am served has a nice texture but is sort of unnaturally reddish. The second has a great crispy sear on the outside, but leaves behind a lingering chemical aftertaste. The next is fine on its own, but I imagine would be quite delicious shredded, drenched in barbecue sauce and served on a bun with vinegary pickles and a side of slaw.If you peeked into this restaurant, you’d see nothing out of the ordinary – just a diverse range of New Yorkers huddled over plates of food. But everyone present is here for more than just a hot meal. We’re participating in a blind taste test of plant- (or sometimes mushroom-) based steaks, organized by a group of people who hope that better-tastingmeat alternativesjust might be a key to fighting theclimate crisis.“We’re looking at food as a key driver of decarbonization,” said Caroline Cotto, director ofNectar, the group behind the taste test. “Taste is the largest primary purchase criteria for consumers, and for these products to gain mainstream adoption, they have to taste good.” But in the past, she admitted, a lot of plant-based meats “have not met consumers’ expectations”.‘You can’t build muscle as a vegan’ – and 13 other plant-based myths, bustedRead moreShe and her colleagues are on a mission to change that, in part by revolutionizing the way that plant-based meat companies taste-test their food. Nectar isn’t affiliated with any specific plant-based meat company; it is an initiative of the climate philanthropy groupFood System Innovations(FSI), and it exists to help speed up the world’s transition away from animal products by making meat alternatives like veggie burgers and mushroom steaks taste better. Nectar does not necessarily care which plant-based meat company “wins” the market, so long as there are plant-based winners on the market, period.The group does that in part through taste tests like the one I am participating in. These trials stand out in that they mimic people’s actual eating experiences far better than the industry standard: rather than being conducted in sterile, lab-like environments, Nectar conducts its tests in real restaurants, where the products are cooked by food service staff on standard food service equipment such as flat-top grills. And where many companies taste-test their products by serving them solo (think a single meatball on a toothpick), Nectar presents the product being tested in a format more similar to how it’s likely to be eaten by consumers (think meatballs served in tomato sauce over spaghetti).Nectar also uses a demographically diverse cross-section of everyday people, rather than taste-testing professionals, to try and get a sense for how the general public would respond to a product. The group screens participants to ensure that the person testing a plant-based steak eats real animal meat steak often enough that they have a baseline of comparison.“We don’t want these products to just taste good to people that don’t eat meat. We want them to taste good to people that are eating meat multiple times a week. We want this to be as representative of a general population consumer as possible, because the vegan market is very small,” she said.Nectar’s approach has rendered some interestingtakeaways: in a blind taste test, omnivores actually preferred the leading plant-based nugget over animal-based chicken nuggets. Vegan hot dogs are pretty universally disliked. Burgers made of real meat blended with mushrooms actually perform better in taste tests than burgers made from 100% beef.This seemingly humble mission to make tastier food has nothing less than planetary ambitions at its heart: “If we’re going to make a dent on climate change,” Cotto said, “we need to capture that mainstream audience.”Animal agriculture takes a serious and demonstrable toll on the environment, especially in the form of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. An estimated 14% of global emissions come from animal agriculture, according to Jonathan Foley, executive director ofProject Drawdown, with big ruminants like cattle being some of the worst climate offenders.“This is the wild card that will make or break climate change – food. It’s gonna be a long fight against fossil fuels, but renewable energy is better and cheaper and faster; it’s going to win at some point,” he said. “But I don’t know if a climate-friendly food system is going to win or not.”Unlike energy or transportation, where decarbonization is happening, however slowly, food is a rare sector where “we’re making almost no progress at all”, Foley said. He blames that in part on the powerful food industry, which regularly spends more money lobbying the US government than big oil or the defense industry does, according to a 2024reportfrom the Union of Concerned Scientists. In other words, there’s a whole web of money and politics that shapes what we eat, as much as we’d like to think we’re buying groceries based simply on our personal preferences and budget.Still, some experts think that having more and better plant-based protein options could help smooth the transition away from excessive meat consumption, even if it’s not a silver bullet.To do that, Cotto would argue, you have to make the alternatives taste good. She’s not alone in thinking so: the Plant Based Foods Institute published astudyin 2024 that found that people who used to buy more plant-based products in the past than they do now named flavor as “the most important attribute driving their decision to decrease their purchase of plant-based foods”.That tracks with the conclusions that Holly Wang, an agricultural, food and resource economics professor at Michigan State University, has come to by studying other kinds of plant-based foods. She points to the rise of plant-based dairy substitutes – think vegetable oil-based butter, coconut milk ice-cream, or oat, almond and soy milks – as an example of food categories where plant-based alternatives do seem to have displaced at least some consumption of animal products.“Among these categories [of plant-based food replacements], we see that the relatively more successful category is milk,” she said. “It’s getting accepted by even the non-vegetarian.” That’s in part, she posited, because “the texture of almond milk, for example, is so close to the texture of traditional milk”.When choosing a plant-based option over an animal product doesn’t feel like a sacrifice, in other words, people are more likely to choose it.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Marietta Bernal/The GuardianCotto likes to joke that she was destined to work in food: she grew up in a town called Sandwich, her last name means “cooked” in Italian, and her parents own an ice-cream store called Sweet Caroline that they named after her.Her early career journey wound through an internship at the White House with Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move!” public health campaign, a Fulbright fellowship in Taiwan and a UN World Food Programme job in Cambodia, among other roles. She went on to co-found a brand calledRenewal Millthat upcycles the byproducts of food manufacturing – the brand turns the pulp leftover from oat milk into oat flour, for example – into things like gluten-free cookie and brownie mixes. That innovation earned her a spot on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list.Cotto isn’t vegan or vegetarian – she describes herself as a flexitarian, and doesn’t seem interested in shaming people for eating meat or dairy. But as her career progressed, and she learned about the role that animal agriculture plays in accelerating the climate crisis, she felt she had to do something about it.“It became increasingly imperative for me to focus my energy on how we can decarbonize the food system,” she said. “Because it’s a huge lever, and it’s grossly underfunded and overlooked in the larger climate conversation.”As a former food startup founder herself, Cotto understands just how much the funding piece matters. The role Nectar plays as a third-party taste tester that offers some of its data for free, and the rest of it for 75% less than what it would cost otherwise, is a huge boon to the businesses in the space, which are mostly startups that are often strapped for cash. Many of these companies are weathering a “nuclear winter” landscape for funding after overvaluations and hype in 2020 and 2021 resulted in an influx of funding that was followed by a spectacular crash.“There was a big bubble in the sector,” explained Rosie Wardle, a partner and co-founder atSynthesis Capital. Wardle was an early investor in Beyond Meat, one of the best-established names in the plant-based meat category. She believes in the category’s potential – but says that companies need to prove that they can deliver on taste and price.‘Insanely tasty green food’: how the meaty Danes embraced a world-first plant-based planRead more“Within the investment community right now, there is still quite a lot of negative sentiment around alternative proteins … because a lot of investors have been burned by investing in companies that really didn’t have what it takes,” she said. “The problem of the last couple of years is that consumers’ expectations just weren’t being met from a taste and overall eating experience perspective.”Cotto hopes that Nectar can be “radically helpful” in this regard by giving businesses detailed feedback about how people perceive the flavor, texture, appearance and other aspects of their food. In the months since Nectar put out its first report last summer, companies have already begun using Nectar’s data to shape their products.Umaro Foods, co-founded by Beth Zotter, is one such company. Umaro’s vegan “bacon” made from seaweed, chickpeas and coconut oil had already raised funding via a successful bid on Shark Tank, is sold on Amazon and in Whole Foods in California, and has plans to expand to grocery stores in the north-east in the next few months. The company is, by many measures, doing far better than many of its plant-based protein peers.But when Umaro received feedback from Nectar that consumers found their product too salty and not smoky enough, it was like a “kick in the pants” to keep improving rather than resting on its laurels, Zotter, who’s also the company’s CEO, said. The company tweaked the formulation of its product in response, and that new version of the bacon is what you’ll get if you buy Umaro today. “Nectar has been invaluable to us,” Zotter said.Other companies have found Nectar’s taste-testing feedback useful in different ways. Michael Fox is the co-founder and CEO ofFable Food Co, which makes meat substitutes mostly from shiitake mushrooms that it sells primarily to restaurants and food service clients, which turn Fable’s product into meals like mushroom tacos.Fable’s blended burger – which combines mushrooms with animal meat – outperformed pure animal-meat burgers in Nectar’s recent taste-test report, which gave Fable a boost in its ability to sell chefs and restaurant owners on using Fable products.“When an independent organization like Nectar can show that, in a blind taste test, consumers prefer our product to 100% beef in a statistically significant way,” said Fox, “that just makes it so much easier for us to take that to potential customers.”How likely is it that a rise in plant-based meats will really make a dent in the amount of animal meat people are consuming? There’s not much consensus: advocacy organizations like the Plant Based Foods Institute have published research that seems to indicate that at least some segments of shoppers who increase their plant-based alternative purchases do buy fewer animal products, but experts like Foley and Wang say they haven’t seen much peer-reviewed data that’s conclusive either way.Cotto said that reviewing various studies has led many in the plant-based space to believe that there’s about a 25% substitution rate for plant-based alternatives displacing animal products, but admits that substitution remains “tricky to pin down since price is still not at parity” between meat and meat substitutes.Still, she’s convinced enough that she’s going to keep doing what she can to help companies make better-tasting vegan bacon and hot dogs, even if she can’t conclusively prove that it will mean fewer methane-burping cows roaming the earth.“Our large goal is not necessarily 100% replacement of meat,” she said. “But any reduction is a positive thing for the climate. We’re hoping that if we can really make the taste as good as or better than meat, that will make it easy for consumers.”Back at the Orion Grill in Manhattan, the stranger sitting across from me motioned for one of the people helping run the study. She, like everyone else in the room, had been selected because she self-identified as someone who eats beef steak at least every one or two months. She had just finished trying her fourth plant- or mushroom-based steak.“Are you able to tell me the brands of any of what I just ate?” she asked. When the study staff member explained that he wasn’t allowed to disclose the brand names, she nodded, looking a little disappointed.As he walked away, she looked across at me. “I just wanted to know because I would’ve looked out for some of these at the grocery store later,” she said."

But every time, the company involved sued the government for lost profits and often, they won (Romania prevailed in its case, Italy and Mexico were forced to pay out).They are among more than 1,400 cases analysed by the Guardian from within the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) system, a set of private courts in which companies can sue countries for billions. There have been long-held concerns about ISDS creating “regulatory chill” – where governments are scared off action on nature loss and the climate crisis by legal risks. Now, government ministers from a range of countries have confirmed to the Guardian that this “chilling” is already in effect – and that fear of ISDS suits is actively shaping environmental laws and regulations.Quick GuideWhat is ISDS and how does it work?ShowWhat is it?Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) was created to help companies protect investments abroad. It allows companies to sue countries for lost profits caused by government action including corruption, seizure of assets or the introduction of health and environmental policies.The system wascreated in the 1960sby the World Bank. It was intended to give companies confidence to invest in poorer countries with weak political systems where they might not get a fair hearing in domestic courts.How does it work?The foreign company must put forward a case showing that the state has damaged its profits. Most international investment treaties and free-trade deals include ISDS clauses. Cases are heard by a private arbitration tribunal, and typically decided by a panel of three arbitrators – one chosen by the company, one chosen by the state and the third selected jointly.How much are the cases worth?Awards regularly amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, and some are in the billions. In 2024 the average amount awarded was$385m(£304m).  The average sum awardedis increasingand these payouts can make up a sizeable chunk of poorer countries' annual budgets.Who is involved?The fossil fuel and mining industries are the most litigious in the ISDS system, accounting formore than 30%of known cases.Most claims are brought by companies based in rich countries against the governments of developing countries. Companies registered in developed countries file81% of ISDS lawsuits, according to UN data, while developing countries have faced 62% of cases.How common is it?ISDS began as an obscure legal mechanism, averaging aboutone case a yearfor its first decade. Now, dozens are brought every year, with Guardian analysis finding more than 900 since 2013.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In April 2018, New Zealand banned new offshore oil exploration projects, but stopped short of an outright ban or revoking existing concession. James Shaw, who was climate minister at the time, said it was because of the risk of being sued by foreign oil and gas companies. “When we implemented the ban on offshore oil and gas exploration, we had to construct that incredibly carefully in order to avoid the risk of litigation. The way that we did that was to leave existing permits in place,” he said. As a result, New Zealand was unable to be a full member of theBeyond Oil & Gas Alliance.Shaw said the implications of ISDS were discussed around the cabinet table, with the ministry of foreign affairs and Trade pushing back on environment policies and “frequently talking about the risk that we would end up in litigation”, although ISDS was rarely explicitly cited.“We could see what was happening around the world”, he said. “We’d keep track of the number of ISDS cases that were being taken and what percentage of those were essentially hostile to environmental regulation.”View image in fullscreenThe Waiho Papa Moana Hikoi (protest march) in Auckland in 2014.

He said: “It matters hugely because of the climate emergency that we are in – we’ve got an imperative under the Paris agreement to act quickly and decisively.”The idea that this does not create a chilling effect is an “outdated and inaccurate view”. He says: “My impression from working closely with governments is that ISDS is now increasingly on their radar, that is it’s increasingly an issue for them to consider: whether implementing a particular policy might give rise to claims.“We’re left with two regimes that conflict: the Paris agreement requires (broadly) that fossil fuels be phased out, and the ISDS regime provides guarantees for investors that protect their investment – even if it is a fossil fuel investment. That’s the conflict – it’s as simple as that.”My impression from working with governments is that ISDS is now increasingly on their radar, it’s increasingly an issueToby Landau, arbitration lawyer“International arbitration costs a lot of money,” says Manuel Díaz-Galeas, attorney general of Honduras, which is fighting cases claiming $18bn (£14bn) – greater than the country’s annual budget. “The thousands of millions of dollars claimed in compensation is simply absurd,” he says.Díaz-Galeas adds that the effects of ISDS claims are particularly significant for countries such as Honduras with high poverty rates and limited budgets.Rob Davies, who was minister of trade and industry of South Africa from 2009 to 2019, withdrew the country from a number of treaties with ISDS clauses from 2013 onwards. He says ISDS posed “significant risk” to the government’s legislation.“Companies have got the right to challenge any policy … that will impact their expectation of profitability in the future, no matter what the regulation is, no matter what its motivation is, no matter how well designed it is or anything,” he says. Davies believes more recently fossil fuel companies are using the ISDS provisions to “thwart regulations on green transition”. He says: “It has a chilling effect, particularly on developing countries.”In 2021, theInternational Energy Agency released a reportsaying the1.5C pathwayrequires no new oil, gas or coal. But the issue of regulatory chill has been acknowledged by a number of international bodies, including the2022 IPPC report on climate change. “Numerous scholars have pointed to ISDS being able to be used by fossil fuel companies to block national legislation aimed at phasing out the use of their assets,” the authors wrote. The UN, Council of Europe and European parliament haveall raised similar concernsabout climate action being delayed or watered down by ISDS.View image in fullscreenProtestors opposing the North American Free Trade Agreement, which contains ISDS clauses, rally in Ottawa, Canada in 2017.Photograph: The Canadian Press/Alamy“There can be astronomical costs associated with these cases,” says Kyla Tienhaara, an associate professor at the School of Environmental Studies at Queen’s University in Canada. Countries are afraid of implementing environmentally friendly policies because they can’t afford the cost of ISDS, says Tienhaara. “Governments don’t even have the funding to deal with the case in the first place.”The Guardian investigation into ISDS reveals $84bn in payouts from governments to fossil fuel companies. More than $120bn of public money has been awarded to private investors across all industries since 1976. The average payout for a fossil fuel claim was $1.2bn.Some cases can cost countries a significant portion of their total annual budget. For example, in 2015 Occidental Petroleum received a$1.1bn payoutfrom the Ecuadorian government. The country’sbudget was $29.8bn in 2016. Hondurasfaces 11 claims, with one seeking damagesequal to 30%of the country’s GDP.The problem is increasingly being discussed by climate ministers and heads of state. On the campaign trail in 2020, US presidential candidateJoe Biden saidhe opposed ISDS clauses in trade agreements because they allow “private corporations to attack labour, health and environmental policies”.View image in fullscreenMembers of the European parliament protest against ISDS during a plenary session in February 2019.Photograph: Frederick Florin/AFP/Getty ImagesLast March,Ireland’s former president Mary Robinson saidthere was a “growing number of claims brought by fossil fuel companies against governments wanting to take action to tackle the climate emergency”, claiming fossil fuel companies were seeking financial compensation from states that decided to tackle the nature and climate crisis. “I cannot overstate just how perverse this is,” she said.Fearing toxic waste, Greenland ended uranium mining.

The report stated that this threat has become a “major obstacle” for countries addressing the climate crisis.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverage.Explore more on these topicsInvestor-state dispute settlementThe age of extinctionFossil fuelsMiningEnergyGreen economyOilfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its satellite observations stretch back to the late 1970s and its historical observations to the middle of the 20th century.Scientists had already observed an extreme heat anomaly in the north pole at the start of February, which caused temperatures tosoar more than 20C above averageand cross the threshold for ice to melt. They described the latest broken record as “particularly worrying” because ice reflects sunlight and cools the planet.“The lack of sea ice means darker ocean surfaces and the ability of the Earth to absorb more sunlight, which accelerates the warming,” said Mika Rantanen, a climate scientist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.The strong winter warming event in the Arctic in early February had prevented sea ice from growing normally, he added. “I believe that this meteorological event, combined with the long-term decline of sea ice due to anthropogenic climate change, was the primary cause of the lowest Arctic sea ice extent on record.”Global sea ice extent varies throughout the year but typically reaches its annual minimum in February, when it is summer in the southern hemisphere.C3S said February 2025 was the third hottest February it had seen. Global temperatures were 1.59C hotter than preindustrial levels, making it the 19th month in the past 20 that was more than 1.5C above preindustrial levels.Earth observation programmes such as C3S rely on the reanalysis of billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations to create snapshots of the state of the climate. The agency cautioned that the margins above 1.5C were small in several months, and could differ slightly in other datasets.The broken sea ice record comes after last year wasconfirmed as the hottest year on recordand a Guardian analysis of C3S datarevealedthat two-thirds of the world’s surface was seared by record-breaking monthly heat in 2024. The El Niño weather pattern in the first half of the year added to the background heating effect of fossil fuel pollution, which traps sunlight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The World Meteorological Organization said on Thursday they expected the La Niña that emerged in December to be short-lived.Richard Allan, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, said the long-term prognosis for Arctic sea ice was grim.“The region continues to rapidly heat up, and can only be saved with rapid and massive cuts to greenhouse gas emissions,” he said. “That will also limit the growing severity of weather extremes and long-term sea level rise across the world.”The headline of this article was amended on 6 March 2025 to clarify that global sea ice cover in February fell to its lowest level on record.

They say it will cut red tape and minimise “the burden of maritime and environmental consent processes for developers”.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the taoiseach, Micheál Martin, are expected to outline the deal on Thursday morning at an inaugural British-Irish summit in Liverpool intended to reduce the trade barriers that Brexit created.Starmer said: “As our closest neighbour, our partnership with Ireland is testament to the importance of working with international partners to deliver for people at home.“Now more than ever we must work with likeminded partners in the pursuit of global peace, prosperity and security.”Martin said the cooperation would also include a joint initiative to map the sea basin to improve the interoperability of energy interconnectors.“There is good cooperation between us on energy, and I am particularly delighted that, following this summit, in recognition of critical importance of the Celtic and Irish seas, we will take that cooperation to a higher level,” he said.He also announced closer cooperation on the EU’s Horizon Europe science research programme to identify joint initiatives with Northern Ireland on energy, climate, water and food sustainability research.Starmer met his Irish counterpart on Wednesday night before the summit. The meeting followed Starmer’s promise after his election last year toimprove relations and bring ties with Ireland to a new level.The two premiers were expected to discuss trade, migration and energy supplies across the islands of Britain and Ireland, butthe latest crisis in the transatlantic partnership, one held dearly by both countries, was likely to be a prominent part of the conversation.Martin told a reception on Wednesday night that he was “delighted” Liverpool had been chosen as the setting for the summit, adding: “While we gather here this week, we are conscious also that this is a changing and uncertain world and, in that context, the case for an active, engaged and close partnership between our two countries has never been greater.”He will go straight from the summit to a special European Council meeting on defence and Ukraine and described the UK-Ireland meeting as a timely moment for both premiers to reflect on their solidarity with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a “crucial moment for European security in a rapidly evolving context”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The women were the wife and daughters of the BBC racing commentator John Hunt.View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Hannah, Carol and Louise Hunt.Photograph: FacebookClifford began plotting to attack Louise two days after she ended their 18-month relationship because he was angry at being rejected. He was also angry at the Hunt family because he “correctly assumed” they had advised Louise to break up with him, Cambridge crown court heard.In her closing speech to jurors, the prosecutor, Alison Morgan KC, said: “Louise was not going to be allowed by him to control the narrative. If he wanted Louise, he would have her, he would control her, he would rape her, and he would murder her and members of her family …“If he could not have Louise Hunt then no one else was going to and he was going to take down her family with her. The family, he knew, did not support his relationship with her. He was angered, and that anger involved the planning of sexual violence as a means of acting out of spite in a final act before Louise Hunt’s death.”View image in fullscreenThe crossbow used by Kyle Clifford.Photograph: Hertfordshire Police/PAClifford, from Enfield, north London, refused to attend the trial before the judge Mr Justice Bennathan and did not give evidence. He admitted the triple murder, false imprisonment of Louise and two counts of possession of offensive weapons, namely an MX-405 crossbow and a 25cm knife, at an earlier hearing at Cambridge crown court on 22 January. He denied raping his former partner on the day of her death.His barrister, Phil Bradley KC, told jurors on Tuesday that the defence case was that Clifford and Louise last had sexual intercourse on 23 June.But on Thursday a jury of seven women and five men found him guilty after about 45 minutes of deliberations of raping Louise on 9 July. There was applause from the public gallery after the verdicts were returned.The judge thanked the jurors and said he would sentence Clifford on Tuesday. He said: “Because of the murder convictions, the only sentence is life imprisonment.”He told the jury the case was “dreadful” and he praised the Hunt family for their dignity and restraint. John Hunt sat next to his surviving daughter, Amy, 31, during the hearing.View image in fullscreenKyle Clifford bought a 30-metre (100ft) length of rope, a crossbow, an air pistol, a 25cm butcher’s knife and two cans of petrol.Photograph: Hertfordshire Police/PAThe trial heard that Clifford began researching murder weapons while also viewing pornography within days of the break-up on 26 June.It can now be revealed that less than 24 hours before the attack he was searching the internet for podcasts by the misogynistic influencer Andrew Tate.He bought a 30-metre (100ft) length of rope, a crossbow, an air pistol, a 25cm butcher’s knife and two cans of petrol. Clifford was captured on CCTV buying two rolls of duct tape, which he used to restrain Louise, binding her wrists behind her back, and her ankles.Morgan told jurors: “It will be difficult for you to imagine what was going on in the mind of someone like Kyle Clifford. What was clearly going on was the marrying up of thoughts of extreme violence with sexual desire and fulfilment. His planning shows he planned a murderous act but also an act involving sexual violence.”Clifford murdered Carol within two minutes of blagging his way into the family home at 2.39pm. He then waited for more than an hour for Louise to finish working in the garden before restraining, gagging and raping her. He murdered her more than two hours later shortly before shooting dead Hannah with the same crossbow when she returned home from work.In legal argument, the prosecutor had said Clifford’s meticulously planned attack had involved the use of sex “as a weapon” against Louise. “The spite and slight that comes from him being mistreated, as he would see it, is what fuels the whole planning of these events and … sexualised violence is a part of that,” she said.Police said the scale of Clifford’s crimes was “unprecedented” in terms of male violence against women and girls.DCI Nick Gardner, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit, said: “This was not a crime of passion, but a carefully planned assault.” He added that Clifford gave no comment during interviews with police, had shown no remorseand felt sorry only for himself.He described Clifford’s failure to attend the trial as a “complete act of cowardice”. The judge made a number of attempts for him to be made available to the court, saying: “He could have dialled in via live link. He himself chose not to do any of that. He has put the family through the ordeal of a trial, he has created everything that has happened over this past week and the failure to show his face is completely cowardly.”Clifford became the subject of a search for a number of hours before he was found injured in Lavender Hill cemetery in Enfield on 10 July 2024 after shooting himself in the chest with the crossbow. He is now paralysed from the chest down.Lisa Kiff, a senior crown prosecutor, said: “Kyle Clifford is a murderer and a rapist who carried out a savage act of violence against three women.“His crimes are among the very worst I have encountered in my career, and he now rightly faces a life sentence behind bars.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Rahman was fined £2,000, with a confiscation order of £1.01. The court heard that neither had funds apart from the property where the fire occurred, which was valued at £155,000She passed sentence in relation to a range of housing offences including permitting unauthorised occupation of the two-bedroomed flat. Investigations are ongoing separately in relation to the death in the fire.Londonfire brigade said the fire was started accidentally by a faulty ebike battery, which was charging at the time.The other residents in the flat managed to escape. Nine bunk beds were found at the property, including two beds in the living room, and some residents are thought to have slept on the floor. The judge said on Thursday that the flat was grossly overcrowded and that some of the residents were told not to use the address for post as it could get the landlords into trouble.The men had to share a single toilet and said the property was riddled with bedbugs, mould and dirt. One said it was “like a prison”.The offences are thought to have been committed by the landlords over at least a six-month period with the couple earning about £40,000 from their tenants. Former residents of the flat have said they paid about £90 or £100 a week in rent to the married couple, mostly paid in cash.The majority of those who were living in the flat on the night of the fire are of Bangladeshi heritage and some were combining university studies with part-time work as delivery couriers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The coroner found that the battery had probably been plugged into a charger with a different voltage rating.

Ministers are looking for ways to keep money flowing toUkraineafter Donald Trump decided to freeze US military aid to the country and cut off intelligence sharing.One source said: “The sense within government is that we are heading towards the courts over this. There is a fundamental disagreement with Abramovich himself over where the money can be spent, and it seems the law is going to be the only way to resolve that.”A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “This government is working hard to ensure the proceeds from the sale of Chelsea FC reach humanitarian causes in Ukraine as quickly as possible. The proceeds are currently frozen in a UK bank account while a new independent foundation is established to manage and distribute the money.“UK officials continue to hold discussions with Mr Abramovich’s representatives, experts and international partners, and we will double down on our efforts to reach a resolution.”Abramovich’s representatives did not respond to a request to comment.The Russian billionairesold Chelsea in 2022for about £2.5bn under pressure from the British government after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Abramovich was under sanctions at the time and was granted a licence from the government to sell Chelsea as long as the money was spent supporting the victims of the Ukraine war.Since then, the government has beenin deadlockwith Abramovich over whether the money should be spent exclusively in Ukraine, as ministers want, or whether it can go outside the country as well.The proceeds, which are now worth an estimated £2.7bn, were placed in a UK bank account controlled by Abramovich’s company Fordstam.The government has promised to establish a foundation to disburse the money, headed by Mike Penrose, the former head of Unicef UK, but has not yet done so.Keir Starmer is under mounting pressure to free up the money as a way to make up for his recent decision to slash the aid budget to pay for defence spending instead. The Labour MP David Taylortold the Commonson Thursday: “The sooner we can get [the Chelsea money] into Ukraine and humanitarian aid the better, because it should, in theory, free up ODA [Official Development Assistance] money for other situations around the world.”Members of the House of Lords European affairs committeelast year describedthe failure to spend the money as “incomprehensible”.Sources say David Lammy, the foreign secretary, has now invited Penrose to a meeting in Whitehall for the first time since Labour entered government, to discuss freeing up the money.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionLammy has been advised that a court case is likely to be the only way to break the impasse with Abramovich, though he has not definitely decided to go ahead with legal action. Sources say any decision to do so would have to be taken in conjunction with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.Government officials say the decision has not yet crossed the desk of Richard Hermer, the attorney general, who has beencriticised by somefor holding up government decision-making, though it is likely to do so soon.Ministers are differentiating between the Abramovich money and a broader pool of Russian assets that have been frozen across Europe and are worth about $350bn.Lammy has beenpushing to seize the assetsand then use the money elsewhere, such as for aid for Ukraine or to buy weapons from the US.However, France and Germany oppose such a move over concerns that it would break the legal principle that sovereign assets should remain untouched. The Treasury is understood to share those concerns, with officials warning that seizing the assets could also deter future investment from other countries.Some in government believe they could still win a legal case to seize Russian assets by arguing they should be treated as proceeds of crime and therefore used as reparations for the victim of those crimes – in this case, Ukraine. However, such a legal argument is relatively untested and could involve a lengthy legal process.Starmer told the Commons this week: “We are using the interest on the assets to help fund Ukraine and we are looking, with others, at whether it is possible to go further.”Explore more on these topicsRoman AbramovichUkraineRussianewsShareReuse this content"

And you know, we will be bringing forward big reforms that actually support people into work, that get them on a pathway to success,” Kendall said.Ministers scrap DWP program allowing landlords to tap into tenants’ benefitsRead moreThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is due to publish a green paper on welfare in the coming days, before Reeves’s statement.With the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expected to downgrade its growth forecasts against the backdrop of a deteriorating global economy, the chancellor is preparing to make spending cuts to ensure she can still meet her fiscal targets.Kendall refused to comment on specific policy changes. “I want to be really clear about our objective: it’s reforming the system, changing the system to provide people with the support that they need because that’s the only way,” she said.However, she repeatedly declined to deny reports that the Treasury is seeking up to £5bn in cuts.With the OBR unlikely to pencil in uncertain future savings from supporting people into employment, analysts believe cuts on such a scale will be impossible to achieve without making it harder to claim benefits, or reducing their value.One senior government source hinted at radical change, describing the current system as “completely busted”, adding: “You don’t need the OBR to tell you it’s not working.”Challenged about how ministers made the sums add up, Kendall said: “We don’t start from a spreadsheet, we start from people. We start first, last and always with people, who’ve actually got hopes and dreams.” Asked whether she and Reeves were at loggerheads over the scale of spending cuts necessary, Kendall said “not at all”. “She’s passionate about reform, about changing the system.”SomeLabourstrategists consider taking a tough line on benefits claimants as a way of appealing to rightwing voters who might otherwise defect to Reform.Labour to ‘fix benefit system to get people back into work’Read moreBut Kendall said Labour’s focus was on supporting people in need of help. “The Tories would have you believe that everybody on benefits, the sick and disabled, are skivers and scroungers. It’s just not true,” she said.The pensions secretary was speaking to the Guardian while visiting a jobcentre in Tower Hamlets, east London, where she met benefits claimants and work coaches.One man, Douglas, told her he had battled addiction with the help of a mentor from Change Grow Live, a charity contracted by the DWP to help clients with substance abuse issues, and was now working for them. Another man, Imran, said he had recently started an apprenticeship to become a work coach after 18 months out of work during which he said he became so depressed he was barely able to get out of bed.Kendall said cases such as these showed how the DWP could work better. “If we free up our work coaches’ time from ridiculous tickbox benefit administration to be more about personalised support, more time, more joined up with employers, with health, with skills, there’s a lot we can do within existing resources to make sure we change the way we work,” she said.The DWP is redeploying 1,000 of the coaches, who meet face to face with benefits claimants, so that they can provide more time for those in need of extra support.Kendall also met the TUC general secretary, Paul Nowak, and the PCS president, Martin Cavanagh, to discuss the challenges for the Jobcentre Plus workforce.Nowak warned against a below-inflation pay settlement for the public sector staff expected to implement the government’s new policies. “If you’re serious about rebuilding public services, you’ve got to be serious about supporting the staff in public services,” he said.Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsWork & careersLiz KendallRachel ReevesLabourUnemploymentnewsShareReuse this content"

The force said her injuries were not life-threatening.“At this time, there is no indication to suggest that this incident was a deliberate act,” police said.A 40-year-old man from Lancaster was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and remains in police custody.Poppy’s family said: “Poppy was 100% determined to be a professional footballer. Many who know her, and who know her determination to improve and win, had no doubt she would achieve her goal to one day play for Manchester United.“Poppy idolised Ella Toone, Georgia Stanway, [Kobbie] Mainoo and [Lionel] Messi to name a few. Poppy was a small, petite and beautiful 10-year-old, yet she played up an age group and proudly represented the Kendal United and county U-12 teams.“Poppy earned her place through her determination and her technical mastery on the pitch, her skill was envied by most that she played with and against.”Poppy shared a love of football with her younger brother, seven-year-old Edward, her family said.“Edward worshipped the ground Poppy walked on, he only ever wanted to be like her.

Or do these findings suggest our current dating of Stonehenge might need revision?”Flagstones was discovered in the 1980s during the construction of the Dorchester bypass, and excavations showed it was formed of a 100-metre diameter circular ditch made of intersecting pits, probably an earthwork bank.Today half of the site lies beneath the bypass, with the remainder beneath Max Gate, Thomas Hardy’s former home, now bequeathed to the National Trust.View image in fullscreenA red deer antler found during an excavation of the Flagstones monument.Photograph: Dorset Museum/PAFlagstones is a scheduled monument with finds and excavation archives preserved atDorsetMuseum.At least four burials were found to have been placed in the enclosure pits, a cremated adult and three children who had not been cremated, and there were three partial cremations of adults elsewhere.The similarity of this site to the first phase of Stonehenge, dated to about 2900BC, led to the assumption that Flagstones must be of a similar date.The new findings suggest the early Neolithic activity, including the digging of pits, took place in about 3650BC.After a gap of many centuries, the circular ditched enclosure was created in about 3200BC, with burials placed within it immediately afterwards.A later burial of a young adult male under a large sarsen stone at the centre of the enclosure took place about 1,000 years or so after its initial use.Flagstones also shows connections to other significant sites, including at Llandegai in Gwynedd.Greaney added that the analysis suggests that Flagstones may have served as a prototype for later monuments like Stonehenge.“Flagstones is an unusual monument, a perfectly circular ditched enclosure, with burials and cremations associated with it,” Greaney said.“In some respects it looks like monuments that come earlier, which we call causewayed enclosures, and in others it looks a bit like things that come later that we call henges.“But we didn’t know where it sat between these types of monuments and the revised chronology places it in an earlier period than we expected.”Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyStonehengeDorsetUniversity of ExeterEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He also suggested he could leave the party unless it was centred less around Farage’s “messianic” leadership.The MP’s criticism comes after internal Reform speculation about tensions with Farage, especially after Musk’s intervention.Asked by the Daily Mail if Farage would make a good prime minister, Lowe said: “It’s too early to know whether Nigel will deliver the goods. He can only deliver if he surrounds himself with the right people.“Nigel is a fiercely independent individual and is extremely good at what we have done so far. He has got messianic qualities. Will those messianic qualities distill into sage leadership? I don’t know.”Farage responded to Lowe in an interview on TalkTV saying he was “utterly, completely wrong” about Reform being a protest party. He also pointed out that Lowe was already on the frontbench of the party, adding: “Perhaps he wants to be prime minister, half the House of Commons do.”“We’re not a protest party and he’s on the frontbench. What is he talking about? With only five people, you can’t really have a shadow cabinet, can you? We’ve got a lot of development to do but we’re absolutely not a protest party,” he said.Asked if Lowe had been told to wind his neck in, Farage said there was “no point telling him what to do or what not to do … the fact is, we are making huge strides”. Pressed on whether Lowe would be an MP at the next election, Farage said: “I hope so, he seems to be taking a tone that suggests he won’t accept us.”Tories compare Nigel Farage to Jeremy Corbyn over Ukraine warRead moreDuring the interview, Lowe also suggested he could leave the Reform party if it does not change before the next election by structuring itself with less dependence on Farage.“We have to change from being a protest party led by the Messiah into being a properly structured party with a frontbench, which we don’t have. We have to start behaving as if we are leading and not merely protesting.“Nigel is a messianic figure who is at the core of everything, but he has to learn to delegate, as not everything can go through one person.“So we have to start developing policy which is going to change the way we govern. I’m not going to be by Nigel’s side at the next election unless we have a proper plan to change the way we govern from top to bottom. We can’t raise the hopes of people who are so frustrated with the way we are governed and then flunk it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But, funnily enough, the one-eyed man is usually in charge in the end in the land of the blind.”Musk, the world’s richest man had hinted at a possible £100m donation to Reform but later said Farage “doesn’t have what it takes” after a spat over the party’s decision to distance itself from the far-right leader Tommy Robinson. At the time, Musk said: “I have not met Rupert Lowe but his statements online that I have read make a lot of sense.”Lowe has been more favourable towards Robinson and has a substantial grassroots following among Reform members, as well as very high levels of engagement on social media. He appeared to be the only one out of Farage’s five MPs not to be at the party’s fundraising eventChris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said there was “internecine warfare at the top of Reform”, claiming that “their MPs are more concerned with their own egos, and advancing their personal ambitions, rather than standing up for the British people”.“With one of Farage’s most senior MPs doubting his leadership abilities and admitting that Reform is a protest party with no plan, it is clear that Reform are not serious, and will always put self-interest above our national interest,” said Philp.“The British public deserve solutions, not just empty slogans. Only the Conservatives, under Kemi Badenoch’s leadership, can be trusted to be a real opposition, and real alternative, to this dreadful Labour government.”Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageElon MuskReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

Mackey will oversee “a substantive clearout of the exec team”, with more casualties than survivors, a second source added.Sarah-Jane Marsh, NHS England’s deputy chief operating officer and national director of urgent and emergency care, is likely to remain in her post.Mackey, an accountant by background, is also weighing up whether to axe Julian Kelly, the deputy chief executive and chief financial officer. Kelly, who is widely respected, does what some see as “probably the toughest job in Whitehall” – trying to make the NHS’s near-£200bn annual budget meet its needs while reassuring ministers that it is spending it wisely. His future remains unclear.A source familiar with Mackey’s thinking said: “It will be a pretty total clearout. And there’s an appetite in some quarters to move Julian Kelly on as part of that. But if you’re going to replace the guy who’s in effect the financial controller of a £200bn budget, you need to know what you are doing before you get rid of him.“Jim will want his own person in that job, but at the same time it’s a risky time to get someone new in, given the NHS’s finances are in a poor state.”Kelly is respected at the Treasury, where he used to be its director general of public spending and finance. However, he has risked irritating ministers by warning at recent NHS England board meetings that the £22bn extra Rachel Reeves has given the health service over the next two years will be swallowed up by pay rises and not be enough to pay for the radical transformation of how care is delivered, through “three big shifts” that Streeting and Keir Starmer have promised.Mackey and Pritchard wrote to the chief executives of the NHS’s 220 care provider trusts on Thursday to summon them to a meeting next Thursday to discuss what they warned was a looming £6.6bn hole in its finances in 2025-26. Kelly was not a signatory to the letter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A no-nonsense and very experienced local and national NHS leader, he will be tough in demanding that, regardless of its precarious finances, the service speeds up treatment waiting times and somehow balances its books, despite the growing demand for care.A source close to Streeting made clear Mackey had his backing for his plans to overhaul NHS England.“While a lot has been achieved together between DHSC and NHS England in the first eight months of this government, Wes has appointed Jim Mackey with a mandate to lead serious, transformative change.“In order to do so, Jim is going to have to go further faster, and he has the health secretary’s backing to make sure he has the team he needs to bring in that change”, they said.Announcing his departure, Powis said: “My time in post has been dominated by the pandemic and its ongoing impact. I will for ever be humbled by the extraordinary work of staff throughout the NHS to the greatest health emergency in a century and I am very proud of the support and advice I was personally able to give to staff, ministers and the public.”Join Wes Streeting in conversation with Pippa Crerar discussing England’s health and social care system and how Labour plans to turn it around.

It shows a group of people of colour posing with a flag on a British street, flanked by three police officers.The columnist wrote a post that condemned the Metropolitan police: “How dare they. Invited to pose for a photo with lovely peaceful British Friends of Israel on Saturday police refused. Look at this lot smiling with the Jew haters.”The photo was in fact from Manchester, and the officers pictured from Greater Manchester police. The people pictured were not supporting Hamas, but were holding a green and maroon flag used by supporters of the Pakistani political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), with the word “Pakistan” written on it.Pearson subsequently deleted the tweet.Two officers knocked on the door of Pearson’s Essex home at 9.40am on Remembrance Sunday in November 2024.The journalist called the experience “Kafkaesque”, saying it was a waste of police time for what was claimed to be a non-crime hate incident.Essex police took advice from prosecutors who told them there was no realistic chance of conviction.As criticism mounted the force ordered a review, conducted by the lead for hate crime for the NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council, Mark Hobrough.His report says of the Sunday morning visit to Pearson’s home, which was recorded on a body-worn camera, that it was clear police were trying to arrange a time for a voluntary interview for Pearson to answer questions after the complaint of inciting racial hatred. They had tried four days earlier to contact her.While the timing could be seen as “inconsiderate”, the report notes the officers happened to be in the area.Names in the report are redacted, and it reads: “During the discussion [Pearson] began to challenge the officer’s actions. She implied a complaint would be made to the chief constable by the Telegraph newspaper.”The report concludes: “Our view was that the officer’s behaviour during this interaction was exemplary.” It notes that he “remained calm and polite throughout”.According to the report, there was initially some confusion in the force about the nature of the incident. By the time Pearson was visited it was classed and pursued as a potential crime, but some in Essex police had initially considered it a non-crime hate incident.The report says that even though prosecutors said there was insufficient chance of a prosecution, Essex should have recorded Pearson’s actions on police systems as a non-crime hate incident, rather than expunging it. “There will be many complaints that pass the test for recording and warrant investigation, but do not reach the threshold necessary for prosecution,” it says.It adds the case should have been closed and classed as an “undetected crime allegation of stirring up racial hatred”, lacking enough evidence to prosecute.The report says: “There is a genuine perception from the complainant that the action was motivated at least in part by a hostility to an ethnic or religious group.” It adds it could have been recorded in police systems without naming Pearson.Explore more on these topicsPoliceTelegraph Media GroupXDaily TelegraphRacenewsShareReuse this content"

It orders all state department entities to immediately suspend aid disbursements, with minimal exceptions.“To effectively implement EO 14204, all bureaus, offices and missions shall pause all obligations and/or dispersion of aid or assistance toSouth Africa,” reads the cable, signed by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio.The cable follows the 7 February order, amid a broader reassessment of US foreign aid which paused certain foreign assistance pending review.The order specifically cites “unjust racial discrimination” against white Afrikaners – descendants of Dutch colonizers who implemented the segregationist regime that denied basic rights to the Black majority until 1994.The South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump super-ally who heads the administration’s government efficiency team and has condemned his homeland for “openly racist policies”, is widely seen as influencing the administration’s stance toward a country where white South Africans, just 7% of the population, still disproportionately control most wealth and land.‘White supremacists in suits and ties’: the rightwing Afrikaner group in Trump’s earRead moreAccording to the cable, Rubio has delegated authority to Pete Marocco, a Trump loyalist whopresided over the administration’s eviscerationof foreign aid programs at USAid and the state department, to determine whether specific aid programs should continue. The guidance emphasizes there is “a very high bar for such requests”.Only Pepfar, the US global HIV/Aids program that provides life-saving treatment to millions of South Africans, will proceed without additional review, according to the cable. All other assistance programs require special permission, even those that had received prior exceptions under the January foreign aid pause.This is the latest sign of escalating tensions between the two generally friendly nations, starting when President Trump accused South Africa of using its new land law to discriminate against white citizens – claims the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa,rejected as misinformation.The bill in question controversially permits government acquisition of private land without compensation in certain circumstances, though its supporters say such seizures would be rare and subject to judicial review.Trump has also criticized South Africa’s leading role in its genocide case against Israel at the international court of justice, while also offering refugee status to wealthy white Afrikaners who wanted to relocate to the United States, further incensing the country.The aid freeze also follows South Africa’srecent announcement that it is preparing a new trade proposal for the Trump administration, as officials anticipate the possible end of the African Growth and Opportunity Act – which has allowed billions in duty-free exports to the United States.Earlier on Thursday, South Africaissued a statementacknowledging the US withdrawal from the Just Energy Transition Partnership (Jetp), which has canceled previously funded climate projects following Trump’s revocation of international climate finance initiatives.The state department did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyUS politicsSouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Thank you,” he said, taking laboured breaths as he spoke in his native Spanish, with some words fading away into nothing.It was the first time the world has heard Francis’ voice since the 88-year-old was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital on 14 February.Pilgrims have been gathering in St Peter’s Square every evening to pray for the pope’s recovery. The hundreds of people there on Thursday applauded when they heard his message.TheVaticansaid earlier on Thursday that the Argentine, head of the worldwide Catholic church since 2013, is in a “stable” condition.There had been no repeat of Monday’s respiratory failure, it said, and the pope’s blood work “remained stable”. Francis continued with his breathing exercises and physiotherapy, did not have a fever, and managed to do some work in the morning and afternoon, it said.The Vatican has been providing twice daily updates on the pope’s health, in the morning on how the night went and an evening medical bulletin. But on Thursday it said that “in view of the stability of the clinical picture, the next medical bulletin will be released on Saturday”.Nonetheless, “the doctors are still maintaining a reserved prognosis”, it said, meaning they will not say how they expect his condition to evolve.For the last three nights Francis – who had part of a lung removed as a young man – has worn an oxygen mask to help him sleep. On Thursday morning, as on the previous day, he switched to a less onerous nasal cannula – a plastic tube tucking into his nostrils – which provides high-flow oxygen, a Vatican source said.Francis missed the formal Ash Wednesday celebrations in Rome marking the start of Lent, but took part in a blessing in his private suite on the 10th floor of the Gemelli.The leader of the world’s almost 1.4 billion Catholics has not been seen in public since his hospitalisation – the longest of his papacy. Neither has the Vatican issued any photos, although Francis has published several texts.During previous hospitalisations, the pope appeared on the Gemelli balcony for his weekly Angelus prayer at noon on Sundays. But he has missed the last three, and no announcement has yet been made about whether he will make an appearance this weekend.The Vatican confirmed on Thursday that senior cardinal Michael Czerny would stand in for the pope and lead the mass marking the first Sunday of Lent.The mass was also part of celebrations for the Jubilee 2025, a Holy Year led by the pope, dedicated this weekend to volunteers.The Holy See said on Thursday that the event “takes on an even deeper meaning, as the thoughts and prayers of all the brothers and sisters turn to the Holy Father and the experience he is going through”.Pilgrims will pray in front of the hospital on Saturday, it said, as well-wishers have done since Francis was admitted.The pope was initially diagnosed with bronchitis but it developed into pneumonia in both lungs, sparking alarm across the globe.On 22 February, he suffered a “prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis” and on 28 February had “an isolated crisis of bronchospasm” – a tightening of the muscles that line the airways in the lungs.On Monday, Francis “experienced two episodes of acute respiratory failure, caused by a significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and consequent bronchospasm”, according to the Vatican.Francis’s health has regularly led to speculation, particularly among his critics, as to whether he could resign like his predecessor, Benedict XVI.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisVaticanCatholicismChristianityItalyEuropeReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

I can hear helicopters, artillery and even mortars,” he said.Syria’s new government has been engaged in sporadic fighting with former Assad militias since rebels led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) forced the dictator from power on 8 December.A total of fifteen people were killed fighting in Deraa, south Syria, on Tuesday and Wednesday, after government forces attempted to enter a town controlled by a pro-Assad militia, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Grenades were also thrown at security officers in Latakia province on Wednesday.The new government, led bypresident Ahmed al-Sharaa, the former HTS leader, has conducted what it calls “combing” operations to catch Assad-affiliated officers. Low-level officers and soldiers were offered clemency after they turned in their weapons to the state, but anyone implicated in war crimes is subject to arrest.The Assad regime relied on a network of militias loyal to local strongmen to enforce its grip over the country during Syria’s 14-year civil war. The decentralised nature of those militias has made it difficult for Syria’s new rulers to completely dismantle the former regime’s military forces. Instead, many groups have merely been driven underground.Security forces were attacked on Thursday by groups affiliated with Suhail al-Hassan, an infamous Syrian army officer who commanded the elite “Tiger Forces” division, according to the country’s state news service.Security officers also arrested Maj Gen Ibrahim Huwaija, the former head of the air force intelligence branch who was accused of carrying outthe 1977 assassination of the Lebanese politician Kamal Jumblatt.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Athena has the same tall, thin design that some experts fear makes it prone to falling over.On Thursday, Steve Altemus, chief executive of Texas-based Intuitive Machines, suggested that a similar fate might have befallen Athena, but that engineers needed more data to be certain of whether it had come to rest on its side.“We don’t believe we’re in the correct attitude on the surface of the Moon, yet again,” he told reporters.“We are charging on the surface. We have command of uplink and downlink from the vehicle to our ground network … so we are communicating. We have powered down and done some power conservation steps as prudent measures to see how long and what objectives we can accomplish in the mission.“When we get that full assessment, we will work closely withNasato identify science objectives that are the highest priority, and we’ll figure out what the mission profile will look like. It will be off nominal, because we’re not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications.”The nearly 5-metre-tall probe set down shortly after 12.30pm ET (5.30pm UK time) on Thursday after a tense descent to Mons Mouton, a high and relatively flat mountain about 100 miles from the moon’s south pole.But while Athena sent back data and began to charge its batteries on the surface, it soon became apparent that its orientation on the rugged terrain was not as expected.As engineers in Houston peered at the lander’s data for clues, Tim Crain, the mission director, urged his team to “keep working the problem”, an acknowledgment that all was not well. “We’re shedding power as fast as we can to keep the vehicle in good health. We are generating power. We are communicating through our telemetry radio, and we are working to evaluate exactly what our orientation is on the surface,” he said.Athena is one of 10 missions contracted by Nasa’s $2.6bn commercial lunar payload services (CLPS) programme to encourage private industry to fly experiments and other equipment to the moon in advance of humans returning before the end of the decade. Under Nasa’s Artemis programme, the US intends to put the first woman and the first person of colour on the moon in mid-2027.On Sunday, another robotic lander funded by CLPS touched down on the moon in the most successful private landing yet. Built and operated by Firefly Aerospace, also in Texas,the Blue Ghost lander settled in Mare Crisium, a 300-mile-wide impact basin filled with frozen lava.The Athena probe is thought to have landed closer to the south pole than any previous lunar mission. The south pole is attractive for human exploration as its permanently shaded craters harbour frozen water that would be crucial for visiting astronauts.One of Athena’s key objectives is to deploy Nasa’s Trident drill to dig beneath the moon’s surface. Any soil it excavates will be analysed by a mass spectrometer to detect essential constituents such as water.The lander carries three robotic rovers, with gear to test a cellular network on the moon, depending on whether the lander is operational.If Athena works properly, it may join Blue Ghost in witnessing a lunar eclipse as the Earth moves between the moon and the sun on 14 March. Days later, the sun will set on the moon and both probes will shut down.Mapp, developed by the Colorado-based company Lunar Outpost, is the first commercial rover to land on the moon. Among the mission’s objectives is the “sale” to Nasa for a symbolic $1 of a small sample of rocky lunar regolith recovered by the rover.The transaction, which will mark the first time a section of a planetary body has changed hands for money, is intended to set an important legal precedent for future space commerce, according to Justin Cyrus, chief executive of Lunar Outpost.“Lunar Voyage 1 is not just about exploration, it’s about proving that private industry can operate, sustain and create economic value on the moon,” he said ahead of the mission’s 26 February launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida.Nasa is preparing to launch two missions from VandenbergSpaceForce Base in California. The SPHEREx and Punch spacecraft are due to blast off on the same SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 3.09am UK time on Saturday.The Punch mission will deploy four suitcase-sized satellites to map the sun’s outer atmosphere, or corona, to understand the solar wind, the stream of plasma that flows from our parent star.Meanwhile, SPHEREx will observe hundreds of millions of galaxies and other objects to create an infrared map of the cosmos.Overall, Nasa’s moon missions face an uncertain future with speculation that its own Space Launch System rocket programme could be canceled in favor of heavy-lift Starship rockets developed by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company, and the reportedlaying off of 10% of the space agency’s workforcethrough Trump administration cuts ordered by Musk’s “department of government efficiency”.Explore more on these topicsSpaceNasaAstronomyThe moonnewsShareReuse this content"

Los Angeles police said Wedding’s operation also moved “five metric tonnes of fentanyl per month” to US and Canadian cities.Wedding and fellow Canadian Andrew Clark are also accused of hiring hitmen to murder those the pair believed were obstacles to their operation, including a man murdered sitting in his car in the driveway of his home, who police said had drug debts.But in one case, officials say two victims were the inadvertent targets of retaliation for a stolen drug shipment.In 2023, gunmen attacked a rental home in Caledon, Ontario, killing Jagtar Singh Sidhu, 57, and Harbhajan Kaur Sidhu, 55, who had arrived to Canada four months earlier. Their daughter Jaspreet Kaur Sidhu,was shot 13 timesand left critically injured.Of the 16 defendants sought by police, Wedding and another are the only ones still on the loose.Clark was arrested on 8 October 2024 by Mexican law enforcement and was transferred on 27 February to the United States.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMexicoDrugsDrugs tradeSnowboardingOlympic GamesAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Columbia University in New York City kickstarted the protests afterHamas’s 7 October 2023 attacksthat killed almost 1,200 people in Israel. Since then, Israeli forces havekilled at least 48,000 Palestiniansand forcibly displaced nearly 2 million survivors with severe food shortages, a lack of fuel and medical supplies amid Israeli aid restrictions.The conflict prompted hundreds of campus demonstrations nationwide, including at the University ofCaliforniaat Los Angeles and other UC system campuses. The protest were some of the largest demonstrations to take place on US campuses since the anti-Vietnam war protests of the 1960s.Students voiced a variety of demands, including calls for universities to publicly support a ceasefire in Gaza, divest from Israeli companies and companies that supply Israel’s military, and cut ties with Israeli universities.The protests in the USinspired similar demonstrationsacross the UK and Europe.Protests at UCLA attracted national attention afterviolence between pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian demonstratorserupted on the campus in late April. Shortly after, hundreds of police in riot gear gathered in the encampment and ordered pro-Palestinian protesters to disperse or face arrest.In a statement announcing the investigation on Wednesday, Leo Terrell, a member of the Federal Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism and senior counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said: “The impact upon UC’s students has been the subject of considerable media attention and multiple federal investigations. But these campuses are also workplaces, and the Jewish faculty and staff employed there deserve a working environment free of antisemitic hostility and hate.”The Department of Justice’s investigation comes months after the US Department of Educationinvestigated nine complaints against UC schoolsin Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Diego, Davis and Santa Cruz, and reached an agreement with the UC system. The complaints alleged the schools failed to respond effectively to antisemitic and anti-Arab harassment.The UC system agreed to step up reporting of complaints to the department’s Office for Civil Rights and review all complaints and reports of harassment from the past two academic years to determine whether further action is needed. The agreement also calls for more training of university employees and campus police officers about their obligations under federal law.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Activists have long campaigned for the island to be bought from its private owners and designated as a heritage site.On Thursday, the SVG prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, announced in parliament that the island had been acquired for the nation because of its historical significance.“The Government of St Vincent and Grenadines, given the historic importance of Baliceaux, has taken the decision to acquire Baliceaux,” he told lawmakers.He did not reveal the terms of the deal, but said the owners would be given “fair compensation within a reasonable time”.Ubafu Topsey, an activist from Belize who has been at the forefront of the fight for Baliceaux said: “We are ecstatic that the government of SVG is doing the right thing for us. [Gonsalves] put his money where his mouth is. He made his promise a reality.”Topsey, who is preparing for an annual Garifuna pilgrimage to Baliceaux on 14 March – celebrated in SVG as National Heroes Day in honour of the Garifuna chief Joseph Chatoyer – said this year’s visit would be an occasion for special celebration.“It is our homeland… and every Garifuna around the world understands that these are holy, sacred grounds. We are just so thankful and joyful,” she said.Topsey is hoping the island will become a World Heritage Site in honor of the Garifuna people, who she said were “transnational” and borderless”.Once a site of horror, a tiny Caribbean island could become a Garifuna shrineRead moreShe also expressed hope that vegetation could be encouraged on the parched island.“That barrenness is too much of a reminder of our grief and our suffering, and moving forward, we have to go beyond the pain and the agony and the suffering. Although we will never forget it, it is a tremendous opportunity for healing and setting an example for unlimited possibilities for future generations,” she said.Princess Eulogia Gordon, 35, a California publicist and Garifuna campaigner, described the news as an opportunity for unity.“Baliceaux doesn’t just belong to us. This is bigger than us. This is truly about unity and family and togetherness,” she said.Explore more on these topicsSt Vincent and the GrenadinesAmericasIndigenous peoplesnewsShareReuse this content"

The remains of eight dead Israeli hostages have also been returned.However, the first phase of the ceasefire ended on Saturday andtalks on the second phase have stalled.The US president’s post came hours after the White House confirmed the US had entered direct negotiations with Hamas, potentially bypassing Israel to secure the release of US hostages still held by the group.Official Israeli reaction to that development was limited to a single-sentence statement late on Wednesday stating that “Israel has expressed to the US its position regarding direct talks with Hamas”.1:02White House confirms US in negotiations with Hamas – videoThe unprecedented direct talks between Hamas and the US appear initially aimed at freeing Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American dual citizen who is thought to be still alive, and securing the return of the remains of four other Israeli-Americans abducted in Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war.Hamas seized about 250 hostages during that attack and killed approximately 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Fifty-nine hostages are still held by Hamas, though Israeli intelligence services believe more than half are dead.Yoram Schweitzer, a Tel Aviv-based analyst and former Israeli intelligence officer, said the contact may create momentum towards resuming the ceasefire agreement.“It has potential benefits. Even in the worst-case scenario – that the Americans just get their people out and then step away – then we are still talking about US-Israeli dual citizens so that’s still more Israelis who are being freed. Even that will help push things forward.”The direct talks are a radical shift for the US. Hamas was proscribed by the US as a terrorist organisation in 1997 and its diplomatic isolation has long been a central principle of Washington’s regional policies and those of allied powers. US sanctions have targeted individuals accused of raising funds for Hamas andthe US last year banned membersof the group, allied armed factions and the Palestine Liberation Organization from visiting.Schweitzer said the Israeli security establishment would be unfazed by US contact with the perpetrators of the October 2023 attacks.“The Americans were dealing with the Taliban and the Iranians despite the facade of not talking to terrorists. We know that sometimes it is a necessary evil. There is a cost of course to a dialogue with Hamas but obviously we understand. The security establishment here understands that very well,” he said.Trump’s ultimatum followed a White House meeting between the US president and a group of hostages recently released by Hamas.Israel wants to prolong the ceasefire, securing the release of hostages but without reaching a final agreement with Hamas on ending the war. Hamas wants to move immediately to the agreed second stage of the ceasefire where the sides would negotiate a definitive end to the fighting.‘Trump Gaza’ AI video intended as political satire, says creatorRead moreTrump reiterated his support for Israel and referred to a recent decision to provide billions more in support for Israeli arms sales. “I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say,” Trump wrote.“This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leaveGaza, while you still have a chance.” He added: “Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!”Trump also made clear there could be repercussions for Gaza as a whole, where more than 48,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed and vast swathes of the territory laid waste during the 16-month Israeli offensive.Since the end of the first phase of the ceasefire, Israel has imposed a total blockade on all goods entering Gaza, demanding Hamas release the remaining hostages without beginning negotiations to end the war.Aid agencies say the humanitarian crisis in the territory remains acute, with needs barely met by the increased flow of aid in late January and last month.Trump wrote: “To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!”Hamas has confirmed the talks with the US, saying there had been two direct meetings between US officials and Hamas in Doha, the Qatari capital, in recent days. White House officials have said Israel was consulted on the “ongoing … discussions” with Hamas.Israel’s consul general in New York, Ofir Akunis, sought to downplay the contacts in an interview with Fox News. “There is a new attitude from the White House … against Hamas. They can talk with Hamas, that’s OK,” he told the network.Many analysts have warned that Netanyahu had little intention of maintaining the agreement because a definitive end to the conflict could threaten his hold on political power within Israel.With Trump in the White House, Netanyahu and his close advisers may also believe they can secure better terms or even the release of more hostages without major concessions.Gideon Saar, Israel’s foreign minister, has denied Israel breached the ceasefire deal by not advancing to stage two talks. He said there was “no automaticity” between the stages and accused Hamas of violating the agreement to allow aid into Gaza by seizing most of the supplies for its own benefit.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaHamasDonald TrumpIsraelUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The prize will allow Ootlin to “begin to reach a far wider audience”, which is “vital so this book can begin to influence policymakers”, she said. “It is my greatest hope that Ootlin is used to help stop other children in the care system falling through all safety nets as I did repeatedly.”By the age of seven, Fagan had lived in 14 different homes and had her name changed multiple times. “There are a lot of kids out there being told they are less than everyone else. They are made unsafe by that story alone,” writes Fagan in the book,extracted for the Guardian.“The government have a modern care system built on systems that are no longer fit for purpose,” she said after her win. “It is time to change the story! We must see all children in the UK offered so much more. Safety, warmth, care, a home, food, an education and people who believe in them should be the very least of it.”‘This book kept me alive’: Jenni Fagan on writing a memoir of her childhood in careRead moreOotlin was alsorecently longlistedfor the Women’s prize for nonfiction. Along with the memoir, Fagan has written four novels – The Panopticon, The Sunlight Pilgrims, Hex and Luckenbooth, the latter shortlisted for the Gordon Burn prize in 2021 – as well as several poetry collections.“Ootlin is a story about a girl who found her only true home in books, who via those stories began to imagine a place where she might truly belong,” said Fagan.Ootlin “has haunted me since I read it, and it proudly moved me as both a work of art and a visceral contribution to an urgent and necessary debate about our care system and whether it is fit for purpose”, said Claire Malcolm, the CEO of New Writing North and co-founder of the prize.TheGordon Burnprize celebrates writing that has an unconventional perspective, style or subject matter. Founded in 2012 by New Writing North, Faber & Faber and the Gordon Burn Trust, it is named after the English writer known for experimental works who died in 2009.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

From Michael Jackson to David Bowie, why are some stars uncancellable?Read moreSix years on, as MJ the Musical premieres in Australia, audience members might also ponder the ethics of buying a ticket to a show that is not only sanctioned by Jackson’s estate, but a source of revenue for it. Two production companies that were owned by the singer at the time of his death and are now owned by his estate are contesting allegations of child sexual abuse by the late artist as part of a civil suit, set to go to trial next year – and the attorney working for the alleged victims has described the musical as “propaganda” that “adds injury to his survivors”.View image in fullscreenMJ the Musical at the Prince Edward Theatre, London in 2024. The show is set in 1992 during rehearsals for Jackson’s Dangerous tour.Photograph: Johan PerssonMJ, which opens in Sydney this weekend, seems to believe youcanseparate the music from the man – or at least, from his baggage.When theGuardian reviewed MJ on Broadway, we described the musical, which is made in cooperation with the late singer’s estate and co-produced by its co-executors, as “a rollicking parade of hits, vocal high points, and a sanitised spin through Jackson’s life that sketches demons without filling them in”, and an exercise in “compartmentalization”.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningSet in 1992 during rehearsals for Jackson’s Dangerous tour, MJ sidesteps the lurid tabloid controversies – including allegations that he abused his pet chimpanzee Bubbles, speculation about his changing appearance and plastic surgery, and his death from a cocktail of prescription drugs in 2009. It also ignores multiple allegations of child molestation made against the star over three decades, including the claims at the centre of a forthcoming civil trial.‘Secrets will eat you up’ – inside the shocking Michael Jackson documentaryRead moreThe omissions can be justified by the plot’s narrow timeframe: MJ is set before the first claims of child molestation were aired in 1993, and doesn’t reference the settlement Jackson made in 1994 with the boy and family at the centre of those allegations. Nor does it mention Jackson’s arrest in 2003 on charges of child molestation.Jackson was acquitted in a 2005 trial and Jackson’s estate has vehemently denied all allegations of sexual abuse made against the star since his death. However some have found the show’s failure to even acknowledge this significant part of the star’s story discomforting, particularly in the wake ofLeaving Neverland, in which Wade Robson and James Safechuck aired fresh allegations that Jackson sexually abused them when they were children. (A sequel to Leaving Neverland will be releasedlater this month.)View image in fullscreenWade Robson (L) and James Safechuck (R), pictured in 2019. The two men have accused Jackson of sexually abusing them when they were children, which Jackson’s estate has denied.Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian“Can we really sit in a theatre and pretend his music can live on without scrutiny?” askedGuardian reviewer Anya Ryanwhen MJ went to the West End. “Some might be able to separate Jackson’s art from the artist. But as [performer Myles Frost] took his final bow and the audience leaped to their feet, I felt queasy – bad, even.”The Michael Jackson estate did not reply to the Guardian’s request for comment, nor did Michael Cassel Group, who are bringing the show to Australia. Butin an 2019 interview with the New York Times, conducted while the show was still a work in progress, the musical’s book writer, Lynn Nottage, and director and choreographer, Christopher Wheeldon, discussed the complications of making MJ the Musical after the documentary had aired.“You can’t watch the documentary without being profoundly disturbed by it, but again, we’re not judge and jury,” Wheeldon said. “[Our role is to] paint a balanced picture. Yes, lean into the complexities, lean into the darkness, but also recognise the great amount of music and film and choreography that Michael left behind.”“We’re not journalists,” Nottage added. “Have I had restless, sleepless nights? Absolutely, and I probably will continue until the day we open.”View image in fullscreenRoman Banks (centre), in the lead role of Michael Jackson for MJ the Musical at Sydney’s Lyric Theatre.Photograph: Bianca De Marchi/AAPThe show did open, and following its premiere on Broadway in 2022, Wheeldon told the Washington Post that after grappling with the ethical considerations, the pair “felt we needed to look at this as making a piece of entertainment first and foremost”. The estate did not dictate the show’s content, he said. “We ended up telling the story we wanted to tell. We were not told what we had to do.”Robson and Safechuck’s allegations are the subject of a joint suit against MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures – owned by his estate – that is due to go to trial in November 2026. Robson alleged that Jackson abused him from age seven to 14. Safechuck alleged that Jackson abused him over the course of four years, starting in 1988 when he was 10. Both men allege that company employees did not adequately protect them from Jackson, helping to coordinate visits and ensuring Jackson could be alone with them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But their attorney John C Carpenter, who says he has seen the show, accused it of being “propaganda” engineered to make money. “It’s entertainment, not the truth,” he told Guardian Australia. “They skirt the entire issue [the allegations of child molestation] and try to makeMichael Jacksonlook like a saint.”People attending the musical have the option to separate the man from the accusations ... victim-survivors don’t have that optionAlison GealeLawyers for Jackson’s companies and his estate maintain Jackson was innocent and have previously alleged he was targeted for his name and money.“We remain fully confident that Michael is innocent of these allegations, which are contrary to all credible evidence and independent corroboration,” a lawyer for Jackson’s estate said in a statement, after a 2023 decision from the appeal’s court which allowed the men’s claims to progress.The estate receives “grand rights” (AKA dramatic performance rights) revenue from MJ the Musical; it likely gets a producer’s cut too, as estate co-executors are two of the show’s three major producers. As of May 2023, they hadrecouped their initial investmentin the show.The Jackson estate “is free to try to make money off of the intellectual property made by Michael Jackson during his lifetime”, Carpenter said. “But doing it at the expense of misrepresenting and discounting the truth that he abused and hurt other people adds injury to his survivors … You can imagine how difficult it might be for other people to celebrate your abuser. That’s hurtful.”View image in fullscreenMichael Jackson’s estate receives dramatic performance rights revenue from MJ the MusicalPhotograph: Johan PerssonAlison Geale, CEO of Bravehearts, an Australian organisation representing adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse, worries about the message that MJ sends. “It’s a Tony award-winning musical that’s had record-breaking ticket sales. And for victim-survivors, not just of Michael Jackson, but those others looking on, it’s as if it [the alleged sexual abuse] didn’t happen,” she says.“When victim-survivors come forward, there are many roadblocks to disclosure, and one of them is, ‘Am I going to be believed?’ And if you can imagine that on a scale where it involves Michael Jackson. Whether Michael Jackson is guilty or innocent in the public’s eye, that is a worldwide question everyone has an answer for – so they [Robson and Safechuck] are in the middle of also not being believed by so many.”MJ the Musical review – sterilised moonwalk through the King of Pop’s lifeRead moreIn Leaving Neverland, Robson describes his first encounter with Jackson, seeing Thriller on VHS when he was five years old: “Everything changed for me. The music, I couldn’t help but move to it, it kind of set me on fire … I slowly but surely started plastering my walls with images of Michael … [I was] going to sleep, waking up in Michael Jackson land.”Geale, from Bravehearts, urges Australians weighing up whether to buy a ticket to consider the victim-survivor perspective. “[The music] is part of the man and part of the machine that, from a victim-survivor’s perspective, allegedly enabled grooming and offending,” she says. “People attending the musical have the option to separate the man from the accusations. And victim-survivors don’t have that option. The man and the music and the crime are all linked for them.”MJ offers a whirlwind tour of “Michael Jackson land”: the music, the moves, the almost mythic artist.

Up in Helmsdale [in the Scottish Highlands], in my studio, I have an art deco radiogram speaker which has a sort of sunburst thing with that phrase written on it. For £60 on eBay – pristine! It was the BBC World Service motto. When we were casting about for a title for the new record, it seemed like a great expression. Grace said, if you’re going to call it that you have to write a song with that title. So I did.I very much enjoyed the new songKnowledgeand the video, shot inHelmsdale. Do you like to travel much these days or are you pretty much happy at home?nogs09I like Helmsdale, and Grace loves it. When I was seven, eight years old, I spent every holiday in Helmsdale, walking with Stuart, my grandfather. And, one year, Mum and Dad said, I think we’ll go to Spain. I said, you can go wherever you like – I’m going to Helmsdale. We’ve been abroad loads of timessince I had the stroke[in 2005] – to Japan once, to Australia. But I love getting home to the studio. That fragrance of the air. The fresh air. It’s beautiful.The Possibilities Are Endless[the documentary about Collins’s recovery from his stroke] is such a motivational and inspiring watch. How easy was it for youto put it out there for all to see?Aubrey26At the beginning, it was difficult to form my language. But you shouldn’t hide any of it away. There’s no point. I express myself and sometimes I get it wrong – the words, the meaning of things … So what? I am a private person, but with no shame.Is your favourite song stillBoredom[by Buzzcocks, namechecked onOrange Juice’s Rip It Up]?James1968In the punk days, I liked the Sex Pistols, but particularly Subway Sect and Buzzcocks. I was obsessed with Pete Shelley. And then, years and years later, after my stroke, we were sitting in Inverness, and this guy came up to me and went: “I don’t know if you remember me. I’m John Maher. I was the drummer in Buzzcocks.” I said: “I remember you, you were the handsome Buzzcock.” He came over from Harris [in the Outer Hebrides, where Maher now lives] and took all the photographs for theBadbea album. He’s a great photographer. Still handsome.Did you plan to break up Orange Juice on the evening of theminers’benefit showat Brixton Academy inJanuary 1985?ChrisBartleyOrange Juice had come to an end. Polydor were dropping me and Zeke [Manyika, drummer] was busy with his solo career. It came to its own conclusion, really. So I said, I might as well say this will be Orange Juice’s last gig. It was Grace’s idea to play Rock and Roll (I Gave You the Best Years of My Life) by Kevin Johnson. “And Zeke followed me through London, through a hundred hotel rooms / Through a hundred record companies who didn’t like my tunes.” There were people crying in the audience.View image in fullscreen‘Orange Juice came to its own conclusion, really’ … Collins, second left, with the band in London in 1981.Photograph: David Corio/RedfernsWould an Orange Juice reunion ever be on the cards?RattonRedNo!I remember that you were quite caustic about other bands in interviews back in the 80s and 90s.Have you mellowed? Most of the bands you slagged off deserved it!1234 RamonesBack then, every indie band was nasty about everybody. Nowadays, everybody’s nice about everybody. Some of the people I’ve been horrible about are very, very lovely to me now. Then you meet people and they’re really nice and you just feel like, what a wanker I am. I remember Pete Wylie from Wah! Heat [aka The Mighty Wah!]. I said [to him]: “Aren’t you sort of like Abba?” And now we are good buddies.I’m currently rereadingGrace’s memoirFalling and Laughing. It’s even more inspiring second time around. Have you written songs about her?SalfordRed64Yes, I have. There’s one called You’re Better Than You Know on Hope and Despair. That’s a lovely song. A song of encouragement. And then Graciously. That’s about it.View image in fullscreen‘I’m not a punk any more. I’m too old for that’ … Collins on stage in Edinburgh in 2020.Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/RedfernsWhen you first wrote and recordedA Girl Like You, did you have any inkling that it would be such a huge worldwide hit, or did its success take you by surprise?VerulamiumParkRangerVic Godardfrom Subway Sect, who sang backing vocals, said: “Yes, that’s the one, that’s the No 1 single.” But, no, we didn’t. It was obvious it was the single – but it didn’t get playlisted. Much later,Mickie Most, the genius producer, said that occasionally there’s a record you can bury under the Empire State Building that will still find a way out. High praise from Mickie. There was absolutely nothing you could do to that record to stop it. It was an unstoppable force. Even I couldn’t mess that record up.I love the fact thatPaul Cook from the Sex Pistolsis the drummer on theGorgeous GeorgeLP. But a mate told me there were loads of other first-generation punks on that record. Can that be true? And do you still consider yourself a punk?frenteboqueronWell, Vic was on the record. And we have worked a lot with Dave Ruffy elsewhere, who was a Rut: “Babylon’s burning!” But I’m not a punk any more. I’m too old for that. I love punk records. I also love northern soul, soul, indie music. In my opinion, there are good records and bad records. And good records, I’ll always love.Will you be making music withVic Godardagain?GrahamCarrisgodPossibly. He’s always running around like a maniac. So we’ll pin him down and see if we can get him to come up and do some recording in Helmsdale. He’s the best company.View image in fullscreen‘I am a private person, but with no shame’ … Collins at Orange Juice’s last gig, at Brixton Academy, in 1985.Photograph: Steve Rapport/Getty ImagesSeventies Night, a song that you recorded withthe lateMark E Smith, became a staple in my DJ sets. Mark was quite a character. Did you two get along in the studio?CoopertapesNot exactly! RIP, of course. The first time I worked with him he said: “I’m not worthy, Edwyn.” Then he came back to our studio and terrified Seb, my sidekick. Poor Seb. Grace told him off and he said sorry – he could be very sweet. He also said: “Right, I’m putting the nails in.” During that session, he sacked his entire group. But he ultimately had a nice person in him, a polite person.Never mind the back pain: how rock’s drummers cope with furious sets in their 70sRead moreI can’t tell you how much I admire your strength, determination and fortitude to recover from a stroke. My question is: what inspires you to keep going?EducatedRitaIn hospital, even my pupils didn’t react. It looked like curtains for me. But my doctor decided to operate. And I’m grateful. Even when I was unconscious, I felt I was fighting for my life. My dreams didn’t die. There was wonderful satisfaction to come. Now, sometimes it’s difficult for me to get about.

In our series,My feelgood movie, Guardian writers reflect on their go-to flick, and explain why their pick is endlessly rewatchable.This list will be updated weekly with further picks.Want more options?Here is our earlier list of the10 best escapist moviesand52 comforting, rewatchable titles.Kabhi Khushi Kabhie GhamStarring:Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Amitabh BachchanDirected by:Karan JoharWhy our writer loves it: “Scenes from this movie are seared in mind and I often quote its lines in my daily life – such is its hold on me. I am a complete sucker for the drama, the music, the pageantry, the familiar (though outdated) movie tropes, the costumes, the sets – after all, I grew up watching Bollywood movies (SRK is the love of my life, he just doesn’t know it). It is a heaping dose of nostalgia that instantly uplifts my mood and restores my spirit, no matter how in the doldrums the world around might seem.”(Tasneem Merchant)Read the full reviewKabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham is available on Netflix and Amazon Prime in the US and UKThe PaperStarring:Michael Keaton, Glenn Close and Robert DuvallDirected by:Ron HowardWhy our writer loves it:“Perhaps it’s all just borrowed nostalgia for the half-remembered 90s, to remix James Murphy’slyric. But I see it as a feelgood film that makes you feel good because it never shouts about it; there’s no need to force joy, it’s just there in all that messy exuberance. The maddening life happening relentlessly, the people at work in the loud city, the thrill of chasing down a story – this is what is actually joyful.”(Larry Ryan)Read the full reviewThe Paper is available to rent digitally in the US and UKThe Wedding SingerStarring:Adam Sandler and Drew BarrymoreDirected by:Frank CoraciWhy our writer loves it:“One thing I love most about The Wedding Singer is the soundtrack that includes You Spin Me Round (Like a Record), Blue Monday and Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic. Barrymore sings a bit of 99 Luftballons into her oversize headphones. Sandler gets to perform his own compositions: Somebody Kill Me (“I was listening to the Cure a lot when I wrote this”) and Grow Old With You – the latter he performs on a plane to stop Barrymore from marrying the evil Glenn. The ending features a brilliant cameo from 1998 Billy Idol playing 1980s Billy Idol, who wakes from his booze-addled slumber to shove Glenn in the airplane toilets. (“Excuse me, sir. I have to serve the beverages.”)”(Rich Pelley)The Wedding Singer is available to rent digitally in the US and on Amazon Prime in the UKRead the full reviewMamma Mia!Starring:Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried and Pierce BrosnanDirected by:Phyllida LloydWhy our writer loves it:“Mamma Mia! isn’t a movie – it’s a holiday. It’s a film so divorced from subtext and intricacy that its only ask for viewers is to bask in the Greek sunshine as the sounds of Abba wash over them … It was never meant to be taken seriously; it’s a film without pretense. Much of what he complains about is precisely what makes Mamma Mia! the perfect cinematic comfort blanket.”(Jeffrey Ingold)Mamma Mia! is available on Max in the US and on Now in the UKRead the full reviewPink FlamingosStarring:Divine, David Lochary and Mary Vivian PearceDirected by:John WatersWhy our writer loves it:“The will to create a movie for the specific purpose of appalling anyone unaware of its true meaning turned Pink Flamingos into the ultimate litmus test. You either got its sick jokes or you didn’t. But those who did got something far more lasting than a laugh. We got a one-way ticket to an underground populated by parallel dissidents, an entire community of the unruly and free. That’s a lot to gain, which is why, even decades after I first saw Pink Flamingos, I return to it whenever I need to be reminded there’s a universe of possibilities out there not reflected in the world we know now.”(Jim Farber)Read the full reviewDefending Your LifeStarring:Meryl Streep and Albert BrooksDirected by:Albert BrooksWhy our writer loves it:“Life-affirming” is perhaps an overused adjective, but few movies have successfully illuminated the human condition as well as this one. Fear is commonplace in our daily lives, but Albert Brooks’s film might hold the key to ridding the worries of anxiety-ridden people such as myself. As the new year often brings about feelings of regret and unease, Defending Your Life is the warmest hug you can receive.”(Oliver Macnaughton)Defending Your Life is available to rent digitally in the US and the UKRead the full reviewNotting HillStarring:Julia Roberts and Hugh GrantDirected by:Roger MichellWhy our writer loves it:“What is so wonderful about the film is how effortless it all seems. The story isn’t complex; there are no gunfights or CGI raccoons; the greatest jeopardy in the film involves Grant having to catch Roberts before she goes back to America – a problem that reads as plausibly insurmountable in 1999 but today would be remedied with a few WhatsApps. But, despite the illusion of effortlessness, getting everything right in this way is deceptively tricky. Has a single romcom ever managed to marry all of the necessary elements – cast, script, timing, an intangible magic – so perfectly? (No. The answer is no.)”(Ralph Jones)Notting Hill is available on Netflix in the US and Channel 4 in the UKRead the full reviewMarried to the MobStarring:Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew ModineDirected by:Jonathan DemmeWhy our writer loves it:The movie is a long list of quirky pleasures, including a “starter kit of premium 80s college rock (New Order, Pixies, the Feelies), well-placed family dog reaction shots, and an FBI agent who dresses himself like Wallace in the Wallace & Gromit shorts. Few of the laughs in the film feel like punchlines or payoffs to some heavily orchestrated joke. Demme’s approach is more low-key and breezy, cruising confidently on the assumption that his DayGlo gangland will be fun enough without him having to push too hard. He catches a rhythm and does the mambo Italiano. It feels like your feet never touch the floor.”(Scott Tobias)Married to the Mob is available on Hoopla, Kanopy and Pluto in the US and Amazon Prime in the UKRead the full reviewRush HourStarring:Jackie Chan and Chris TuckerDirected by:Brett RatnerWhy our writer loves it:“Rush Hour taps into something that stirred my heart then and now: an ease settles into the two actors, Chan and Tucker’s joviality feeling so genuine that the east-meets-west tropes evolve into characters who have something real at stake, and who are also having fun.”(Tammy Tarng)Rush Hour is available on Netflix in the US and Amazon Prime in the UKRead the full reviewFather of the BrideStarring:Steve Martin, Diane Keaton and Martin ShortDirected by:Charles ShyerWhy our writer loves it: “Why do I come back to this film again and again? As a girl and younger woman I was emphatically against marriage (though I’ve since softened) and watched it more as a comedy horror than anything aspirational. The only aspect of the Bankses’ life I’d want is the kitchen. And yet watching Franck and the family put on their ridiculous show makes me want to be part of it. I love ritual, and ceremony, and Steve Martin, and Martin Short, and Diane Keaton.”(Laura Snapes)Where to watch:Father of the Bride is available on Hulu and Disney+ in the US and on Disney+ in the UK and AustraliaRead the full reviewDiggstown AKA Midnight StingStarring:James Woods and Louis Gossett JrDirected by:Michael RitchieWhy our writer loves it:“Diggstown is the perfect feelgood movie – a breezy but exciting genre mashup with enough of a hangout vibe that you can have it on in the background, but also enough stakes that you will inevitably end up giving it your full attention.”(Zach Vasquez)Where to watch:Diggstown is available on Amazon PrimeRead the full reviewBurlesqueStarring:Cher and Christina AguileraDirected by:Steve AntinWhy our writer loves it:“Many of those who panned Burlesque on its release would feel punished by this cosmically appointed choice of comfort movie. A sequined patchwork quilt of all manner of backstage musicals and melodramas from various eras of Hollywood – starring, in a naked reach for cross-generational gay fandom, dual divas Christina Aguilera and Cher – the film inspired critical comparisons to A Star is Born, Cabaret and Showgirls, most of them unflattering. It made $90m at the global box office: not a flop but not a palpable hit either, least of all for a film where the feather budget alone could have funded a modest indie drama. Antin, whose long but scattered pre-Burlesque career ran the gamut from acting to screenwriting to stunt work to producing Pussycat Dolls reality shows, hasn’t directed another film since. The world, by and large, hasn’t mourned.”(Guy Lodge)Where to watch:Burlesque is available to watch on Netflix in the US, on Sky Cinema in the UK and ABC iView and Amazon Prime in AustraliaRead the full reviewHead of StateStarring:Chris Rock and Bernie MacDirected by:Chris RockWhy our writer loves it:“I’ve come back to this film so many times after the election for laughs, only to wind up seeing the whole picture as a clearer allegory for Kamala Harris’s defeat than Obama’s victory. Like Harris, [Chris Rock starring as Mays Gilliam, a small-time politician turned presidential hopeful] was a party sacrifice, offered up to make a certain loss look less bad on the cards, thrown into the fray at the 11th hour, plugged into a humming campaign apparatus, and touted as a history maker. It really makes you think about how close comedy is to horror.”(Andrew Lawrence)Where to watch:Head of State is available to stream in the US on Freevee, Tubi, Paramount+ and MGM+, in the UK on Paramount+ and on Amazon Prime in AustraliaRead the full reviewA Knight’s TaleStarring:Heath Ledger, Shannyn Sossamon and Paul BettanyDirected by:Brian HelgelandWhy our writer loves it:“To me, watching a feelgood film is an intensely nostalgic exercise. That’s because whenever a film is special or timely enough to take up lodging in your heart, rewatching it is also an act of remembering an old version of yourself.A Knight’s Taleis shaded by the genuine sadness of Ledger’s death only seven years after its release, but when I watch it I also remember the way it used to make me feel, as a girl who loved the jousting because her older brother did, all the while secretly cherishing an action film for being so brazenly sentimental.”(Francesca Carington)Where to watch:A Knight’s Tale is available on Amazon Prime in the US and available to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaRead the full reviewAlita: Battle AngelStarring:Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz and Jennifer ConnellyDirected by:Robert RodriguezWhy our writer loves it:“My feelgood movie for when humanity lets me down is Alita: Battle Angel, a movie where much of humanity hangs out in a city-sized junkpile. And though I don’t press play with this aspect particularly in mind, it’s nice to imagine a future where things have gone terribly wrong (that just seems realistic at this point) yet unforeseen triumphs still emerge from the tech-nightmare garbage heap. There are plenty of more time-honored films that take a more direct path to temporary bliss, including sci-fi movies better-equipped to restore faith in humanity.”(Jesse Hassenger)Where to watch:Alita: Battle Angel is available to watch on Hulu in the US, on Netflix and Disney+ in the UK and on Disney+ in AustraliaRead the full reviewI Know Where I’m Going!Starring:Wendy Hiller, Roger Livesey, Pamela BrownDirected by:Michael Powell and Emeric PressburgerWhy our writer loves it:”I Know Where I’m Going! offers up such portentous moments of mystical and romantic significance lightly, alongside comical asides and colourful eccentricity. It’s a disarming strategy, which tends to leave the audience every bit as bewitched as (the film’s main character) Joan. In this corner of the universe, anything might be possible, even an ancient curse.”(Pamela Hutchinson)Read the fullreview for I Know Where I’m Going!Where to watch:I Know Where I’m Going! is available to watch on Tubi, Amazon Prime and the Criterion Channel in the US and is available to rent digitally Australia and in the UK and watch on BBC iPlayerRead the full reviewExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood moviefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rodrigo will perform on Sunday. In 2022, the Drivers License singerperformed on the Other stage, a set that boasted a guest spot from Lily Allen and an excoriation of the US supreme court following the overturning of Roe v Wade a day earlier.In between on Saturday comes a previously – accidentally – announced headline set from Neil Young and his band the Chrome Hearts. On 1 January, Young declared, out of the blue, that he was withdrawing from this year’s festival owing to his perception that it was under broadcast partner the BBC’s “corporate control”. Two days later, he said he had received “an error in information” and thatthe festival was “back on our itinerary”. He previously headlined in 2009.View image in fullscreenOfficial poster of the Glastonbury lineup.The soul-pop starRayewill play on the Pyramid stage before Young. The 27-year-old Londoner is already something of a national treasure after walking away from her major label to find critical and commercial success with her debut album, My 21st Century Blues.The festival previously revealed thatRod Stewart would take this year’s “legends” slot. Stewart, who turned 80 in January, said he was “more than able to pleasure and titillate” at his age.The Other stage headliners have also been revealed. After turning the world lime green with herculture-dominating album Bratlast summer – and rivalling Dua Lipa’sheadline extravaganzawith merely a DJ set at Glastonbury 2024 – Charli xcx will headline the festival’s second stage on Saturday. The London rapper Loyle Carner headlines it on Friday, and the Prodigy will close the stage on Sunday – the dance group’s first Glastonbury performance since the death of their frontman, Keith Flint, in 2019, just before that year’s festival.A raft of talents old and new are among this year’s first-time performers. At the breakout end of the scale, there is the Stick Season troubadour Noah Kahan, the That’s So True songwriterGracie Abrams, the Messy singer Lola Young, the euphoric Brits-minted star Myles Smith, the cheeky American-Ghanaian rapper Amaarae and the A Bar Song (Tipsy) star and Beyoncé collaborator Shaboozey.There are more surprising debuts from Alanis Morissette, Busta Rhymes, Brandi Carlile – who will befresh off the back of a duets album with Elton John– the US girl group En Vogue, Anohni and the Johnsons, the cult British funk act Cymande, the hard-touring Osees and everyone’s friend electric, Gary Numan.‘She really is everything!’: how Doechii became a rap icon – and bagged a GrammyRead moreWorthy farm stalwarts scheduled to perform include Ezra Collective – riding high off winning best group at this year’s Brit awards – the Australian punk tykesAmyl and the Sniffers, Jorja Smith, Creedence Clearwater Revival’s John Fogerty and the roots reggae stars Burning Spear and Black Uhuru.Friday also sees the return of the Isle of Wight indie duo Wet Leg, presumed to be back this year with their second album. The Irish pop star CMAT is another returning talent, along with the Bath dance iconoclast PinkPantheress and Sheffield’s Self Esteem, who returns with her new album, A Complicated Woman, in April.Afterwinning best rap albumfor her mixtape Alligator Bites Never Heal at this year’s Grammy awards – which also featured a performance hinting at the magic she will bring to Worthy Farm – the Florida rapper Doechii will headline the West Holts stage on Saturday.That day also sees the Glastonbury debut of Jade, formerly of the UK girl group Little Mix. She joins a well-rounded day that features the London rock duo Nova Twins and the capital-born rapper Pa Salieu, the returning Scissor Sisters and New York indie stalwarts TV On The Radio, who have received rave reviews for the 20th anniversary tour of their 2004 album Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes.On Sunday, the British indie quartet Wolf Alice mark their return, four years after their critically acclaimed third album, Blue Weekend. The Libertines – now a venerable indie institution far from their chaotic 00s heyday – lead an indie-heavy lineup that also features the resurgent Maccabees. From varying sides of the US rock firmament, St Vincent will perform songs from her 2024 album All Born Screaming, and the presence of Baltimore hardcore band Turnstile indicates that they may finally release the much clamoured-over followup to 2021’s Glow On.More acts are yet to be announced in the coming months, with performances rumoured from Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and – take it with a pinch of salt – Rihanna,which seems incredibly unlikely given that the three Pyramid headliners have already been revealed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

We meet workers who feel ‘disposable’ – and the groups pushing for changeRachael HealyThu 6 Mar 2025 10.57 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 11.15 ESTShare‘Every time I think about starting a new job,” says Lucy, a documentary maker, “I feel triggered. Because every job I’ve done in the last five years, bar maybe two, I’ve had some kind of absolutely horrendous experience. I nowexpectto be put in danger at work.”Lucy (not her real name) is by no means an isolated case. According to new research into “the human toll and economic impact of injury”, nearly 80% of cast and crew members working in stage or screen productions have been injured at some point in their careers. The survey, conducted by the Injury Prevention Consultancy and shared with the Guardian, found that almost half of stage and three-fifths of screen performers have been placed in unsafe situations. Among crew, nearly three-quarters said that adhering to a show’s creative vision had compromised their safety, while only a quarter felt their wellbeing was regarded as a priority.I got an email from the executive producer saying: ‘I want you all to adopt a Dunkirk spirit’Stories make the headlines when the worst happens: take the tragic death ofcinematographer Halyna Hutchins, accidentally shot on the set of Alec Baldwin movie Rust in New Mexico in 2021; andcameraman Mark Milsome, who died after being hit by a Land Rover when a stunt went wrong during the shooting of Black Earth Rising in Ghana in 2017. Likewise, when the injured person is sufficiently famous, as in Ian McKellenfalling off a London stagewhile performing Player Kings last year (the star said his fat suit “saved” him). What the research suggests, however, is that many more people are suffering unseen, with almost a fifth saying they were left permanently damaged by an injury.View image in fullscreenLong hours … a film crew on location after dark.Photograph: Justine Evans/AlamyWhat the report also highlights is a lack of preventive measures, worsened by a culture of fear, with workers scared to speak up when they feel in danger. Some told the Guardian that a lack of regard for safety, coupled with a lack of support should an injury happen, made them feel “disposable”. With financial pressures squeezing both industries, they said conditions are becoming even more hazardous. Lucy says that, in many ways, she had a lucky escape while shooting a high-risk documentary overseas: although she feared for her life, she survived. But it has caused lasting trauma. She was left alone, waist-deep in water, during a lightning storm. “If I had slipped,” she says, “I would’ve been washed away. They would never have found me.”The production, she adds, was poorly funded and she had been abandoned by the person tasked with helping her film. “It left me with this choice: either I stand in moving floodwater in pitch-black darkness filming – or I don’t get any shots and get fired. I felt I had to put myself in unbelievable danger.” Lucy’s case is a shocking clash between two categories of danger: the life-threatening and the career-threatening.Tome Levi, the woman behind the Injury Prevention Consultancy, used to work as a professional dancer and conditioning coach. “I was witnessing a lot of injury,” she says, “seeing friends and colleagues go through things I deemed avoidable.” This made it all the worse when Levi saw the repercussions injuries had, both psychological and financial: productions halted, earnings lost, everyone stressed.Eight years ago, inspired by the rise of intimacy coordinators, Levi created a new role: injury prevention consultant. She will observe a show, then figure out a plan to prevent injuries, which could include a simple change to choreography that does little to alter the impact of a show.Crews often do heavily physical work, on their feet for long periods, wrestling heavy equipment about. But it’s not just heft and power that can lead to injuries. In theatre, a performer might do the same material eight times a week, for months on end, while in TV and film, actors might do 10 or more takes. “I’ve heard shocking stuff,” says Levi. “Repetitive strain injuries that become so acute people have to leave their jobs. Even if the initial event wasn’t avoidable, the exacerbation of it was.”View image in fullscreen‘The precariousness of work makes people less inclined to rock the boat’ … dancers’ toes.Photograph: Hans Neleman/Getty ImagesJennifer Caldwell, a performer who has starred in various hit shows including Six the Musical, spent years early in her career dancing on a painful foot, often rehearsing eight hours a day in heels. There’s pressure to “push through it”, she says, even holdingback tears of pain on stage at times. After nearly four years of the pain following her through different jobs, an MRI scan found a broken bone in her foot.She says there’s a stigma to talking about injuries: “I end up downplaying everything, to not appear weak or unable to do the job. Which is ridiculous, because it’s an injury I’ve sustained by going into work and worsening it.”Working on Six, things were different:Levi was there as a consultant, suggesting costume and movement adjustments so that all the repetition was more sustainable. “Having a third party there felt amazing,” she says.Ricardo Castro also broke a bone, in his case while dancing on stage. It left him unable to land new roles for four months. “There’s this mindset of, ‘the show must go on.’ But sometimes we can’t carry on – and that has to be OK.” The show involved high-energy moves, but he believes there weren’t enough understudies, standbys or swings: “It meant there was pressure to not get injured.” He raised concerns abouthis footwear but says: “I didn’t feel like I was heard.”Castro said the “family” ethos of theatre felt suddenly absent after his injury. His union Equity stepped in and he was able to claim money to weather the months he was unable to perform. The experience has made him more likely to speak up, he says, even if it can mean you’re viewed as ungrateful.View image in fullscreenHeavily physical work … a film set.Photograph: Striking Images/Studio Shots/AlamyNick (not his real name) was a camera operator on a long-running reality show for a major broadcaster. Feeling unsafe filming on uneven terrain, he asked for a spotter, but didn’t get one. He lost his footing and fell on his back. “You get up and get the shot, because that’s all they care about. You fight through the pain.”This tallies with the survey, which found that a third of workers felt similar pressure to work through an injury. The culture, says Levi, leads workers “to associate taking a break with letting colleagues down”.Nick continued working, however, carrying a heavy camera. The pain worsened, affecting his performance and he was dropped from that job and struggled in his next. He feels he’s been blacklisted by the company.The survey found that two-thirds of people feared raising concerns for exactly those reasons. “You don’t want to cause trouble for a production company,” Caldwell says. At one point, she had to take 12 weeks off and she hasn’t been hired, or seen, for anything by that company since.The Film and TV Charity has called for an independent body to report such concerns to. Many hope CIISA, the newly formed Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority, will take on this role. Levi hopes independent organisations such as hers can offer similar support.View image in fullscreenFear of saying no … a film crew at work on a bridge.Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesMany employees said they felt companies acted to protect themselves rather than their workers. “The immediate response,” says Cathy Sweet, Equity’s head of film and TV, “is, ‘It wasn’t our fault.’ They need to put the artist’s wellbeing first, then look at ongoing support. There should be no cost spared, but it feels like there is.”Workers are legally entitled to 11 hours off between finishing one day of work and starting the next. But they’re often asked to forgo that – in a practice called “broken turnaround”. Creative industries union Bectu is calling for action after its own research found that only 4% of crew members hadnotbeen asked to break turnaround across their last three jobs. Almost everyone said breaking turnaround affected their ability to work safely. They described accidents, falling asleep at the wheel, mental health issues.“Smaller budgets, last-minute script changes, poor scheduling and inexperienced producers can and do exacerbate this issue,” says head of Bectu Philippa Childs. “It is often the crew that are most significantly impacted.” Stage workers are affected too, though, she adds: “The UK’s theatre industry is also plagued by long hours, near misses and challenging environments.”Lucy faced “endless pressure” to work 18-hour days. Requests for additional staff or time were ignored. On other jobs, she’s worked 90 hours a week. Many workers are unaware they can object to broken turnaround, says Sweet, or fear saying no when asked.View image in fullscreenAwkward lifting … documentary fim-makers.Photograph: Leblond Catherine/AlamyTV production manager Rachel Wood recalls many jobs where this was an issue, including one particular shoot much earlier in her career. “Even before going out on location, we were leaving the office between 11pm and 3am,” she says. “I got an email from the exec producer saying, ‘I want you all to adopt a Dunkirk spirit.’ This line will stick with me until I die.”And then out on location, she found herself working 15 to 17 hours a day. “Three weeks in, I slipped over in the shower from exhaustion,” she says. “I hit the back of my knee. It was like an electric shock going through my body. I was screaming in pain.” She was summoned to a meeting. “They go, ‘You’re obviously not able to handle it, so we’ll have to let you go.’ I never heard from them again.”The response of companies and colleagues to injuries left many feeling undervalued. Wood says: “The first thing isn’t, ‘How are they?’ It’s, ‘Who can you get to replace them?’” Nick agrees: “There is no support. You’re so disposable – because so many people want your job.”Levi hopes theatre and TV companies will realise that safeguarding their staff has a positive effect for them, too. Injuries can mean costly staff replacements, insurance claims, delays, even cancellation. “The precariousness of work, especially now, makes people less inclined to rock the boat. That puts the onus even more on industry leadership to make sure that boat is steady.”Measures suggested by Bectu include giving health and safety advisers the power to enforce change, and providing training for all staff. “The industry,” says Childs, “must focus on ensuring that staff and freelancers have the appropriate qualifications and training. The industry needs to take this issue much more seriously.”See the full Impact of Injury reporthereExplore more on these topicsCultureTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She doesn’t mind the word, but prefers to describe her clothes as “romantic”.Under the domed roof of the Tennis Club de Paris, with long blondes Jerry Hall and Georgia May Jagger on the front row, the German-born designer sent out a soothing procession of ruffled blouses, ballet flats and gold Chloé logo belts.Big soft totes came laden with charms, and trousers were wide-legged and low slung. Fashion loves to throw a new erogenous zone into the ether until one sticks. At Dries Van Noten it was the left shoulder, and at Chloé it’s the midriff. As with almost every show so far, faux fur was everywhere. A little bitOphelia in the brook, a little bit whimsical 70s, it was hard not to argue that boho was back. Again.View image in fullscreenGold belt-buckles on display.Photograph: Stéphane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty ImagesBoth the high street, where Marks & Spencer has seen a reported and inconceivable 9,633% increase in searches for “boho styles”, and in popular culture, where boho is the unofficial wardrobe of the tradwife, it’s one of the few trends to skip seamlessly between generations. Love it or hate it, at a time when fashion is frantic for new silhouettes, subversive designs and viral moments, doing something familiar – and easy to wear – is a welcome surprise. Plus it sells – in the first year since she joined the brand, annual sales shot up 26.9%.Speaking backstage after the show, the German-born designer said she wanted to help women avoid “overthinking how they get dressed”. As a woman gets older her wardrobe changes, she said. Stating the obvious perhaps, but it’s also true in the everyday: “women are not always the same, we have shifting moods, and feelings and clothes need to reflect that”.The standout piece was a slip dress, cut on the bias, which came in pastel shades. In the dressing-up box of some of the most famous women in the world – Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy regularly wore Calvin Klein, while a freshly divorced Princess Diana turned up at the 1996 Met Ball wearing a dress by Dior – today, it was modelled by Alexa Chung. In Paris, home of the “cinq à sept”, slip dresses are more for the everyday. Wearing flats and a faux fur coat with hers, it managed to lampoon the line between public and private dressing, while being a little bit sexy too.View image in fullscreenDesigner Chemena Kamali takes the plauditsPhotograph: Stéphane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty ImagesChloé the label was originally founded in 1952 by the French fashion designer Gaby Aghion because she wanted something easy to wear (not possible in 1950s Paris). She created a brand, named it after a friend and in turn, created an archetype: the “Chloé girl”. Under various designers, including Phoebe Philo and most recently the Uruguayan designer Gabriela Hearst, her identity has shifted depending on who was sketching. But she’s endured.Kamali, who previously worked at Chloé under Philo in the 2000s and Clare Waight Keller in the 2010s, has been something of a revelation in the fashion industry, giving women clothes they clearly craved. This has been particularly true after the spate of appointments of white male designers in womenswear.If designers are the face of their label, or at least its most visible representation, running out for her end-of-show bow in loose trousers, a little lace vest, her long hair worn down, Kamali looked more like Chloé’s protagonist.Explore more on these topicsParis fashion weekFashion weeksParisFranceEuropeShareReuse this content"

What should I do?The signs that a cat likes you are fairly obvious. Here’s how to strengthen your bond with a pet if you think they prefer your partner moreMadeleine AggelerThu 6 Mar 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 15.13 ESTShareMy boyfriend and I moved in together last April. To be more precise, my boyfriend, my dog and I moved in together. Cleo and I had already spent seven years living together, supporting each other through several cross-country moves, napping together and cuddling whenone of us felt sad. Cleo loves my boyfriend very much, but ultimately she is mine and I am hers.Then, in January, we got a cat named Blue. She’s beautiful, loving, hilarious and perfect in every way. But suddenly, my boyfriend and I were on the same level – the cat had no prior allegiance to either of us. A few weeks after we got her, I voiced my concern. “I think she likes you better,” I said sadly as Blue busily kneaded his thigh. “Really? I was thinking she likes you more,” he said, also kind of sad.I needed to know for sure, so I consulted professionals.“Cats have individual preferences, just like people,” says Kristiina Wilson, a clinical animal behaviorist specializing in felines.The signs that a cat likes you are fairly obvious, Wilson says: nudging you with their head, sleeping on or near you, greeting you when you come home and kneading you with their paws – an act often referred to as “making biscuits”.Kneading is “a really, really big” sign a cat likes you, because it’s a self-soothing behavior. “That indicates that they view you as someone who is close and comforting to them,” Wilson says.Blue does all of these things with both of us. We call her our “busy baker” because of how much time she spends making biscuits on our legs, stomachs and – on a few unpleasant mornings – faces. Neither of us can sit still for more than a few minutes before she comes and curls up on one of our laps.View image in fullscreenFine, she likes both of us! But how could we tell if she liked one of usmore?The signs that a cat prefers one partner to another “can range from subtle to serious”, says LeeAnna Buis, a certified feline training and behavior consultant for Feline Behavior Solutions. If the cat tends to follow one person around the house more, and go to them for cuddling, petting or playing, that’s probably their preferred partner. In more serious cases, where one partner really doesn’t like cats or is mean to them, the cat may hiss, hide from or avoid that person.Hm. That didn’t clear up anything. Blue divides her time between us so evenly you would think she’s subject to a shared custody agreement. She has never hissed at either of us, and far from hiding from or avoiding us, it seems to frustrate her that we are all forced to exist in separate bodies.A cat might prefer one partner to another for any number of reasons, depending on the cat’s individual personality. “Cats have as many preferences as we do,” says Buis. This could be everything from the way one partner interacts with them, or the way that partner carries themselves. “One partner may start their evening relaxation time at the same time the cat likes to wind down, making them a better choice for cuddling,” she says. Other cats may prefer a more active partner who plays with them more.A cat’s primary sense is not their vision, but their hearing, says Wilson, so if one partner is extremely loud, that might turn them off. “I think that’s a reason why a lot of cats are not in love with small children,” she explains.When a cat does seem to prefer one partner, the other can always work to strengthen their bond with the animal. Buis and Wilson suggest spending more time with them, playing with them, being the one to feed them and rewarding them with high-value treats. Also, pay attention to your cat and what seems to make them happiest – rather than treats, it might be playtime, pets or compliments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others may be wondering, “Why would a person even care if their pet prefers their partner? Don’t they have better things to worry about?” To answer the first part of that question, I turned to a mental health professional.Find a stray cat? That might be the cat distribution system at workRead moreJealousy about a pet preferring a partner is “definitely something I’ve encountered”, says Kelly Scott, a psychotherapist and licensed mental counselor in New York City. She adds, however, that “virtually 100% of the time it is representative of something else”.She recalls one couple in which a dog’s fondness for one partner reinforced the other partner’s feelings of “not being chosen in other ways that had nothing to do with the pet”. This dynamic was painful and unresolvable, “because they were trying to resolve a problem through their pet that wasn’t really about their pet”.Still, Scott says that having feelings about our relationships with pets is normal. “Objectively, it feels shitty to come home at the same time as your partner, and your dog runs to one of you and ignores the other,” she says.Am I worried that if Blue loves my boyfriend more, it is a sign that I am fundamentally unlovable and will eventually be abandoned by everyone I care about? Haha, what a wild suggestion! Luckily, I don’t need to reflect on that because, according to my research, Blue seems to like us both the same.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyCatsPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I spent much of my 30s caring for my elderly parents while I lived in insecure share houses. I was single for all those years, apart from a couple of brief relationships. My mother died during the pandemic and my father moved cities and is now looked after by one of my siblings. I am terrified of losing him, but he is increasingly frail each time I visit, which I’m not able to do often due to my job.I still work in a junior role despite my age and I did not manage to maintain friendships as my experience was so different from theirs. I am being bullied at work and I find it heartrending that I spend my days in an environment where this is happening, while not being able to see my father.I also know that by spending all my emotional resources on the family I grew up in, I have not been able to start one of my own. It is likely that even if I met someone now it would be too late for us to have a child – and, as a heterosexual woman, I feel increasingly disillusioned as I see the terrible outcomes for everyone living in a patriarchy.I’m a mum who feels like the most boring fool on Earth. How do I find ‘interesting me’ again? | Leading questionsRead moreI want so much better for myself than what my life currently consists of. I feel too vulnerable to follow the standard advice of getting out there, meeting new people. This seems like it is keeping me isolated, while I cower from the idea of losing my father. Any thoughts you may have would be welcomed.Eleanor says:It’s just rotten to arrive at an important milestone feeling as though you don’t like your life. It’s hard to say which is more painful – admitting that you hoped it would be different, or admitting that that hope has been disappointed.You’ve pointed to a lot of domains where it sounds as though you want things to be “further along”. Career, romance, friendships, starting your own family. That’s a big list. There are not many people who, at 40, feel they’ve got everything sorted in these areas, or in the balance of how much life they take up. Everybody feels they’ve fallen behind. When we peer into other people’s lives from the outside they look more together than they feel on the inside.You also received something in exchange for the sacrifices you made. You took care of your parents, you got to be with your mother when she needed you most; it sounds like you’re close to your family. That can be a blueprint for love and care that a lot of people wish they had – lots of people would trade every success they have for 15 more minutes with a parent.Those two thoughts might lessen some of the sting you’re feeling. But I know it won’t totally take it away. It’s just hugely painful to know that our one life hasn’t – so far – gone the way we wanted.Maybe, before we can respond to these disappointments, we have to grieve a bit – to say “well, shit” about where we’ve ended up. It’s scary that life can disappoint us in big ways. It’s so scary that sometimes we feel those thoughts as a background hum but try to push them aside, strategise them away, or stay optimistic because we want the resolve to change things. Maybe it would help to just let it on stage for a specified period of time: “I’m having a horrible time and I’m not where I wanted to be.” Get those feelings out, don’t fight them.You’re not alone in feeling as though you don’t have the energy to do the things that might help, and I won’t waste your time with tips on getting out there. But maybe a bigger question might help. There are really only two things we can do in response to big disappointments: we can try to change our circumstances, or we can try to change our reactions. Which do you most want?I want to find my ‘thing’. How can I work out what I want to do with my life? | Leading questionsRead moreIf you want to change your reactions so life as it is feels better, that recommends one set of strategies. But if what you really want is big changes to your circumstances, you have to be willing to pull some pretty big levers to get there. You’ll need to make big changes to get closer to your dad, or out of this bullying job, or to decide you want a family by such and such a time with or without traditional romance – if those are things you want.If what you’re saying is youfeelbad, the response is to target the feeling. But if what you’re saying is you feel trapped in circumstances thatarebad, the response is to change them. It’s important to be clear about the difference: bad feelings can follow you anywhere, no matter how many big levers you pull. Conversely, all the emotional work in the world won’t solve the problem if the problem is just that you want to quit and move.Neither way of responding is easy, and neither guarantees relief. But picking a strategy to chase can help make life feel like it’s yours again.The reader’s letter has been edited for lengthAsk Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleLeading questionsFamilyParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A sailor, stricken in a wild and furious sea, fell to the deck of his ship to pray for salvation. The almighty unveiled a mountain in the midst of the tempest where the ship duly made landfall: in gratitude the sailor built a church on its summit. The devil – who had unleashed that evil storm – did his best to prise the church from its foundations, but Archangel Michael sprung to its defence and became the patron of this Devon parish. The tale has many versions, but this is the general gist.Map of Dartmoor, south DevonToday, St Michael de Rupe counts as the highest working church in southern England – poised dramatically on top of a western outlier of Dartmoor’s tors. This medieval building casts a striking silhouette over the west Devon landscape, but it also marks the start of theArchangel’s Way: a pilgrimage route created in 2021 by the diocese of Exeter that travels 38 miles eastward from here across Dartmoor to a second St Michael’s church in Chagford. I chose to walk the route in February when the moor was at its quietest and most mysterious – and though the seas of the famous folk tale had receded, on my visit the storm had not.Storm Herminia was thrashing through the West Country as I climbed the muddy path to the porch of St Michael de Rupe. Inside, the church had the mood of a ship in a storm. There was the whistle of the wind in the roof: gusts pressing lead-lined glass into ancient panes. The winged figure of Archangel Michael adorned the stained glass behind the altar. In folklore he is the guardian of high places, and the vanquisher of heathen forces that once held dominion over the peaks.St Michael de Rupe is the highest working church in southern England – poised dramatically on top of a western outlier of Dartmoor’s torsSitting in the porch, I unfolded a map and considered the path ahead of me. The Archangel’s Way passes villages with parish churches, pubs with warm hearths, places where you can find succour and society. However, it also skirts the North Moor – the more desolate and remote half of Dartmoor, where signs of Christendom are still outnumbered by prehistoric pagan edifices, such as stone circles and cryptic megaliths.In Dartmoor folklore there is barely a crossroads the devil does not frequent to barter for a soul, nor a hill nor stone at which some evil entity claims authority – phantom, beast, horned figure. To walk this route was, in a sense, to walk a line between dark and light. To be a wanderer of the English wilderness for, if not exactly 40 days, then at least about 40 miles.The path led to Lydford and then climbed the western flank of Dartmoor proper. Green fields turned to bracken the colour of a well-thumbed two pence piece. A final stone cross guarded the approach on Brat Tor: to the south red flags fluttered on poles, a warning sign that the army were conducting live firing exercises nearby.View image in fullscreenThe Nine Maidens stone circle.Photograph: ASC Photography/AlamyThe storm blew on. The overflow waterfall of the Meldon reservoir flew upwards into massing clouds. I was walking with my friend, Justin Foulkes, a Devonian who has been exploring the moor since he was 15. He pointed out the lonely ruin named Bleak House, and Amicombe Hill, the scene of fires attributed to the devil by residents of the farmland below. Justin was clear that, for him, Dartmoor was never a sinister place. As a teenager he had found himself too anxious to revise for exams at home and so brought piles of textbooks out on to the moor to find focus. “When you’re sitting on top of a bronze age burial chamber it puts everything in perspective,” he said.We wanted to harness the spirituality of the moor in the creation of the Archangel’s WayChloe Axford, diocese of ExeterAfter a night on the moor at a friend’s near Belstone, further prehistoric remains followed on the second day of walking. First came the Nine Maidens stone circle – the stones said to come alive with the ringing of the church bells (out of earshot in the wind). There followed the stone rows on Cosdon Hill, arriving through a thick Hammer Horror mist. Lastly came the spectacular Scorhill stone circle – supposedly protected by a magic forcefield which prevents livestock from entering.Folklore is an errant guide to these relics of an unfathomable past – whose meaning and function are lost to an age before recorded history – indeed an age before climate change helped lead to a large-scale human exodus from Dartmoor’s high country.View image in fullscreenSt Michael’s, Chagford, marks the end of the route.Photograph: Ian Goodrick/AlamyHowever, where certainties are absent the imagination steps in to complete the picture. It was perhaps natural for God-fearing folk to populate the moorland with supernatural entities that could thrive in the wild weather and hostile terrain where humans could no longer live.“Dartmoor is like the sea,” Chloe Axford of the diocese of Exeter later told me. “It’s a rugged, wild and unpredictable place. We wanted to harness the spirituality of the moor in the creation of the Archangel’s Way. And also encourage people to visit its churches and chapels, and give them a warm welcome there.”How I found my Dartmoor moment with the gift of wild campingRead moreEventually, there were signs I was returning to society: a cattle grid, a row of conifers. A country lane winding down to St Michael, Chagford, where snowdrops were sprouting among the graves. Inside the beautiful little church was a rough-hewn sculpture of St Michael – a demon vanquished beneath his foot. Yet, you could still hear the wind pressing upon the rafters, as if Herminia herself was trying to get inside.On This Holy Island: A Modern Pilgrimage Across Britainby Oliver Smith is published byBloomsbury(£10.99).

Some say ‘polycrisis’ captures itThe term ‘polycrisis’ has gained traction as we face one disaster after another. It’s overwhelming – but diagnosing the catastrophe is the first step to addressing itMatthew CantorThu 6 Mar 2025 11.02 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 16.00 ESTShareTwo months into 2025, the sense of dread is palpable. In the US, the year began with a terrorist attack; then came thefiresthat ravaged a city, destroying lives, homes and livelihoods. An extremist billionaire came to power and began proudly dismantling the government with a chainsaw. Once-in-a-century disasters are happening more like once a month, all amid devastating wars and on the heels of apandemic.The word “unprecedented” has become ironically routine. It feels like we’re stuck in a relentless cycle of calamity, with no time to recover from one before the next begins.How do we make sense of any of this – let alone all of it, all at once?A number of terms have cropped up in the past decade to help us describe our moment. We’re living in theanthropocene– the era in which humanity’s impact is comparable to that of geology itself. Or we’re in the “post-truth” era, in which we no longer share the same sense of reality. We’re facing apermacrisis, an endless state of catastrophe.There were never any climate havens: floods in the midwest, hurricanes in AppalachiaRead moreBut perhaps the word that best describes this moment is one that emerged at the turn of the millennium, picked up steam in the 2010s and has recently been making the global rounds again: polycrisis.Not to be confused with a “perfect storm” or the perhaps less scientific “clusterfuck”, “polycrisis” –a term coinedby the authors Edgar Morin and Anne Brigitte Kern – refers to the idea that not only are we facing one disaster after another, but those messes are all linked, making things even worse. Or, as Adam Tooze, a Columbia University history professor and public intellectual who has championed the term,put it: “In the polycrisis the shocks are disparate, but they interact so that the whole is even more overwhelming than the sum of the parts.”Our globalized world is built on interconnecting systems, and when one gets rattled, the others do too – a heating climate, for instance, increases the risk of pandemics, pandemics undermine economies, shaky economies fuel political upheaval. “There’s a kind of larger instability, or a larger system disequilibrium,” the researcher Thomas Homer-Dixon says. To illustrate the situation, Homer-Dixon uses a video of metronomes on a soft surface. Though they’re all started at different times, they end up synchronized, as each device’s beat subtly affects the rest. When people see it for the first time, “they don’t actually see what’s happening properly. They don’t realize the forces that are operating to cause the metronomes to actually synchronize with each other,” Homer-Dixon says.In much the same way, it’s often unclear even to experts how global systems interact because they are siloed in their disciplines. That limits our ability to confront intersecting problems: the climate crisis forces migration; xenophobia fuels the rise of the far right in receiving countries; far-right governments undermine environmental protections; natural disasters are more destructive. Yet migration experts may not be experts on the climate crisis, and climate experts may have limited knowledge of geopolitics.That’s why Homer-Dixon thinks better communication is essential – not just to create consensus around what wecallour current predicament but also how to address it. He runs the Cascade Institute, which is fostering “a community of scholars and experts and scientists and policy makers around the world who are using this concept [of polycrisis] in constructive ways”.“Constructive” is a key word here. “You’ve got to get the diagnosis right before you can go to the prescription,” he says. Finding that diagnosis means looking at how stresses on various systems – climate, geopolitics, transportation, information, etc – intersect and identifying what his team calls “high leverage intervention points”: “places where you can go in and have a really big impact for a relatively low investment”.TheCascade Institute’s proposalstarget what they have identified as key drivers of the polycrisis, such as polarization and climate change, by, for instance, improving school curricula to bolster students’ understanding of disinformation and expanding the use of deep geothermal power.In addition to bringing people with disparate expertise together, the Cascade Institute, part of Royal Roads University in British Columbia, has developed an analytical framework for understanding the polycrisis, and it operates a website, polycrisis.org, which serves as a hub for the latest thinking on the issue – including critiques of the concept, Homer-Dixon says. The site contains a compendium of resources from academia to blogposts that explore the polycrisis, reflecting, for instance, onwhat’s already happened in 2025(a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza, California wildfires, Trump upending the global order, an AI-bubble selloff, and the outbreak of bird flu).View image in fullscreenA burning house during the Eaton fire in Altadena on 8 January.Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty ImagesThere has been some backlash to the idea of the polycrisis. The historian Niall Ferguson hasdescribed it as“just history happening”. The political scientist Daniel Drezner says its proponents “assume the existence of powerful negative feedback effects that may not actually exist” – in other words, when crises overlap, the outcome might not always be bad (for instance, the pandemic lockdowns might have had someshort-lived environmental benefits). Some point to past crises as evidence that what we are experiencing is not new.Homer-Dixon disagrees. “We’ve moved so far and so fast outside our species’ previous experience that many elites don’t have the cognitive frame to grasp our situation, even were they inclined to do so,” he wrote in 2023, when the term was the talk of Davos.It’s all a bit overwhelming, as Homer-Dixon acknowledges. “If you’re not really scared by what’s going on in the world, you’re braindead,” he says.On the other hand, “t​​he crisis can actually be a moment for really significant change,” he says, “because it kind of delegitimizes the existing way of doing stuff, the existing vested-interest stakeholders who are who are hunkered down and don’t want anything to change”. For instance, while Homer-Dixon seesDonald Trumpas an “abominable” figure, he also notes that, “like an acid”, the president dissolves norms around him. That creates the risk of disaster but also offers opportunities to change the world for the better.“This really is a critical moment in human history and things can be done,” Homer-Dixon says. “We don’t know enough about how these systems are operating to know that it’s game over.”And the term itself, as terrifying as it is, can also be a strange comfort. “I think that’s useful, giving the sense a name. It’s therapeutic,” Tooze toldRadio Davos. When the world feels like a nightmare, identifying the condition gives us something to hold on to – a kind of understanding amid the chaos.Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS politicsClimate crisisCalifornia wildfiresDonald TrumpElon MuskMigrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tech billionaireBill Gatesis listed as a stakeholder in the company.‘A trash can for the US’: anger in Mexico and Canada over toxic waste shipmentsRead moreLast week theQuebecminister of natural resources and forests introduced a bill to force the city to sell the land to allow the expansion to go forward, saying the waste site is about to run out of space and the government must act quickly to avoid a stoppage in hazardous waste disposal.The company says it offers a safe way to dispose of toxic waste that could otherwise pollute the environment, but opposition leaders questioned whetherCanadashould be handling US waste.“We are not the trash can of the United States,” Ruba Ghazal, an opposition member of Quebec’s parliament, said at a press conference. She said it is unacceptable for Quebec’s ruling conservative party to “expropriate a city to give it to Trump’s United States”.The issue has gained attention following aninvestigation last month by the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab, a Mexican investigative unit, which showed the US ships more than a million tons of hazardous waste to Canada and Mexico each year.Opposition to those waste exports is growing at a time when Canadians areactively registeringtheir displeasure with the newadministrationofDonald Trump. Trumphas imposeda 25% tariff on Canadian goods and talked abouttaking overCanada as “the 51st state”. Canadians have variously responded byboycotting pizza ingredientsfrom the US andcanceling their travel plansto their southern neighbor.I can’t understand why the government wants to expropriate the land for the benefit of an American company, especially when we have an alternative solutionLiza Poulin, Blainville mayorA coalition of environmental groups iscalling forCanada to stop accepting US hazardous wastes altogether, saying the government of Canada “must take advantage of the current context of economic tension with our southern neighbours to take a strong stand and put an end to the MASSIVE import of hazardous waste from the United States”.Municipal officials say their immediate concern is protecting about 165 acres (67 hectares) of peat bog and forest land, where Stablex is pushing to expand. They say the company can instead develop what they say is a less environmentally sensitive site nearby, which is owned by the Quebec government and had previously been designated for the expansion.“I can’t understand why the government wants to expropriate the land for the benefit of an American company, especially when we have an alternative solution,” Blainville mayor Liza Poulin said.The landfill, run by Stablex, a subsidiary of the US giant garbage company Republic Services, has operated in the town of Blainville since 1983. In 2023 it received more than 5,000 tons of contaminated soils and sludges from the US, as well 28,000 tons of a variety of substances including cyanide, mercury and nitric acid, according to EPA records obtained through a freedom of information act request. It receives waste from Quebec and other Canadian provinces as well.Quebec business registration recordssay that Gates has 25-50% of voting rights in Stablex. This is because his investment firm holds a large stake in Republic Services, Stablex’s parent company.‘The relationship is broken’: Canadians respond to Trump’s tariffsRead moreA spokesperson for Gates’s investment company declined to comment.The company advertises that it permanently secures hazardous wastes for burial by “treating, stabilizing, and then binding them” before putting them “in a secure placement cell” and promises “to dispose of them permanently and without risk to the environment”.Between 2018 and 2022, Stablex was the largest importer of hazardous waste to Quebec and the second largest importer of hazardous waste in Canada, according to aninvestigation published last week by Le Journal de Quebec, which analyzed the data obtained by the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab.In a February letter to the Quebec premier, the CEO of Stablex said the Blainville site is on track to reach full capacity in 2027 and, unless the company can break ground on a new storage cell by April 2025, it risks facing a service disruption which could leave Quebec industry with nowhere to dispose of its waste.“We cannot emphasize enough the seriousness of the situation,” wrote Stablex CEO Michel Perron. “We have seen in the past situations where materials have been disposed of illegally or in unauthorized locations.”In response, Maïté Blanchette Vézina, Quebec’s minister of natural resources and forests, introduced a bill to force Blainville to sell its land for the expansion. She represents Quebec’s ruling party, which has sufficient votes to approve the bill.Stablex says the city’s parcel of land is needed because the nearby Quebec-owned alternative site is too close to newly constructed neighborhoods and has clay deposits that would have to be removed, requiring 40,000 annual truck trips through the city’s streets each year for the two years of construction.Mexico authorities order factory cleanup after Guardian toxic waste investigationRead more“The Quebec government conducted its own analyses and made its choice in the interest of the Quebec community,” said Maxime Couture, a spokesperson for the company. He said the proportion of hazardous materials coming to the site from the US has fallen from 43% in 2018 to 17% in 2024.City officials noted that Quebec’s environmental watchdog agency released a report last year recommending against the expansion and questioning the company’s stabilization process, which it said was developed 50 years ago and has never been subjected to testing outside a laboratory.An organization of municipal governments for the Montreal region has come out against the bill as well, saying that expropriating land from the city infringes upon local rights and runs counter to regional wildland preservation goals.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmerica's dirty divideWasteTrump tariffsAmericasDonald TrumpTrump administrationQuebecnewsShareReuse this content"

A collection of islands and atolls the size of Puerto Rico, Bougainville is located 600 miles east of Moresby, across the Solomon Sea. Its southern shore is just three miles from the politically independent Solomon Islands, and its people share a culture, linguistic links and dark skin tone with their Solomon neighbours. But thanks mostly to European colonisers, who drew the borders, Bougainville is the farthest-flung province of Papua New Guinea, whose lighter-toned inhabitants Bougainvilleans often call “redskins”, betraying a sense of otherness in their own country that partly explains why I am writing about them here.I say partly because if not for the islands’ having fought a bitter, decade-long war against the Australia-backed Papua New Guinea – which remarkably they won – and demanding Papua New Guinea allow Bougainville’s independence by 2027, the story I am about to tell would likely never have happened.In October 2023, I booked a trip to Buka to report on these developments, budgeting some days at the end to interview leaders of the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG), the formal authority that expects to secure self-rule for its people. But over the previous months I had become transfixed instead by the strange tale of Noah Musingku, a Bougainvillean scam artist who had made a fortune, lost it, then retreated to a remote armed compound in the jungle, where he declared himself the islands’ king. He wore crowns of brass and cowrie shells that, lest there be any ambiguity, spelled out king. An academic who has described Musingku as “Bougainville’s Bernie Madoff” wrote him off as an “irrelevance”, while a diplomatic envoy to Papua New Guinea told me he was a “fucking joke”.Bougainvilleans had other ideas. Musingku’s purported con – a vast, millenarian Ponzi scheme called U-Vistract – had, since the late 90s, raked in some $232m, perhaps far more, and near as I could tell, it was still plodding on. In 2006, a militia allegedly aligned with the ABG stormed Musingku’s hideout and almost killed him. One man told me that U-Vistract was “just like a mafia”; police have also accused Musingku of plotting to overthrow the ABG. An ABG minister told me that Musingku was just the excuse, or “thorn”, that Papua New Guinea needed to forestall independence. Not since 2012, it seemed, had a foreign reporter set foot in the Royal Kingdom of Papaala, Musingku’s name for his compound in the village of Tonu. Nobody entirely knew what he had been up to in the intervening years, but they were sure it wasn’t good.Which is all by way of saying, I wanted to meet the king. But after several months, the best lead I had was an obscure YouTube channel offering shaky videos of U-Vistract events. It belonged to a man named Nawera Karrenna, who claimed he could introduce me to Musingku – though when I revisited these messages at my hotel bar in Moresby, I realised that most of them were just his replying “yes” and generally dodging my increasingly desperate and long-winded proposals, which made me suspect that the entire thing was some sort of hoax.So I was more than a little relieved when, in the early afternoon, I landed and, having sweat so quickly in the heat that I felt as if somebody had thrown a pail of water over me, spotted my royal envoy in a crowd outside Buka airport’s rusting corrugated-steel terminal. Short and broad with sepulchral eyes, Karrenna wore a bucket hat, polo shirt, shorts and flip-flops. We shook hands. He told me he’d once spent several weeks in Manchester, England, trying out for various professional football teams. But he didn’t look like a sportsman. Given the scant number of media visits to Papaala, I remarked glibly, he hardly had his work cut out as a media rep. He shrugged. “HM is a busy man,” he said, using a royal honorific (His Majesty) that I would hear a lot in the ensuing days. Together we rode a taxi five minutes into town, exchanged some cash at a Chinese-run convenience store, and, paying the equivalent of 50 US cents, hopped aboard one of the dozens of brightly painted banana boats darting across the narrow Buka Passage that cleaves its namesake island from the far larger island of Bougainville. It’d be at least another day, Karrenna told me, before we reached the king.On the other side of the water was Kokopau, a town that doubles as a cab stand for vans and 4x4s headed up-country, and triples as Bougainville’s premier live-music spot. Australia’s primary legacy on Bougainville is Panguna, a colossal, open-pit copper and gold mine that, while dormant, is still one of the largest on earth, and whose controversial operation kindled the Bougainvillean uprising. The secondary legacy is a taste for heavy metal music. Seemingly every other person dresses in denim shorts and band T-shirts – Slayer, Megadeth, Pantera, AC/DC, Metallica, Judas Priest, Van Halen, Black Sabbath. You’d be hard-pressed to find a difference between many Bougainvilleans and a convocation of midwestern roadies if not for the band names that recalled Bougainville’s darkest days: Crisis Survivors, Trouble Zone, Dooms Vein, Mortal Revenge. Almost everybody who climbed into our taxi, a tattered Toyota Land Cruiser, was a metalhead, it seemed. Karrenna wasn’t keen; “white music,” he called it.We left Kokopau by means of a shoreside highway cradled by coconut palms. It was around two o’clock. By early evening, we would reach Arawa, Bougainville’s former capital, which was built by the Australians to service Panguna. Not coincidentally, it was also the gateway to a sprawling “no-go zone” established by Bougainville’s great, bushy-bearded war hero, Francis Ona, at the tail end of the conflict, in 1998. Tonu and its elusive leader, Musingku, were nestled in the centre of this zone. With any luck I would be shaking the king’s hand in a day or two.If I really believed that at the time – and I think I did – I was no more deluded than most outsiders who have visited Bougainville.The maritime historian Samuel Eliot Morisononce noted that Bougainville possessed “wilder and more majestic scenery” than he’d encountered anywhere in the South Pacific. The islands offer almost every geographic feature imaginable, from mountains and volcanoes to coral reefs, waterfalls, and a sparkling, pristine coastline. Almost everything is quilted in a dense canopy of palm fronds. Copra – the dried white flesh of coconuts – was Bougainville’s prime export long before copper or gold.In part owing to this wild abundance, Bougainville and its neighbouring isles have enticed a succession of fair-skinned cads, colonisers and crazies. The French explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville lent the island his name after an 18th-century voyage, and he named Buka after a word bellowed at him from the shore (most agree that it likely means “who”).In 1961, a colonial geologist named Jack Errol Thompson visited a site in central Bougainville, near the sacred mountain of Panguna, and found evidence of a large deposit containing sizeable quantities of porphyry copper, gold and silver. By 1972, Bougainville Copper Ltd (BCL), a subsidiary of the conglomerate Conzinc Riotinto of Australia (later simply Rio Tinto ), had dug one of the largest human-made holes on earth.View image in fullscreenThe remains of mining buildings at Panguna.Photograph: Human Rights Law CentreThe Panguna mine soon became one of the world’s most profitable, accounting for nearly half of Papua New Guinea’s exports. Conzinc Riotinto connected it to Arawa via a vertiginous, 16-mile road and filled the town with rows of whitewashed, two-storey apartment blocks the likes of which Bougainvilleans had never seen. Aussie roughnecks and their families arrived en masse, bringing beer, pies and music. Arawa was an unlikely boomtown.Those days are long gone. Visitors to Arawa today are greeted by great braids of rusted pipelines that encircle the city, ducking below ground and rising above like huge, mechanical boas. Smokestacks and substations have been overtaken by ferns and creepers. It reminded me of Chernobyl. His Majesty, our driver told me, as we approached the city, “helps many people”. Bougainvilleans were suffering from a cost of living crisis, and the ABG “doesn’t have enough money even for the roads”. Just then, the Land Cruiser jolted across the broken tarmac. He smirked at his own good timing. Bougainville, he said, “is a wrong-way place”.We arrived at Arawa at dusk, an orange sun disappearing beneath the ridge of a mountain range. The following day, Karrenna guided me around town, pointing out streets where major battles had been fought. He was 34, and his memories of the Crisis, as it is known, were vague. But envisioning the privation that followed, after the Panguna mine shut down, requires little imagination. We passed a row of apartments that once housed BCL’s foreign staff and were now gutted and inhabited by squatters. Beside them was a modest globe erected as a peace memorial but which had long since been stripped down to its wire frame. Karrenna pointed out homes whose owners, he claimed, had invested in U-Vistract: “He’s invested, they’ve invested, this one has invested,” and so on. Investors are still expecting payouts. The poverty is the ABG’s fault, he told me, as we hurled rocks into the Pacific Ocean. “Money is just a belief system.”“If HM delivers on what he says,” he added, “everyone will run to him.” When will he do that? I asked. Karrenna ignored my question. The morning heat was stupefying. We walked back to my guesthouse, and I packed my things. The Land Cruiser would depart at midday, head into the mountains and the no-go zone, and deliver us to Tonu.His Majesty was born in 1964,far from Arawa, in a village in southern Bougainville. He says he is the last of eight children – in fact, he claims to be “the lastborn of the lastborn of the lastborn” going back no fewer than 14 generations. But the truth is unclear. What’s certain is that, as a young boy, he joined the island’s Pentecostal movement, a fundamentalist faith that put as much emphasis on financial reward as on liberation from the daily trials of life. Musingku was a “mysterious kind of student”, James Tanis, a schoolmate of his and future ABG president, told me. He’d revelled in rags-to-riches tales about “a beggar who became a millionaire”.Musingku says his father planted in him the idea to found an alternative banking system “with very high interests”. He claims to have travelled across Papua New Guinea, then to Australia and the US, in search of suitable business models. Somewhere during this period, God appeared to him. “You are the answer,” the Lord told Musingku. “You are the solution.” And so Musingku returned to Port Moresby.Bougainville was, by this point, mired in conflict. In 1975, as Papua New Guinea prepared for independence from Australia, Bougainville declared itself the Republic of the North Solomons, but the next year settled for increased autonomy and abandoned the name. Meanwhile, Francis Ona, aged 23, joined BCL as a surveyor before switching to driving dump trucks. But over the years, Panguna had swallowed Ona’s home village of Guava, and he distrusted BCL. He took on night shifts as a cleaner, which gave him access to company files, which he photocopied. The files confirmed that the company was lowballing landowners; soon, Ona began to spread the word, including the extent of Panguna’s ecological destruction. In 1988, BCL commissioned an environmental inquiry, but Ona, puckish and with a talent for political theatre, stormed out, declaring it a sham. He demanded 10bn kina (about £2bn) in damages, local ownership and consultation on all future projects in the region. “Land to us is our lifeline and we cannot be separated from it,” he wrote. “We are fighting to save our land from foreign exploitation.”View image in fullscreenFrancis Ona in his home village of Guava above the Panguna mine, in 1994.Photograph: The GuardianNot long afterward, local men used stolen dynamite to blow up transmission pylons in the pit of the mine. Regional fighters created the Bougainville Revolutionary Army, or BRA, with Ona as its commander in chief. Papua New Guinea sent in police officers at what it claimed was BCL’s behest, but the sabotage continued. Moresby dispatched the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, which burned homes and fired on civilians from Australian-made helicopters that had been repurposed as gunships. In 1989, Panguna shuttered, and its roughnecks fled from Arawa. “We are the ‘sacrificial lamb’ for the few capitalists whose hunger for wealth is quenchless and unceasing,” read a November 1989 communique by Ona. The Crisis had begun.In 1990, Papua New Guinea blockaded the islands with gunboats. Thousands died from lack of medicine, as the occupying force herded many people into makeshift “care centres”, where rights groups recorded revenge attacks and disappearances. Fuel reserves ran low. The rebels who’d worked at Panguna – miners, turners, fitters, forgers, joiners, plumbers, painters, smelters, glaziers – scavenged pipes and vehicle parts and refashioned them into more than 50 hydroelectric generators. They also made weapons from the mine’s twisted wreckage.But the most extraordinary aspect of the BRA’s resistance was the use it made of Bougainville’s erstwhile staple crop: the coconut. Islanders ate its flesh, drank its milk and sealed their wounds with its leaves. They wove it into baskets and homes, burned it to ward off mosquitoes and even made music from the husks. They cooked with it and cleaned their guns with its oil, boiled it into soap, and when they fermented and cooked it, they distilled a fuel that yielded double the mileage of regular diesel. “In some ways the war’s been good to us,” the photojournalist Ben Bohane recalls Ona telling him. “We’ve gone back to our customary ways. There’s no more meat pies and beer … we don’t need money.”In 1997, Papua New Guinea’s prime minister, Julius Chan, secretly hired a group of South African mercenaries to storm Bougainville in a desperate bid to win the war. The deal leaked. New Guineans rioted in protest, and PNGDF troops took the mercenaries hostage, forcing Chan’s resignation. Eight previous peace efforts had failed, but the ninth, held at a military camp near Christchurch, New Zealand, was successful, thanks to atarout,or “vomiting session”, that might be understood today as an extreme form of radical honesty. These discussions paved the way for the signing of the Bougainville peace agreement in 2001, in which Papua New Guinea promised to enact in Bougainville, among other things, a disposal of weapons, the formation of the ABG, and within 15 years of that formation, the right for islanders to vote in an independence referendum. But by then, nearly a tenth of Bougainville’s population had been killed, and Ona had refused to take part in the peace talks. “He’d already declared independence,” Shane McLeod, an Australian reporter who covered Ona, told me. “He didn’t really need to go through the hoops of this crummy Bougainville peace process.”Ona sealed himself and several former BRA men inside a no-go zone surrounding Panguna, rebranding themselves the Me’ekamui Defence Force, or MDF, using a local word meaning “Holy Island”. People flocked to the hero’s new enclave. But he needed money. Fortunately, he’d just met a Bougainvillean man in Moresby who was about to make more than anybody there could imagine.Years before, Noah Musingku and his brotherhad devised a scheme they called the Pei Mure Association, spinning a wild, picaresque tale that might have been torn from the diaries of one of Bougainville’s early European interlopers. Pei Mure – “the law of King Pei” – had been forged at an ancient, Edenic kingdom called Papaala, whence he claimed the island’s first ancestors had come. A conclave of chiefs had revived the law in 1922, Musingku said, and added plans to implement a new world banking system.In 1997, a financial crisis rocked Asia and destabilised the Papua New Guinean economy. Schemes with names such as Bonanza, Windfall, Gold Money and Money Rain proliferated across the nation, promising investors fantastical returns. U-Vistract, which promised up to 100% returns each month, was different. Musingku positioned himself as a man of deep faith, preaching a prosperity gospel that resonated with people crawling from war to deprivation. He sermonised to U-Vistract investors for hours, and demanded their unalloyed loyalty; he created a government, renaming months of the year for gemstones, a move that drew comparisons to the cargo cults prevalent across the Pacific.For U-Vistract, Musingku courted foreign investors, including the architects of similar frauds elsewhere. Reports circulated of his lavish spending on private jets and events. Senior political figures in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Fiji were believed to have invested. Some of U-Vistract’s early investors saw returns, but the vast majority never did. Within a couple of years, Papua New Guinea, Australia and the World Bank moved to freeze U-Vistract’s assets, which were estimated at almost a quarter of a billion dollars. Musingku responded by folding the scheme into his bogus Kingdom of Papaala, crowning himself King David Peii II. U-Vistract’s missives blamed Papua New Guinea’s poor economy on the country’s godlessness, and in 2001, a promoter told angry investors at a U-Vistract event that only born-again Christians would receive payouts, a provision that would preclude adulterers, gamblers and smokers. The payments would come soon, the promoter vowed – but they would be made according to “God’s will and timing.”As authorities liquidated U-Vistract’s accounts, Musingku fled to Solomon Islands. But in 2003, under legal pressure, he returned to Bougainville, where he hooked up with an old acquaintance, Francis Ona. The war hero had changed. He now claimed that he could cure cancer, Aids and other illnesses, and travelled to Arawa and Buka on the bed of a truck, telling crowds that he was Bougainville’s king. More ominously for his followers, Ona shaved off the Garibaldi beard that had been the emblem of his arcadian struggle.Ona had broken “the covenant he signed with God and his people”, one former BRA soldier told me. So when, at a bizarre coronation ceremony near Guava, on a drizzly morning in May 2004, Musingku placed a crown of cowries upon Ona’s head and declared him “King Francis Dominic Dateransy Domanaa, head of state of the Royal Kingdom of Me’ekamui”, even a onetime leader in Ona’s militia called it “bullshit”. Bougainville’s revolutionary hero, stripped to the waist, looked less like a monarch than a tired, vulnerable old man standing in the rain, surrounded by conmen.Me’ekamui and Papaala would be “twin kingdoms”, Musingku announced, and would open a new Central Bank of Me’ekamui. He moved the U-Vistract headquarters to Tonu, where unpaid “helpers” brought him food, built homes, or did yard work. The whole thing was a farce – but still it threatened the legitimacy of the ABG. In April 2005, Musingku hired five Fijian mercenaries to protect him, and said that 800 more were on their way. “God has bigger plans for Bougainville and the region,” he wrote, “and no one can change or stop it from happening regardless of his education, position, power or authority.” It looked to anybody outside the no-go zone as if Ona and Musingku were preparing to take Bougainville by force.Then, late that July, Ona died at the age of 52. Some suspected foul play. Musingku declared that Ona had recently granted him control of Me’ekamui, and he quickly conscripted more than 200 people as security personnel, training them at Tonu under the Fijians. Musingku quickly grew into the role of mad king, spending entire days in his office hammering away at a laptop or talking on a satellite phone. His subjects lived by a strict regimen of fasting, church and military drills. Musingku would emerge only if accompanied by security, his helpers sweeping the ground before him. He would fast for long periods and, when he did eat, allowed only close family members to prepare his meals.In May 2006, the local police clashed with members of the Me’ekamui Defence Force and two of Musingku’s Fijians. The rebels reportedly stabbed a policeman and torched three police stations, and authorities captured two of Musingku’s lieutenants as they attempted to flee. “This is the beginning of more arrests to come to make sure at the end of the day we totally get U-Vistract out of Bougainville,” said the ABG leader, Joseph Kabui. Then, one November morning at about four o’clock, one of the Fijians, a former UN peacekeeper named Maloni Namoli, heard a dog bark around Tonu’s King Square. Moments later, a column of ex-BRA combatants and two police officers burst into the village and fired on Musingku’s royal guards. Amid the ensuing raid, the attackers reportedly killed four men and lost one of their own. Musingku tried to escape, but an M16 round tore through his jaw, spraying blood all over the floor of his royal office.According to Namoli, he grabbed the wounded king and sped into the surrounding jungle. He had feared the worst, but Musingku survived – and after around a month in hiding, he returned to his bamboo casbah, his battle scar serving as a symbol of the suffering that his people had endured in the war. ABG leaders denied they’d sanctioned the raid but had already lost credibility with the public. They had come for the king and missed. Worse yet, they had created a living martyr, a man convinced it was God’s plan for him to revive U-Vistract and lead Bougainville to independence. He hasn’t left Tonu since.In 2019, Bougainville held a referendum in which nearly 98% of voters chose independence. But Moresby has drawn the ABG into a legal battle since then, threatening not to ratify the poll’s results. The stalemate plays into the hands of the “U-Vistract faction”, as politicians have called Musingku’s rogue kingdom. In 2009, Musingku minted his own Bougainvillean kina to compete with the official Papua New Guinean kina, believing that whoever controls the currency controls the islands. He should also pay back his investors, I suggested. Mapah chimed in. “HM will come good,” he said, raising his eyebrows emphatically, a local tic. I began to ask another question, but he cut me off. “Yes,” he reiterated. The eyebrows remained motionless. “He’ll come good.”The skies above Arawa darkenedas we left town, and by the time we reached a roadblock at the border of the no-go zone a half hour later, rain was falling in ropes. Beneath a tarp on the side of the road, I paid sentries 300 kina (£57) for a Papaalan “visa”; it resembled a dry-cleaning ticket. We trundled over the mountain ridge soon after, the rains subsiding as we descended along a gravel track into Panguna. It is an eerie place. Vast factories and processing plants slumped into the earth, stripped bare like knotted jungle gyms. The pit itself extended almost to the horizon, its stepped ramparts sinking below the earth like an upturned pyramid.Beyond the mine, the road disappeared altogether, and we spent the remaining four or so hours crawling through wet, cleft tongues of mud. It was dark when we rolled into a tiny village that housed about 50 people in a dozen thatch residences. My audience with His Majesty would have to wait until tomorrow. Our accommodation for the meantime was a dilapidated guesthouse run by Philip Mapah, a grey-haired man with jaundiced eyes who had been U-Vistract’s long-serving finance minister, and his wife, who went only by “Missus”.I rose early the following morning. Mapah left for Tonu, a tattered satchel tucked under his arm like a Willy Loman of the tropics. Karrenna told me that we would be summoned to Papaala at any moment, but that HM had “his own priorities”. I told him that, as I’d travelled more than three days to meet him, I hoped I’d be one of them. He gave me a noncommittal nod. Lunch came and went.View image in fullscreenChildren of BRA guerillas arrive at the signing of the ceasefire agreement in Arawa on Bougainville in 1998.Photograph: Torsten Blackwood/AFP/Getty ImagesAround four o’clock, Karrenna returned and told me that we should have sent a slip of paper with Mapah, explaining the purpose of my visit to HM. I sulked. “You know,” he clucked, “people have been waiting 20 years, not just a few hours.” Nonetheless, he added, we should head down to the king’s headquarters and see if we could get lucky. I threw on a shirt and had sweat through it by the time we reached a roadblock beside a sign announcing the border of “Tonu City; Papaala Meekamui; Twin Kingdom; U Vistract protectorate; Ophir peace zone”. (Ophir is another name for Bougainville.) A wiry man of about 60, wearing dark fatigues, a wide-brimmed hat, and an MDF armband, beckoned me into the compound.It was now 5.30pm, and the sun was setting. The king was ready for me. Musingku, however, would not check my credentials until the internet came on at six. I had submitted them weeks ago, I told Karrenna, losing patience. Didn’t he see through all this? I asked him, unwisely. Had he himself invested in U-Vistract? “I’m not poor,” he snapped back. “I can eat.” All well and good, I replied, but it’s pretty rough to rob somebody’s home and then tell them they should feel lucky to have food. He bristled. “You cannot use that word,” he said. “I’m gonna let these guys know you said that. I think you wasted your time coming here. The king is busy. So I think it’s bad luck, the wrong timing.” His mouth curled into a snarl. I thought he might strike me. I backtracked, seeing that in Karrenna’s eyes I had finally become the duplicitous foreign hack bent on bad-mouthing HM that he’d suspected I was all along. I was saved by a bearded man with a clipboard whotold us that HM was ready, and that I’d have 30 minutes with him. It was dark now, and bugs tangoed in the halogen light of a small hut tucked behind a chainlink fence. Namoli escorted me through. I signed a guest book, removed my shoes and stepped into the king’s office.I had spent the past few months watching so many videos of Noah Musingku, reading about him, hearing of him from others, that when I finally entered the citadel of the Kingdom of Papaala and shook the hand of the short, smiling man before me, I was stunned into silence. The room was about the size of a studio apartment. Its walls were decorated with woven coconut leaves, canes, fans and other traditional items. Musingku’s Acer laptop sat at the centre of his desk, which was crowded with strange ornaments and gewgaws: potted plants, perfume jars, plastic bottles filled with scented oil, business cards, maps, loudspeakers, a globe, several smartphones and tablets, towers of well-thumbed paperwork, and stacks of illegal blue, green and purple Bougainvillean kina notes. The king’s throne was draped in a purple satin throw. Behind him was a plastic banner in blue and green that read, in what looked like Comic Sans, “HM King David Peii II Government of Bougainville Island”. Below it was the Papaalan flag, a more stylised version of the Bougainvillean one, with coloured rings and a rainbow and stars, and a clip-art-styleupe. The king smiled as I scanned the room in near disbelief.And here was Musingku himself. A little tighter in the belt than he was in the videos I’d played on repeat, his eyes were still wide and unyielding, half hidden beneath cowries that hung like bangs from a beaded crown that read “king” along the band and clacked quietly as he spoke. He smiled giddily the entire time and wore the red coat of an 18th-century British soldier, with a gold aiguillette and a powder-blue sash.He looked a little like a combination of Rick James and Adam Ant. Why the red coat? “Every country is ruled by someone,” Musingku told me. “We talk about a kingdom. A kingdom encompasses everybody – all religions are part of the kingdom, whether you are Muslim or Christian or Hindu.” A lot of answers went this way – wordy, with references to history and religion that might better have been summed up with a shrug. How, I asked him, did Papaala fit into Bougainville’s independence movement?“Everyone in Bougainville is fighting for independence – we’ve been fighting for it for the past 48 years,” he said. “But under the ABG it’s independence. Under Me’ekamui it’s sovereignty. There’s a big difference between independence and sovereignty. Independence: somebody grants it to you. Sovereignty is by declaration – you proclaim it, and you make it work. Just like the US became independent by its own declaration. England did not grant it to the US, sovereignty is under God almighty. Independence is at the UN.”The ABG’s protracted negotiations with Papua New Guinea were tantamount to litigating the terms of Bougainvilleans’ serfdom; no wonder Francis Ona had rejected them outright. Musingku described his relationship with Ona as “connecting the software and hardware” – the hardware of Ona’s no-go zone and the software of U-Vistract’s accounts. He told me that U-Vistract had 930,000 clients until Papua New Guinea shut it down. Nonetheless, “everyone invested” since then, he said, chuckling. “Even the ABG president invested.” (A spokesperson denied this.) Claims that U-Vistract was a Ponzi scheme or a cult, he told me, were simply born of ignorance. “It’s ready for me to just touch the trigger,” he said. “When we kick off, nothing will stop us.”Namoli, who had joined us, nodded approvingly. Karrenna hitched his phone to a tripod and filmed the scene. “Money answers all things,” he chirped. It was the happiest he’d looked the entire trip. I motioned to the piles of Bougainvillean kina: people had told me that Musingku was stealing gold from Panguna, I said. “We don’t need to dig it up,” he replied.Bougainville itselfis the reserve. “We don’t need to disturb it.”I asked Musingku whether he feareda repeat of the 2006 attack. He didn’t. “Everyone just wants payouts,” he told me. “When they get payouts, they will be united.” Nonetheless, he added, he would “not surrender” his claim to the islands, arguing that they should break the control of a global “serpentine system”. Musingku spoke in platitudes and riddles so plainly preposterous they were almost cleansed of meaning. I suppose this is part of the con; to pour on such grandiloquence that you convince everybody you’re a savant. Like a televangelist, say. Affinity fraud, experts call it: appealing to the commonality of religion, ethnicity or culture to squeeze money out of a huge number of people. Bernie Madoff did it. Noah Musingku does it, too – and he does it well.The next morning we headed back to Arawa. In the Land Cruiser I sat next to a middle-aged man named Thomas, who claimed he worked for the king, processing spreadsheets of investments in U-Vistract. He was concerned that Musingku hadn’t linked the system to Visa or Mastercard, meaning that Bougainvilleans couldn’t withdraw their funds. He added, exasperated, that the king had stolen gold. “Francis Ona gave him gold in 200-litre drums,” he said. “About four drums. Then he smuggled it overseas to Australia … he’s a bloody fucking millionaire, Noah Musingku.”It was hot when we reached the no-go-zone checkpoint, where I sat with its guard, a bald, 60-year-old man in wraparound sunglasses who introduced himself as Alex. He had worked the roadblock for decades – first for a limestone firm, then for Ona, and today for Musingku. He’d invested in U-Vistract “when it started”, he said. “Most of us who work here are investors.” He has eight kids. Musingku hasn’t paid him a kina in years. “But I still stay,” he said. “Because I believe we will come out in the end. If we move out without seeing what we fought for …” He trailed off, thumbing the visa I’d paid for a couple days earlier before clearing his throat. “I don’t have any doubts.”Karrenna and I parted the next day,and I returned up the coast to Buka. The independence process was faltering. That week, Papua New Guinea had declared that the 2019 referendum was nonbinding, prompting anger among ABG officials. (Last September, both parties agreed to fresh negotiations that would again be mediated by New Zealand.) I expected to find a town in the throes of nationalistic fervour, but it was a sleepy place, and few people wanted to discuss politics.Ishmael Toroama, who had been one of Francis Ona’s military commanders, became the ABG’s president in 2020 pledging to deliver independence and to vanquish corruption. More recently he has sought to reopen Panguna. Rio Tinto divested from the mine in 2016, reportedly leaving an Arabian-horse breeder, a former Australian government minister, and an American investment banker and novelist as its prospective saviours. Many Bougainvilleans fear that Panguna’s revival could rip open the cultural wounds that had precipitated the Crisis. But an independent Bougainvillean government would require an estimated quarter of a billion dollars to function, a sum nothing except the mine could come close to matching.Bougainville has become an unlikely pawn in the struggle between Washington and Beijing for hegemony in the Pacific. Papaala and the ABG “have to resolve and find a compromise”, Aloysius Laukai, the manager of a local radio station, told me. Otherwise, Bougainville could be “like North and South Korea”. James Tanis, too, frets that Musingku could join a growing archipelago of non-state actors, “like Houthis and Hamas … I’m not saying he’s dangerous now, but I’m worried about the potential. Because he has access to weapons. What if he decides to become a proxy for Iran? This man is about creating an alternative system to the western one. So in terms of doctrine and ideology, he’s already where the Iranians are.”It seemed to me that the ABG was caught in a double bind: try to liquidate Musingku again, and risk Papua New Guinea’s insisting that Bougainville isn’t ready for statehood; leave him untouched, and he just might contrive another scam or foment a violent secessionist movement. “To suggest that probably we’ll go and smoke him out,” Ezekiel Massat, the ABG’s attorney general, told me, “that’s not our intention. He’s a Bougainvillean. But we say his time will be up shortly. This scheme that he operates will die a natural death. All his brothers and the brothers’ wives and people who surrounded that king will slowly put him out.”The incredible plan to make money grow on trees | Sam KnightRead moreTanis wasn’t so sure. He’d never come across anybody who was “dead against” the king, he said. “Noah Musingku did not hold them at gunpoint and take their money; they invested because of their own greed.”Why hadn’t one of U-Vistract’s conned investors tried to kill him? I asked. People have died in Bougainville for far less.“Killing him will shut the door that they ever get paid,” said Tanis. “Keeping him alive continues to keep the hope alive.”After I left Bougainville, I continued my conversations with Musingku. He impressed upon me his belief that he wasn’t a danger to the ABG or Bougainville, and that everyone should work together – that U-Vistract would be the software to Papaala’s hardware, as it were. In January last year, a U-Vistract source leaked to me a letter from Musingku to the ABG that proved he’d kept at his scam. “I have heard that there are outstanding bills and invoices owed by the ABG to our lovely citizens, service providers, business houses, institutions, schools, hospitals, etc,” Musingku wrote in the missive, “dating back to many years and worth many millions”.Please, compile and send to my Crown Administration a complete list of their names, companies, nature of payment and the amounts owed. My office will immediately instruct the Governor of CBOB (Central Bank of Bougainville) to release the needed funds as a priority. […] Note that although PNG banks ceased dealing with cheques at the end of December 2023 under IMF instructions, our sovereign banks are not affected in any way. I now look forward to your prompt response so we can together address and resolve the manifold cries, worries, sufferings and lamentation of our people soonest.Yours Sincerely,HM King David Peii Upeii 2ndA longer version of this piece appeared inHarper’sListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere."

Illustration: Angelica Alzona/Guardian DesignHarrowing story of ‘ES’, fleeing persecution to seek safety in US, shines light on judges who grant claims at exceptionally low rates – or not at allByMaanvi Singh,Andrew WitherspoonandWill CraftThu 6 Mar 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 14.31 ESTShareAt an immigration court in Pearsall, Texas, in front of a judge, government attorneys and a court interpreter, “ES” shakily recounted the darkest moments of his life.He explained how he had been arrested seven years earlier inTurkey, amid his government’s crackdown on followers of the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen. The police officers who detained him accused him of being involved in a terrorist movement and demanded he reveal the names of his associates, he said.When he refused, he told the judge, the officers brutally beat him with a stick and raped him. “The first time they did it, I passed out,” he said.The officers made him smell something to revive him, he told the judge, and then proceeded to torture him again. They did so, over and over, for three days. That was only the beginning.“In the events that followed, my whole life went upside down,” said ES, whom the Guardian is identifying by only his initials to protect his safety and the safety of his family.ES told the court he served 25 months in prison, and continued to be abused and denied access to medical treatment. He was told to strip naked for the guards, and was beaten if he did not comply fast enough.Once he was released, he tried for a while to piece his life back together. His wife – who worked for the government – had filed for divorce, fearing that she would become implicated by association. He struggled to find ways to keep seeing his children – twins who were quickly growing up in his absence. He found he had been blacklisted in his industry, and couldn’t find work. So he moved in with his parents, and took up a job delivering milk.Nearly three years later, authorities charged him again, saying he had been spotted speaking to known Gülenists.“I understood that I was not safe, my life was not safe there, so I had to leave,” he told the court.Minutes after ES finished his testimony, the immigration judge, Veronica Marie Segovia, told him she would be denying his request for asylum.His attorneys were flabbergasted. It was one of the strongest asylum cases they had ever seen in their careers.The Guardian analyzed 25 years of asylum application decisions across the US, and found that Segovia grants asylum at an exceptionally low rate.Since she was appointed as a judge in November 2023, Segovia has denied more than 100 asylum applications, granting asylum in a single case. It is one of the lowest rates among the more than 800 judges who have presided over more than 100 asylum applications each.A cluster of khaki colored dots with one larger dot in redUsing data from the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR), the Department of Justice agency that interprets and administers federal immigration laws, the Guardian analyzed cases where immigration judges could either grant or deny asylum, excluding cases that were withdrawn or otherwise concluded before a judge could reach a final decision. On average, judges granted 38% of asylum applications, the analysis showed. Some judges, like Segovia, granted asylum in less than 5% or 10%.An earlieranalysisby Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse found two judges who denied 100% of cases they heard between 2019 and 2024.Immigration judges, who are appointed by the US attorney general, can wield incredible power over asylum seekers’ fates. Those who are denied asylum by judges have narrow options to appeal against their cases, and few are able to afford legal fees to cover the lengthy process.But a November 2024analysisby legal researchers of asylum cases published in the Boston College Law Review found that immigration judge decisions often “bore little resemblance to what we have come to expect in a reasoned judicial ruling”, and that they “frequently rested on factual and legal errors, poor legal analysis, and/or express illustrations of bias”. In an examination of more than 500 immigration judge decisions, the authors found examples of speculation, overt bias against applicants or “vague or incomprehensible analysis” of laws and policies.Researchers found that judges who had previously worked in immigration enforcement – including as attorneys for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) – had higher denial rates, and that male judges tended to deny asylum at greater rates overall than women.Immigration judges are meant to be impartial interpreters of the law. But administrations tend to promote and appoint judges who reflect certain biases – the first Trump administration, for example, filled the ranks of the immigration courts with judges who, as a whole, have disproportionately ordered deportation, according to a Reutersanalysis.“There’s no way to justify this as being fair when you have such an extreme difference in outcomes for asylum seekers, based not on anything about the law, but based on the background of the judge,” said Karen Musalo, a founding director of the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies and the Refugee and Human Rights Clinic at University of California College of the Law in San Francisco, and one of the authors of the review.Lawyers told the Guardian they try to keep track of which judges and courts have the highest denial rates, and try – when they can – to move their clients’ cases to more favorable venues.“It’s quite glaringly obvious that there’s a huge range in discretion in adjudicating cases,” said Ruby Powers, a Texas-based immigration attorney.Segovia had previouslyservedas an assistant chief counsel with the office of the principal legal adviser with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in San Antonio. She had also served as assistant district attorney in Bexar county, Texas, and privately practiced criminal defense law.The Guardian was unable to reach Segovia via email or phone numbers that were publicly listed. A spokesperson for the EOIR, Kathryn Mattingly, said the agency “does not comment on third-party reporting of EOIR data”.“Asylum cases typically include complex legal and factual issues, and each case is unique with its own set of facts, supporting evidence, and circumstances that may affect the outcome of the case,” Mattingly said in a statement. “Immigration judges consider all evidence and arguments that the parties present and make determinations and issue decisions in accordance withUS immigrationlaws, regulations, and precedent decisions.”ES had no idea about the judge’s background before he appeared before her in court, recounting to her the memories he had tried to bury in the deepest part of his brain. When he first heard her decision, he wondered if he was misunderstanding due to the language barrier. “I thought it was a dream. I thought it was a nightmare,” he said. “I thought: ‘I’m going to wake up. I’m going to wake up.’”His lawyers, Seda Yildiz and Bryan Johnson, were struggling to understand the decision as well. DHS had filed a letter saying the agency did not oppose granting ES asylum, writing that it was of the opinion that he “has established his eligibility for the requested relief and that it should be granted as a matter of discretion”.“I really wish the court had taken the time to read my brief because, yeah, it didn’t appear that judge did in the oral decision,” said Johnson. “This respondent really should be free right now because he’s a refugee.”Segovia was unconvinced. She said that while the rape and torture ES endured was terrible, “the court does not find that this was based upon or motivated by his political opinion”. His treatment, she continued, “was based on the fact that they identified the respondent as part of a terrorist organization that they were attempting to bring forward for prosecution and possibly imprisonment for the attempted coup that led to much bloodshed in Turkey”.To ES and his lawyers, the decision seemed to fully ignore the geopolitical context of his situation.In Turkey, the Gülen movement had attracted legions of followers who were drawn to Fethullah Gülen’s Sufi-inspired vision of Islam, and its emphasis on charity and education. “It represented Islam in a way that is far from radical,” said ES, who started to attend meetings alongside his friends and family, and eventually began volunteering time to fundraise for the movement’s educational and social aid programs in Africa.The movement’s founder, however, was a complicated figure. He had fled Turkey after the country’s old secular elite accused him of trying to overthrow the state in 1999, and he sought refuge in Pennsylvania, where he lived in self-imposed exile until his death last year. For a while, he was a close ally of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, until the two had a falling out.When a faction of the Turkish military coordinated a coup in 2016, Erdoğan assiduously blamed Gülen, though details of the coup and Gülenists’ involvement remain unclear. Gülen denied any connection to the coup attempt, and the US declined to extradite the cleric to Turkey. Still, Erdoğan declared the Gülenist movement a terrorist organization, and immediately instituted a purge of its followers – which international observers including the US have said resulted in massivehuman rights violations. Thousands of teachers, academics, government officials and journalists were among the Turkish citizensarrested– often based on vague, arbitrary charges.The US state department has said that it does not consider the Gülen movement a terrorist group.View image in fullscreenPolice officers take into custody people arrested because of suspected links to Gülen, in Kayseri, Turkey, in 2017.Photograph: Olcay Duzgun/AP“I have never held a weapon in my life,” ES said. “I did not take part in an organization to hurt anyone in my life.”Yet it felt as if the judge was saying he deserved the way he had been treated by Turkish authorities, he said. She conceded that the rape and beatings had been bad, but said his treatment thereafter had been “not as bad” – suggesting that what he experienced wasn’t quite torture. “She made it seem like a very light event,” he said.And she told him his imprisonment amounted to “lawful sanctions” for crimes.ES said he still doesn’t understand what exactly Turkish authorities accused him of doing. The first time he was arrested and accused of being part of a terrorist movement, the evidence authorities pointed at was the money he had been raising for the Gülen movement’s charity programs.ES’s lawyers have appealed his case. But his path to asylum now is exceedingly narrow.Members of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) are often promoted from the ranks of the immigration courts, and some have recordsof rejectingmost of the asylum applications they review. In 2020, the American Immigration Council filed alawsuitseeking information about hiring procedures for BIA members afterreportsthat judges with skewed denial rates were being promoted.Last month, Law360reportedthat the EOIR had moved to reduce the number of BIA members from 28 to 15. Among those dismissed were nine members appointed by the Biden administration. The EOIR declined to confirm or deny whether BIA judges had been let go.Attorneys and advocates worry that an implicit threat of being removed could pressure the remaining BIA members to take harsher stances on asylum cases. After George W Bush’s attorney general, John Ashcroft, enacted a purge of the BIA in 2002, the board’s decisions dramatically shifted. “We started to see restricted decision-making happening not just in asylum but across all immigration petitions,” said Blaine Bookey, legal director at the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies at UC Law San Francisco. “We’re now seeing that threat again.”If appealing to the BIA doesn’t work, ES and his team could appeal to the federal court. In rare cases, asylum issues are escalated to the supreme court. But the appeals process could take years. Most asylum seekers are unable to afford to pay the legal fees required to keep fighting for their cases. For many who are in detention, the prospect of remaining – indefinitely – in custody while the courts hear their cases is too much.Still, ES remains hopeful. “The ruling that the judge made does not bring down my faith in the US justice system. I still believe that American justice will correct this mistake,” he said.ES’s brother, who had also been arrested and detained on similar charges, went to Germany, where he has since gained asylum. But ES said he thought he would have a better chance of finding safety in the US.When he left Turkey, he told no one, slipping out in the middle of the night. Because Turkey had canceled his passport, he had to slip out through his country’s border with Greece, eventually making his way throughEuropeand then Mexico.In August 2024, he arrived at the US border, and used the CBP One app to make an appointment to claim asylum. “I want to make clear that I entered the US legally,” he said. “Without breaking any laws.”He has been in detention ever since.View image in fullscreenThe privately run South Texas detention center in Pearsall, Texas.Photograph: Eric Gay/APHe’s able to occasionally speak with his twins on video call – though he cannot bring himself to tell them where he is or what has happened to him. “I’ve told them I’m in an immersive educational program of some sort,” he said. He’s pretty sure they don’t believe him – they’re teenagers now, and old enough to know better. Eventually, when he can see them in person, he’ll sit them down and explain everything. “This will hurt their hearts,” he said. “I want to be in physical proximity enough to hug them when it hurts.”In past months, he has rarely gotten a full night’s sleep. He has felt uneasy around people in a uniform ever since he was first arrested. “It doesn’t have to be the police. It could be a security guard in the mall,” he said. Now he’s constantly surrounded by uniformed officers, including those who stand guard through the night in the dorm of about 100 people where he is being held.On the days when the officer on the night shift is a man, he feels especially panicked – and his mind flashes back to the two policemen who abused him. “I know that the same thing will not happen here, because there’s cameras everywhere, it’s monitored. But this fear does not hesitate to penetrate me,” he said. He paces around the dorms, though the night, for four or five hours, until his body begins to feel so weak he is physically unable to remain awake. It’s only when the guards are women that he’s able to rest a bit.A psychologist he saw while in custody suggested sleeping pills, but he declined the prescription. He didn’t want to be unconscious, and lose his vigilance. Someday soon, he hopes, he’ll be able to rest – alone – in a bed and a room that’s all his own.And he wants to kiss the twins, once on each of their cheeks, “just how they like”.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTurkeyEuropeHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Low-rise family homes with small gardens alternate with meadows and fields and life has the sedate pace of a provincial town.Anold lighthousenow lies in ruins and not far away is thedarsena deibilancioni, the beach that takes its name from the stilt houses, orbilancioni, once used for fishing.But this coastal spot at the mouth of the Tiber River is at the centre of a controversy threatening its future tranquility. It is the intended site of a new port called Fiumicino Waterfront, a joint venture between the cruise company Royal Caribbean and the British investment fundIcon Infrastructure.Local authorities support the project because they believe it will bring in tourism, but many grassroots groups oppose it because of the impact they think it will have on the marine environment.View image in fullscreenGianfranco ‘Attila’ Miconi by hisbilancione. ‘This is a lovely place,’ he says. ‘If it looks degraded it’s because authorities never took care of it.’Photograph: Victor Sokolowicz/The Guardian“The lighthouse and thebilancioniare a natural film set. Actors like Charlize Theron, Andy Garcia andUma Thurmanhave come here,” says Gianfranco Miconi, who is nicknamed Attila.He is a retired 72-year-old who, for the past 30 years, has been living in and renovating one of the stilt houses now threatened with demolition. “This is a lovely place,” he says. “If it looks degraded, it’s because authorities never took care of it.”For many years the area has been unloved. In 2010, plans were signed off for the construction of what would have been the largest marina in the Mediterranean, comprising four large docks, a hotel and convention centre, commercial spaces and luxury flats.But two years later, the developer, Francesco Bellavista Caltagirone, wasarrested for fraud(he waslater acquitted) and the project was abandoned for another decade.Then, three years ago, the landwas boughtby Royal Caribbean for €12m (£10m). It later sold 90% of its holding to Icon, with permission to transform the port into a facility specifically for cruise ships.Now, as well as berths for hundreds of smaller boats, there will be one dock for Oasis-class cruise liners, which were the world’s largest and longest passenger ships until 2023. At 72 metres high, they are twice the height of Fiumicino’s lighthouse and can carry up to 5,000 passengers.“They say this port will bring work,” says Giancarlo Petrelli, a retired engineer who is part of theTables of the Port, a group of local associations that has been fighting the development plans since 2010. “But in these cases the sailors are not hired locally and the tourists won’t be interested in Fiumicino, but in Rome.This is the most beautiful place in the world and I have no intention of leaving unless I am deadGianfranco Miconi“Does no one think about the traffic and pollution generated by 5,000 people going to and from Rome?”There is already a port that serves Rome –Civitavecchia– but the new facility will provide extra capacity for the cruise industry.Petrelli also worries about the impact on coastal erosion. The most significant legacy of the original port plan is an 800-metre-long breakwater. This altered the currents by taking sand from the beaches of Focene and Fregene, which lie just north of Isola Sacra.“The breakwater has altered the marine ecosystem,” he says. “Now there’s only sand, but in the past there used to be shellfish, such astellins, and octopuses.”View image in fullscreenAn impression of how the Fiumicino cruise port in Isola Sacra would look when it is finished.Illustration: Fiumicino WaterfrontFiumicino’s waters are shallow: to make room for large ships, developers would need to extract more than 3m cubic metres of sand. About a third of it will be used to replenish the beaches in Fregene and Focene,according to the project plans.Federica Giunta, an anthropologist who lives in Fiumicino and belongs to theCollettivo No Portoprotest group, is concerned that the breakwater would have to be extended to 1,200 metres. On top of that, she says, “the entire coastline will be cemented over, since a separateport to house the fishing fleetis being built not far away”.For Pietro Spirito, former president of theCentral Tyrrhenian Sea Authorityand professor at Rome’s Mercatorum University, the issue is not so much the port itself but its ownership.Although it is not uncommon for cruise lines to own land where they dock, these are usuallysmall private islandsor beaches. “An island is one thing; being 20km from the capital of Italy is another,” he says. “The precedent that would be set would leave other companies free to create their private stopovers inside public places.”View image in fullscreenGiancarlo Petrelli at Isola Sacra. ‘The breakwater has altered the marine ecosystem,’ says the retired engineer.Photograph: Victor Sokolowicz/The GuardianOpponents of the scheme are holding on to some hope. The Italian government included the project among theprogramme of works for the Catholic jubilee year, a celebration that happens once every quarter-century and runs until January 2026. Yet building has yet to begin, held up by further assessments and objections.Nevertheless, Royal Caribbean plans to have some ships visit by November, the company says. The idea is to have them anchor off the coast and thenbring passengers ashore in smaller boats.Defending its plans, a spokesperson for Fiumicino Waterfront said it believed the port would “provide a solution for a real need”. The company saidItalyneeded more berths for tourist ships and the port infrastructure in Lazio, the region around Rome, “lags behind in quality and quantity of offerings compared with its main competitor, the Barcelona terminal”.‘I feel guilty and angry’: the captain turned campaigner trying to keep cruise ships at bayRead moreThe spokesperson added that the project would employ about 7,000 people – 2,000 in constructing the port and 5,000 when the work was completed. They said that only one cruise ship at a time would be allowed to dock in Fiumicino and to reduce emissions the ships would connect to the onshore electricity supply rather than using the diesel generators that typically power moored cruise ships.Mario Baccini, mayor of Fiumicino, views the new port as a “historic opportunity, which will change the city for the better and at no cost to the municipality”. He believes the town will become a “nerve centre of tourism”.Cruise ships, he says, will dock for “less than 50% of the days of the year”, adding that the “real risk is not the ships, but not having the full potential that Fiumicino has”.View image in fullscreenThe old lighthouse area of Isola Sacra, where Royal Caribbean plans to build the first large privately managed tourist port in Italy.Photograph: Victor Sokolowicz/The GuardianBack on the beach in Isola Sacra, sunset is approaching and Attila stops to look out of the window of his stilt house.“I don’t know anything about bureaucracy,” he says. “I just know that this is the most beautiful place in the world and I have no intention of leaving unless I am dead.”This article was amended on 6 March 2025 because an earlier version said that the proposed port would have two docks for Oasis-class cruise liners. In fact, it will have one.Explore more on these topicsThe real cost of cruisesCruisesHeritageItalyEuropeEndangered habitatsMarine lifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dannatt was cleared of any wrongdoing on the previous occasion.0:28Lord Dannatt says he would 'make a point of getting to know' the relevant minister – videoExperts feel Dannatt’s comments in the latest secret recording represent a “clear breach” of the rules that prevent peers from lobbying.These rulesban members of the Lords from contacting ministers, officials, MPs or other peers on behalf of paying clients. This means, for example, that they cannot connect or introduce those clients to members of the government.Dannatt, 74, said he did not agree that his conduct had broken Lords rules and added: “I am well aware of […] the Lords code of conduct […] I have always acted on my personal honour.”Conflict of interest?The findings follow revelations about the involvement ofLord Evans of Watford,a Labour peer, in what appears toamount to a cash-for-access venture.It is part of a project by the Guardian,the Lords debate, examining the role of the House of Lords and the conduct of its members, at a time when the government is proposing to reform the upper chamber.The project has found that nearly 100 peers werepaid to give political adviceby commercial companies, amid concerns that their activities are not being properly regulated.Democracy campaigners question whether peers should be allowed to act as political advisers to businesses and lobbying companies,as they say there is an inherent conflict of interest in working for a commercial concern while also serving as a legislator in parliament.To test whether the Lords rules were preventing peers from lobbying, the undercover reporters posed as property developers who were seeking to convert high street department stores into a mixture of flats and shops, and who wanted to have their voice heard in government.The Guardian approached peers who already seemed to work for clients where there could be a conflict. In total, 11 peers were asked if they would join an advisory board to help the fictional company “better understand the political landscape and make the introductions both within government and the opposition”. The email contained what should have been a red flag.Six peers did not respond or declined the offer. Two others responded but did not meet; one of them said they were unsure as they would have to check whether making such introductions was within the rules. The other would only attend if their lawyer was present.Do you have information about this story? Email henry.dyer@theguardian.com, or (using a non-work phone) use Signal or WhatsApp to message +44 7721 857348.Three peers agreed to meet the property developers. One said he did not think the developers needed political advice and made it clear that he could not lobby for them. A second also said he could not lobby, and after the meeting he emailed to reject the offer, saying he had consulted the Lords rules. He added that he could not establish the bona fides of the property developers.The third peer to meet the fictionaldevelopers was Dannatt. He became a member of the Lords in 2011, after38 years in the British armywhere he rose to the top job, chief of the general staff. Headvised the Conservative partywhen David Cameron was leader of the opposition.During his time in the Lords, Dannatt has been adirector and adviserto a series of companies, and he has recently been employed by a lobbying business to advise the Armenian government on how to develop warmer relations with Britain.‘Rub shoulders’At an online meeting set up after Dannatt agreed to meet the fictional property company, the undercover reporters described how they were concerned that the Labour government could change planning and tax rules that had been introduced by the previous administration. They said they wanted to make connections and get introductions within the government so they could better understand the situation.Immediately,Dannatt made it clear he had to work within the rules. He said: “I have to keep myself scrupulously above board to make sure that what I’m doing is declared and is well above board and not below board.”He said he was willing to help if he believed it was “widely in the national interest”.Emphasising that he would need to be transparent about the fact he was working for a commercial company, he then went on to explain how he could make introductions.The undercover reporters first asked if he would be able to make a connection within local councils. Relaxing into the discussion, Dannatt said: “Without any guarantees that I could magically open doors, one could probably help facilitate a conversation.”He went on to explain that he would be more able to make the right connections within parliament. “Where I’m better placed, is, particularly as you’re concerned that the current government might be thinking of changing legislation … is to quite easily see who the minister in the House of Lords is that deals with these things, who I may or may not know, because I don’t know who it is, but I can easily arrange to meet them.”0:54Lord Dannatt says he could 'easily arrange to meet' the relevant minister in the House of LordsHe was asked if he could help facilitate a meeting with a minister. He replied: “Yes, I mean, depending who the minister is and what the commercial plans were, I don’t see why they would not wish, if it was consistent with government policy or what you thought government policy might be if they were persuaded, why they wouldn’t want to have that meeting.”Dannatt later explained how he may be able to find out if changes were being proposedthat could affect the company. “Well, again, the first thing I would need to do is to find out who the minister in the House of Lords was who was responsible,” he said. “If it was ideally someone I knew, I could have an opening conversation. If it was someone I didn’t know, I’d make a point of getting to know them and then having that conversation.”He also told the reporters he did not think it would be very difficult for him because “the House of Lords … that’s the house I inhabit. And that’s where I can easily rub shoulders with people.”He said he could possibly make introductions in the Commons too, adding that if the specific issue of converting former retail premises to residential accommodation came up he could find out who had responsibility for it.He explained that if the minister in the Lords told him that responsibility lay with the minister who sat in the Commons, “there’s no reason why I can’t then say to him: ‘Well, those who I’m working with would very much like a meeting with Mr John Smith if he’s the minister for housing.’”To illustrate how he could help the fictional property company, Dannatt described how he had previously helped a client with an introduction to a minister.He raised the subject of a major hydroelectric plant in Sierra Leone. This was a reference to a project developed by an energy firm, Joule Africa, towhich Dannatt has been anadviser since 2011.He said: “I introduced them to the then minister for Africa and that got them an introduction into the British government and to the high commission in Freetown in Sierra Leone and they’ve gone forward from there.”He added: “I was able to do that, but I made it quite clear that the basis of this was a commercial undertaking, but I thought it was worthwhile and reasonable and therefore I was prepared to help them.”Dannatt said later in response to questions from the Guardian that he had taken it on because he felt it was a good venture that would help Sierra Leone. He said he had been given a “modest shareholding” and had personally invested in it.1:16Lord Dannatt explains how he had previously introduced a client to a relevant minister – video‘Clear breach’Throughout the conversation with the undercover reporters,Dannatt emphasised that he would need to declare the client he was working with in any dealings with ministers. “Provided in any conversation I declare what my interest is, then I can report that back,” he said.He further emphasised this in his formal response to the Guardian. “I said at the outset that I need to be transparent in anything that I did for a commercial company,” he said.He added that he felt he had been a target of a deliberate sting that set out to entrap him. He said that if he had taken up the role, he would have included it in his entry of interests in the House of Lords register.However, the rules governing the conduct of peers state they are banned from lobbying ministers, which includes introducing clients with commercial interests, regardless of whether they declare that they are being paid.Dr Jonathan Rose, a political integrity expert at De Montfort University who reviewed the evidence, said it was clear Dannatt was trying to be open and transparent, but Rose felt Dannatt’s conduct was a “very clear breach” of the Lords rules.Rose said he felt the investigation raised wider, “more important” questions for the House of Lords about how well peers understood the rules. “This seems to highlight a potentially systemic issue that there are members of the Lords who do not have a clear understanding of the rules, and the house needs to immediately address this,” he said.During the covert recording with the Guardian’s undercover reporters, Dannatt said: “I’m assuming you’re not inviting me to do this pro bono … I do quite a lot of things pro bono. But this is – my understanding is a strictly commercial conversation.”He declined to answer when asked how much he would charge on a daily basis. But when payment of between £1,800 to £2,800 a day was suggested, he replied: “Per day. Yeah, that’s a ballpark I recognise.”As part of the conversation about payment, Dannatt again referred to “a similar conversation” he had with what turned out to be undercover reporters from the Sunday Times in 2012.On that occasion, the Sunday Times reporters approached Dannatt and other top-ranking retired military officers pretending to represent a South Korean defence company. According to the Sunday Times, Dannatt agreed to lobby the Ministry of Defence to promote the South Korean company for an annual fee.Dannattdenieddoing anything wrong and wascleared in 2013by the Lords authorities who ruled there was “no evidence that he had used his position to exercise parliamentary influence for personal gain, or to provide parliamentary advice or services”.As the discussions with the Guardian undercover reporters drew to a close,Dannatt said he was not committing himself to becoming an adviser. He wanted to get some more information, he said, and was prepared to meet again after that.Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsThe Lords debateRichard DannattnewsShareReuse this content"

When he got a place at an award-winning ‘sanctuary’ in London, it sounded perfect. The reality was shockingly differentSimon HattenstoneThu 6 Mar 2025 00.00 ESTShareJude Black was delighted when her son, Joe, moved into Holmes Road Studios in Camden, northLondon. This wasn’t any old homelessness hostel. It had just won an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and it looked gorgeous.The 59 refurbished studio flats had en suite bathrooms and were designed around a courtyard garden. Joe was allocated No 21. Each studio was distinguished by a colourful front door – blue, brown, orange, green, red, turquoise. The rustic-looking brickwork gleamed in the sun and a stylish porthole window lit up the mezzanine bed space.Peter Barber Architects, which designed Holmes Road, referred to the studio flats as cottages and envisaged the inhabitants transforming the place into a horticultural paradise. “We imagine a group of residents working with a gardener to create and maintain an intensely planted and beautiful garden,” statedthe project’s manifesto. “There would be an apple tree or two, potatoes, green veg, soft fruit, herbs, a greenhouse, a potting shed and a sunny spot to sit and rest. We think there ought to be a little room/shed in the garden for private chats (1:1) and counselling.”View image in fullscreenAn artist’s impression of Holmes Road Studios in north London, where Joe lived for two years.Photograph: Peter Barber ArchitectsHolmes Road, in the constituency of the prime minister, Keir Starmer, was created for single homeless people with support needs. A citation for the RIBA award stated that the hostel provided counselling, education and training spaces. After a maximum of two years in this temporary accommodation, residents would hopefully progress to independent living. Holmes Road was called a sanctuary.Jude felt Joe would be shielded from danger here. Holmes Road rigorously asserted its zero‑tolerance drug policy. If lucky enough to be offered a place, residents had to promise not to take drugs on the premises – and, ideally, not at all. This was vital for Joe, because he was vulnerable, with a dual diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and a substance use disorder. In his previous flat, he had been cuckooed – drug dealers moved in, took over and used the place as an office. It was terrifying and traumatising for Joe. Now more than ever, he needed the promised sanctuary.Two years after moving into Holmes Road, Joe was found dead, slumped over his kitchen table, surrounded by drug paraphernalia. He was 39.Joseph Forbes Black was a gifted musician and composer. His specialism was bass guitar; he passed grade 8 with the highest mark in the country. He was adored by his family – Jude, a special needs teacher; his father, Andy Forbes, who has been the principal of a number of further education colleges; and his two sisters and baby niece. He was quiet, sensitive, loving, smart and troubled.It’s October 2023, two months after Joe died. Jude and I meet in a cafe in north London, close to where she lives. Her black hair is swept into a ponytail. She looks gaunt and distraught. Jude shows me pictures of Joe. “This is him as a little boy. And that’s him holding his niece – his elder sister’s baby. He was so looking forward to watching her grow up.” It sets her off. “So many beautiful photos,” she says, through tears.She moves on to photos of his flat after he was found. It’s filthy. Jude believed he would get help keeping his place tidy. After all, this was supported accommodation with the aim of helping people back to independent living. She tells me the hob wasn’t working, so he couldn’t cook. “He was living in squalor. He wasn’t edging in the direction of living independently – he was deteriorating.”As a young boy, Joe was outgoing, loving and hugely popular. He was obsessed with music and it was obvious from an early age that he was gifted. “He used to say: ‘Music keeps me alive, Mum,’” says Jude. At seven, he was playing baby bass at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. He went on to write, produce and record music under the name Nexus 23 and graduated with a degree in creative music production and business before starting a master’s in music at the Institute of Contemporary Music Performance in London.Jude and Andy split up in 1990 when Joe was seven, but remained friends, committed to doing the best for their two children. After their separation, Jude moved with the kids to Oxford, where they lived for 10 years, then to Brighton. She had another daughter, Georgia.View image in fullscreenBy seven, Joe was playing at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester.In his statement to the coroner, Andy said he became aware of Joe’s illness when his son was in his late teens. “I drove to Brighton to bring Joe to stay with me in Manchester. His flat and clothes were filthy; he was talking nonsense and showing clear signs of psychosis.” Andy was familiar with the symptoms. “There is a strong history of psychotic mental illness in the Forbes family,” he told the coroner.Joe was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. As this became more debilitating, his drug and alcohol use became more problematic. Jude says he was self-medicating. The outgoing boy became an introverted, self-conscious man. The older he was, the younger he behaved. Joe would often tell Jude how much he struggled with life as an adult. He sent her a message saying: “I wish I was a baby so I could live my life over again.”His health deteriorated in his 20s and he became more paranoid. He told Jude and Andy that he didn’t believe they were his true parents and that he was descended from Egyptian royalty. He struggled with frightening delusions and hallucinations, which only made him feel more isolated. Joe sent Jude messages saying: “Mum, I have a terrible mental illness,” and: “Mum, I am monumentally depressed.” He believed he was the target of racism, that everyone hated him and that he had no friends.Joe struggled with identity. He loved his mixed heritage, but it also confused him. He wasn’t sure who he was or where he belonged. Jude is white and Jewish (she lost relatives in the Holocaust); Andy is Anglo-Irish and half Jamaican. Joe was equally confused by class. His family had done well for themselves through education (Andy’s father had been one of Britain’s first black GPs) and Joe couldn’t place himself. “He’d say to me: ‘Am I a posh boy, Mum?’ And then he’d say: ‘Am I a Gypsy?’ because people told him he looked like a Gypsy.”Jude laughs when she talks about his fixation with their poshness. “My grandfather worked in a coat factory in Manchester. His parents moved to Manchester from the pogroms and they had a horse and cart. We weren’t posh!”Another thing Joe really got wrong was that he wasn’t liked. People adored him, Jude says. Even at his most deluded, “he had such empathy for people and wanted to help them if they were struggling”.In 2011, he went missing for 18 months. Even now, Jude finds it traumatic to discuss. “I would look at people sleeping in doorways and on the streets and wonder if they might be Joe. Every day, I thought he might be dead.” After he was found, Joe was sectioned for almost four months.View image in fullscreenJoe with his mother, Jude Black.Over the next few years, he lived in a series of bedsits and flats in Brent, north-west London. He often neglected himself physically and struggled to look after his home. When he left hospital, he was discharged to the Brent community mental health team and allocated a care coordinator to make sure he attended his medical appointments and coped with life as well as possible. Jude speaks positively of the mental health team that looked after Joe in these years. When she raised concerns about him, his care coordinators told her it was helpful to have the family involved, because it meant the professionals could do their job more effectively. She would be invited to review appointments with Joe’s psychiatrist and care coordinator, where they would discuss his care plan. “Joe was comforted that we were all working together to monitor and support him,” she says.In June 2020, Joe moved to a bedsit in Camden and was transferred to Camden community mental health team. Jude says they made it clear they didn’t want her input. She felt they regarded her as an interfering busybody. When she discovered Joe had not been given a care coordinator, she contacted north Camden rehabilitation and recovery team to express her concern, because she knew how dependent he had been on previous care coordinators. Joe was in acute distress, telling Jude he “would be better off dead”. Jude says the manager insisted Joe’s main issue was substance misuse, not mental illness, whereas at Brent it was accepted that he took drugs to self-medicate and a dual diagnosis qualified him for a care coordinator.It was 2021 when Joe was cuckooed. Jude remembers how petrified he was when he called her. “He was very agitated and sounded very frightened. He said: ‘I’m lucky to be alive, Mum.’” He told her the dealers had put a gun to his head and ordered him to empty his bank account. He didn’t know how long they had been occupying the flat, but he said he had managed to escape. Joe told her he had used heroin and crack while being cuckooed, instead of ketamine and cannabis.The manager admitted to me the place is full of drug addicts. How am I supposed to change in a hostel full of drug addicts?He withdrew from his master’s in north-west London, because the police told him it wasn’t safe to return to the area, and presented as homeless to Camden council. On 19 July 2021, a few weeks later, he was given an emergency placement at Holmes Road. When Jude looked it up, she thought it sounded perfect. But Joe was not convinced. He told her someone had offered to sell him crack there on the first day. She thought that might be his illness talking, or that he was trying to alarm her so she would agree to him living elsewhere.She felt trapped. He was not capable of looking after himself in independent accommodation and she was not equipped to look after him at home. Holmes Road offered supported living. Surely he would be safest there? On 23 July 2021, Joe messaged her to say: “This place is full of crack addicts”; “I despise this place”; “It is like a prison.” Three days later, he left the hostel with all his belongings and went to stay in a friend’s flat. He told Jude he had left because “it is hell on earth for me”.Jude was terrified he would lose his placement and go missing again. She told him to go back, otherwise he would not be rehoused. “I didn’t want him ending up on the streets. He was so vulnerable,” Jude says.She is able to document Joe’s last years so comprehensively because she kept virtually every text, email and WhatsApp sent from and to Joe and those responsible for his care.She was still convinced Holmes Road had to be better than the dilapidated rented accommodation in which he had been living; here, he would have one-to-one support with specialist staff. If things went well, Jude believed, he would be helped back to independent living. Another advantage was that the hostel was opposite Kentish Town police station. Holmes Road management said any drug dealing on the premises was immediately reported to the police.In September 2021, Joe texted Jude to tell her he had been offered a full-time place at Holmes Road. She told him how pleased she was and asked what his room was like. “Shit,” Joe replied. “The manager admitted to me the place is full of drug addicts. How am I supposed to change in a hostel full of drug addicts?” Joe expressed his worries that he could “end up addicted to hard drugs again”. “Can’t you see this hostel is going to murder me?” he said. Jude was alarmed. She rang the hostel to ask if it was true about the drugs. She says staff just told her: “Joe has to stay strong and say no to anyone who offers him drugs.”View image in fullscreenJude outside the hostel last month.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianJoe was panicking. “He said: ‘You have made a massive mistake if you want me to keep away from drugs. Aren’t you worried about me being in this hostel?’ I asked: ‘Are you?’ He said: ‘Yes. This terrible hostel will kill me. The place is full of crack and heroin dealers and I want to stay clean from that.’“These messages haunt me,” says Jude, her eyes red with tears. Again, she told herself Joe was exaggerating. She says she asked staff so many times about the level of heroin and crack use, but nobody acknowledged that it was a problem, so she put it down to Joe’s paranoia. After all, Holmes Road was so proud of its zero-tolerance drug policy.On one occasion, Joe was bullied over money he owed a fellow resident. He said he feared for his life. The hostel took action on this occasion and the resident was expelled.Every week, Jude would meet Joe outside the hostel (she wasn’t allowed beyond the reception) to buy him food, chat and check up on him. Joe was losing weight. He had a deep split on his bottom lip, which suggested crack use, he looked exhausted and he couldn’t manage his finances. He was always running out of money and was in debt to the hostel for his £16 weekly service charge. She thought it must be because he was spending all his money on drugs, but again the hostel staff expressed no concern.When she said she was worried about Joe, she was told no information could be shared because of confidentiality. When she asked how he was doing, she was always told: “OK.” Nothing more. She was not invited to any meetings about his welfare or mental health, as she had been when Joe was in the care of Brent. She was never told about how he was progressing on the pathway towards independent living. It later emerged he hadn’t been put on a pathway. Holmes Road offers only short-term accommodation, for a maximum of two years, but there was no discussion about where Joe would go next, or when, even though the two years had passed.Holmes Road was like a legalised crack den and it’s across the road from the police station! It’s horribleOn the evening of 3 August 2023, Joe messaged Jude: “Mum, I have literally no friends. Everyone I know is a snake in the grass. I cannot trust anyone.”He claimed people were laughing behind his back, insulting him to his face and ganging up on him. Whether it was true or he was having a paranoid-schizophrenic episode, he was clearly not in a good way mentally. “And you wonder why I drink and take drugs,” he messaged Jude. “I have no friends. I have no job. I practically have no family. I have no home. What have I ever done to deserve this?”Again, he said he doubted whether Jude and Andy were his real parents. He sounded desperate. “Plz talk to me mum. I’m feeling very unhappy and vulnerable and lonely … I have been hiding the truth from you for a while now … My life is getting progressively worse and worse.” It took Jude a few minutes to reply, which only increased his paranoia.He sent another message: “See you don’t even care – you won’t even talk to me now. Are you my real mum? Be honest.”But his mood was changeable. Five days later, on 8 August 2023, Joe messaged to say he had cheered up because Andy had helped him buy a new bike (he was working as a part-time delivery cyclist). Jude asked if he was still taking drugs. “It’s not my fault I suffer from very poor mental health,” he said. “Can’t you see I’m monumentally depressed?” He texted at about 11pm and said he was taking a night-time walk in Highgate.Jude told him to take care. At 11.57pm, he texted: “Are you going to make your amazing cheesy pasta bake for me this coming weekend?” Jude said she was working that weekend and he should ask Andy to make it for him, because he was seeing him. “Ok no worries mum,” he texted at 12.07am. At 12.32am, Jude texted him: “How are things at Holmes Road? Is your new bike safely in your flat?” He did not respond to the message.Later that day, the police knocked on Jude’s door to tell her Joe was dead.Jude was determined to find out how Joe had died and what could have been done to prevent it. But when she asked staff at Holmes Road for information, no answers were forthcoming. There had to be an inquest and they were in no position to tell her what had happened. But she sensed that even if they could have helped her, they didn’t want to. She had always been the nuisance mother and she felt they still saw her like that, even in her grief.She began investigating Joe’s death herself. She contacted all the agencies who were supposed to have been working with him. Some were helpful; some wouldn’t talk to her. The day after Joe died, she rang North Camden’s rehabilitation and recovery service to find out when Joe last presented at the depot for his monthly antipsychotic injection and what state he has been in.Jude was told the service had received an alert about synthetic opioids being mixed in with other drugs three weeks before Joe died – there had been overdoses in Camden and this may have been why Joe fatally overdosed. After the call, Jude was emailed aNational Patient Safety Alertdated 26 July and titled “Potent synthetic opioids implicated in heroin overdoses and deaths”. This was the first Jude had heard of the alert. At the very least, she says, if she had been told, she could have warned Joe of the dangers. A second email revealed that Joe had missed the last three reviews with his psychiatrist. The last time he had been seen was in November 2021, 21 months before he died.Three weeks before Joe died, and a week before the emergency warning about dangerous synthetic drugs was issued, Holmes Road residents were sent a letter reminding them of the zero-tolerance drug policy.View image in fullscreen‘He was a nice person. He didn’t have a bad bone in his body.’Yet on 20 October 2023, two months after Joe’s death, the service manager for adult safeguarding and care management at Camden wrote to Jude, saying: “It is noted that people may continue to use both legal and illicit substances during their stay. In light of this, staff extend advice and support, striving to mitigate potential risks and helping those who wish to cut down or quit entirely. Staff are also conscious that for some, drug use may be a means of coping, often due to past traumas or ongoing personal struggles. It’s crucial to mention that any illegal activities identified within the hostel are immediately reported to the police and could result in eviction.”There was a blatant contradiction. How could there be a zero-tolerance drug policy when they were saying that illicit substances could continue to be used by residents during their stay, with staff supporting those who wished to quit? In one sentence, it said they understood that residents would continue to take drugs as a coping mechanism; in the next, it said they would immediately be reported to the police. None of it added up.Jude, Andy and Joe’s younger sister, Georgia, replied to the letter. “Not only did [the hostel’s] hopeless lack of support give Joseph permission to carry on using illegal drugs but it actually made him rely more and more on them,” they said. “We would also like to mention that Joseph had visibly lost weight over the two years that he was living at Holmes Road. He was also known to be constantly leaving and returning to the hostel, during the day and late at night. Why did this not cause any concern and why was this not addressed by the day and night time staff? We are heartbroken that Joseph was allowed to deteriorate and die in their care.”When Jude and Andy went to collect Joe’s belongings, they were shocked by the attitude of the staff. They were greeted by the new manager, who had only been in place a few months. “She said: ‘I’m sorry, but he’s with God now.’ It was horrific,” Jude says. “I said: ‘Well, I’m not a religious person, so he’s not with God. He’s dead and he died at your hostel.’”She met up with residents who had known Joe during his stay at Holmes Road. They were devastated by what had happened to him.Mark, who lived at Holmes Road, says it was apparent to everybody that Joe was struggling. “He didn’t shower, didn’t wash. His room looked like a bomb had gone off – stuff all over the place. A keyworker who had any care for their client would say: ‘You can’t live like this, mate,’ and check up on him regularly, otherwise you’re letting people rot in their room. They were supposed to provide a breakfast club, coffee morning, art class. But there was none of that.”What was Joe like? “He had a drug problem, but he was a nice person. He didn’t have a bad bone in his body. I believe he died because he was neglected by Camden council and staff here – left to do what he wanted. Class A drugs are rife here. I find it weird that staff turn a blind eye to it. They just let it happen. I don’t understand it. They’d have a go at you for playing music too loud, but let people smoke crack. I’ve never been in a hostel run like this. Holmes Road was like a legalised crack den and it’s across the road from the police station! It’s horrible. Absolutely horrible.”Mark was evicted from the hostel. He believes it was for talking to Jude. “One day, the manager said to me: ‘Why are you going in and out of everyone’s room?’ I said: ‘I talk to people.’ They said: ‘We think you’re extorting vulnerable people.’ I was like: what? Next thing I know, they’re sending me to another hostel.”Joe’s family called for an article 2 inquest because they believed the failings of Holmes Road and various agencies tasked with supporting him meant his right to life, protected by article 2 ofthe European Convention on Human Rights, had been violated. Article 2 inquests are broader in their scope, tend to last longer and often have a jury. The assistant coroner for inner north London, Ian Potter, decided Joe’s death did not merit an article 2 inquest.The four-day inquest began at Camden coroner’s court on 9 December 2024, 16 months after Joe’s death. At times, it felt as if the family were on trial. The counsel for Camden, Nick Stanage, insisted that Jude’s statement be hugely redacted. Potter agreed with most of the cuts, leaving less than 40% of her statement on record, which caused huge concern to the family’s legal team, who argued unsuccessfully that the inquest should be adjourned because of “procedural unfairness”.Every time Camden’s barrister spoke, he seemed to reduce Joe’s mother and sister to tearsStanage said he thought the inquest could be done and dusted in one day and argued successfully that a witness from the hostel should not be allowed to give evidence because he had a criminal record and was therefore not of good character. Every time Stanage spoke, he seemed to reduce Jude and Georgia to tears. (At the end of the inquest, he told Jude that, if he had come across as confrontational, he regretted it. “I apologise to you if at any stage of this year or this week you have formed the impression of any personal hostility from me to you or any member of your family.”)As witnesses spoke, the extent to which agencies had failed to act collectively, or at all, to support Joe emerged. Joe’s psychiatrist insisted it was not significant that Joe hadn’t seen her for almost two years because he saw an experienced nurse every four weeks for his antipsychotic injection. She said that when he did turn up to an appointment on 7 June 2023, only two months before he died, he couldn’t be seen because he had arrived half an hour late and she had to leave. She said he did not need a care coordinator because he had keyworkers at the hostel.When the psychiatrist talked about her list of 300 patients and working with only one junior doctor, it was hard not to feel for her. Perhaps Joe would not have been so badly let down if services were better resourced. On the witness stand, she addressed Jude: “Before I leave, I want to say to you, Jude, my sincere condolences. And I valued the time we had on the phone and that I was able to listen to you.” It came across as sincere and heartfelt.The next day, she took to the witness stand again to say she had got her dates wrong and couldn’t remember the day Joe had turned up late for his appointment. Her argument that a keyworker would suffice for Joe was contradicted by the hostel’s manager who said that keyworkers had no mental health training. “Two separate roles,” said the manager. “The keyworker role supports with housing-related roles. The care coordinator, the NHS worker, deals with the mental health needs. We are not trained mental health workers.”At Joe’s inquest, the manager of Holmes Road rejected the idea that the hostel was an unsafe environment for him.The manager said that although they often met with mental health professionals to support residents, “in the case of Joe, there was nothing like that, because there was no issue with his mental health that we saw”. Yet, according to fellow residents, he was clearly struggling with paranoid schizophrenia. As for drugs, the manager stated categorically: “We have zero tolerance.” A few minutes later, she admitted they were so concerned about Joe’s drug taking that they had increased the number of daily welfare observations.She admitted she was aware that Joe was exploited by other residents, that the level of heroin and crack use in Holmes Road was “high” and that the morning welfare check on 9 August 2023, the day of Joe’s death, did not take place.Potter appeared horrified by the state of Joe’s room. “Without disrespect to Joe or his family, is it fair to say when you found Joe the state of his room was dire?” The manager said no.Emma Favata, the barrister for the family, asked whether Joe should have been referred toChange Grow Live, Camden’s integrated drug and alcohol service. The manager agreed he should have been, but denied that this was a failure of the hostel. She said it would have been pointless because he was not ready to engage with services. Catch-22.The manager was asked about the availability of the drug naloxone, which can reverse an opioid overdose if administered in time. She said the hostel kept it locked in the office and that the only way for residents to get hold of it was through Camden’s drug and alcohol services.Favata asked the manager: “Do you agree Holmes Road in 2023 was an unsafe environment for someone as vulnerable as Joe?”“I’m not accepting that,” replied the manager.Joe’s keyworker at the hostel gave evidence that Joe was known to be “very active in the hostel at night procuring substances”. He was seen knocking on the doors of other residents and would go in for a bit. “I assumed he was picking up drugs from them,” said the keyworker, who also acknowledged that staff were aware Joe “spent all his money on drugs” and that, after a safeguarding incident in March 2023, he was known to be “extremely vulnerable and being exploited in the hostel”.When the manager and her team had finished giving their evidence, it felt like a long time since Holmes Road had been depicted as a drug-free designer complex with a model support system in place.Potter concluded that Joe died after taking adulterated heroin. He said there was no evidence he had obtained the heroin in the hostel and that Joe had been made aware by the nurse at his last antipsychotic injection appointment, six days before he died, that synthetic opioids were being sold on the streets. No mention was made in his “findings and conclusion” of the hostel’s failure to adhere to its drug policy, or its reluctance to inform substance misuse services of Joe’s increased drug taking.Although he did find there was a risk of drug use within resident rooms in Camden-run hostels and the potential for future deaths by overdose, Potter said “nothing could meaningfully be achieved” to address this. “Joe’s engagement with substance misuse services and treatment was sporadic, at best … There were no concerns that Joe lacked capacity to make decisions not to engage with treatment … It is unfortunate that neither healthcare professionals, support workers or Joe’s family were able to secure his continued engagement with the substance misuse support and treatment that was available.”Potter said he was concerned that the only way to obtain naloxone was by engaging with substance misuse services. He stated that he would write aprevention of future deaths reportsuggesting naloxone should be made more readily available.Jude was shattered by the coroner’s verdict. She remains convinced that, as a person with paranoid schizophrenia who was self-medicating with drugs and alcohol, Joe did not have the capacity to make rational decisions about engaging with services. He managed to get to his monthly appointment for his antipsychotic injection only because Jude made sure to remind him, she says. That is why she argued so persistently for him to have a care coordinator. If support is so inconsistent, she says, dependent on the policies and practices of individual boroughs, survival becomes a postcode lottery for the most vulnerable.I think Holmes Road should be closed. There’s something deeply wrong and dangerous and disturbing about that placeCamden is no stranger to homelessness controversies. In November 2023, several tents, most of them filled with belongings, weredumped in the back of a bin lorryand destroyed during the eviction of people experiencing homelessness. The council acknowledged that what had happenedwas “unacceptable”andpromised an “urgent investigation”, butan internal reviewconcluded: “Overall, rough sleeping services … work empathetically and effectively.” Jon Glackin, from the homelessness organisation Streets Kitchen, which filmed the evacuation, calls the review “an absolute whitewash”.In February, an inquest at St Pancras coroner’s court ruled that 47-year-old Stephen Lovell died in Arlington House, another Camden homelessness hostel, from cardio-respiratory failure caused by cocaine and opioids. Lovell, whose jaw had previously beenbroken by a member of staff, died on his first day back in the hostel after two months spent getting clean at his sister’s home. Before the inquest, the Lovell family had said that it was impossible for recovering residents to steer clear of the drug culture at the hostel.While the coroner found little fault with the support services that Joe received, the north Camden rehabilitation and recovery team, part of north London NHS foundation trust, found plenty to learn from his death. After investigating, it sent Jude a “Duty of Candour” report in November, shortly before the inquest. It concluded that the failure to appoint a care coordinator for Joe had left “gaps in care and communication” and that in future there needed to be a more robust system for booking, monitoring and rebooking medical appointments after it was revealed that Joe hadn’t seen his psychiatrist for almost two years.The report found that Jude should have been offered a formal carers’ assessment as required under the Care Act 2014 and that Camden failed to recognise her role as a caregiver. It also acknowledged that Joe’s care did not fully reflect policy on co-occurring mental health problems and substance misuse and that his needs had been primarily attributed to substance abuse. Finally, it identified gaps in collaboration with the north Camden rehabilitation and recovery team, the drug and alcohol services and Holmes Road. “We are committed to learn from this tragedy and improving our services to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future,” they said in a letter to Jude.View image in fullscreen‘Nobody should have to deteriorate and die like that.’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe report could not have been more different in tone and findings from the coroner’s report. While the coroner concluded that it was up to Joe to embrace the support offered, the Duty of Candour report accepted that, because of his condition, he was not always in a position to do so. As for the award-winning Holmes Road Studios, its reputation may be damaged beyond repair.A spokesperson for north London NHS foundation trust told the Guardian: “We were deeply saddened to learn of Joseph Black’s death, and our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Extensive reviews have been conducted, both internally by the trust and independently through an inquest. This process has provided us with the opportunity to reflect deeply on Joseph’s death as part of our commitment to continual learning. We have shared these reflections to improve care and support for those who need it. We will continue working closely with all our partners across the NHS and beyond to further this effort.”In mid-January, I meet Jude near Camden. She is with Alaister, a former resident of Holmes Road who knew Joe well. Alaister, hollow-cheeked with a shock of red hair, says he is doing much better now that he has left the hostel. “I have been a drug addict, I’ve been in the prison system, I’ve been stabbed, but my experience at Holmes Road was worse than all that,” he says. “Before I left, I was suicidal. I’ve never been as desperate.”He talks about the shortfall in services the hostel provided compared with what it claimed to offer and tells me that two dealers who bullied Joe were finally evicted months after his death. Jude says it still shocks her that the hostel claimed to be helping people towards independent living, yet residents couldn’t even cook in their rooms because the hobs weren’t working.“Ah, there’s a reason for that,” Alaister claims. “They came round and turned them off because people were using it as a last resort at night-time to cook their drugs and that made the internal alarm go off in the flats.”Jude listens, open-mouthed and appalled, as if it’s just starting to make sense. “I said to Joe: ‘Why have they turned the hobs off?’ He said: ‘I don’t know.’ So …” She can barely get her words out. “They would rather stop people cooking than deal with the actual drugs problem?” She comes to a stop. “I never believed it was as bad as Joe described. That will always stay with me. That I should have done something.” What could she have done? “Got him out of there,” she says baldly.A few weeks ago, Black met the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, at a conference hosted by Inquest, the campaign group that supports families bereaved by state-related deaths. She told Mahmood that Joe had died in the prime minister’s constituency. This week, she received an email from Starmer’s senior caseworker, asking if there were issues she would like to raise with his office. There are plenty. She hopes to meet the prime minister to discuss them.I ask what should happen to Holmes Road now. “I think it should be closed,” Jude says. “There’s something deeply wrong and dangerous and disturbing about that place. Nobody should have to live like that and deteriorate and die like that.”A Camden council spokesperson said: “Our deepest sympathies remain with Joe’s family and friends following his tragic death. Ensuring our residents’ needs are met is a responsibility we take very seriously. We are participating in a Safeguarding Adults Review which is reviewing the support and care Joe received both from the council and its health partners. The learning from this review will be published and will help us work together to continually improve the support that residents receive.“Camden council’s hostels help support people who are homeless towards full independent living in the community. We will always work alongside individuals to ensure that their choice, control and privacy is respected and central to everything we do. We also work with partners to support people who may have additional needs and ensure that they have access to the services they need. In the case where people have drug or alcohol dependency specifically, our priority is always to reduce the risk of harm to that person, whether or not abstinence is their goal, and to support them to engage with substance misuse services.”The council declined to comment on how it could reconcile its zero-tolerance drug policy with the prevalence of drugs at Holmes Road. It also declined to say why Joe was not put on a pathway, or what plans are in place to ensure Holmes Road is safer for its residents in future. It admitted that the hobs were still switched off, but insisted this was due to an installation issue and nothing to do with drugs.A couple of days after my meeting with Jude and Alaister, Jude messages me to say she has been going through more of Joe’s messages. “Joe sent me this, two years before he died, just before he was placed at Holmes Road,” she says.“I want to get better.I’m so sick of drugs.They make me so unhappy.I don’t want to die young.”Explore more on these topicsHomelessnessDrugsHousingPovertySocial exclusionCommunitiesMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why does the outside world ignore such attacks – or even blame the victims?Moya CrockettThu 6 Mar 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 09.07 ESTShareErin knows her three children haven’t had an easy time. When they were growing up, her partner was abusive towards her and the children witnessed violence and coercion at home before she found the strength to end the relationship. A few years later, her child Jay – then in their early teens – disclosed that a trusted adult had sexually abused them.Erin, a successful businesswoman, has always believed Jay. She reported the abuse to police and severed ties with the alleged perpetrator. But Jay’s behaviour began to change. They threw knives at Erin. They set fires in the house. “They would use anything as a weapon to cause injury and harm,” Erin says. Often, Erin was forced to barricade herself inside her bedroom when Jay tried to attack her, while the other children fled the house. In many ways, she felt as if she was living with her abusive ex again.When Erin was with her ex, she knew there was help available for victims of domestic abuse. But when she sought support for Jay’s behaviour, she felt as if she was hitting a brick wall. A mental health assessment concluded that Jay was not struggling with any psychological conditions. Social workers focused on how Erin could improve her parenting and downplayed the severity of Jay’s behaviour. Eventually, afraid that Jay would kill her, or one of her other children, Erin begged her local authority to take Jay into care. It wasn’t until Jay made a credible attempt to kill one of their siblings that she succeeded.Erin didn’t know it at the time, but Jay’s behaviour towards her had a name – or rather, lots of names. Among other terms, it is called filial violence, child-to-parent abuse or child-against-parent aggression. There is no legal definition but the national domestic abuse charity Respect uses the acronym Capva (Child and Adolescent to Parent Violence and Abuse) as a term to describe a person aged between eight and 18 who engages in “harmful and repeated” abusive behaviour. This might include physical violence, sexual and economic abuse or “emotional, coercive or controlling behaviour”.Over the last two decades, interest in Capva has risen steadily among academics, social workers and practitioners in sectors including domestic abuse, adoption and mental health services. The pandemic saw asurge in reported casesand today, specialist services working to address child-to-parent abuse report that they cannot keep up with demand. A storyline about this issue even featured in EastEnderslast year, as Kat Slater struggled to cope with the increasingly violent behaviour of her teenage son Tommy. Anew reportby Femicide Census on more than 170 UK mothers killed by their sons (of all ages) in the past 15 years observed that mothers were sometimes considered a “safe space” for children to mete out violence.Parents will reach out to their family and friends and get a response that’s quite shamingBut this gradual growth in awareness has yet to translate into families getting the support they need. In a recent landmark survey by Respect, British parents shared their experiences of Capva. The survey report paints a picture of desperate parents punched in the face so they need stitches; attacked with knives and other weapons; suffering heart attacks due to the stress of their situations. It also highlights the silence, stigma and lack of understanding that surround child-to-parent abuse. More than half of parents experiencing Capva told Respect they had not sought support at all; of these, 68% said this was because they were ashamed or worried about the stigma or judgment from professionals.“Shame and blame are really prevalent issues for Capva, and I think they are part of the reason this issue can stay hidden for so long,” says Justine Dodds, head of young people’s services at Respect. “Parents will maybe reach out to family and friends at first and get a response that’s quite shaming. Unfortunately, sometimes professionals in services working with children have very similar responses.”Dodds says she often hears of parents who are told they simply need to “get a grip of their kids and take charge” – by friends, family or frontline practitioners such as social workers, police officers and teachers. “All of this is because of a lack of awareness,” she says. “If you haven’t seen Capva in action, it can be hard to conceptualise that somebody might be really frightened of their children.”Michelle John is the founder of Pegs (Parental Education Growth Support), a social enterprise launched in 2020 to support parents and caregivers affected by child-to-parent abuse. She compares the disbelief and victim-blaming to the way domestic abuse was widely talked about in the 1960s or 70s. “There are those really damaging attitudes: ‘Just tell him no.’ ‘You must be doing something wrong.’ ‘Put up and shut up’,” she says. Between 2023 and 2024, Pegs saw a 70% increase in referrals. John met a solicitor recently and mentioned what her organisation does. “They laughed and said: ‘That doesn’t happen.’”Helen Bonnick first met a mother who was scared of her child in the 1980s, when she was a social worker in London. Recently awarded an MBE for her work to raise awareness of child-to-parent abuse, Bonnick remembers how the idea that parents should be held responsible for curbing their children’s harmful behaviour dominated public discourse in the 1990s, as Tony Blair’s Labour government began to send people on mandatory parenting courses viaantisocial behaviour orders. Bonnick was sure the fearful parents she met through her work in social services, and then in education, were facing problems beyond “normal teenage stuff”. But, she says, the prevailing political narrative was that if your child was being violent or aggressive, “you, as a parent, needed to pull your socks up”.In 2025, some cultural narratives around raising children may look very different – this is an era of gentler parenting, after all. But judgment and shame still underscore conversations about raising families, and modern parents who can’t stop their child from hurting them report receiving similar messages about how they are failing.“You do worry that you sound like a really weak parent,” says Tim. He lives with his partner Charlie and their 12-year-old son Silas. When Silas was younger, some teachers dismissed him as naughty and he was often punished. Later in childhood, he was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Today, he regularly blocks doorways, punches Tim in the stomach and jabs him in the chest. Insults, swearing and name-calling are a daily occurrence.It feels like the message is: ‘If you learn to parent a bit better, all this will go away.’ You start to feel powerlessThere are moments of joy and peace – Tim chuckles as he describes watchingThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Airwith his son and doing 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzles together at the kitchen table. But more often, Tim feels scared in his own home. “Silas’s behaviour feels more threatening as he’s got bigger and stronger. His language is becoming more sophisticated, too. He’ll be really aggressive, two inches from my face. Then he’ll flip into talking really calmly, like: ‘I’m not wound up at all.’ It can feel like you’re being gaslit.”Silas was adopted so Tim and Charlie have had readier access to professional support than some other parents. On top of the training they had as part of the adoption process, the couple have attended three intensive courses on “positive parenting”, five workshops on raising neurodiverse children and multiple child psychotherapy webinars. None of this has made a meaningful difference to Silas’s violence and aggression. “It feels like the message is: ‘If you just learn to parent a bit better, all this will go away.’” Tim says. When that doesn’t work, “you start to feel powerless. There’s a real sense of despair.”It is no surprise that traditional parenting strategies, which focus on rewards and consequences, don’t work for families like Tim’s. While there is no one reason for child-to-parent abuse, or one type of family in which these dynamics play out,researchsuggests that neurodivergence and the experience of care – including fostering and adoption – can be compounding factors. Children who have grown up in homes where intimate partner violence is present may also be more likely to engage in child-to-parent abuse themselves. Overall, a child who has “experienced loss, grief, trauma, adverse childhood experiences, bullying at school, parental conflict, domestic violence, mental health issues [of] a parent, mental health issues for themselves [and/or] neurodiversity” may find it extremely difficult to communicate their needs or emotions, says Jane Griffiths, the co-founder of Capa First Response, an online support service for families affected by child-to-parent aggression.In these situations, some children may resort to “externalising” their emotions by displaying violent or harmful behaviour, Griffiths explains. An effective response to child-to-parent aggression, she says, has to involve helping children and parents to learn to communicate with one another. “This is not an issue that can be resolved by putting boundaries in place or using star charts.”For parents, finding a way to communicate to other adults what they are going through – simply having the right language to describe their experience, and trusting that others will believe them – is essential. Yet there is no legal definition of child-to-parent abuse. A Home Office consultation was held in early 2024 but shelved when the general election was called. Meanwhile, parents and professionals are divided over whether the word “abuse” should be used at all. Many parents feel the word is the only way to adequately convey their suffering. Others recoil from it, fearing that it further stigmatises the vulnerable children involved.From the outside, Jack’s got a great life, he doesn’t want for anything. He’s never punched me. But he’s kicked meDolly certainly doesn’t think of her 15-year-old son Jack as abusive. Instead she describes him as outgoing, charismatic, cheeky, struggling with big emotions. Jack’s dad has never been around, but he has grown up surrounded by a tight-knit, affectionate family that many would envy. He loves motorbikes and keeps busy with extracurricular clubs; he has no special educational needs. “From the outside, Jack’s got a great life,” says Dolly. “He doesn’t want for anything.” But around the start of the pandemic, Jack began lashing out at Dolly. “He’s never punched me. There have only been a couple of occasions where I really felt like he was going to hit me,” she says. “But he’s kicked me and been very violent around me – hitting or kicking or punching the windows or the doors, screaming.”Jack is much taller than Dolly now, and can “be really scary”, she says. “I think he knows he can intimidate me.” Predictably, some relatives have suggested that she simply needs to be tougher. “My dad said: ‘If he hits you, you hit him right back.’” But Dolly didn’t want to hurt her son – she wanted to understand him.Recently Dolly and Jack came to the end of Respect’s Young People’s Programme, a three-month intervention for families where children or young people are being abusive or violent towards their parents or carers. Families participate in sessions designed to help them identify negative behaviour patterns and work together to improve their situation. Evidence so far suggests this approach can make a meaningful difference:one evaluationin Cambridge found the programme reduced violence and abusive behaviour for all parents and carers who took part, while arecent pilotin Norfolk reported that 100% of children said the programme helped to improve their relationship with their parent or caregiver.Dolly was particularly moved by sessions in which she and Jack recorded voice notes for each other, guided by a trained practitioner from the relationships charity Talk Listen Change. “Jack said some things he’d never told me before about his feelings about his dad. I said his behaviour does scare me sometimes,” she says. “He was shocked by that.” While Jack has not stopped being aggressive to Dolly entirely, she feels that they both have new tools to communicate their emotions and needs. “It’s helped because it’s not a parenting course aimed at me,” she adds. “It’s about him.”Capa First Response’s approach, which draws on neuroscience and attachment theory, is designed to help whole families develop strategies for communicating emotions. It has also seen positive results: 96% of parents who have worked with the organisation reported feeling more confident about working with their child to change their behaviour, while 83% said they felt better able to seek support from others. Inevitably, resources are limited. Most families have to wait years to get this kind of help. Long-term funding is desperately needed for specialist support, especially for families with neurodivergent children. More training is needed for professionals in social care, education, health and the police. In the meantime, says Justine Dodds, of Respect, compassionate, honest conversations about child-to-parent abuse will help to bring the issue out of the shadows so that families don’t have to suffer in silence. “We cannot solve a problem that cannot be discussed.”Names and some details have been changed to protect privacy.Further information and support:capafirstresponse.org,talklistenchange.org.uk,respect.org.ukDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It orders all state department entities to immediately suspend aid disbursements, with minimal exceptions.“To effectively implement EO 14204, all bureaus, offices and missions shall pause all obligations and/or dispersion of aid or assistance toSouth Africa,” reads the cable, signed by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio.The cable follows the 7 February order, amid a broader reassessment of US foreign aid which paused certain foreign assistance pending review.The order specifically cites “unjust racial discrimination” against white Afrikaners – descendants of Dutch colonizers who implemented the segregationist regime that denied basic rights to the Black majority until 1994.The South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump super-ally who heads the administration’s government efficiency team and has condemned his homeland for “openly racist policies”, is widely seen as influencing the administration’s stance toward a country where white South Africans, just 7% of the population, still disproportionately control most wealth and land.‘White supremacists in suits and ties’: the rightwing Afrikaner group in Trump’s earRead moreAccording to the cable, Rubio has delegated authority to Pete Marocco, a Trump loyalist whopresided over the administration’s eviscerationof foreign aid programs at USAid and the state department, to determine whether specific aid programs should continue. The guidance emphasizes there is “a very high bar for such requests”.Only Pepfar, the US global HIV/Aids program that provides life-saving treatment to millions of South Africans, will proceed without additional review, according to the cable. All other assistance programs require special permission, even those that had received prior exceptions under the January foreign aid pause.This is the latest sign of escalating tensions between the two generally friendly nations, starting when President Trump accused South Africa of using its new land law to discriminate against white citizens – claims the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa,rejected as misinformation.The bill in question controversially permits government acquisition of private land without compensation in certain circumstances, though its supporters say such seizures would be rare and subject to judicial review.Trump has also criticized South Africa’s leading role in its genocide case against Israel at the international court of justice, while also offering refugee status to wealthy white Afrikaners who wanted to relocate to the United States, further incensing the country.The aid freeze also follows South Africa’srecent announcement that it is preparing a new trade proposal for the Trump administration, as officials anticipate the possible end of the African Growth and Opportunity Act – which has allowed billions in duty-free exports to the United States.Earlier on Thursday, South Africaissued a statementacknowledging the US withdrawal from the Just Energy Transition Partnership (Jetp), which has canceled previously funded climate projects following Trump’s revocation of international climate finance initiatives.The state department did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyUS politicsSouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The decision will also result in huge knock-on effects for the health and safety of the largest refugee settlement in the world.”He said that when food rations werepreviously cut in 2023, until the US filled a funding shortfall, there was an increase in malnutrition and gender-based violence.Sullivan said: “With USAid decimated, and other donors following suit with their own reductions, the outlook for restored food aid is dismal and will lead to the loss of life.”The monthly food voucher is provided on a card issued to the refugees, which they must spend at WFP outlets in the camps. Refugees said that at current costs the voucher would amount to enough to buy 10kg of rice, 1.5kg of lentils and 500g of salt.Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, the refugee relief and repatriation commissioner of Bangladesh, saidRohingyarefugees had already been “barely surviving” with the existing monthly food ration.He said: “Cutting the ration over half will have a horrible impact on refugee health and nutrition. Children and women will bear the brunt of this cut, as they make up about 78% of the refugee population here.“In fact, this cut could also lead to crime in the community as refugees struggle to make ends meet. Maintaining law and order in and around the camps will be extra challenging for the government now.”More than 1.3 million Rohingya refugees live in the camps of Cox’s Bazar. Nur Qadr, a Rohingya teacher who lives in the Jamtoli refugee camp, said: “It feels like the world wants to starve us to death.“We are human beings, just like the people in [western] nations. We are already barely making it through.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But now, they are cutting down the ration even further. We all have to starve now.”Last week, the WFP informed refugees inKenyathat it would be reducing their food rations to 3kg of cereals a month and would no longer provide beans or oil – which would amount to 40% of the full ration.The move promptedprotests in the Kakuma refugee camp, which hosts 300,000 people, and four refugees were injured in clashes with Kenyan police.The WFP also said this week that a million people in Somaliacould fall into crisis levels of hunger because of conflict, drought and inflation but that it would have to reduce the support it provided because it was $300m short of funding for the next six months.In a statement on the situation in Somalia, it said: “As humanitarian needs grow, limited funding is resulting in life-saving programmes being reduced or cut altogether. From April, WFP will support 820,000 vulnerable people per month with food and cash assistance – down from a peak of 2.2 million reached monthly in 2024.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentRohingyaAidBangladeshKenyaAfricaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The drugs are kind of there, but not available. Stigma is also an issue. So you can make a lot of parallels.”In another similarity between the conditions on the African continent, women aremore likelythan men to be infected with HIV. And while 25% of men in Africa are overweight or obese, for women the figure is 40%. In most other world regions the gap is much smaller, or reversed.And the trend is accelerating. While 45% of women in Africa will be overweight or obese by 2030, for men the figure is 26%, according to theWorld Obesity Atlas.View image in fullscreenA Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation mobile health service in Nairobi, Kenya.Photograph: Desmond Tutu Mobile ServiceChandiwana said the question of why obesity was rising faster among women in Africa was complex, and involved multiple intersecting factors.“Urbanisation and lifestyle shifts play a major role –many African cities lack safe spaces for physical activity, and long working hours, caregiving responsibilities, and safety concerns, etc, make movement harder for women. Unlike men, who may engage in occupational or leisure physical activity, women’s daily routines are becoming more sedentary,” she said.“HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) add another layer. In high HIV-burden settings like South Africa, ART-related weight gain, especially with drugs such as dolutegravir, is becoming more noticeable, disproportionately affecting women.”Biological factors such as reproductive health, menopause, and differences in cravings, metabolism, genetics and hormones are additional factors, she said.“It is definitely going to get worse as ultra-processed foods become more ubiquitous, climate change increases and [because of] gender inequity,” said Chandiwana, with women facing more barriers to activities such as exercise because of their other commitments. “We need prevention and treatment targeted specifically at women in South Africa.”Already, two-thirds of women in South Africa are overweight or obese, the second highest rate on the continent, after Eswatini.The rates in women could be a warning sign.Research suggeststhat countries’ experiences of rising obesity typically begin with higher levels in women and higher-income groups before spreading through the population.Chandiwana said she was excited by the possibilities of the new generation of anti-obesity drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Wegovy or Mounjaro, which have been popularised in the west by celebrities and politicians such asOprah WinfreyandBoris Johnson.View image in fullscreenA vial of the drug semaglutide, the active ingredient in the weight loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic.Photograph: Cj Gunther/EPAShe said she had been about to get US funding for the first trial of semaglutide in women with HIV, shortly before the Trump administrationfroze most research spending.“I think these drugs are a gamechanger and also they legitimise obesity as a chronic disease,” she said. “Without treatment, people always look at it as a personal failure. It’s you, you haven’t done enough. But when you have treatment, we’ve got more in our toolbox.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said diabetes patients in South Africa are having to return tousing insulin in glass vials, rather than the more modern alternative of pens with measured doses.“It doesn’t matter where you are, there’s a drug that’s available that can help you with your disease. We do have to try the best we can to give people access,” Chandiwana said.Johanna Ralston, CEO at the World Obesity Federation, said cultural norms and expectations around obesity in some African countries might play a role in making women more vulnerable to obesity. “As is the case in many Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries, it is more culturally acceptable for women to have excess weight, and in some cases is desirable.”View image in fullscreenA fast food outlet in Nairobi, Kenya. The switch from traditional diets to western-style foods is one factor behind rising obesity.Photograph: Brian Otieno/The GuardianRalston said: “Gender-responsive action is needed to address these disparities and more research is needed to understand the nuances.”Brenda Chitindi of the Zambia NCD Allianceagreed that cultural attitudes to obesity were an obstacle to tackling the condition in her country.“Obesity is a very big challenge inZambiabecause we have not taken it seriously. Most of the time we think when you are obese, you eat well – without knowing that it is a disease,” she said.Time for a noodle tax? Doctor who sounded alarm on ultra-processed food urges tougher actionRead moreSpeaking at the NCD Alliance Global Forum, a conference for NCD advocates last month, Chitindi said: “The other big challenge is where the [food] industry right now have brought into the country these fast foods. Where a lot of people have been attracted and, ignoring the regional food we have … they rush to these fast foods to show people ‘we are well off, we eat well’, without knowing they contribute to obesity.“The government is looking at the revenue that they get from this industry, which is a very big challenge as well.”The latesteditionof the World Obesity Atlas assessed countries’ “readiness” to address obesity by looking at factors such as their ability to provide treatment for NCDs, and policies for prevention such as taxes on sugary drinks, and restrictions on marketing unhealthy food to children.These were lacking in many countries, the report’s authors found. But they warned that a reduction in the number of adults who are overweight or obese will require “dramatic policy interventions”.Explore more on these topicsGlobal healthObesityAfricaWomen's healthSouth AfricaZambianewsShareReuse this content"

Activists have long campaigned for the island to be bought from its private owners and designated as a heritage site.On Thursday, the SVG prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, announced in parliament that the island had been acquired for the nation because of its historical significance.“The Government of St Vincent and Grenadines, given the historic importance of Baliceaux, has taken the decision to acquire Baliceaux,” he told lawmakers.He did not reveal the terms of the deal, but said the owners would be given “fair compensation within a reasonable time”.Ubafu Topsey, an activist from Belize who has been at the forefront of the fight for Baliceaux said: “We are ecstatic that the government of SVG is doing the right thing for us. [Gonsalves] put his money where his mouth is. He made his promise a reality.”Topsey, who is preparing for an annual Garifuna pilgrimage to Baliceaux on 14 March – celebrated in SVG as National Heroes Day in honour of the Garifuna chief Joseph Chatoyer – said this year’s visit would be an occasion for special celebration.“It is our homeland… and every Garifuna around the world understands that these are holy, sacred grounds. We are just so thankful and joyful,” she said.Topsey is hoping the island will become a World Heritage Site in honor of the Garifuna people, who she said were “transnational” and borderless”.Once a site of horror, a tiny Caribbean island could become a Garifuna shrineRead moreShe also expressed hope that vegetation could be encouraged on the parched island.“That barrenness is too much of a reminder of our grief and our suffering, and moving forward, we have to go beyond the pain and the agony and the suffering. Although we will never forget it, it is a tremendous opportunity for healing and setting an example for unlimited possibilities for future generations,” she said.Princess Eulogia Gordon, 35, a California publicist and Garifuna campaigner, described the news as an opportunity for unity.“Baliceaux doesn’t just belong to us. This is bigger than us. This is truly about unity and family and togetherness,” she said.Explore more on these topicsSt Vincent and the GrenadinesAmericasIndigenous peoplesnewsShareReuse this content"

Los Angeles police said Wedding’s operation also moved “five metric tonnes of fentanyl per month” to US and Canadian cities.Wedding and fellow Canadian Andrew Clark are also accused of hiring hitmen to murder those the pair believed were obstacles to their operation, including a man murdered sitting in his car in the driveway of his home, who police said had drug debts.But in one case, officials say two victims were the inadvertent targets of retaliation for a stolen drug shipment.In 2023, gunmen attacked a rental home in Caledon, Ontario, killing Jagtar Singh Sidhu, 57, and Harbhajan Kaur Sidhu, 55, who had arrived to Canada four months earlier. Their daughter Jaspreet Kaur Sidhu,was shot 13 timesand left critically injured.Of the 16 defendants sought by police, Wedding and another are the only ones still on the loose.Clark was arrested on 8 October 2024 by Mexican law enforcement and was transferred on 27 February to the United States.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMexicoDrugsDrugs tradeSnowboardingOlympic GamesAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Top retail CEOs have also beenbracing customers for significant price increasesin grocery stores within days.After a call with Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, Trump declared: “Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything” that falls under an existing trade deal between the US, Mexico andCanadaknown as USMCA.Tariffs are not paid by countries, but importers – in this case, US companies – that buy products from businesses in the targeted countries.Hours later, Trump signed an amendment which extended the same relief to Canada until 2 April. Earlier in the day he had pointedly attacked Justin Trudeau, his Canadian counterpart, claiming he was “using the Tariff problem” to stay in office.Trump said the reversal has “nothing to do” with turbulence in the stock market in recent days, as investors weigh his economic plans. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 1.8% on Thursday. “I’m not even looking at the market,” he claimed.During the president’sjoint address to Congresson Tuesday evening, he acknowledged that tariffs would cause disruption. There will be “a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that”, he said.Trump had initially pledged to target Canada andMexicowith tariffs on his first day back in office. Upon his return, however, he said he was considering imposing the tariffs at the start of February. Last month, he offered Canada and Mexico a one-month delay at the 11th hour.Only on Tuesday did hepull the trigger, imposing 25% duties all goods from Mexico, and 25% duties on most goods from Canada, with 10% duties on Canadian energy products. He also doubled a tariff on Chinese exports from 10% to 20%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tech billionaireBill Gatesis listed as a stakeholder in the company.‘A trash can for the US’: anger in Mexico and Canada over toxic waste shipmentsRead moreLast week theQuebecminister of natural resources and forests introduced a bill to force the city to sell the land to allow the expansion to go forward, saying the waste site is about to run out of space and the government must act quickly to avoid a stoppage in hazardous waste disposal.The company says it offers a safe way to dispose of toxic waste that could otherwise pollute the environment, but opposition leaders questioned whetherCanadashould be handling US waste.“We are not the trash can of the United States,” Ruba Ghazal, an opposition member of Quebec’s parliament, said at a press conference. She said it is unacceptable for Quebec’s ruling conservative party to “expropriate a city to give it to Trump’s United States”.The issue has gained attention following aninvestigation last month by the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab, a Mexican investigative unit, which showed the US ships more than a million tons of hazardous waste to Canada and Mexico each year.Opposition to those waste exports is growing at a time when Canadians areactively registeringtheir displeasure with the newadministrationofDonald Trump. Trumphas imposeda 25% tariff on Canadian goods and talked abouttaking overCanada as “the 51st state”. Canadians have variously responded byboycotting pizza ingredientsfrom the US andcanceling their travel plansto their southern neighbor.I can’t understand why the government wants to expropriate the land for the benefit of an American company, especially when we have an alternative solutionLiza Poulin, Blainville mayorA coalition of environmental groups iscalling forCanada to stop accepting US hazardous wastes altogether, saying the government of Canada “must take advantage of the current context of economic tension with our southern neighbours to take a strong stand and put an end to the MASSIVE import of hazardous waste from the United States”.Municipal officials say their immediate concern is protecting about 165 acres (67 hectares) of peat bog and forest land, where Stablex is pushing to expand. They say the company can instead develop what they say is a less environmentally sensitive site nearby, which is owned by the Quebec government and had previously been designated for the expansion.“I can’t understand why the government wants to expropriate the land for the benefit of an American company, especially when we have an alternative solution,” Blainville mayor Liza Poulin said.The landfill, run by Stablex, a subsidiary of the US giant garbage company Republic Services, has operated in the town of Blainville since 1983. In 2023 it received more than 5,000 tons of contaminated soils and sludges from the US, as well 28,000 tons of a variety of substances including cyanide, mercury and nitric acid, according to EPA records obtained through a freedom of information act request. It receives waste from Quebec and other Canadian provinces as well.Quebec business registration recordssay that Gates has 25-50% of voting rights in Stablex. This is because his investment firm holds a large stake in Republic Services, Stablex’s parent company.‘The relationship is broken’: Canadians respond to Trump’s tariffsRead moreA spokesperson for Gates’s investment company declined to comment.The company advertises that it permanently secures hazardous wastes for burial by “treating, stabilizing, and then binding them” before putting them “in a secure placement cell” and promises “to dispose of them permanently and without risk to the environment”.Between 2018 and 2022, Stablex was the largest importer of hazardous waste to Quebec and the second largest importer of hazardous waste in Canada, according to aninvestigation published last week by Le Journal de Quebec, which analyzed the data obtained by the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab.In a February letter to the Quebec premier, the CEO of Stablex said the Blainville site is on track to reach full capacity in 2027 and, unless the company can break ground on a new storage cell by April 2025, it risks facing a service disruption which could leave Quebec industry with nowhere to dispose of its waste.“We cannot emphasize enough the seriousness of the situation,” wrote Stablex CEO Michel Perron. “We have seen in the past situations where materials have been disposed of illegally or in unauthorized locations.”In response, Maïté Blanchette Vézina, Quebec’s minister of natural resources and forests, introduced a bill to force Blainville to sell its land for the expansion. She represents Quebec’s ruling party, which has sufficient votes to approve the bill.Stablex says the city’s parcel of land is needed because the nearby Quebec-owned alternative site is too close to newly constructed neighborhoods and has clay deposits that would have to be removed, requiring 40,000 annual truck trips through the city’s streets each year for the two years of construction.Mexico authorities order factory cleanup after Guardian toxic waste investigationRead more“The Quebec government conducted its own analyses and made its choice in the interest of the Quebec community,” said Maxime Couture, a spokesperson for the company. He said the proportion of hazardous materials coming to the site from the US has fallen from 43% in 2018 to 17% in 2024.City officials noted that Quebec’s environmental watchdog agency released a report last year recommending against the expansion and questioning the company’s stabilization process, which it said was developed 50 years ago and has never been subjected to testing outside a laboratory.An organization of municipal governments for the Montreal region has come out against the bill as well, saying that expropriating land from the city infringes upon local rights and runs counter to regional wildland preservation goals.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmerica's dirty divideWasteTrump tariffsAmericasDonald TrumpTrump administrationQuebecnewsShareReuse this content"

No. But we are not the 51st anything.”Replete with orchestral swells and chest-thumping patriotism, is a remake ofthe famous 2000 advertfor Molson Canadian beer.It features an increasingly enthusiastic “Joe Canadian” working his way through a catalogue of national stereotypes, passing from diffidence to defiance before the original’s climactic cry: “Canada is the second largest landmass! The first nation of hockey! And the best part of North America! My name is Joe! And I am Canadian!”When it first came out, the spot struck a nerve and entered the pantheon of Canadian popular culture.And it has seen a revival sinceDonald Trumpstarted threatening Canada’s sovereignty. The US president’s suggestion that the country might become the 51st US state hasprovoked a wave of patriotic fervour.On Wednesday, fans got a long-anticipated update.Jeff Douglas, the video’s star, said the new version was produced by an anonymous collective of Canadian creatives and advertising professionals.“These are professionals who typically are competitors, coming together, offering what they have, for a common goal … No logos, no brands … the client for this one is Canada.”The new video cycles through images of famous Canadians, including Terry Fox and Gordon Lightfoot,and the Canadian response to catastrophe.“We are the first to unite in the crisis, the first to build bridges – not walls – and the first tostand on guard for thee,” Douglas says in the clip, a reference to Canada’s national anthem.For Douglas, the years between the two videos have seen reflection on the nature of patriotism and the unifying threads ofCanada’s shared – and often dark – past.“Our history, as we were taught, was put together so we would feel good about ourselves and that we’re a force for good in the world. I still think we are a force for good in this world. But certainly, the past 25 years have revealed how we haven’t always done good things. We’ve done some really bad things,” he told the Guardian.After Trump announced 25% taxes on Canadian goods earlier this week, Canada has responded with disbelief, outage and defiance.With the new video, Douglas says the job was simple: “We humbly hope it may be something that can help boost Canadian spirits.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaTrump tariffsAmericasTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

We need a plan B | Zoe DanielRead moreInstead, those nuclear submarines, stationed in Australia, could bear US flags, carry US weapons, commanded and crewed by American officers and sailors.Australia, unswerving ally, reduced instead to a forward operating garrison – in the words of the chair of US Congress’s house foreign affairs committee, nothing more than “a central base of operations from which to project power”.Reliable ally no longerOfficially at least, Aukus remains on course, centrepiece of a storied security alliance.Pillar one of the Australia-UK-US agreement involves, first, Australia buying between three and five Virginia-Class nuclear-powered submarines from the US – the first of these in 2032.Then, by the “late 2030s”, according to Australia’ssubmarine industry strategy, the UK will deliver the first specifically designed and built Aukus submarine. The first Australian-built version will be in the water “in the early 2040s”. Aukus is forecast to cost up to $368bn to the mid-2050s.But in both Washington and Canberra, there is growing concern over the very first step: America’s capacity to build the boats it has promised Australia, and – even if it had the wherewithal to build the subs – whether it would relinquish them into Australian control.We cannot assume that the Americans will always turn upMalcolm TurnbullThe gnawing anxiety over Aukus sits within a broader context of a rewritten rulebook for relations between America and its allies. Amid theSturm und Drangof the first weeks of Trump’s second administration, there is growing concern that the reliable ally is no longer that.With the casual, even brutal, dismissal of Ukraine – an ally for whom the US has provided security guarantees for a generation – the old certainties exist no longer.“I think America is a much less dependable ally under [president] Trump than it was,” the former prime ministerMalcolm Turnbulltells the Guardian this week. “And this is not a criticism of Trump, this is literally a feature, not a bug: he’s saying that he’s less dependable.“It may be that – regrettably – we do end up with no submarines. And then we have to invest in other ways of defending ourselves. But the big message is that we are going to have to look at defending Australia by ourselves.“That’s really the issue. We cannot assume that the Americans will always turn up.”Trump can hardly be accused of hiding his priorities. If the 47th president has a doctrine beyond self-interest, “America First” has been his shibboleth since before his first term.“Our allies have taken advantage of us more so than our enemies,” he said on the campaign trail. Hetold his inauguration: “I will, very simply, put America first.”‘The cheque did clear’On 8 February, Australia paid $US500m ($AUD790m) to the US, the first instalment in a total of $US3bn pledged in order to support America’s shipbuilding industry. Aukus was, Australia’s defence minister Richard Marles said, “a powerful symbol of our two countries working together in the Indo-Pacific”.“It represents a very significant increase of the American footprint on the Australian continent … it represents an increase in Australian capability, through the acquisition of a nuclear‑powered submarine capability … it also represents an increase in Australian defence spending”.US defence secretary Pete Hegseth – joking that “the cheque did clear” – gave succour to Aukus supporters, saying his country’s mission in the Indo-Pacific was not one “that America can undertake by itself”.“Allies and partners, technology sharing and subs are a huge part of it.”But, just three days after Australia’s cheque cleared, theCongressional Research Service quietly issued a papersaying while the nuclear-powered attack submarines (known as SSNs) intended for Australia might be built, the US could decide to never hand them over.View image in fullscreenAn Australian Collins-class submarine. The current ageing fleet was launched in the 1990s.Photograph: Aaron Bunch/AAPIt said the post-pandemic shipbuilding rate in the US was so anaemic that it could not service the needs of the US Navy alone, let alone build submarines for another country’s navy.Under a proposed alternative, “up to eight additional Virginia-class SSNs would be built, and instead of three to five of them being sold to Australia, these additional boats would instead be retained in US Navy service and operated out of Australia along with the five US and UK submarines that are already planned to be operated out of Australia”.The paper argued that Australia, rather than spending money to buy, build and sail its own nuclear-powered submarines, would instead invest that money in other military capabilities – long-range missiles, drones, or bombers – “so as to create an Australian capacity for performing non-SSN military missions for both Australia and the United States”.Onsome forecasts, the US is projected to have half the working submarines it needs in 2032 and is building new boats at half the rate it needs to.Trump believes it can be fixed. He told an address to Congress-cum-campaign rally this week he would “resurrect the American shipbuilding industry” by establishing a new “office of shipbuilding” inside the White House.“We’re going to make them very fast, very soon.”A sunken historySubmarines have long presented logistical and political turmoilfor Australian governments.The country’s first submarine, HMAS AE1, hit the sea floor near Papua New Guinea in September 1914, barely seven months into service. All hands were lost. The second was scuttled by its crew the next year after five days of operations during the Gallipoli campaign.In 1919, Australia was “gifted” six obsolete J-class submarines by Britain. They were sold for scrap within five years. Subsequent decades brought persistent issues with costs and crewing and difficulties simply keeping boats in the water.The nation’s current submarine fleet, the Collins-class fleet, was built over two decades from 1990, with the first boat put to sea in 1996.View image in fullscreenPresident Biden (centre) announcing the Aukus deal with Scott Morrison (l) and Boris Johnson (r) in 2021.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockBut to replace that now-ageing class, three different submarine designs have been pursued by successive governments, with boats to be built by Japan, France and now – under Aukus – the US and UK.Indecision has brought delay, and with it, a capability gap: a vulnerability exposed in recent weeks when a flotilla of Chinese warships – perhaps accompanied by an undetected nuclear submarine – circumnavigated Australia, and undertook allegedly unforecast live-fire drills in the Tasman Sea.‘They have no obligation to sell us a submarine’In 2016 then prime minister Turnbull signed a $50bn deal with the French Naval Group for new diesel-electric submarines to be built in Australia.That agreement – which had subsequently encountered delays and cost over-runs – was unilaterally cancelled by his successor, Scott Morrison, who, in 2021, dramatically signed Aukus with US president Joe Biden and UK prime minister Boris Johnson. None of these men are in office any more.Turnbull argues pillar one of the Aukus deal was a “catastrophe” from conception, and its liabilities “are becoming more apparent every day”.“We are spending a fortune vastly more than the partnership with France would have involved. We’re spending vastly more and we are very likely, I would say almost certainly, going to end up with no submarines at all.“We’re giving the Americans US$3bn to support their submarine industrial base, but they have no obligation to sell us a submarine.”He says Morrison’s agreement to Aukus “sacrificed Australia’s honour, sovereignty and security”.View image in fullscreenThe USS Minnesota, a Virginia-class nuclear submarine, in Rockingham, Western Australia, in February.Photograph: Getty Images“Australia has to be sovereign. It has to have sovereign autonomy. We need to be more self-reliant. Unfortunately, the problem with Aukus was that it made Australia much more dependent on the United States at a time when America was becoming less dependable.”Former prime minister Kevin Rudd, now serving as ambassador to the US, said from Washington DC this week the Aukus deal has been consistently reaffirmed under the newTrump administration, including by the defence secretary, Hegseth, and secretary of state, Marco Rubio.He said Aukus would equip Australia with the “most advanced weaponry in the world”.The submarines “will have … a lethality and utility across the Indo Pacific, which will make Australia more secure in the decades ahead”.“This is a multi-decadal, multi-billion dollar investment by the Australian government.”And Rudd told a University of Tennessee audience last month that Aukus was in the interests of both the US and Australia.“The strategic geography of Australia is quite critical to America’s long-term strategic interests in the wider Indo-Pacific. It’s good for us that you’re there,” he told his American audience, “it’s good for you that we are there”.This is a key argument behind the Aukus agreement, bolstering the belief of those who argue it can and will deliver: Aukus is a good deal for America. Bases on Australian soil – most notably Pine Gap and HMAS Stirling (as a base for submarines) – are critical for US “force projection” in the Indo-Pacific.But the same argument in favour of Aukus is also used by its critics: that Australia is being exploited for its geo-strategic location – as an outpost ofUS militarymight.‘Almost inevitable’Clinton Fernandes, professor of international and political Studies at the University of New South Wales and a former Australian Army intelligence analyst, says the Aukus deal only makes sense when the “real” goal of the agreement is sorted from the “declared”.“The real rather than declared goal is to demonstrate Australia’s relevance to US global supremacy,” he tells the Guardian.“The ‘declared goal’ is that we’re going to become a nuclear navy. The ‘real goal’ is we are going to assist the United States and demonstrate our relevance to it as it tries to preserve an American-dominated east Asia.”The dangerous folly of Australia’s come-what-may sycophancy towards Trump is on full display | Paul DaleyRead moreFernandes, author of Sub-Imperial Power, says Australia will join South Korea and Japan as the US’s “sentinel states in order to hold Chinese naval assets at risk in its own semi-enclosed seas”.“That’s the real goal. We are demonstrating our relevance to American global dominance. The government is understandably uneasy about telling the public this, but in fact, it has been Australia’s goal all along to preserve a great power that is friendly to us in our region.”Fernandes says the Aukus pillar one agreement “was always an article of faith” based on a premise that the US could produce enough submarines for itself, as well as for Australia.“And the Congressional Research Service study argues that … they will not have enough capacity to build boats for both themselves and us.”He argues the rotation of US nuclear-powered submarines through Australian bases – particularly HMAS Stirling in Perth – needs to be understood as unrelated to Aukus and to Australia developing its own nuclear-powered submarine capability.“Submarine Rotational Force-West(SRF-W) is presented by the spin doctors as an ‘optimal pathway’ for Aukus. In fact, it is the forward operational deployment of the United States Navy, completely independent of Aukus. It has no connection to Aukus.”The retired rear admiral and past president of the Submarine Institute of Australia, Peter Briggs, argues the US refusing to sell Virginia-class submarines to Australia was “almost inevitable”, because the US’s boat-building program was slipping too far behind.“It’s a flawed plan, and it’s heading in the wrong direction,” he tells the Guardian.Before any boat can be sold to Australia, the US commander-in-chief – the president of the day – must certify that America relinquishing a submarine will not diminish the US Navy’s undersea capability.“The chance of meeting that condition is vanishingly small,” Briggs says.View image in fullscreenA French navy Suffren-class nuclear attack submarine undergoing testing. Experts say these could a viable alternative to the promised Aukus nuclear submarines.Photograph: Cindy Motet/Naval Group/AFP/Getty ImagesIt now takes the US more than five years to build a single submarine (it was between three and 3.5 years before the pandemic devastated the workforce). By 2031, when the US is set to sell its first submarine to Australia, it could be facing a shortfall of up to 40% of the expected fleet size, Briggs says.Australia, he argues, will be left with no submarines to cover the retirement from service of the current Collins-class fleet, weakened by an unwise reliance on the US.The nuclear-powered submarines Australia wants to buy and then build “are both too big, too expensive to own and we can’t afford enough of them to make a difference”.He argues Australia must be clear-eyed about the systemic challenges facing Aukus and should look elsewhere. He nominates going back to France to contemplate ordering Suffren-class boats – a design currently in production, smaller and requiring fewer crew, “a better fit for Australia’s requirements”.“We should have done all this 10 years ago. Of course, it’s too late, but the alternative is no submarines at all … that’s not a good idea. They give us a capability that nothing else does.“It’s worth the hunt.”Explore more on these topicsAukusAustralian militaryUS militaryAsia PacificMalcolm TurnbullKevin RuddDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The drills are intended to prepare the allies for any potential conflict with the North, which views them as a preparation for an invasion.The live-fire exercises were suspended while military authorities tried to establish the cause of the incident.Pocheon’s disaster response centre said six civilians, including two people from Thailand and Myanmar, had been injured and were being treated at hospitals. Several other civilians reportedly suffered feelings of anxiety.Some of the victims sustained fractures to their necks and shoulders, according to News1. None of the injuries are thought to be life-threatening.Local people have long complained about the noise and disruption, as well as the potential danger posed by military exercises.One man, who gave only his surname, Park, told Yonhap news agency he had been at home watching television when the accident happened.“I suddenly heard an enormous explosion, like a thunderclap, and the whole house shook. When I went outside, everything was in chaos,” Park said.View image in fullscreenThe incident occurred at about 10am local time.Photograph: Jeon Heon-Kyun/EPACheon Man-ho, 68, who lives about 20 metres from where one of the bombs fell, said he initially thought war had broken out.“The roof collapsed, windows shattered, and trees were all broken,” Cheon told the Chosun Ilbo newspaper. “When I went to see what was happening, everything was destroyed and black smoke was rising.”Lee Poong-seop, 65, who has run a car business in the village for 30 years, described the moment of impact. “I was cleaning the car centre when suddenly there was a ‘boom’ sound and the building shook violently,” he told News1. “I’ve lived here my whole life but never heard such a loud sound.”The military cordoned off the area to check for unexploded bombs, prompting an evacuation order, but later confirmed all eight bombs had detonated.Photographs from the scene showed shattered windows and a church building strewn with debris. Local media reported that five homes, a warehouse, a greenhouse and a 1-tonne truck were also damaged.The air force said it had established an accident response committee to investigate the incident and would “take all necessary measures, including compensation for damages”.The national fire agency said the bombs were “presumed to have fallen on a village during a South Korea-US joint exercise”. This resulted “in many displaced residents”, it added.People at a centre for senior citizens felt the impact, even though it is located about 1km from the scene.“A sudden explosion shook the building. The windows shattered, and one of our teachers was injured and taken to the hospital,” the centre’s director, surnamed Yu, told Yonhap. “Fortunately, none of the seniors were hurt, but they were so frightened that we sent them all home.”North and South Korea remain technically at war since their 1950-3 conflict ended in an armistice but not a peace treaty.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

We advise the US to put away its bullying face and return to the right track of dialogue and cooperation as soon as possible.”China sets GDP target of 5% for 2025 amid tariff war with TrumpRead moreThe comments about “any other war” were shared on X by the spokesperson for ministry of foreign affairs. The post was then re-posted by the Chinese embassy in the United States. The embassy reiterated the message, writing: “If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.”Asked on Wednesday to clarify what he meant by “any other war”, Lin said: “If the US has other intentions and insists on damaging China’s interests, we will fight to the end. We advise the US to put away its bullying face and return to the right track of dialogue and cooperation as soon as possible.”China strongly objects to Trump’s attempts to link the tariffs to the flow of fentanyl from China to the US. Lin said that the fentanyl issue was “an excuse” for the US to impose harsh trade measures on China.China retaliated this week byimposing duties of up to 15%on a range of US agricultural products.On Wednesday, China’s State Council published a white paper titled: “Controlling Fentanyl-Related Substances – China’s Contribution”. The paper said that “China rigorously meets its international drug control obligations” and that counter-narcotics operations are “a central focus of cooperation between China and the US”. In 2019,China scheduled all forms of fentanyl, making it the only major country to permanently include the drugs on a list of controlled substances. But the White Housesaysthat “Chinese officials have failed to take the actions necessary to stem the flow of precursor chemicals” to organised crime groups such as drugs cartels in Mexico.Lin’s fiery comments come as China is hosting itsbiggest annual political event, thetwo sessions. The name refers to parallel meetings of China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress, and a top advisory body. The events are tightly choreographed and normally do not include aggressive “wolf warrior” rhetoric such as Lin’s comments. At the opening ceremony of the NPC, Premier Li Qiang delivered the government’s work report, which said that the world was seeing “changes unseen in a century”.Explore more on these topicsChinaDonald TrumpAsia PacificUS foreign policyTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

You chose dishonour, yet you will have war’,” Goff said.James Cameron says US under Trump is ‘horrifying’ as he becomes New Zealand citizenRead more“President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history?” Goff asked, which garnered laughs from the audience.Speaking to the media on Thursday, New Zealand’s foreign minister Winston Peters said it was “seriously regrettable” that he had been forced to act over Goff’s remarks and would have done so had he made them about any other nation’s leader. Peters said Goff’s comments were “disappointing” and made the envoy’s position “untenable.”“When you’re in that position, you represent the views of the government and the policies of the day – you’re not able to free-think, you are the face of New Zealand,” he said.The secretary of foreign affairs and trade, Bede Corry, would now work through with Goff “the upcoming leadership transition” Peters’ office said.The move comes as New Zealand attempts to keep its relationship with the US – one of its largest export markets – on track against a wider backdrop of unease over the Trump administration’s treatment of its allies.This week, prime minister Christopher Luxon told mediahe trusted Trump, but would continue to “act in our own national interests”.Goff, a former Labour party leader and former Auckland mayor, was appointed to the role in 2022, during Jacinda Ardern’s administration. His term was due to finish towards the end of 2025 but that date has now been brought forward.In a post to social media, former prime minister Helen Clark said it was “a very thin excuse for sacking a highly respected former [New Zealand] foreign minister.”It is not the first faux-pas Goff has made during his time in the role. During an event for a delegation of New Zealanders attending the coronation of King Charles in May 2023, Goff offended the Māori King, Kīngi Tūheitia, who was present, by saying no one in the room had experienced a coronation before.The Guardian attempted to reach Goff through the ministry of foreign affairs. In a statement the ministry said it was in discussion with Goff about his return to New Zealand and had no further comments.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandDonald TrumpAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

She said passengers were told their luggage would be delivered to them later. The airport was in lockdown.Jetstar said it was working with police and the airport to understand what happened.Explore more on these topicsVictoriaAustralian police and policingnewsShareReuse this content"

Do not underestimate this storm.”Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Matthew Collopy said Alfred had “doubled back on its path” in the early hours of Thursday before resuming towards the coast, and that its crossing had been delayed by about 24 hours.Collopy said it was important not to get “hung up” on the precise crossing time because impacts would occur before and after.Collopy said if Alfred crossed the coast at high tide, storm surges of up to 1.5 metres were possible, with parts of Redland Bay and Gold Coast likely to be most at risk.“The hazards, including the wind, rainfall, storm surge and flooding remain, and we expect them to develop through the day today as the system approaches the coast,” Callopy said.“What we’ve seen overnight, in terms of the erratic movement of the system, reiterates the fact this is an evolving situation.”View image in fullscreenForecast track map for Tropical Cyclone Alfred as of 4.46pm AEST, Thursday 6 March.Illustration: Bureau of MeteorologyThe Queensland premier, David Crisafulli, said there had already been 700 requests for SES assistance and urged Queenslanders to use the additional time to double-check their preparations.“I have spent a bit of time on the ground yesterday and the message is certainly getting out there,” he said. “I want to thank people for that.

They are prepositioned and they are able to respond, but it is now important that communities understand their risk and start to put plans in place not only for the cyclone … but also for flash flooding and riverine flooding.”The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said Alfred was behaving “like a completely unwanted house guest”.“It’s going to be late but linger even longer. Unfortunately that means the window for destruction in our community – heavy rains, winds, powerful surf – is longer than we would have otherwise liked.”The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he had spoken with the mayor of Lismore, Steve Krieg, overnight.“He spoke about what a tough night he’s had with himself and his partner. They are still in recovery mode. They’ve had hit after hit after hit,” Albanese said.“At the worst of times we always see the best of Australian character. I said yesterday that there were no political parties in this process and there are no borders. Tropical Cyclone Alfred certainly does not recognise any borders and nor should the government’s response.”Residents who choose to evacuate their home are urged to stay with friends or family if possible. There have been more than 26 emergency centres established in Queensland and more in NSW. An evacuation centre has been erected at Southern Cross University on Military Road in East Lismore.This article was amended on 7 March 2025. An earlier version stated there had been a record 12.3 metre wave at Main beach on the Gold Coast. The Queensland government subsequently said that erroneous reading was due to a damaged monitoring buoy.Explore more on these topicsTropical Cyclone AlfredQueenslandAustralia weathernewsShareReuse this content"

It’s up to them from there.” Adult frogs measure up to six-centimetres long.Once abundant, the species – found only on a “really small patch of real estate on the Baw Baw plateau” – had suffered a 98%population crashmainly due to a disease called thechytrid fungus, Gilbert said. They also faced overlapping threats due to climate change, historic logging practices and development.Map showing the location of the Baw Baw plateau east of MelbourneDr Kirsten Parris, a professor and amphibian ecologist at the University of Melbourne, said the Baw Baw frog was one of the rarest of Victoria’s 38 frog species. Very few people had heard or seen the “super cute” and “chunky” frog, she said, given its small distribution in a relatively remote part of the state.No Baw Baw frogs were recorded in a recent citizen science frog censuscalled Frog Month Victoria, she said, which received more than 1,200 records of frog calls from all parts of the state. They did, however, receive some calls of another nationally listed species – the vulnerable growling grass frog – from parts of Melbourne and the Bellarine peninsula.Deadly skin-eating fungal disease wipes out 90 amphibian species in 50 yearsRead moreBaw Baw frogs had developed some specialised reproductive strategies, Parris said, which made it harder for populations to recover from threats such as chytrid fungus.“It lays eggs in little nests in moist areas. The tadpoles have a semi-terrestrial life and then turn into little frogs,” she said.View image in fullscreenOne of the froglets, known as metamorphs, which measure 6-7mm long.Photograph: Jo Howell/Jo Howell/Zoos VictoriaThey put additional effort into making their eggs, but lay fewer – about 100 – compared with more common frogs, such as the pobblebonk frog that lays more than 1,000.In the wild, the Baw Baw frog’s entire reproductive cycle happens underground in the absence of sunlight, Gilbert said. Tadpoles, which are “pure white” from the lack of sunlight, survive thanks to huge yolk sacs.It could take four to six years for recently released froglets to reach maturity, he said. If they survived to adulthood, some might live up to15 years old.Gilbert was quietly optimistic the new batch could help bolster wild populations, after successfully returning smaller numbers of frogs in recent years. A recent survey undertaken at a trial release site – a patch of suitable habitat where no wild Baw Baw frogs had been recorded – revealed the zoo-bred froglets were capable of surviving in the wild.“I couldn’t believe it, to be honest, when we went in to start surveying and were having all these frogs call back at us for the first time,” he said.View image in fullscreenA release site for the Baw Baw frogs. Finding the tiny frogs is ‘almost impossible’ without the help of detector dogs and radio transmitters.Photograph: Jo Howell/Jo Howell/Zoos VictoriaFinding frogs in the forest was “almost impossible”, Gilbert said, particularly Baw Baws, which had a penchant for hiding under soil and leaf litter. So to help with tracking, the adult frogs were released fitted with radio transmitters attached to a small belt around their hips.The team would also rely on their trio of specialised wildlife detection dogs – Kip, Finn and Sugar – who were trained to systematically sniff out Baw Baw frogs and sit calmly until their handlers and biologists confirmed the discovery.The zoo’s recovery team plan to check in on the latest arrivals in October, during a small window of time when male Baw Baws would be calling. It will be a long wait until then.These types of recovery programs were a “lesson in patience”, Gilbert said, adding it was important to share hopefulness and optimism when things were going in a positive direction.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsAustralian climate and environment in focusEndangered speciesVictoriaWildlifeConservationAnimalsReptilesnewsShareReuse this content"

He drew comparisons with Napoleon’s failed conquest of Russia.In a solemn address on Wednesday, Macron had warned the French nation that Russia was rearming quickly on the back of its invasion ofUkraineand could attack more countries if it was not firmly deterred, including with the French nuclear umbrella.“I know President Putin well. If he’s reacting like that, it’s because he knows what I said is true,” Macron told reporters at the EU summit in Brussels on Thursday.“He’s making a historical error: Napoleon waged conquests. The only imperialistic power I see in Europe right now is Russia,” he said, responding to a question posed by a Russian journalist in exile in France.Macron said he knew Putin could betray his word, because he had done just that when it did not respect the Minsk agreements signed with France, Germany and Ukraine after the invasion of Crimea in 2014.He also said the reactions in Moscow on Thursday were probably so vociferous because Russia’s intentions to continue waging war with Europe eventually, if a rushed peace treaty in Ukraine is signed, had been uncovered.“He was probably piqued by the fact we’re exposing his game,” Macron said.Responding to a question on Trump’s comments questioning whether France would come to the US’s rescue if it was attacked, Macron said France and other European countries had joined US troops in fighting in Afghanistan after 9/11.“Not only the French, but the Europeans were there when we were called for Afghanistan. And by the way, they weren’t politely warned when (the US left Afghanistan),” Macron said.“We are loyal and faithful allies.”Macron also said he had been approached by other leaders all day during the summit in about his offer to extend French nuclear deterrence to the rest ofEuropeand hopes to see cooperation by the end of the first half of 2025, after technical talks with other leaders.He has invited other EU leaders to a meeting of European army leaders in Paris on Tuesday, he said.ShareUpdated at19.04 EST"

Last month he issued an executive order to revamp the US foreign service to ensure “faithful and effective” implementation of his foreign policy agenda.During his electoral campaign, he had repeatedly pledged to “clean out” what he refers to as “the deep state” by firing bureaucrats that he deems disloyal.Critics say the potential cuts in the US diplomatic footprint coupled withthe dismantlingof the US Agency for International Development (USAid) that provided billions of dollars worth of aid globally risk undermining American leadership and leaves a dangerous vacuum for adversaries like China and Russia to fill.Trump and Musk say the US government is too big and American taxpayer-funded aid has been spent in a wasteful and fraudulent way.Leipzig, Hamburg and Dusseldorf in Germany, Bordeaux and Strasbourg in France, and Florence in Italy were among a list of smaller consulates that the state department is considering shutting down, three officials said, adding that could still change as some staff were making a case for them to stay open.Officials said the department on Monday had notified Congress that it plans to shutter its branch in Turkey’s south-eastern city of Gaziantep, a location from which Washington has supported humanitarian work in northern Syria.“The state department continues to assess our global posture to ensure we are best positioned to address modern challenges on behalf of the American people,” a state department spokesperson said.The department operates in more than 270 diplomatic missions worldwide with a total workforce of nearly 70,000, according to its website.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Thank you,” he said, taking laboured breaths as he spoke in his native Spanish, with some words fading away into nothing.It was the first time the world has heard Francis’ voice since the 88-year-old was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital on 14 February.Pilgrims have been gathering in St Peter’s Square every evening to pray for the pope’s recovery. The hundreds of people there on Thursday applauded when they heard his message.TheVaticansaid earlier on Thursday that the Argentine, head of the worldwide Catholic church since 2013, is in a “stable” condition.There had been no repeat of Monday’s respiratory failure, it said, and the pope’s blood work “remained stable”. Francis continued with his breathing exercises and physiotherapy, did not have a fever, and managed to do some work in the morning and afternoon, it said.The Vatican has been providing twice daily updates on the pope’s health, in the morning on how the night went and an evening medical bulletin. But on Thursday it said that “in view of the stability of the clinical picture, the next medical bulletin will be released on Saturday”.Nonetheless, “the doctors are still maintaining a reserved prognosis”, it said, meaning they will not say how they expect his condition to evolve.For the last three nights Francis – who had part of a lung removed as a young man – has worn an oxygen mask to help him sleep. On Thursday morning, as on the previous day, he switched to a less onerous nasal cannula – a plastic tube tucking into his nostrils – which provides high-flow oxygen, a Vatican source said.Francis missed the formal Ash Wednesday celebrations in Rome marking the start of Lent, but took part in a blessing in his private suite on the 10th floor of the Gemelli.The leader of the world’s almost 1.4 billion Catholics has not been seen in public since his hospitalisation – the longest of his papacy. Neither has the Vatican issued any photos, although Francis has published several texts.During previous hospitalisations, the pope appeared on the Gemelli balcony for his weekly Angelus prayer at noon on Sundays. But he has missed the last three, and no announcement has yet been made about whether he will make an appearance this weekend.The Vatican confirmed on Thursday that senior cardinal Michael Czerny would stand in for the pope and lead the mass marking the first Sunday of Lent.The mass was also part of celebrations for the Jubilee 2025, a Holy Year led by the pope, dedicated this weekend to volunteers.The Holy See said on Thursday that the event “takes on an even deeper meaning, as the thoughts and prayers of all the brothers and sisters turn to the Holy Father and the experience he is going through”.Pilgrims will pray in front of the hospital on Saturday, it said, as well-wishers have done since Francis was admitted.The pope was initially diagnosed with bronchitis but it developed into pneumonia in both lungs, sparking alarm across the globe.On 22 February, he suffered a “prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis” and on 28 February had “an isolated crisis of bronchospasm” – a tightening of the muscles that line the airways in the lungs.On Monday, Francis “experienced two episodes of acute respiratory failure, caused by a significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and consequent bronchospasm”, according to the Vatican.Francis’s health has regularly led to speculation, particularly among his critics, as to whether he could resign like his predecessor, Benedict XVI.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisVaticanCatholicismChristianityItalyEuropeReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

Macron said Russia reacted the way it did tohis speech warning that Russian aggression “knows no borders”because it was true.The European show of unity was marred by Hungary’s prime minister,Viktor Orbán, failing to endorse an EU statement on Ukraine pushing back against Trump’s Russia-friendly negotiating stance.The 26 other EU leaders, including Orbán’s ally Robert Fico, the Slovakian prime minister, “firmly supported” the statement. “There can be no negotiations onUkrainewithout Ukraine,” said the statement, a response to Trump’s attempt to sideline Europe and Kyiv.The European Council president António Costa, who called the meeting, said: “Hungary has a different strategic approach on Ukraine, but that means Hungary is isolated among the 27.”Arriving at the summit, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had originally been scheduled to join by video link, said: “We are very thankful that we are not alone.”Europe can’t just hope for the best with Trump. Ukraine needs all the arms we can send | Frans TimmermansRead moreThe European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, who presented to leaders an €800bn (£670bn) plan to increase European defence spending, said it was “a watershed moment for Europe” and also for Ukraine.Von der Leyen later told reporters that if Trump wanted “peace through strength” this would only be possible with the EU and its member states “because preconditions have to be met”. There were “many examples that show how important the support of Europe is to come to a positive end”, she said citing EU economic, military aid and support to keep Ukraine’s energy system running.Earlier in the day, Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, set the tone of the meeting. “Spend, spend, spend on defence and deterrence,” she said. “That is the most important message, and at the same time, of course, continue to support Ukraine, because we want peace in Europe.”0:47'About damn time': EU parliament president on plans to raise European military spending – videoZelenskyy shook leaders’ hands and was embraced by several around the table at the start of the meeting. It was a stark contrast to the hostility from Washington, where US officials doubled down on the decision tocut intelligence sharing with Ukraine.The US envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said it had been done to show the US was serious about ending the war. “The best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a two by four across the nose. You get their attention,” he said.Separately, Ukrainian opposition leaders confirmed they hadmet members of Trump’s entourage, but they denied seeking to remove Zelenskyy from power.Addressing EU leaders, Zelenskyy said: “The real question for any negotiations is whether Russia is capable of giving up the war,” as he noted Russia was increasing military spending, growing its army and “making no pauses in trying to overcome sanctions”.Zelenskyy later said on social media he planned to visit Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. “After that, my team will stay in Saudi Arabia to work with our American partners,” he wrote. “Ukraine is most interested in peace. As we told POTUS, Ukraine is working and will continue to work constructively for a swift and reliable peace.”2:46'They brought it on themselves': US envoy blames Zelenskyy for intel and aid pause – videoThe EU special summit was called last week after Trump embarked on his direct diplomacy with Vladimir Putin, but before the US president’sbullying encounterwith Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and the suspension of US military aid.EU leaders largely endorse theplan to “rearm Europe”outlined by von der Leyen earlier this week, although the €800bn is highly theoretical, depending on decisions by member states.“Europe must become more sovereign, more responsible for its own defence and better equipped to act and deal autonomously with immediate and future challenges and threats,” the final conclusions state. The EU “will accelerate the mobilisation of the necessary instruments and financing” to boost security and “reinforce its overall defence readiness [and] reduce its strategic dependencies”.Arriving at the summit, von der Leyen told reporters: “Europe faces a clear and present danger, and therefore Europe has to be able to protect itself, to defend itself, as we have to put Ukraine in a position to protect itself and to push for a lasting and just peace.”The commission has said its plan is worth€800bn, including a €150bn loan scheme secured against unused funds in the EU budget, as well as greater flexibilities in the EU’s fiscal rules that could unlock €650bn in new spending.Member states would still have to agree to the €150bn loans scheme, while it is unclear if governments would make full use of the €650bn financial leeway the commission suggests.Some of the money could be used by EU countries to finance military aid for Ukraine. “The best security guarantees are the Ukrainians themselves,” Costa said, although EU diplomats privately acknowledge Europe will not be able to fill the gap left by the withdrawal of US military aid.Pressure is growing on all countries to increase national defence budgets, especially the seven EU Nato members, including Spain and Italy, that are below the 2% target set more than a decade ago. Belgium’s new prime minister, Bart De Wever, said his country was “an extremely poor pupil” and “getting a slap on the wrist that we deserve”.In a seismic shift, Germany’s probable next coalition partners, the CDU-CSU and SPD, have agreed to change the country’s “debt brake” toallow increased spending on defence, heralding billions for armaments production. Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, the fiscal hawk turned defence spending advocate, met von der Leyen and Costa before the summit, although he is not yet at the table.The current German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who represents Germany as coalition talks continue, said there appeared to be growing consensus on changing the German constitution toallow greater defence spending. The unexpected move from Berlin has left Germany’s frugal-minded allies scrambling to understand the ramifications.Scholz gave a cool response to Emmanuel Macron’s proposal to allow European allies to shelter under the French nuclear umbrella, saying Europe should not give up on US involvement. Merz, however, has said he wants to discuss with Paris and London whether British and French nuclear protectioncould be extended to Germany.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeUkraineUrsula von der LeyenDonald TuskViktor OrbánEmmanuel MacronnewsShareReuse this content"

One European diplomat said: “We will know very soon if the US has set its face against helping Europe, and what its explanation is.”As the French president,Emmanuel Macron, put it in his patriotic address on Wednesday night: “I want to believe that the United States will remain at our side. But we must be ready if that is not the case.” In saying this, he caught the spirit of the Brussels summit, and the new mood in Germany being led by the chancellor-elect, Friedrich Merz.It is, so far as relations with Washington are concerned, a mood of optimism of the will combined with pessimism of the intellect. It requires Europe to prepare for a severance with the US, and one that may come much sooner than Nato planners had envisaged.Specifically, it requires European nations to upend their economies and throw out their fiscal debt rules that once seemed immutable, even if it risks a confrontation with the bond markets as well as part of their electorates. “Whatever it takes,” theslogan coined by Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, to get Europe through the eurozone crisis, is being revived to get Europe through this security crisis.But in a sense, diplomats say, as with the eurozone crisis this is not just about money, or even transferring resources to spend more on defence over the next four years, critical as this will be. This is about political will, and taking the mental leap of independence from America. One western diplomat said: “Macron was probably right in his talk of European strategic autonomy. We have wasted seven years not building a European defence capability, and now we must make up for lost time.”The first stage is to put Donald Trump on the back foot by showing that Ukraine is not the war party, as claimed by the US vice-president, JD Vance. Kyiv’s proposal for an immediate pause in the fighting covering sea, air and energy installations is backed by Macron and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer. The aim is to flushVladimir Putinout and try to show the White House that the obstruction to a ceasefire and a just deal lies in Moscow and not Ukraine.One European diplomat said: “With Trump only putting pressure on Ukraine to negotiate, no questions have been asked of Putin’s terms for a deal, and no pressure has been applied on him by the White House. It is outrageous.”The second stage is to consider what Europe, probably allied with Turkey, Canada and even Australia, can do to help Ukraine if the US refuses to provide the backstop, or to end the pause on its supply of weapons to Ukraine. Can Europe self-assemble a short-term package of ammunition, weaponry and intelligence that acts as a substitute for what the US supplied and at least buysVolodymyr Zelenskyysome time? European countries insist they can send to Ukraine this year at least 1.5m rounds of artillery ammunition, air defence systems and missiles, drones and other equipment.An additional proposal is to challenge Trump to sell to Europe the arms he is refusing to supply to Ukraine. If Washington rejected such a highly commercial offer it would reveal that Trump’s concern was not the cost to the American budget of helping Ukraine, but something more geo-strategic. The seizure of Russian central bank assets to fund this has not yet been ruled out, diplomats say, but will be discussed later.But either way, it is the speed of irreversible events, notably in Germany as much as Brussels, that have diplomats on the back foot.German concerns about debt, born of historical fears around Weimar-era inflation, arebeing hurled out the window. Merz’s Christian Democratic Union campaigned right up to election day on a promise to make budget savings while Olaf Scholz insisted lifting the restrictive debt brake rules in the German constitution was unavoidable. The SPD badly lost the election, but triumphantly won on the policy when Merz did a post-election volte face.In a bid to push the extra spending through, and knowing they lack the required two-thirds majority to change the debt rule in the newly elected Bundestag, the SPD and CDU are rushing the change through the outgoing Bundestag elected in 2021.It is a head spinning change. It is also deeply ironic that an election triggered largely by acoalition dispute about spending an extra €8bn-€9bn(£6.7bn-£7.5bn) has ended with an agreement to set up an off-the-books €100bn infrastructure fund over 10 years. Moreover, this is all being proposed by Merz, the most staunch Atlanticist in the CDU.But Germany now openly questions where Trump’s loyalties lie, and even if he will be seen in Red Square on 9 May alongside Putin on the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war.Indeed it is unlikely Merz would disagree with the Ukrainian ambassador to London, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who told a Chatham House conference: “We see that it is not only Russia and the axis of evil trying to destroy the world order, but the US is actually destroying it completely.”The Ukrainian envoy, a former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, added that talks between the US and Russia – the latter of which was “headed by a war criminal” in Putin – showed the White House was making “steps towards the Kremlin regime, fully realising that in this case Europe could be a new target for Russia”.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionDefence policyDonald TrumpUkraineJohn HealeyEmmanuel MacronFriedrich MerzanalysisShareReuse this content"

Their scheme had included sabotaging and disabling the power grid, an operation they named “Silent Night”.They hoped that in the ensuing chaos they would be joined by disgruntled members of the security forces.Adherents of the Reichsbürger movement claim the German empire, which collapsed in 1918, still exists.Other cases have been launched by courts in Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart. Some have led to convictions, while others are continuing.The eclectic movement of malcontents and gun enthusiasts wasled by a minor aristocrat and businessman, Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss.The alleged putschists are said to have taken inspiration from the global QAnon movement.The Koblenz court also found two of the main defendants guilty of weapons offences and one of planning a serious act of violence endangering the state.The men were arrested in April 2022 and the woman in October that year. The trial began in May 2023.Last April, German prosecutors said they had charged a sixth suspect in the kidnap plot.Nancy Faeser, the interior minister, said: “The investigations into this terrorist group have revealed an abyss. The violent plans for a coup, for attacks on the electricity infrastructure, for the kidnapping of health minister Karl Lauterbach and for the killing of his bodyguards have shown an enormous threat.”She said security services took “threats posed by the Citizens of the Reich scene seriously and are acting accordingly. We are protecting our democracy”.Explore more on these topicsGermanyThe far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I can hear helicopters, artillery and even mortars,” he said.Syria’s new government has been engaged in sporadic fighting with former Assad militias since rebels led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) forced the dictator from power on 8 December.A total of fifteen people were killed fighting in Deraa, south Syria, on Tuesday and Wednesday, after government forces attempted to enter a town controlled by a pro-Assad militia, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Grenades were also thrown at security officers in Latakia province on Wednesday.The new government, led bypresident Ahmed al-Sharaa, the former HTS leader, has conducted what it calls “combing” operations to catch Assad-affiliated officers. Low-level officers and soldiers were offered clemency after they turned in their weapons to the state, but anyone implicated in war crimes is subject to arrest.The Assad regime relied on a network of militias loyal to local strongmen to enforce its grip over the country during Syria’s 14-year civil war. The decentralised nature of those militias has made it difficult for Syria’s new rulers to completely dismantle the former regime’s military forces. Instead, many groups have merely been driven underground.Security forces were attacked on Thursday by groups affiliated with Suhail al-Hassan, an infamous Syrian army officer who commanded the elite “Tiger Forces” division, according to the country’s state news service.Security officers also arrested Maj Gen Ibrahim Huwaija, the former head of the air force intelligence branch who was accused of carrying outthe 1977 assassination of the Lebanese politician Kamal Jumblatt.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The model was still being trained in the second half of last year. It is not clear whether it has yet been deployed.The efforts to build the large language model (LLM) – a deep learning system that generates human-like text – were partially revealed in a little-noticed public talk by a former military intelligence technologist who said he oversaw the project.“We tried to create the largest dataset possible [and] collect all the data the state of Israel has ever had in Arabic,” the former official, Chaked Roger Joseph Sayedoff, told an audience at a military AI conference in Tel Aviv last year. The model, he said, required “psychotic amounts” of data.Three former intelligence officials with knowledge of the initiative confirmed the LLM’s existence and shared details about its construction. Several other sources described how Unit 8200 used smaller-scale machine learning models in the years before launching the ambitious project – and the effect such technology has already had.“AI amplifies power,” said a source familiar with the development of Unit 8200’s AI models in recent years. “It’s not just about preventing shooting attacks, I can track human rights activists, monitor Palestinian construction in Area C [of the West Bank]. I have more tools to know what every person in the West Bank is doing.”Details of the new model’s scale sheds light on Unit 8200’s large-scale retention of the content of intercepted communications, enabled by what current and former Israeli and western intelligence officials described as its blanket surveillance of Palestinian telecommunications.The project also illustrates how Unit 8200, like many spy agencies around the world, is seeking to harness advances in AI to perform complex analytical tasks and make sense of the huge volumes of information they routinely collect, which increasingly defy human processing alone.View image in fullscreenA signal intelligence-gathering installation of Unit 8200, an Israeli intelligence corps unit responsible for collecting signal intelligence and code decryption, located on an observation point on the Israeli-Lebanese border near Rosh HaNikra crossing.Photograph: Eddie Gerald/AlamyBut the integration of systems such as LLMs in intelligence analysis has risks as the systems can exacerbate biases and are prone to making mistakes, experts and human rights campaigners have warned. Their opaque nature can also make it difficult to understand how AI-generated conclusions have been reached.Zach Campbell, a senior surveillance researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW), expressed alarm that Unit 8200 would use LLMs to make consequential decisions about the lives of Palestinians under military occupation. “It’s a guessing machine,” he said. “And ultimately these guesses can end up being used to incriminate people.”A spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the new LLM, but said the military “deploys various intelligence methods to identify and thwart terrorist activity by hostile organisations in the Middle East”.A vast pool of Arabic-language communicationsUnit 8200 has developed an array of AI-powered tools in recent years. Systems such asThe GospelandLavenderwere among those rapidly integrated into combat operations in the war in Gaza, playing a significant role in the IDF’s bombardment of the territory by assisting with the identification of potential targets (both people and structures) for lethal strikes.For almost a decade, the unit has also used AI to analyse the communications it intercepts and stores, using a series of machine learning models to sort information into predefined categories, learn to recognise patterns and make predictions.After OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022, AI experts at Unit 8200 envisaged building a more expansive tool akin to the chatbot. Now one of the world’s most widely used LLMs, ChatGPT is underpinned by so-called “foundation model”, a general-purpose AI trained on immense volumes of data and capable of responding to complex queries.Initially, Israeli military intelligencestruggled to build a model on this scale. “We had no clue how to train a foundation model,” said Sayedoff, the former intelligence official, in his presentation. At one stage, officials sent an unsuccessful request to OpenAI to run ChatGPT on the military’s secure systems (OpenAI declined to comment).However, when the IDF mobilised hundreds of thousands of reservists in response to the Hamas-led 7 October attacks, a group of officers with expertise in building LLMs returned to the unit from the private sector. Some came from major US tech companies, such as Google, Meta and Microsoft. (Google said the work its employees do as reservists was “not connected” to the company. Meta and Microsoft declined to comment.)The small team of experts soon began building an LLM that understands Arabic, sources said, but effectively had to start from scratch after finding that existing commercial and open-source Arabic-language models were trained using standard written Arabic – used in formal communications, literature and media – rather than spoken Arabic.“There are no transcripts of calls or WhatsApp conversations on the internet. It doesn’t exist in the quantity needed to train such a model,” one source said. The challenge, they added, was to “collect all the [spoken Arabic] text the unit has ever had and put it into a centralised place”. They said the model’s training data eventually consisted of approximately 100bn words.One well-placed source familiar with the project told the Guardian this vast pool of communications included conversations in Lebanese as well as Palestinian dialects. Sayedoff said in his presentation the team building the LLM “focused only on the dialects that hate us”.View image in fullscreenAn Israeli soldier from Unit 8200 taking part in a cyber defense challenge event in which teams compete in stopping malicious hackers from invading vital infrastructures in a simulation game in 2016.Photograph: Eddie Gerald/AlamyThe unitalso sought to train the model to understand specific military terminology of militant groups, sources said. But the massive collection of training data appears to have included large volumes of communications with little or no intelligence value about everyday lives of Palestinians.“Someone calling someone and telling them to come outside because they’re waiting for them outside school, that’s just a conversation, that’s not interesting. But for a model like this, it’s gold,” one of the sources said.AI-facilitated surveillanceUnit 8200 is not alone among spy agencies experimenting with generative AI technology. In the US, the CIA hasrolled out a ChatGPT-like toolto sift through open-source information. The UK’s spy agenciesare also developingtheir own LLMs, which it is also said to be training with open-source datasets.But several former US and UK security officials said Israel’s intelligence community appeared to be taking greater risks than its closest allies when integrating novel AI-based systems into intelligence analysis.One former western spy chief said Israeli military intelligence’s extensive collection of the content of Palestinian communications allowed it to use AI in ways “that would not be acceptable” among intelligence agencies in countries with stronger oversight over the use of surveillance powers and handling of sensitive personal data.Campbell, from Human Rights Watch, said using surveillance material to train an AI model was “invasive and incompatible with human rights”, and that as an occupying power Israel is obligated to protect Palestinians’ privacy rights. “We’re talking about highly personal data taken from people who are not suspected of a crime, being used to train a tool that could then help establish suspicion,” he added.Nadim Nashif, director of 7amleh, a Palestinian digital rights and advocacy group, said Palestinians have “become subjects in Israel’s laboratory to develop these techniques and weaponise AI, all for the purpose of maintaining [an] apartheid and occupation regime where these technologies are being used to dominate a people, to control their lives”.Several current and former Israeli intelligence officers familiar with smaller-scale machine learning models used by Unit 8200 – precursors to the foundation model – said AI made the blanket surveillance of Palestinians more effective as a form of control, particularly in the West Bank where they said it has contributed to a greater number of arrests.Two of the sources said the models helped the IDF automatically analyse intercepted phone conversations by identifying Palestinians expressing anger at the occupation or desires to attack soldiers or people living in illegal settlements. One said that when the IDF entered villages in the West Bank, AI would be used to identify people using words it deemed to indicate “troublemaking”.“It allows us to act on the information of many more people, and this allows control over the population,” a third source said. “When you hold so much information you can use it for whatever purpose you want. And the IDF has very few restraints in this regard.”‘Mistakes are going to be made’For a spy agency, the value of a foundation model is that it can take “everything that has ever been collected” and detect “connections and patterns which are difficult for a human to do alone”, said Ori Goshen, co-founder of AI21 Labs. Several of the Israeli firm’s employees worked on the new LLM project while on reserve duty.But Goshen, who previously served in Unit 8200, added:“These are probabilistic models – you give them a prompt or a question, and they generate something that looks like magic. But often, the answer makes no sense. We call this ‘hallucination.’”Brianna Rosen, a former White House national security official and now a senior research associate at Oxford university, notes that while a ChatGPT-like tool could help an intelligence analyst “detect threats humans might miss, even before they arise, it also risks drawing false connections and faulty conclusions”.She said it was vital for intelligence agencies using these tools to be able to understand the reasoning behind the answers they produce. “Mistakes are going to be made, and some of those mistakes may have very serious consequences,” she added.In February, theAssociated Press reportedAI was likely used by intelligence officers to help select a target in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza in November 2023 that killed four people, including three teenage girls. A message seen by the news agency suggested the airstrike had been conducted by mistake.The IDF did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about how Unit 8200 ensures its machine learning models, including the new LLM being developed, do not exacerbate inaccuracies and biases. It also would not say how it protects the privacy rights of Palestinians when training models with sensitive personal data.“Due to the sensitive nature of the information, we cannot elaborate on specific tools, including methods used to process information,” a spokesperson said.“However, the IDF implements a meticulous process in every use of technological abilities,” they added. “That includes the integral involvement of professional personnel in the intelligence process in order to maximize information and precision to the highest degree.”Do you have information about this story?

The remains of eight dead Israeli hostages have also been returned.However, the first phase of the ceasefire ended on Saturday andtalks on the second phase have stalled.The US president’s post came hours after the White House confirmed the US had entered direct negotiations with Hamas, potentially bypassing Israel to secure the release of US hostages still held by the group.Official Israeli reaction to that development was limited to a single-sentence statement late on Wednesday stating that “Israel has expressed to the US its position regarding direct talks with Hamas”.1:02White House confirms US in negotiations with Hamas – videoThe unprecedented direct talks between Hamas and the US appear initially aimed at freeing Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American dual citizen who is thought to be still alive, and securing the return of the remains of four other Israeli-Americans abducted in Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war.Hamas seized about 250 hostages during that attack and killed approximately 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Fifty-nine hostages are still held by Hamas, though Israeli intelligence services believe more than half are dead.Yoram Schweitzer, a Tel Aviv-based analyst and former Israeli intelligence officer, said the contact may create momentum towards resuming the ceasefire agreement.“It has potential benefits. Even in the worst-case scenario – that the Americans just get their people out and then step away – then we are still talking about US-Israeli dual citizens so that’s still more Israelis who are being freed. Even that will help push things forward.”The direct talks are a radical shift for the US. Hamas was proscribed by the US as a terrorist organisation in 1997 and its diplomatic isolation has long been a central principle of Washington’s regional policies and those of allied powers. US sanctions have targeted individuals accused of raising funds for Hamas andthe US last year banned membersof the group, allied armed factions and the Palestine Liberation Organization from visiting.Schweitzer said the Israeli security establishment would be unfazed by US contact with the perpetrators of the October 2023 attacks.“The Americans were dealing with the Taliban and the Iranians despite the facade of not talking to terrorists. We know that sometimes it is a necessary evil. There is a cost of course to a dialogue with Hamas but obviously we understand. The security establishment here understands that very well,” he said.Trump’s ultimatum followed a White House meeting between the US president and a group of hostages recently released by Hamas.Israel wants to prolong the ceasefire, securing the release of hostages but without reaching a final agreement with Hamas on ending the war. Hamas wants to move immediately to the agreed second stage of the ceasefire where the sides would negotiate a definitive end to the fighting.‘Trump Gaza’ AI video intended as political satire, says creatorRead moreTrump reiterated his support for Israel and referred to a recent decision to provide billions more in support for Israeli arms sales. “I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say,” Trump wrote.“This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leaveGaza, while you still have a chance.” He added: “Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!”Trump also made clear there could be repercussions for Gaza as a whole, where more than 48,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed and vast swathes of the territory laid waste during the 16-month Israeli offensive.Since the end of the first phase of the ceasefire, Israel has imposed a total blockade on all goods entering Gaza, demanding Hamas release the remaining hostages without beginning negotiations to end the war.Aid agencies say the humanitarian crisis in the territory remains acute, with needs barely met by the increased flow of aid in late January and last month.Trump wrote: “To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!”Hamas has confirmed the talks with the US, saying there had been two direct meetings between US officials and Hamas in Doha, the Qatari capital, in recent days. White House officials have said Israel was consulted on the “ongoing … discussions” with Hamas.Israel’s consul general in New York, Ofir Akunis, sought to downplay the contacts in an interview with Fox News. “There is a new attitude from the White House … against Hamas. They can talk with Hamas, that’s OK,” he told the network.Many analysts have warned that Netanyahu had little intention of maintaining the agreement because a definitive end to the conflict could threaten his hold on political power within Israel.With Trump in the White House, Netanyahu and his close advisers may also believe they can secure better terms or even the release of more hostages without major concessions.Gideon Saar, Israel’s foreign minister, has denied Israel breached the ceasefire deal by not advancing to stage two talks. He said there was “no automaticity” between the stages and accused Hamas of violating the agreement to allow aid into Gaza by seizing most of the supplies for its own benefit.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaHamasDonald TrumpIsraelUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The order is titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”.The Trump administration’s rollbacks of LGBTQ+ rights have since greatly affected the arts world. Last month, Trumpnamed himself the chairof the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC after accusing it of hosting drag shows that are “specifically targeting our youth”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationArts fundingTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsNational Endowment for the Arts (NEA)Arts policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Top retail CEOs have also beenbracing customers for significant price increasesin grocery stores within days.After a call with Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, Trump declared: “Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything” that falls under an existing trade deal between the US, Mexico andCanadaknown as USMCA.Tariffs are not paid by countries, but importers – in this case, US companies – that buy products from businesses in the targeted countries.Hours later, Trump signed an amendment which extended the same relief to Canada until 2 April. Earlier in the day he had pointedly attacked Justin Trudeau, his Canadian counterpart, claiming he was “using the Tariff problem” to stay in office.Trump said the reversal has “nothing to do” with turbulence in the stock market in recent days, as investors weigh his economic plans. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 1.8% on Thursday. “I’m not even looking at the market,” he claimed.During the president’sjoint address to Congresson Tuesday evening, he acknowledged that tariffs would cause disruption. There will be “a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that”, he said.Trump had initially pledged to target Canada andMexicowith tariffs on his first day back in office. Upon his return, however, he said he was considering imposing the tariffs at the start of February. Last month, he offered Canada and Mexico a one-month delay at the 11th hour.Only on Tuesday did hepull the trigger, imposing 25% duties all goods from Mexico, and 25% duties on most goods from Canada, with 10% duties on Canadian energy products. He also doubled a tariff on Chinese exports from 10% to 20%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Howell continued, “in our constitutional order, the president is tasked to be a conscientious custodian of the law, albeit an energetic one, to take care of effectuating his enumerated duties, including the laws enacted by the Congress and as interpreted by the Judiciary”.Wilcoxfiled the lawsuit early last month, alleging her removal was a “blatant violation” of the National Labor Relations Act, which stipulates that members of the board can only be removed for negligence or misconduct. Her removal left the board with only two members, lacking the quorum of at least three members required to rule on cases.“I’m ready to get back to work,” said Wilcox after the hearing in aspeechoutside the courthouse today. “It’s not just about me, but I’m glad to be the face of this fight.”Her attorney, Deepak Gupta, noted this was the beginning of a long fight.Wilcox wasconfirmedby the Senate in September 2023, and set to serve until August 2028. She sought a declaratory judgment ruling her removal unlawful and an injunction to permit her to complete her appointed term.The White House has defended her removal, and that of the NLRB general counsel, claiming that “these were far-left appointees with radical records of upending longstanding labor law, and they have no place as senior appointees in the Trump administration”.During the hearing, Howell noted that in court, the Trump administration claimed the law prohibiting removal of board members was unconstitutional. Similar arguments have been made in recentlawsuitsagainst the NLRB by SpaceX, Amazon and other employers in response to labor law enforcement actions pursued against the corporations.Howell explained the US supreme court precedent ofHumphrey’s Executor, a 1935 case in which the court ruled that a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission had been unlawfully removed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt.Trump ‘usurping rule of law’ after agency firings, say former US labor watchdogsRead moreFormer NLRB chairs and labor leaderscriticizedthe removal of Wilcox, claiming it violated that precedent set by the supreme court, undermined the independence of the NLRB and in effecthaltedfederal labor law enforcement in the US.The AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, held a rally in support of Wilcox outside the courthouse during Wednesday’s hearing.“A week after taking office, President Trump effectively shut down the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and jeopardized the NLRB’s independence byillegally firing Wilcox, the first Black woman to serve on the Board,” said the AFL-CIO.Explore more on these topicsUS newsLaw (US)Trump administrationWorkers' rightsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

During his first weeks in office, Trump rolled out a spate of pro-fossil fuel policies, while congressional Republicans attacked regulations on the oil and gas industry.It’s the kind of potential industry influence that demands more scrutiny on Capitol Hill but is unlikely to receive it anytime soon, Whitehouse said.Until Republicans took control of the Senate in January, the Democratic senator chaired the budget committee, devoting more than a dozen hearings over two years to the climate crisis. Under his leadership, the committee also helmed an investigation into the oil and gas industry’s history of disinformation alongside the House oversight committee, whichlaunchedthe inquiry in 2021.The probe uncovered hundreds of documents from energy giants ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP, as well as the lobbying groups the American Petroleum Institute and the US Chamber of Commerce, demonstrating that big oil has privately acknowledged its efforts to downplay the dangers of burning fossil fuels and providing what one expert, who testified on the subject before Congress,calledan unprecedented look at the industry’s recent “duplicity”.Even as energy interests voiced support for climate policies, they privately fought to preserve their fossil fuel-heavy business models by lobbying against regulations, the tranche showed. The investigation came as an increasingnumber of cities and states sued big oilfor allegedly lying about the dangers of using fossil fuels. Its findings may have provided new material evidence for the cases.These revelations were only possible because majority parties in the House and Senate have the power to subpoena documents, Whitehouse said.“I don’t think we would have seen any cooperation from the fossil fuel industry without subpoena power,” he said. “When we asked for documents, we in the Senate were told that fossil fuel companies have a constitutional right to conspire with each other.”The Guardian has contacted the American Petroleum Institute and the Chamber of Commerce for comment.WithRepublicansin control of both chambers, Congress is not likely to push for more evidence of oil industry misinformation or political collusion. Whitehouse and other Democratic leaders had also been calling on Joe Biden’s justice department to investigate the fossil fuel industry’s climate disinformation campaign – something not likely to happen under Trump.Reached for comment, the White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said: “President Trump is rooting out corruption and fraud backed by radical [D]emocrats in the name of climate change and is unleashing our natural resources.”As head of the budget committee, Whitehouse was alsolooking intoTrump’s relationship with the oil sector amid concerns about potential ethics violations. He said that a Republican-led Senate is less likely to press for this information.“There is massive corruption within theTrump administration,” said Whitehouse. “It goes right from the White House itself to the cabinet nominees.”The Republican National Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Chris Wright, the head of Trump’s energy department, is a former fracking CEO. His interior department secretary, Doug Burgum, is a promoter of oil and gas. And his pick to head the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Russell Vought, was a key architect of the rightwing policy blueprintProject 2025and “has been a fossil fuel front group stooge for as long as I’ve known of him”, Whitehouse said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under the Biden administration, climate-related spending increased, though oil and gas production also reached record levels.Congressional Democrats may hold “shadow” off-the-books hearings to shine a light on energy interests’ “deception and political collusion”, Whitehouse noted, but their power will be highly limited.A lack of federal leadership, however, doesn’t mean all hope is lost to uncover new findings about the oil industry, he said. State legislatures “have theauthorityto undertake investigations and hold hearings and issue subpoenas”, he said. Some climate accountability lawsuits are also progressing toward a trial, raising the possibility that more information about industrydeceptioncould be unveiled, he said.In the meantime, Whitehouse said he will continue to speak out about climate deception and dangerous pro-fossil fuel policies.“We’ve got to keep the focus on the corruption,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS political financingDemocracy and justiceOil and gas companiesTrump administrationUS politicsRepublicansUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump, too, has acknowledged there would be “a little disturbance” as a result.During an appearance at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, Bessent conceded there could be what he referred to as “a one-time price adjustment” as a result of Trump’s tariffs.“Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream,” he said. The American dream was “the concept that any citizen can achieve prosperity, upward mobility, economic security”, he added. “For too long, designers of multilateral trade deals have lost sight of this.”It comes a few days after Bessent said he was “laser-focused” on high prices in the US. At the weekend, he announced the treasury would recruit an “affordability czar” to help address the issue.“I think President Trump said that he’ll own the economy in six or 12 months, but I can tell you that we are working to get these prices down every day,” Bessenttold Face the Nationon CBS.The US president has already watered down key parts of this week’s US trade onslaught,suspending tariffson Mexico and Canada for carmakers on Wednesday, beforetemporarily halting tariffson many other goods from the two countries on Thursday.Trump has repeatedly pledged to rapidly bring down prices for consumers, and declared during a joint address to Congress on Tuesday evening that he was “fighting every day” to “make America affordable again”.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsMexicoCanadaDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It had previously forecast growth of 1.1% for this year, and 1.4% in 2026.But it lifted its forecast for inflation this year, from 2.1% to 2.3%, because of higher energy prices.After six cuts in the cost of borrowing in the last year, ECB officials are understood to be hesitant about going further while the international situation remains volatile and the recent fall in inflation could reverse.Price pressures eased in February, as inflation fell to 2.4% from 2.5% in January, according to a flash estimate by Eurostat, and services inflation dropped to 3.7% – below 3.9% for the first time since April 2024.However, increases in energy prices in response to the uncertainty surrounding “peace talks” to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine could upend projections that inflation will fall back to the 2% target by the first quarter of 2026.Markets were volatile at the moment, Lagarde told a press conference in Frankfurt. “From one day to the other, the situation changes dramatically, and our projections, the measure of underlying inflation, the price of energy, you know, you just name it, risks are all over the place.”Lagarde warned that a rise in energy prices could feed through to higher food prices, delaying an expected return of inflation to 2% next year.The deposit rate sets the interest that banks receive when they make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem.The ECB also cut its main refinancing rate, paid by banks when they borrow funds from the central bank on a weekly basis, by a quarter of one percentage point, to 2.65%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In reality, though, the conditions are often some of the most hellish on tour. Along with the slow conditions because of the dry, dusty desert air, gusty wind can make it incredibly challenging for all players.Emma Raducanu could ‘barely breathe or see through the tears’ after spotting stalkerRead moreFrom the start of the day, it was clear that the windy conditions would make life extremely difficult. Raducanu had begun well, immediately establishing a break lead in the opening games of the match, but the Japanese player handled the challenging circumstances best.While Raducanu tried to dictate the match from inside the baseline, her errors piled up in the unforgiving conditions. Uchijima, who is ranked four places above Raducanu at No 52, produced an excellent performance that illustrated why she has won many matches and risen 99 spots in the rankings over the past year. She remained rock-solid from the baseline across both sets while also serving well in the decisive moments and sweeping up all short balls with her heavy topspin forehand.During her pre-tournament press interviews, Raducanu said she had taken a week off to clear her head and she had initially been unsure about whether she would make the trip to Indian Wells so soon after the stalking incident. She has now lost five of her last six matches since her positive run to the Australian Open third round. Still, considering the events of her last match, when she was overcome with emotion at the Dubai Open after spotting her stalker in the crowd, simply being back on court and able to calmly conduct her business is a positive outcome.As she tries to find her feet again on the tour, Raducanu will hope that the new face in her player box will help. Thursday marked her first match of a trial run with the Slovak coach Vladimir Platenik, who has worked with a number of former top 10 players, including Daria Kasatkina, Belinda Bencic, Dominika Cibulkova and Veronika Kudermetova, in addition to being head coach of the prominent Empire Tennis Academy in Trnava. Raducanu’s previous coach, Nick Cavaday, decided to part ways with her after the Australian Open because of health issues.Earlier on Thursday, the men’s British No 3, Jacob Fearnley, went down to a brutal 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 defeat by the 18-year-old João Fonseca in the final set of his ATP Masters 1000 debut.After a poor opening set, Fearnley played spectacular attacking tennis in the middle of the match, completely out-hitting one of the most destructive ball strikers in the game, and put himself in position for a strong victory. From 3-1 in the third set, though, Fearnley’s nerves simply got the better of him while Fonseca showed the mental toughness and inner belief that complements his shot-making. Fonseca rolled through the final eight games to close out an unforgettable victory on his Indian Wells debut.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now it’s a stubborn problemJon ArnoldAn anti-gay slur’s at San Diego FC’s home debut prompted a strong response from the club. They’re not the first ones forced to address a tired tropeThu 6 Mar 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 13.16 ESTShareIt all started as a bit of a joke, just not a funny one. Now infamous enough to be known as ‘the chant’ or ‘the p-word’ even in English, historical accounts say the homophobic chant that has remained persistent in Mexican soccer began in Guadalajara. Atlas fans were infuriated by goalkeeper Oswaldo Sánchez’s departure from their team and his eventual return to their rivals Guadalajara. That’s when they tweaked a traditional gridiron football ritual, building up noise before belting out an anti-gay slur whenever Sánchez took a goal kick.The chant appeared again – this time with more venom – at a game between USA and Mexico in a 2004 pre-Olympic tournament in Guadalajara. Mexico fans were still smarting from El Tri’s loss to the US at the 2002 World Cup. That led to 60,000 Tapatios directing the slur at US goalkeeper DJ Countess during Mexico’s 4-0 win. The ugly trend has continued, and grown, despite campaigns from the Mexican football federation,Fifa fines, and efforts from Liga MX, who named a full season after an alternative chant in 2021.Last week the chant once again made an unwanted appearance, during San Diego FC’s home debut as an MLS expansion team.San Diego FC condemns homophobic chant heard at first MLS home gameRead moreThe club reacted swiftly. Sensing the opportunity to nip things in the bud, San Diego head coach Mikey Varas made statements after the match, in English and Spanish, condemning the chant.“Look, we can’t have racism, we can’t have discriminatory words in our sport, at our club, in our community. It’s unacceptable,” he said. “It doesn’t represent me, the players or the club and doesn’t reflect San Diego as a community. This is a diverse community that is full of love. We can’t go and say things like we did in this game … This was people in the general seats, not everyone, but a group we heard and I want to say that if they’re going to keep doing that it’s better that they don’t come to matches. Those aren’t the values we have.”San Diego sporting director Tyler Heaps echoed that sentiment. Clips of Heaps’ and Varas’s statements were posted on the club’s social media accounts next to celebratory posts about the team’s successful start to life inMLS. The team continued its push Monday, releasing a statement from club ownership saying they “will take immediate steps to address this behavior and will communicate a detailed plan prior to the next home match.”MLS talking points: Messi’s no-show, Lozano’s injury and Zaha’s debutRead moreThe club’s effort toward inclusivity has perhaps been necessitated by its location. San Diego has wisely marketed itself not just to communities across San Diego but also to fans over the border in Tijuana. The cities are so close fans in Tijuana can easily cross over fromMexicofor the match and be home in time for dinner. To this end, the team signed Hirving Lozano, a wildly popular Mexico international, to be the face of the franchise. “El Chucky” has been welcomed by throngs of fans at every press tour stop, many wearing his green Mexico jersey.View image in fullscreenSan Diego FC fans were largely positive in their support during the home opener.Photograph: Sean M Haffey/Getty ImagesSan Diego should want those fans at matches. The Mexican population is a huge part of the city’s fabric, and it makes sense for a brand new team to want as much buy-in as possible from all parts of the city’s population. But that’s also part of the problem. Mexican fans – although by no means all of or exclusively them – are the most likely to use the forbidden chant, which itself makes other groups feel like a San Diego FC game may not be a space for them after all.Fans who yell the word will typically say they aren’t trying to hurt anyone, or that it isn’t a slur. They argue that the word can be used in other contexts in Spanish: it is often heard when someone complains about traffic or is used to add emphasis to something great. In soccer, though, its usage and the context around it is clearly negative. No one shouts the word at their own team. Many LGBTQ and human rights groups in Mexico have asked for the chant to end, and they’re making that request for a good reason.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On-the-spot enforcement is difficult, not least because it can be difficult to suss out who is yelling the word in the first place. Part of the Mexican FA’s efforts to stamp it out include asking security workers to throw out offenders, something anyone who has attended a crowded match knows is highly improbable even with highly trained personnel, let alone overmatched security contractors. The Mexican FA has also threatened fines and point deductions, but some frustrated Mexico fans have used this as a misguided excuse to force change, using the chant when their team is losing in an effort to enact those very sanctions.It’s also clear that many casual fans are yelling the word to show they’re in on the “joke.” There’s a feeling that yelling the word means you’re in the know, not avillamelón, a fairweather fan. A home opener is an event that attracts many more of those fans than subsequent matches; it’s a game to see and be seen at rather than one midway through the long slog of a season.Those who yelled the word may think they are being savvy, but they expose themselves as anything but. The chant isn’t a clever chirp from the supporters’ section that gets under a rival’s skin or a new song for a new hero on a brand-new team. It’s a boring, dismal device whose only impact is embarrassing the broader fanbase and hurting people right next to them in the stands.San Diego FC’s statements seem to acknowledge this. If their efforts to eradicate the chant are successful, officials have to hope it’s something that can be replicated elsewhere. The magnifying glass of the 2026 World Cup is coming to North America next year, and far too many fans are still trying to get a laugh out of the same tired ‘joke’ that isn’t funny now, and never was.Explore more on these topicsMLSMexicoUS sportsSan Diego FCcommentShareReuse this content"

Los Angeles police said Wedding’s operation also moved “five metric tonnes of fentanyl per month” to US and Canadian cities.Wedding and fellow Canadian Andrew Clark are also accused of hiring hitmen to murder those the pair believed were obstacles to their operation, including a man murdered sitting in his car in the driveway of his home, who police said had drug debts.But in one case, officials say two victims were the inadvertent targets of retaliation for a stolen drug shipment.In 2023, gunmen attacked a rental home in Caledon, Ontario, killing Jagtar Singh Sidhu, 57, and Harbhajan Kaur Sidhu, 55, who had arrived to Canada four months earlier. Their daughter Jaspreet Kaur Sidhu,was shot 13 timesand left critically injured.Of the 16 defendants sought by police, Wedding and another are the only ones still on the loose.Clark was arrested on 8 October 2024 by Mexican law enforcement and was transferred on 27 February to the United States.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMexicoDrugsDrugs tradeSnowboardingOlympic GamesAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

I appreciate Michael’s contributions to the Broncos and am confident he will move forward in a positive direction.”Wilhoite is scheduled to appear in court on 10 March to be advised of the charges prosecutors plan to file against him.The 38-year-old was arrested on 23 February on suspicion of second-degree assault on a police officer and spent the night at aDenverjail. According to a police affidavit, Wilhoite left his vehicle unattended in the drop-off lane of the Denver airport. A uniformed police officer approached Wilhoite when he returned and told him to move his car.According to the affidavit, Wilhoite told the officer to shut up and bumped his chest into the officer, who shoved Wilhoite back. Wilhoite then allegedly punched the officer in the face, knocking him down and returned to his truck. The officer used a Taser on Wilhoite as he entered his vehicle to drive away.At a hearing the day after the alleged assault, magistrate Arnie Beckman told Wilhoite, “These are routine, everyday interactions that thousands of people get through successfully at the airport without assaulting a police officer. That a routine, everyday encounter turned violent is concerning to the court.”Wilhoite joined the Broncos’ staff in 2023 as outside linebackers coach after previously working for Payton in New Orleans as a defensive and special teams assistant in 2019-20. He was the Los Angeles Chargers’ linebackers coach from 2021-22. Before going into coaching, Wilhoite spent six seasons in theNFLas a linebacker with the 49ers and Seahawks.Explore more on these topicsDenver BroncosSan Francisco 49ersNFLUS sportsDenverColoradonewsShareReuse this content"

Bosa had a cap number of $36.47m for the 2025 season, but the Chargers will save $25.36m in cap space.Bosa was the third overall pick by the Chargers in the 2016NFLdraft, and went on to be named NFL defensive rookie of the year. He was also the last player on the current roster to have played for the Chargers when they were in San Diego. He signed a five-year extension worth $135m in 2020 that made him the league’s highest-paid defensive player at the time.Eagles reportedly make $41m Saquon Barkley highest-paid running back in historyRead moreBosa played in 14 games with nine starts this past season after agreeing to restructure his contract. But his five sacks were his fewest in the six seasons during which he has played at least 12 games as he battled hip and back injuries.After seeing action in 16 games in 2021, Bosa saw the field for only 14 games combined in the 2022 and 2023 seasons. He missed most of 2022 because of a groin injury, but returned late in the year. He was sidelined for the final seven games in 2023 with a foot injury.Bosa’s 72 sacks are tied for 10th most in the NFL since he entered the league and are second in franchise history. He was named to the Pro Bowl five times, including this past season as an alternate.With Bosa’s release, the Bolts will put a bigger emphasis on trying to re-sign linebacker Khalil Mack, who is an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his 11-year career. Tuli Tuipulotu, who led the Chargers with 8.5 sacks this past season, is expected to move into a starting spot with Bosa’s departure.Earlier this year Bosa spoke about the possibility of playing alongside his younger brother, Nick, at the San Francisco 49ers.“It’d be cool at some point,” Bosa said. “I always thought of myself being somebody that will play here and retire here, which I think not many people do on one team, and I think it would be a cool thing to accomplish, but you never know.”Joey and Nick’s father, John, was also a first-round NFL pick and was a member of the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles ChargersNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

I spoke to someone who knows all about the power – and price – of protestThu 6 Mar 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 06.02 ESTShareSince Donald Trump took office for his second term, he has taken a blowtorch to America. Hehas pardoned January 6 rioters, started thegutting of the federal government, eliminateddiversity, equity and inclusion programs, insultedwho we thoughtwere the country’s allies, andvilified immigrants.Etan ThomasWhile there have been voices of dissent in the sports world – such asformer NFL punter Chris Kluweandsoccer coach Jesse Marsch– athletes have largely stayed silent on Trump’s policies, a stark contrast to his first term in power. In recent months, Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce spoke of their pride in playing in front of Trump at the Super Bowl, while the Philadelphia Eaglesare reportedly keento visit the White House to celebrate their NFL title,a decision supported by Charles Barkley, who believes boycotts make the nation more divided.I couldn’t disagree more with Barkley. So I wanted to sit down with the epitome of the athlete activist, someone who didn’t hesitate to express his beliefs,even in the face of enormous backlash. And that is the great Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, whose protest during the national anthem in 1996 cost him his NBA career. Below is our conversation, which was has been lightly edited for length and clarity, about the importance of protest under the Trump administration.Etan Thomas:Do you think athletes have gone a little quiet since Trump has taken office? How important is it for athletes to not stay silent?Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf:It’s definitely not just athletes, but for the context of this discussion, we can focus on athletes. And, yes, it’s super important [for athletes to speak up]. I can’t help but think of years ago, J Edgar Hoover was discussing the power of the athlete. And how [the] goal was to shift [focus] from the Muhammad Ali types to the more quiet type of athlete because those in power recognize the power that athletes had to influence people. Especially an athlete that’s articulate and knows how to communicate and is current with all of the issues. So, there is an enormous amount of power that a lot of athletes … don’t realize that they have.ET:A lot of the reasoning given as to why athletes may be more reluctant to speak out now is because they are making so much more money and have much more to lose.MAR:Well, to whom much is given much is expected. Sometimes, people are quiet when they’re trying to get ahead in fear of messing up their chances to succeed, and I understand that. But when you get to a point where you are making millions and your finances are all taken care of, you would think that it would embolden you even more. But for so many of us, it makes it even worse … Sometimes, people listen to athletes more than they will academics who have studied the issues continuously.The 2026 Trade War World Cup encapsulates our new nativist world order | Aaron TimmsRead moreET:Has the time of athlete activism passed? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar once told me “if you have someone with that type of power and influence, pushing for something you don’t agree with, of course they are going to try to do whatever they can to silence them, because they are a threat to them.”MAR:Mr Abdul Jabbar was absolutely correct. So athletes having that power, have to prepare themselves for that responsibility. And if you want to improve on anything, you have to practice. We have to prepare ourselves just like we do on the basketball court. Just as we train, plan and strategize to overcome the opponent, exploit their weaknesses, capitalize on your strengths to win the game, that same strategic analysis has to be applied in real life. You can’t lose those lessons. It has to carry over. And let me add to that, the more athletes surround themselves with people who can influence them in a positive way, the better.ET:Like Muhammad Ali being mentored by Malcolm X.MAR:Exactly. Without the influence of Malcolm X, we may have only known Muhammad Ali as the greatest boxer of all time. And that would’ve been tragic. An athlete can be utilized as a mouthpiece to wake up the masses … because if an athlete says it, they pay more attention. It shouldn’t be that way of course, but a lot of times, that’s the reality. But honestly, the masses shouldn’t need anyone to point out what is clear and evident. It is amazing that a small cabal of people have convinced the masses to accept their oppression while they know they are being oppressed.ET:Like Trump getting so many people to vote against their own interests for a second time.MAR:Exactly, yes. So to answer your original question, it’s mandatory [for athletes to speak out against Trump]. Too much is at stake. I have conversations with different athletes all the time, just as I’m sure you do. Different races, ages, colors, coaches, administrators, everyone. But I also have conversations with different people of everyday life all the time; not just athletes, people from all races, backgrounds, owners of companies, people in the workforce. But so many people are afraid to make it public. They got us so fearful right now.ET:Almost like everyone is afraid to stand up to the school bully. The whole reason I wrote my book We Matter: Athletes And Activism is because I wanted to praise athletes like LeBron James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant who were using their voices in Trump’s first term, despite the criticism and backlash, and showing younger athletes that they can follow suit.MAR:And they should look at those criticisms as a compliment. If the powers that be are speaking highly of you, in a system that doesn’t mean you or your people well, you should ask: “Why are they praising me?” Because they always have an angle. They are always trying to manipulate and conform to fit their agenda. But on the flip side, if they are going out of their way to tear you down, that means you are doing something right. The civil rights leader John Lewis talked about “good trouble”. Well, this is “good backlash”.ET:I like that. In your day, there was no social media. Nowadays, athletes don’t have to wait for a reporter or media outlet to interpret what their message is. They have the power to construct their own message, however they want to. But power unrecognized is just a waste.MAR:I wish we had social media back in the day. Being able to control your own narrative and get your own message out the way you want to is invaluable. And to add to that, now athletes have the ability to feel the support of the community through social media. So just as you can feel the backlash, you can also feel support. We didn’t have that when we were coming up. We kind of felt like we were on an island by ourselves because we only heard the media backlash. So, yes, social media plays a big difference in many ways.ET:Any final thoughts?MAR:OK, let me end it with this. If you’re really about human freedom and justice you have no choice but to speak up. With everything going on right now, it’s crucial for everyone to use whatever platform they have – not just athletes but everyone. I want to make that point clear. We can’t put this all on athletes even though we know and understand the level of influence athletes have. Silence is acceptance, compliance and ultimately agreement with the status quo. It was Huey P Newton who said: “I do not think life will change for the better without an assault on the establishment”. With the magnitude of where we are right now, remaining silent isn’t an option. Either you’re part of the solution, or you’re part of the problem. And that goes for everyone, not just athletes.Explore more on these topicsUS sportsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsNBANFLBasketballcommentShareReuse this content"

But, first, theOlympic gold medallistandworld championpauses to remember those who preceded her.In August 1998, the British Boxing Board of Controlwere taken to courtby Jane Couch, a professional fighter who had been forced abroad because women’s boxing was banned in her country. Bernard Buckley, the board’s solicitor, told the judge that “many women suffer from premenstrual tension which makes them more emotional, labile and accident-prone. They are too fragile to box and bruise easily.”Cindy Ngamba: ‘I don’t want to go to Saudi until I hear from women that laws have changed’Read moreThe barrister Dinah Rose demolished the boxing authorities’ ridiculous argument and Couch became Britain’s first licensed professional female boxer. “It shows how far we’ve come and we owe it to trailblazers like Jane,” Price says.Her friend and sparring partner Cindy Ngamba, who won ahistoric first medalfor the Refugee Team at the Paris Olympics last summer, was born in Cameroon three weeks after Couch’s landmark victory. “I’ve watched some videos of Jane’s fights and how the hell do people think that she is weak?” Ngamba asks. “No matter how many bruises she had, she just kept going.“Look where we are now – with female fighters in different weight categories, from different countries, with different styles. They have the typical mindset of a boxer who is hungry and not afraid in the ring.”Price pays tribute to other pioneers and includes Jonas, her 40-year-old rival, in the next group of female fighters who changed boxing. “I look at Jonas,Nicola Adams,Katie Taylor, Savannah Marshall and Claressa Shields who all went to the 2012 Olympics. They’re trailblazers who led us to this all-female card at the Albert Hall. I’m lucky to be headlining it and me against Jonas is a great fight.View image in fullscreenNatasha Jonas gets some tips from Roberto Durán, the legendary former world champion, in the Champs Camp gym in Moss Side.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“Caroline Duboisis in a great fight [defending her WBC lightweight title against Bo Mi Re Shin]. Karriss Artingstall [Price’s former partner] against Raven Chapman is a great fight. Cindy is making her debut against the European champion, Kirstie Bavington.“It’s massive for women’s boxing at an iconic venue like the Royal Albert Hall. To think Muhammad Ali boxed there [in a 1979 exhibition] is crazy. We still have a long way to go, but women’s boxing is getting there and I’m proud to be part of it.”Price, Jonas and Ngamba also address the problems that undermine women’s boxing – from the lack of depth in each division to the fact that Saudi Arabia, which has oppressed women for so long, now controls the fight business. But before they confront these dilemmas, each carries a moving backstory.Price was given up by her mum in Wales when she was three days old. She was brought up by Derek and Linda Jones, whom she called her grandparents even though they are not blood relatives. “My brother died two years ago,” Price says, “and at the funeral I said to my sister: ‘I was the lucky one who got away.’“Both my parents are no good as they’re alcoholics and the life my brothers and sisters had growing up wasn’t great. If I wasn’t saved I probably would have ended up in care or worse.My brother was 39 when he died and he’d been in and out of jail. He had a sad life.“My grandparents are two amazing people and so I thank my mother for giving me away to a better life. She took a beating every day, so she got rid of me. In life you get given chances and I believe you just need to dream and, if you work hard enough, you can achieve anything.”View image in fullscreenPrice applies Vaseline before putting on her headguard for a sparring session.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianPrice became a kickboxing world champion and was capped by Wales as an international footballer before turning to traditional boxing. She is the unbeaten WBA world welterweight champion.Her opponent holds the IBF and WBC world titles in the same division. Jonas also became, in 2022, the first woman to win British boxing’s fighter of the year.Jonas, like Price, had a testing childhood. “My mother had me when she was 15,” Jonas told me in 2023. “Before I was born people were saying the best thing to do is to abort me.“It was just [three years] after the Toxteth riots [in 1981]. There were all these stereotypes but my mum instilled in me not to let anybody tell you who you can be and what you can do. If you want to do it, go and do it.”Ngamba arrived in Bolton as a refugee and she describes how boxing transformed her life. “I was 11 years old, very shy and I could not really speak English. I had no friends. But I went to this youth club and my life changed. I saw a group of boys sweating and it looked as if there were flames coming out of their backs. They had just left the boxing gym.“I went inside and it was boiling. I saw loads of boys sparring, skipping and shadow boxing. I knew nothing about boxing but it was so interesting. I asked the coach, Dave Langhorn, if I could join. He had never trained a girl and so I had to learn all the basics before, after two years, he allowed me to put on the gloves.”View image in fullscreenCindy Ngamba hits the pads with her trainer, Rob McCracken.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianNgamba soon showed Langhorn she could absorb pain and fight back. “I really shocked him because I was the only girl and I held my own in sparring against the boys. I got accepted because, if I got hurt, I kept coming back. I was a proper boxer but it was lonely. If it was my period I couldn’t tell my coaches. I just had to get on with it.”The 26-year-old is still classified as a refugee and, as a lesbian, she cannot return to Cameroon where homosexuality is a criminal offence. She is acutely aware of the ramifications for her now Saudi Arabia runs men’s professional boxing at the highest level.Stressing her disappointment, and suggesting she would fear for her safety in Saudi Arabia, Ngamba is supported by Price and Jonas.“I’m gay as well,” Price says, “so I wouldn’t know what to expect if I went to Saudi. If the opportunity came up for a massive fight out there, I would speak to [her trainer] Rob McCracken and probably go. But it would have to be big. I’m hoping that they will put on bigger and better fights for women.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I remember when Callum Smith was fighting George Groves in Jeddah [in 2018] I wanted to go. But my trainer, Joe Gallagher, gave me a list of rules in Saudi. You had to be covered from neck to knee and be in the company of a man at all times. No public affection was allowed, so I thought I’d better not go than do something silly and end up in a Saudi jail for God knows what.View image in fullscreenJane Couch, who had to go to court for the right to fight, jabs Leah Mellinger during their bout in 1997.Photograph: Rick Stewart/Allsport“When I first went to Riyadh a few years later I was pleasantly surprised that I was just seen as part of the team. No one looked at me any different because I was a woman. I know the history of Saudi but hopefully going forward it can change. It maybe won’t change in my time but hopefully it’ll change for females after us. Sport should be progressive and it should improve – like we’ve seen with female boxing here.”All three women were surprised on hearing that Riyadh Season is a sponsor of the Albert Hall show. Their promoter, Ben Shalom, told me that societal changes in Saudi are “vast” and that “they’re a sponsor of the event just like Betfred or Everlast. In return for the exposure their brand will get, they’ll pay a fee.”The future of women’s boxing is clouded because Saudi Arabia has yet to show any sustained interest. Shalom says: “With Riyadh Season being introduced in the past 18 months, women’s boxing has gone from the shining light of the sport to taking a bit of a back seat. Friday’s event is about kickstarting the power of women’s boxing again.”I’ve written my last book on boxing. The ring is darker than it has ever been | Donald McRaeRead moreThe best female fighters are exceptional athletes but the depth of talent in women’s boxing is worryingly shallow.John Sheppard, who runs BoxRec, the definitive public record of professional boxing, pointed out in 2023 that the four main sanctioning bodies had created 1,380 female titles in 15 weight divisions. There were 1,909 active female boxers then and, as two are needed for a fight, it translated to the equivalent of 1.4 titles for each pro female bout.Rosie Eccles, who fought at the Paris Olympics, rejected the chance to turn pro and is looking ahead to the 2026 Commonwealth Games. She cited the lack of quality in the paid ranks as a crucial factor. “I agree with her reasons,” Ngamba says, “and it’s hard to find promoters you can trust and there’s a lot of backstabbing in pro boxing. It’s not pure.”Price says: “Internationally, many of the best amateurs are not turning pro. Kellie Harrington [the Irish fighter who won gold in Tokyo and Paris] got paid more as an amateur. The Turkey team get blocks of gold, cars, big money when they win tournaments. Same with Kazakhstan. There are great female fighters out there, but, for them, there’s more money in the amateurs.”With so many amateur fighters choosing to represent their country, the elite pros often struggle to find adequate competition. “My weight probably has the best fights,” Price says, “but as you go up, there’re not many. [Elite super-middleweights] Savannah Marshall and Claressa Shields are not tested often.”View image in fullscreenNgamba gets help from McCracken putting on her gloves.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianShields is probably the best female fighter in the world and last monthbecame the first undisputed heavyweight championin women’s boxing. Yet, according to BoxRec, there are 17 licensed pros in the division and nine share five victories between them.This dearth of talent means Ngamba can make her debut on Friday against theEuropean champion. It is a non-title bout but Bavington, a decent operator with a humdrum record of nine wins in 16 fights, will surely be outclassed.A few weeks ago, at Price’s and Ngamba’s base at GB Boxing’s headquarters in Sheffield, I watched an outstanding sparring session. They shared eight rounds as accomplished as they were fiery. It was a reminder that the Royal Albert Hall show carries real significance and the main fight between Price and Jonas could be a classic example of a fighter in her prime, with the Welshwoman being 10 years younger, facing a revered veteran at the right time.For one night, hopefully, we can set aside the lingering concerns and uncertainty and just revel in the power and potential of women’s boxing.Explore more on these topicsBoxingSaudi Arabia and sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The first, from Bruno Fernandes, probably deniedManchester Unitedtheir victory; the second, from André Onana, definitely denied Real Sociedad theirs.United deservedly got themselves into a first-leg lead when Joshua Zirkzee guided a side-footed shot beyond Alex Remiro that appeared to set them up for a win and potentially even one big enough to virtually see them through. But an eagle eye and a video replay revived their Basque opponents, allowing Mikel Oyarzabal to equalise from the spot with 20 minutes left and in the last of those they nearly scored again. Which was when a figure in yellow flew to the rescue.Real Sociedad 1-1 Manchester United: Europa League last 16, first leg – live reactionRead moreUltimately, a 1-1 draw is not a bad result for United, and Onana’s sensational save from Orri Óskarsson ensured that they return to Old Trafford level but frustrated. “It could be better, it could be worse,” Ruben Amorim said. It also offered little evidence that United have overcome their most pressing, immediate problems. Instead, it highlighted flaws, leaving them to reflect on the moments when they could have provided the final pass and, in particular, applied the finish.“It is clear we have to be more clinical,” Amorim said. “We’re creating chances. Sometimes you don’t see that in the xG because we manage not to shoot. Sometimes we are missing something.” The manager talked of United’s “anxiousness” to score here, a mental block that needs to be broken, and there is tiredness to deal with too. That, Amorim said, was increasingly evident in the final minutes when his side looked overrun.Quick GuideEuropa League roundup: Roma and nine-man Lazio snatch late winsShowA stoppage-time goal earnedRomaa 2-1 home win overAthletic Bilbaoin the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie asLaziosnatched a late 2-1 win atViktoria Plzen, despite finishing the game with nine men.Roma wasted two decent chances to take a first-half lead. Artem Dovbyk found a way past the Bilbao defence and into the area but lost his footing as he went to shoot and Paulo Dybala thundered a shot off the crossbar.Bilbao took the lead five minutes after the break when Iñaki Williams headed in, but Roma were soon level when Angeliño's shot went in off the post after a cutback from Zeki Celik. Bilbao went down to 10 men five minutes from time after Yeray Álvarez received a second booking and Roma snatched the late winner via Eldor Shomurodov.Plzen fell behind to Lazio after 18 minutes from Alessio Romagnoli's header but the Czechs drew level after the break when the unmarked Rafiu Durosinmi headed home from close range. Lazio had Nicolò Rovella sent off and Samuel Gigot also saw red in added time, but Gustav Isaksen curled a shot into the top corner in the 98th minute to give them victory.Bodø/Glimttook a major step towards the quarter-finals with a 3-0 win overOlympiakosandEintracht Frankfurtsecured a 2-1 win atAjax.Bodø/Glimt were in front after 13 minutes thanks to Konstantinos Tzolakis's own goal, the Olympiakos keeper knocking Jostein Gundersen's header into his own net after the ball bounced down off the crossbar.The hosts doubled their lead when Kasper Høgh tapped in Ole Blomberg's cross and Høgh was on target after the break with another close-range finish. The Norwegian side will fancy their chances of advancing when they head to Greece with a three-goal cushion over last season's Conference League winners.Ajax went ahead in the 10th minute through Brian Brobbey's header but Frankfurt levelled when Hugo Larsson netted with a powerful strike from distance which took a slight deflection off Brobbey. Frankfurt grabbed the winner 20 minutes from time, Ellyes Skhiri finishing off a pass from Ansgar Knauff.Earlier in the evening,Lyonsecured a 3-1 victory atFCSB. Malick Fofana netted twice in the final four minutes to wrap up the win.ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Beyond that there is something deeper, more basic. The game began with United’s players waiting for a long punt in their rough direction, and for much of the opening period that felt like it had set the tone. Soon after, Fernandes looked up, appealed for some movement and struck a long diagonal out of play, which did too. The game was cautious and imprecise. When Beñat Turrientes slipped and his shot dribbled apologetically wide, it was eloquent. As was the fact that the referee, Ivan Kruzliak, immediately pointed at his watch and told Onana to hurry up. They had been playing only 18 minutes and it was already dragging a bit.ThatReal Sociedadhad more possession with little threat at least offered United space into which to run, seen when Noussair Mazraoui released Diogo Dalot. Rasmus Højlund was screaming for it, first time, inside the area but instead Dalot slowed, turned back and went to Garnacho. The chance was lost and the move concluded with Patrick Dorgu slicing over, while Højlund justifiably made his displeasure very visible. “The decision was not the best,” Amorim said. “The important thing is to move on [and] not be still fighting.”View image in fullscreenReal Sociedad’s Mikel Oyarzabal scores from the penalty spot to level the score at 1-1.Photograph: Javier Etxezarreta/EPAThe next time was better too, at least in inception. A superb pass released Dalot, who pulled it back for Fernandes by the penalty spot. Fernandes’s shot was blocked by Aritz Elustondo, Zirkzee’s first follow-up hit Remiro’s legs and his second scuffed wide, something a little comic in how it had all unravelled. What was it Amorim had said? “There are things that are hard to explain.

When Fernandes lifted a pass into the area Dalot dropped his header harmlessly into Remiro’s arms. But at least United were getting chances and those became clearer and more frequent, red shirts beginning to stream through the middle. A smart pass from Fernandes and a neat flick from Zirkzee set up Dorgu to drive the ball across the six-yard box, through four men, Højlund included, only for Garnacho to hit the side netting. Next, Fernandes set up Garnacho for another effort. And then United were away, Dalot supplying Garnacho who drew in three defenders and teed up Zirkzee to sidefoot through Turrientes’s legs and past Remiro.All that had happened within eight second-half minutes and a moment later Garnacho hit the side netting again. “We were in control. We were so near to getting the second, you could feel the stadium was nervous,” Amorim reflected, “but the penalty changed it.” As Fernandes jumped with Nayef Aguerd on 70 minutes he reached out an arm that few here saw but in the video assistant referee room they did. From the spot, Oyarzabal smashed the ball past Onana. It was Real Sociedad’s first shot on target, and suddenly they were in this.Not just in it but chasing victory, led by the substitutes Sheraldo Becker and Orri Óskarsson. As they ran, United faded. Onana brilliantly pushed away a superb Brais Méndez shot and then Real should have gone ahead when Becker’s perfectly weighted delivery reached Óskarsson. Six yards out, he nudged wide with the outside of his right boot. The next time Becker received, the pass was the same; this time, Matthijs de Ligt slipped but somehow scrambled it away. United were on edge and when Oyarzabal’s superb pass set up Óskarsson on 93 minutes, they needed Onana to take off once more, left hand outstretched.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueReal SociedadManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

According to reportingin the New York Times, the delegate was Ignacio Alonso, the president of the Uruguayan Football Association. Uruguay will be one of three South American countriesto host a “centenary celebration match”in 2030. Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, agreed to explore the idea further.AFifaspokesperson told the Guardian it had a duty to consider all requests from council members: “A proposal to analyse a 64-team Fifa World Cup to celebrate the centenary of the Fifa World Cup in 2030 was spontaneously raised by a Fifa council member in the ‘miscellaneous’ agenda item near the end of the Fifa council meeting held on 5 March 2025.

A proposal to stage the World Cup every two years was abandoned but next year’s World Cup in Mexico, Canada and the US will bring an increase from 32 countries to 48, with the number of matches rising from 64 to 104.Spain, Portugal and Morocco are to act as joint hosts in 2030, with centenary matches in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay. The addition of 16 further teams would create substantial logistical challenges for the hosts, not least the duration of the tournament, which would probably run for at least six weeks. Questions over the carbon footprint of such an event would grow larger.The politics of an expanded World Cup reveal the differing priorities of competing nations and confederations. In South America an increase in participating numbers could in effect mean the end of qualifying rounds, which would in turn hit the resources of national associations who receive revenue from those matches, and as many as half of Uefa’s 55 nations would be expected to qualify. In Asia, Africa and Oceania an expansion of places would probably be received positively, with a number of countries likely to make their World Cup debuts as a result.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2030World CupFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

An abject ­display in which his side fell behind to an early own goal from the unfortunate Lucas Bergvall and then failed to lay a glove on AZ Alkmaar means the ­Australian’s chances of maintaining the proud record of winning a trophy in his second season at every club he has managed now rest on next week’s second leg.The home side – who are known as the cheese heads – could have been out of sight after repeatedly finding holes in the Spurs defence had it not been for two excellent saves from ­Guglielmo Vicario, including one to deny the Tottenham academy graduate Troy ­Parrott in the first half. Even though Spurs have not even reached the quarter-­finals of this competition in five attempts since 2013, ­Postecoglou said ­beforehand that his players sensed an opportunity to win it now that some of them are back from injury. But the sight of Tottenham’s record signing, Dominic Solanke, limping off late with a ­suspected back problem on his return from seven weeks out with a knee injury potentially made it an even more disastrous evening for the head coach.AZ v Tottenham, Fenerbahce v Rangers: Europa League last 16, first legs – liveRead morePostecoglou had seemed encouraged by the prospect of welcoming back Solanke and the defenders Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven after their spells on the sidelines. But while neither defender ended up making it off the bench as Kevin Danso and Archie Gray were given the runaround by Parrott, Postecoglou’s enthusiasm and that of the 950 away fans who made the trip will only have diminished after this.Liverpool’s Arne Slot cut his teeth as manager of AZ before moving on to Feyenoord – following in the ­footsteps of as Louis van Gaal and Dick ­Advocaat. The club up the road from Amsterdam have a decent pedigree in this ­competition and in 1981 reached the final of its predecessor, the Uefa Cup. Maarten Martens’ side is packed with players who helped them to win Uefa’s Youth League in 2023, although they were missing the ­playmaker Sven Mijnans and Ruben van Bommel – son of the ­former ­Netherlands captain Mark.AZ’s current youth team dumped Real Madrid out of the same competition on Wednesday and the senior side have a formidable record in their compact home ground, having thrashed Galatasaray 4-1 in Alkmaar in the previous round. Roared on by a boisterous crowd, Ernest Poku helped set the tone as he ­immediately caused Djed Spence problems down the left flank.The breakthrough came from a corner when Parrott volleyed the ball back in the general direction of the goal and it took a wicked slice as Bergvall attempted to clear before looping over the helpless Vicario. The stadium announcer initially rather hopefully gave the goal to Parrott, who looked like a man on a mission against his former club.View image in fullscreenTottenham’s Lucas Bergvall is consoled by Guglielmo Vicario after his own goal give AZ Alkmaar the lead.Photograph: Soccrates Images/Getty ImagesTottenham struggled to get to grips with what Postecoglou described as a “tricky” surface and looked vulnerable whenever they lost the ball to a midfield being patrolled by veteran Jordie Clasie, once of Southampton. Son Heung-min was guilty of not tracking Denso Kasius when he played in Parrott for a golden ­opportunity to double AZ’s lead but the Republic of Ireland striker could not find a way past Vicario.Despite dominating possession, Spurs did not have an effort worthy of note until Brennan Johnson fired over from distance five minutes before half-time. They somehow survived a goalmouth scramble from another corner when Parrot and Poku had been allowed acres of space in the buildup. Something clearly needed to change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

AZ continued to look dangerous and it needed a full-stretch save from Vicario to keep out Poku’s drive after a clever flick from Parrott. Rodrigo Bentancur did not help Postecoglou’s mood when he was booked for a late challenge that will rule him out of the second leg.Solanke, Pedro Porro and Pape Sarr were summoned from the bench, with the disappointing James ­Maddison one of those to make way. It did not seem to make much of a­difference as Tottenham continued to look ineffective. Parrott was given a standing ovation when he was taken off with 10 minutes to go and AZ’s only regret was that they could not find a second goal their superiority deserved.For Postecoglou, the pressure is only mounting and he will need to find some answers if Spurs are not going to finish yet another season empty-handed.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueAZ AlkmaarTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Last Saturday Barry Ferguson was being beaten at home by Motherwell. Five days later the interim head coach was leading Rangers to a famous victory in Istanbul, responding to being patronised by José Mourinho by ending Fenerbahce’s 18-match unbeaten run.Perhaps the scoreline was not as eye-catching as the4-2 win away to Borussia Dortmundthree years ago, but given the circumstances this was arguably more remarkable. Where there had been shambles, there was rigour. Where there had been diffidence, there was conviction. Where there had been incoherence, there was incisiveness. This was a result beyond Rangers’ realistic expectations, and yet it could have been even better. It was not just that Cyriel Dessers had two efforts ruled out for tight offsides, it was that he squandered two other counters as Fenerbahce’s structure disintegrated in the second half.AZ v Tottenham, Fenerbahce v Rangers: Europa League last 16, first legs – liveRead more“We were very bad everywhere,” Mourinho said. “Maybe you will laugh but for me it was a good result because of the way we performed. I know Jack Butland made three fantastic saves and there was maybe a penalty but I don’t think to speak about the referee after this performance is ethical. We lost lots of duels, our passing was not fast. We made incredible mistakes. We had no pace to follow them. I have to say that we deserved the punishment of this result. But if you ask me do I think it’s over? No.”Rangers have lost their past three home games so, as Ferguson stressed at every opportunity, the tie is not over. Perhaps with Fred back from suspension Fenerbahce will not be quite as leaden in midfield, but there was little here to provoke anxiety.View image in fullscreenJosé Mourinho reacts during his side’s defeat in the last-16 first leg.Photograph: Murad Sezer/ReutersMourinho had used his pre-match press conference to hit back at Philippe Clement, who had criticised his style of play beforebeing sacked by Rangers last week. Ferguson, he said, understood that “it’s on the pitch that you win matches, not with philosophy”.It was perhaps a reflection of that pragmatism that Ferguson started with a back three. “The team gave me everything I asked for,” Ferguson said. “They took on a lot of information, every single thing me and my staff told them on the training field. It’s not easy changing system and they’ve not played that way before.”Quick GuideEuropa League roundup: Roma and nine-man Lazio snatch late winsShowA stoppage-time goal earnedRomaa 2-1 home win overAthletic Bilbaoin the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie asLaziosnatched a late 2-1 win atViktoria Plzen, despite finishing the game with nine men.Roma wasted two decent chances to take a first-half lead. Artem Dovbyk found a way past the Bilbao defence and into the area but lost his footing as he went to shoot and Paulo Dybala thundered a shot off the crossbar.Bilbao took the lead five minutes after the break when Iñaki Williams headed in, but Roma were soon level when Angeliño's shot went in off the post after a cutback from Zeki Celik. Bilbao went down to 10 men five minutes from time after Yeray Álvarez received a second booking and Roma snatched the late winner via Eldor Shomurodov.Plzen fell behind to Lazio after 18 minutes from Alessio Romagnoli's header but the Czechs drew level after the break when the unmarked Rafiu Durosinmi headed home from close range. Lazio had Nicolò Rovella sent off and Samuel Gigot also saw red in added time, but Gustav Isaksen curled a shot into the top corner in the 98th minute to give them victory.Bodø/Glimttook a major step towards the quarter-finals with a 3-0 win overOlympiakosandEintracht Frankfurtsecured a 2-1 win atAjax.Bodø/Glimt were in front after 13 minutes thanks to Konstantinos Tzolakis's own goal, the Olympiakos keeper knocking Jostein Gundersen's header into his own net after the ball bounced down off the crossbar.The hosts doubled their lead when Kasper Høgh tapped in Ole Blomberg's cross and Høgh was on target after the break with another close-range finish. The Norwegian side will fancy their chances of advancing when they head to Greece with a three-goal cushion over last season's Conference League winners.Ajax went ahead in the 10th minute through Brian Brobbey's header but Frankfurt levelled when Hugo Larsson netted with a powerful strike from distance which took a slight deflection off Brobbey.

Malick Fofana netted twice in the final four minutes to wrap up the win.ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.TheEuropa Leaguerepresents Rangers’ only remaining chance of silverware this season and the sense had been that their main objective was to keep the tie alive for the second leg at Ibrox next week, but within six minutes they had been handed the lead. First Sebastian Szymanski, trying to twist out of trouble on the edge of his own box, was dispossessed by Vaclav Cerny, then another attempted clearance bounced off Mohamed Diomande to Dessers, whose shot just beat Caglar Soyuncu across the line. Dessers divides fans and misses chances, but he has 22 goals this season, four of them in the three games under Ferguson.At that stage, with the pressure applied by Cerny and Diomande clearly unsettling Szymanski, the switch to the back three looked a masterstroke. Rangers started creaking, though, even before they lost Robin Pröpper to a head injury sustained in a collision with Butland. It was not long after he went off that Alexander Djiku swivelled to thump in a volley.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When space opened up for Cerny three minutes before the break, nobody could catch him as he crafted an elegant one-two with Dessers, then finished calmly as the stadium slipped into a shocked silence that was emphasised by the hollow echo of the celebrating Rangers fans. Their mood had been dampened bythe death of a fan in a traffic accident in Istanbulin the early hours of Thursday morning. Scarves were left at the site in tribute, while a GoFundMe for the family of the victim raised more than £30,000 within hours of being established. Ferguson spoke of how he and the squad had been “devastated” to hear the news.Mourinho switched to a 4-3-3 at half-time, but it made Fenerbahce more vulnerable to counters. Fenerbahce had chances, there were a couple of desperate blocks and Edin Dzeko and Talisca muffed headers when well-placed, but Rangers retained their threat. The counterattacking third goal they had promised so frequently did eventually arrive, Cerny capping a superb display with his second. This season of chaos may be salvaged yet.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueFenerbahceRangersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Tuchel has been given a one-tournament contract for the 2026 World Cup and there have been conversations with him about the logistics of the finals, which will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The manager’s immediate priority is to establish bonds, to shape the right environment as Gareth Southgate did before him, and he has had detailed discussions with the main players plus others on the fringes of the squad.James Maddison, for example, said Tuchel had “touched base” with him and it is known he has also spoken to Ben White, who has been in self-enforced exile since the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Tuchel has cast the net far and wide, with others hoping for a call-up including Myles Lewis-Skelly, Ethan Nwaneri, Tyrick Mitchell and Adam Wharton.“Gareth was very, very connected and very smart culturally and Thomas is the same,” Bullingham said. “He realised early on that you don’t build those connections in the 60 days you get together [in camps across the campaign]. So he’s put a lot of effort into that [reaching out to the players].“He’s got his 55 on his longlist and makes sure that he’s got a strong connection with them, that they know he’s seen them. It’s not only the players inEnglandthat he’s been to see, it’s players playing abroad. That will only stand us in good stead in the long run.”Bullingham describes Tuchel as an “incredibly charismatic and energetic individual” and so the initial impact he has made has come as no surprise. “He’s looking at some tweaks and changes for how he runs the camp – some quite creative ideas there – but I’m just really pleased with how he’s approached it. He’s really hit the ground running.View image in fullscreenArsenal defender Ben White is among those contacted by Thomas Tuchel.Photograph: EYE4images/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“You’ve seen him at a number of games. He’s also integrated a small number of his sports team he brought with him into St George’s Park. He’s been up there a lot and spent a lot of time with people. We’ve already started looking at some of the challenges ahead in terms of the World Cup and the different dynamics that presents in terms of climate, distance, altitude.”Bullingham was asked whether there was the option for Tuchel to stay beyond the World Cup. “I think he always said: ‘I might be here for 10 years but I’ll only ever sign up in two-year cycles,’” Bullingham replied. “The reason for that is he just wants his sole focus to be on the next tournament and be really single-minded with the players on that. It’s very early to judge [about the longer term].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Greenwood won one cap for England, as an 18-year-old in a Nations League game in Iceland in 2020.“My understanding is he’s asked to switch,” Bullingham said. “That’s happened formally. Was it because it was indicated to him he wasn’t going to play? No. Gareth was up front about him not being in his thinking because he hadn’t been performing at that level. I’m not aware of any communication with him. It’s a personal decision by him.”Bullingham spoke at a review of the FA’s performance over the past four years and a look ahead to what it will prioritisepriorities over the next four – winning tournaments, tackling discrimination, boosting opportunity for female players and delivering new pitches. The target is more than 6,000 high-quality grass surfaces and 300 3G ones.Bullingham also said he would be open to a trial of bodycams for referees in the professional game after the success of the initiative at grassroots level. He said it had protected officials, making them feel more confident and reducing instances of abuse.“In the professional game, I think bodycams are more about: is it something which will be really good for the broadcaster?” Bullingham said. “There’s different views on that. I personally think it is good and it is something which should be trialled and potentially allowed. Initially it might be trialled without audio and then long-term trialled with audio.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelThe FAnewsShareReuse this content"

The top flight’s nearest competitors, La Liga and theBundesliga, brought in €3.7bn and €3.6bn respectively. It forms part of a wider picture in which revenues in the continent’s top divisions totalled €26.8bn, 17% more than before the Covid-19 pandemic.The median revenue for a Premier League club stood 60% higher than their Bundesliga equivalents and more than three times those in Serie A andLa Liga, in what is essentially a comparison between mid-table sides. This was primarily driven by broadcast money and the disparity looks likely to become more dramatic in the coming years amid a broadly bleak picture for television rights figures across many of the major leagues.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Domestic broadcasting revenues across the board grew by a modest 3% in the five years to 2023, paling in comparison with much greater leaps in commercial, sponsor and gate income. Early data for 2024 points to an 11% rise in gate revenues last year, with income from premium seating a major driver. Crowds were shown to be up 6% on pre-pandemic levels.Premier League clubs’ player wages ate up 49% of their revenue on average. Salaries rose by only 3% around the continent in 2023 and 4.5% across early-reporting clubs in 2024.Uefafeels it is evidence its cost control rules, which will cap spending on wages and transfers at 70% of revenue for next season, are kicking in after being rolled out gradually in the past two years. A 19% increase in non-player wage growth suggests clubs are committing to heavier investment in technical and administrative staff. Total wages among top-division clubs in Europe topped €18bn.The report detailed that Chelsea’s squad at the end of the 2024 financial year was the most expensive ever, its combined transfer cost standing at €1.66bn and surpassing the €1.33m spent by Real Madrid to assemble their 2020 squad. Three other clubs, all in the Premier League, had squads that cost more than €1bn: Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal.Nine English clubs were included in the continent’s top 20 wage bills for 2023-24, City leading the top flight’s contingent by taking second place behind Paris Saint-Germain. Arsenal, United, Tottenham and Liverpool were among eight European sides to take more than €100m in gate revenue in 2023.Explore more on these topicsFinancesPremier LeagueUefaEuropean club footballBusinessLa LigaBundesliganewsShareReuse this content"

It makes English football distinctive from other leagues. It adds jeopardy and excitement. It’s something we all love about the game of football and that has never been under question. We fundamentally believe promotion and relegation is an important differentiator and an important competitive advantage for us, relative to other women’s sport leagues globally.”Doucet added that there was a desire to “make sure that our league works for club investors to allow more investment in the game” but that that would not “change our core principles”.She also said they “wouldn’t be doing our job properly” if they did not consider and review all available options. “Our mission is to build the most distinctive, competitive and entertaining women’s football competition in the world for the players and the fans for today and tomorrow,” she said. “That is one that also supports the entire pyramid.”Doucet, asked whether the backlash on social media against possible changes to promotion and relegation had changed their perspective, said that it had not and the chief operating officer, Holly Murdoch, said they would canvass fan opinion through more formal channels.“Absolutely the fan groups will be part of consultation,” said Murdoch. “What we are talking about today is that we haven’t yet got a proposal to consult on. We are still looking at concepts and options. When that proposal is in a place where we can consult, there will be informal and formal consultation so we can make sure we take everyone on the journey. The governance process is vigorous. We are working really closely with the FA on that.”The clubs are due tovote at the end of the seasonon whether to scrap relegation. But the decision is not totally in the hands of WPLL, with any changes to pyramid regulations for the 2026-27 season needing Football Association board approval by 1 August.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “I think there’s a difference between not having relegation and allowing the league to grow through promotion with no relegation versus having a closed league. If we get presented with a package of changes that’s good for the women’s game overall – and I’m talking about academies, minimum standards, player pathways – and within the context of that there’s a change to the number of clubs in the league brought about through having promotion and no relegation, then we could potentially be supportive. But we need to look at that overall package.”Further details of what is on the table have been elusive, with WPLL unwilling to disclose what is on the agenda or discussed during private shareholder meetings or expand on possible options being put forward.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen’s ChampionshipWomen's footballFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the second half, Son was replaced by Dominic Solanke, who was then forced off himself. The England striker had just returned from seven weeks out with a knee injury, but Postecoglou said he hoped the latest problem was just a knock.Bergvall’s own goal gives AZ advantage after abject Tottenham displayRead moreSon, the Tottenham captain, was highly critical of his side’s display and called on the team to adopt a different mindset for what he described as “the biggest game of our season next week”. “This was nowhere near the level we should be in terms of our performance,” he said. “This is very disappointing, including from myself, and it is a big wake-up call ahead of the biggest game of our season next week. It is tough playing away from home in the Europa League. We were sloppy and not performing how we should. Everyone is disappointed and we have to look at ourselves. No excuses and it was nowhere near good enough. It is just 1-0 and the tie is not finished. Next week we have to be much better than we were tonight.”Postecoglou acknowledged that the deficit could have been greater had AZ taken their chances. “We didn’t really come to grips and have the right mindset to tackle an away fixture in Europe,” said the head coach. “It is always tough and we obviously conceded the goal, which was a disappointing set of events but even after that we didn’t really ­settle down into the game at all.Quick GuideEuropa League roundup: Roma and nine-man Lazio snatch late winsShowA stoppage-time goal earnedRomaa 2-1 home win overAthletic Bilbaoin the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie asLaziosnatched a late 2-1 win atViktoria Plzen, despite finishing the game with nine men.Roma wasted two decent chances to take a first-half lead.

It’s a reward for that really. Probably across the board there were some really good performances. I was keen to let them go again.Ireland and France load benches with forwards to play Risk in search of rewardRead more“The challenge the group set themselves on Monday was that they are pleased with the performance, but not the result, because they are all competitors. Can we do the same again and build a little bit more on top of that? The passion and effort was first rate. It is matching that as a minimum, but trying to build our game slowly.”The Edinburgh encounter is Sherratt’s penultimate match in charge of Wales before he resumes duties as Cardiff head coach after taking over from Warren Gatland on a temporary basis. Wales have lost their past 15 Tests, but the quality of performance ingoing down 27-18 to Irelandoffered a brighter outlook before their remaining Six Nations appointments with Scotland and England. Their recent Murrayfield record against Scotland is impressive, having won on six of the past eight visits to Edinburgh.Sherratt said: “I am not naive. I knew there would be an emotional response for Ireland. We’ve got England at home next week, last one in the Six Nations. That one looks after itself. This week for me was always going to be the one that was the test of the squad. We are going away and it is two weeks after the Ireland game. But what I sense from the players pretty early on is there is a determination to lift that emotion from the Principality Stadium and take it to Murrayfield.”Two switches among the replacements mean returns for the former captain Dewi Lake, with the hooker recently recalled to the squad after recovering from biceps surgery, and the Cardiff prop Keiron Assiratti.Quick GuideScotland v Wales lineupsShowBritish Gas Murrayfield, 4.45pm, Saturday 8 MarchScotland:B Kinghorn (Toulouse); D Graham (Edinburgh), H Jones (Glasgow), T Jordan (Glasgow), D van der Merwe (Edinburgh); F Russell (Bath, capt), B White (Toulon); P Schoeman (Edinburgh), D Cherry (Edinburgh), Z Fagerson (Glasgow), J Gray (Bordeaux), G Gilchrist (Edinburgh), J Ritchie (Edinburgh), R Darge (Glasgow, capt), J Dempsey (Glasgow).Replacements:E Ashman (Edinburgh), R Sutherland (Glasgow), W Hurd (Leicester), G Brown (Glasgow), M Fagerson (Glasgow), G Horne (Glasgow), K Rowe (Glasgow), S McDowall (Glasgow).Wales:B Murray (Scarlets); T Rogers (Scarlets), M Llewellyn (Gloucester), B Thomas (Cardiff), E Mee (Scarlets); G Anscombe (Gloucester), T Williams (Gloucester); N Smith (Leicester), E Dee (Dragons), W John (Sale Sharks), W Rowlands (Racing 92), D Jenkins (Exeter), J Morgan (Ospreys, capt), T Reffell (Leicester), T Faletau (Cardiff).Replacements:D Lake (Ospreys), G Thomas (Ospreys), K Assiratti (Cardiff), E Williams (Cardiff), A Wainwright (Dragons), R Williams (Dragons), J Evans (Harlequins), J Roberts (Scarlets).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Scotland, meanwhile, welcome back Darcy Graham after the Edinburgh wing missed the16-15 defeat against Englanddue to a concussion in the home defeat by Ireland almost four weeks ago. Graham passed his head injury assessment before the match at Twickenham on 22 February but Scotland coaches and medics opted to take a precautionary approach and give him more time to ensure he was fully recovered given the severity of his collision with his teammate Finn Russell. Having trained this week, the 27-year-old – Scotland’s second-highest try-scorer of all time – has been selected to start against Wales in place of Kyle Rowe in the only change to the side that started the Calcutta Cup match.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rugby’s version is not a million miles removed: bigger pitch and more bodies involved but plenty of overlap on the content. For Saturday’s pivotal next step in Ireland’s grand slam bid, France have put it up to them before a ball is kicked, with a magnificent seven lumps on the bench, supported by just one back.It worked against Italy, which is not to say it will not end in tears this time out. That’s why it’s called Risk.Ireland’s riposte is less brazen, but only just. The last time they went 6-2 on the bench was against England a year ago – whichdidn’t end too well– and they have an extra bit of jeopardy with the inclusion of their most capped player, Cian Healy, in the replacements. The prop is a veteran of countless contacts and is looking forward to the afterlife already, which he reckons will demand more physical activity simply to avoid falling apart. The plan for Saturday is to limit his engagement to the fag end of the final quarter. The risk is that circumstance might hurry that one up to a critical level if Andrew Porter has to bail out ahead of schedule.The Breakdown | Ireland v France can live up to hype and seize rugby back from stattosRead moreOtherwise Ireland are treading the conventional path with the usual suspects in the starting lineup. Jamie Osborne may not fit that category yet but if this was Ghostbusters then he’d be the first one you’d call. His talent mitigates the absence of the injured Mack Hansen, and his versatility could get him a seat on the plane to Australia with the Lions this summer.“We have a bit of flexibility in Jamie’s position, [with] him covering the majority of positions in the backline,” Simon Easterby, the interim head coach, said. “We felt Caelan [Doris] has done incredibly well to get back to full fitness and done a brilliant job with the medical staff, being able to get himself right from an injury which other players might not have been able to do in a short space of time. We needed to make sure we had good coverage in the back row.“The dynamics of that pack and how France might play the game meant we felt that it was a nice chunky back five of our scrum to come on and make an impact, as well as having someone like Jamie from the start, and he can cover a number of positions.”On the downside Tadhg Furlong and Rónan Kelleher are not back to full fitness yet but Finlay Bealham’s form has been good and Rob Herring is exactly the sort of veteran you need for this environment.“I think Rob gives that little bit more experience and nous in a position which can be pretty tricky,” says Easterby. “What he will allow us to do as well is he’ll have the opportunity to come off the bench with a younger player in Tom Clarkson. It gives him and Tom a nice bit of a connection, along with Cian and his experience on the other side of that.”On the diplomatic front for France, Fabien Galthié lobbed over the top one of those compliments that could be designed to explode on impact. “Ireland today are a team of the very highest quality: one of the two best countries in the world – perhaps even the best – and they’re playing at home,” he said. “To put the task for us in context: since 2020 they have played 31 home matches and lost two – against France in 2021 and New Zealand last November. So it’s true we’re facing a huge challenge but that’s what we’re looking for.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Offered a choice between running over the top of boys in green or getting stuck in full-on warfare, surely he would opt for the former. The return of Damian Penaud on the wing and Emmanuel Meafou to the bench feeds into this. Sticking with Mickaël Guillard reflects how good the Lyon second-row was against Italy, and the impact Ireland will have to deal with when the replacements roll into action. By then Galthié will hope, with Romain Ntamack back in harness, the reward is winning out over the risk.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025Ireland rugby union teamFrance rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

But having been restricted to 507 minutes of football, and only 76 minutes in the Premier League, the 21-year-old admits Slot’s outstanding debut campaign has had its challenges.‘The best goalkeeper in the world’: Arne Slot hails Alisson’s Paris masterclassRead moreElliott, who has not started a league game forLiverpoolthis season, said: “I’ve already played almost 150 games for Liverpool [137] and I feel like I’m very experienced in that aspect. So there are moments within the season where I am getting angry, I am getting frustrated because I want to play, but at the same time I need to respect the situation and I need to respect the manager’s decisions.“Some games I’m needed, some games I’m not. That’s just how football is. That’s why I feel we’re in the position that we are in this season so far because of his decisions. PSG was another one where it worked in our favour. Luckily I was the chosen one, you could say, to come in and get the match-winner. We all need to be ready, it’s just not me and it’s just not the lads that are starting frequently. We’re all going to play our part, it’s just about staying ready.”Elliott has spoken regularly with the Liverpool head coach over his involvement and accepts that, with Salah and Dominik Szoboszlai among those ahead of him, playing for his boyhood club will be a test of patience.He said: “We’ve had very honest conversations and open conversations. It’s down to me to put the work in and show him everything that he’s told me. I’m trying to work on it, I’m trying to improve and I’m trying to get in this team. At the same time, I feel like I can’t get too angry and frustrated because quite frankly the team is doing amazing.“It’s a team game. It’s just not about me. I just need to make sure that I’m ready in moments like this where I can contribute. Just make sure I’m in the right mind frame to come on and influence the game.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it’s going to be a tool that they are going to need to use all their lives,” Cave said.“In Bridgwater we’ve gotHinkley Point being built, the new nuclear power station, and Gravity, which is a massivegigafactory for batteriesfor Jaguar Land Rover. That’s all going to be hi-tech businesses and children are going to need to know this stuff to get on with employment in the local area.”Marina Wyatt, head of science for key stage 3 at Furze Platt senior school in Maidenhead, said that she has found teacher-led use of AI useful for engaging students in discussions, including with a virtual Charles Darwin.“We prompt the AI before we take the class – we tell it: ‘Imagine you are Charles Darwin, you have students from a science class who are interested in your experience around the world, they particularly want to know about the theory of evolution, natural selection, variation and inheritance.’“In the prompt we tell it to respond as Charles Darwin, and stay in the role. And it works. It came up with some brilliant stuff.“Children who often don’t have the opportunity to participate, for one reason or another, were hooked on this and were asking questions like crazy,” Wyatt said.Wyatt could screen the ChatGPT Darwin’s answers to the students’ questions before playing them aloud to the class, allowing her to avoid inaccuracies or bias.Wyatt said students were not given direct access to using AI while the school was developing policies for its use, including parental consent and data security.Daisy Christodoulou, head of education forNo More Marking, a firm adapting technology for classroom assessments, said the exciting uses of AI and large language models (LLMs) came with concerns about the effects on how pupils learn.“The first problem – and most fundamental problem – is a basic principle from cognitive science: learning is not performance,” Christodoulou said.“What this means is that the fundamental underpinning skills and knowledge you need to become an expert user of LLMs – or indeed any modern technology – are often not best acquired simply by playing around with the technology.“A lot of adults find LLMs useful because they already have the basic literacy, numeracy and background knowledge to make sense of their outputs. Twenty years ago we heard a lot of hype about how you didn’t need to know anything because you could just look it up on Google. That was wrong, and we are in danger of repeating the error with LLMs.”Emma Darcy, director of technology for learning atDenbigh high schoolin Luton, said the uses and pitfalls of AI were taught in weekly “digital character” classes for year 7 pupils.“After the explosion of ChatGPT two years ago, we didn’t want to wait for official guidance to come out because we knew we needed to be having those conversations with our staff and students,” Darcy said.Researchers fool university markers with AI-generated exam papersRead more“We’ve got a student AI steering group as well that meets monthly. We thought it was important because young people are the end users of the technology but don’t get a voice in how it’s used in school.”But the school has enabled controlled use of AI in some cases, utilising Canva graphic design software.“We did a big project with the whole school around presenting positive images of Luton and we asked the students to use Canva to help generate an image of a car representing Luton and the Luton community,” Darcy said.“But what we were actually teaching was language and literacy skills, what a good prompt would look like and image generation. What we don’t do is send students directly on to an LLM – it needs to be done with a clear learning objective and purpose.”Explore more on these topicsSchoolsArtificial intelligence (AI)Teachers' workloadTeachingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump is seen sipping cocktails with a topless Benjamin Netanyahu on sun loungers, while Elon Musk tears flatbread into dips.The video first emerged in February, shortly after Trump unveiled hisproperty development plan for Gaza, under which he said he wants to “clean out” the population of about 2 million people to create the “Riviera of the Middle East”.Trump then posted the clip without any explanation on his Truth Social platform on 26 February.Solo Avital, an LA-based film-maker, said he created the video in less than eight hours while experimenting with AI tools in early February, and that its spread had “surprised the hell out of me”.“We are storytellers, we’re not provocateurs, we sometimes do satire pieces such as this one was supposed to be. This is the duality of the satire: it depends what context you bring to it to make the punchline or the joke. Here there was no context and it was posted without our consent or knowledge,” he added.Trump faces Truth Social backlash over AI video of Gaza with topless Netanyahu and bearded bellydancersRead moreAvital, who is a US citizen born inIsrael, and his business partner, Ariel Vromen – director of the 2012 film The Iceman, starring Michael Shannon, Winona Ryder and Chris Evans – run EyeMix, a visuals company where they produce documentaries and commercials.Avital said he was experimenting with the Arcana AI platform, and decided to create “satire about this megalomaniac idea about putting statues [in Gaza]” to see what the tool could do.He had shared the video clip with friends, while his business partner posted it on his popular Instagram for a few hours, before Avital encouraged him to take it down on the grounds “it might be a little insensitive and we don’t want to take sides”.The pair shared an early version with Mel Gibson, whoTrump named as a special ambassador to Hollywood in Januaryand who has previously collaborated with EyeMix and Arcana. Gibson told them he shared another video about the LA fires with people close to Trump, but denied sharing the Gaza video with the president, the creators said.The first Avital knew that the video had reached a wider audience was when he awoke to thousands of messages on his phone, as friends alerted him to Trump’s post.Avital said he was surprised by some of the reactions to the video. “If it was the skit for Saturday Night Live the whole perception of this in the media would be the opposite – look how wild this president is and his ideas, everyone would think it’s a joke.”He said the experience had reinforced for him “how fake news spreads when every network takes what they want and shoves it down their viewers with their narratives attached”.He hoped this experience would “spark a public debate about rights and wrongs” of generative AI, including what the rights of creators are.However, as a creative industries professional, he said he generally welcomed AI, saying it is “the best thing that’s happened to creativity by a long shot. Everyone who thinks it will kill creativity, we’re proof to the contrary. This film wouldn’t have been created without human intervention.”Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who specialises in identifying deepfakes, said this was “not the first time and won’t be the last time” that AI-generated clips about news events would go viral. He noted there had been a flurry of content created around the LA wildfires, including a video of a burnt Oscars trophy.He said Avital’s experience should make people realise “there’s no such thing as ‘I just shared with a friend’. You make something, assume you don’t have control.”He added the fact the video was intended as political satire but repurposed as “very compelling, visceral” propaganda by Trump highlighted the risk of AI-generated video.“It allows individuals without a lot of time, money and, frankly, skill you would normally need, to generate some pretty eye-popping content.

As the survey points out, this is an open-ended question: early, groundbreaking titles such as Space Invaders and Pong regularly crop up as answers because they helped write the rules of the form, but on a personal level, the right game at the right time can be exceptionally influential, too. For players, it’s often the games that made us feel differently about what games could do that feel the most influential. For a game designer, a film director, a writer or a musician, one particular game might inspire a whole creative era.Inspired by Bafta’s survey, we asked people from across games and culture for their most influential game – and not one name cropped up twice.Mike Bithell, game designer and head of Bithell GamesView image in fullscreenRevision evasion … Metal Gear Solid 2.Photograph: KonamiMetal Gear Solid 2 (2001) hit me at the perfect moment. I was trying to power through my GCSEs, and here came this perfect thing that pointed to a future of games that took me seriously as a player. (I nearly failed my last maths test after staying up for those final few cutscenes.) It engaged with sci-fi tropes and stylish storytelling in a way that felt generations ahead of its peers. Shenmue was the game that convinced me I wanted to make games, but MGS2 showed me thekindof games I wanted to make. One day I’ll get there.Louise Blain, creative lead at Blumhouse GamesView image in fullscreenFresh fear … PT.Photograph: Kojima Productions/KonamiHelpfully, the constantly evolving nature of the horror genre means that a new game can arrive and instantly unlock a fresh fear. Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro’s shortform horror game PT (2014) holds a special place in my heart, and it’s all the more bittersweet for the fact that it is now unavailable and its full-length successor, Silent Hills, never saw the light of (foggy) day. Taking the lead from Amnesia: The Dark Descent’s oppressive first person experience, the simplicity of PT’s looping corridor is its masterstroke. All you really need to do is push forward and peer into its darkest corners, making this a frankly agonising haunted house taken entirely at your own pace. The game has spawned an infinite number of spiritual successors in atmospheric horror over the last decade, but even the recent trend for anomaly horror has a distinct PT flavour, as we enter the same spaces over and over again, on edge for the frightening differences.Keza MacDonald, Guardian video games editorView image in fullscreenBeyond fun … The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.Photograph: NintendoAs Grand Theft Auto’s Dan Houser once said: “Anyone who makes 3D games who says they’ve not borrowed something from Mario or Zelda is lying.” The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998) set an example for explorable 3D game worlds that is still followed today – everything, from Link’s movement to the sword combat to the little fairy who acts as a guide to what was then a new way of controlling games, was designed from scratch and with little precedent. But it’s themoodof this game that I think was especially influential, not just on me but a generation of children who played it. Ocarina of Time is exciting, but also scary and a little sad. With its child hero, who hurtles forward in time against his will, it depicts a loss of innocence; it trusted young players to overcome their nervousness and get to grips not just with a new type of video game, but with all the threatening creatures, malevolent forces and hidden secrets that might be out there in its world. I think it’s the first video game I played that felt like it wasn’t just for fun.Ellie Gibson, comedianView image in fullscreenGirls’ own adventure … Tomb Raider.Photograph: ReutersThe obvious and only correct answer is Tomb Raider (1996). It introduced the idea that a female video game character could be the star, rather than sidekick or hostage. It was the first game I played that wasn’t just about collecting shiny things or killing baddies (and it’s a great shame the series lost its way down these rabbit holes in later years). It was about adventure, exploration and clever puzzles that made you feel like a genius when you finally solved them. Tomb Raider went on to inspire a raft of successful action adventure titles, such as the Uncharted games, and its influence is still present in the Assassin’s Creed series. It’s a shame this influence didn’t extend to inspiring a raft of strong female characters, but patriarchy gonna patriarchy, innit. On a personal note, Lara Croft was such a huge influence on me personally that in 2002 I visited Angkor Wat wearing a tight vest and attempted to climb up a temple via some overhanging vines. I got shouted at by a security guard and ran away.Nina Freeman, game designerView image in fullscreenPhysical humour … QWOP.Photograph: Foddy.netThe most influential game for me must be QWOP (2008), by Bennett Foddy. It sort of brings me back to my roots when I play it. I’ve always been drawn to small, experimental games, and QWOP is a timeless example of that. At one of the first game jams I ever did, my friends and I madehow do you Do It?, which was heavily inspired by the physical humour of QWOP. Bennett, whom I hadn’t yet met, was a judge at the jam! We showed him the game, chatted a bunch, and kept in touch after that. Bennett ended up becoming one of my biggest mentors at this early stage of my career, so his work in general has had a big impact on me.Brenda Romero, game designerView image in fullscreenFather of FPS … Doom.Photograph: id SoftwareLook, I admit a bias here, but even if I were not married to John [Romero], my answer would still be the same: Doom (1993). I actually tried to think of something else, but nothing compared to its impact. Doom defined the first person shooter and set the stage for what is gaming’s most popular genre. At the same time, it introduced deathmatch and online multiplayer to a wide audience. All FPS games truly owe their DNA to Doom.Doom was created to be moddable, and that decision is part of the reason why the community is still active almost 32 years later. I don’t know of a single game developer who was not taken aback when Doom hit. It was mind blowing and a cultural shift for both games and game culture. At the time, consoles really dominated, and Doom sold the PC hard.From a design perspective, Doom introduced the abstract level design philosophy, the style for which John Romero is still known. As a designer, the non-linear and non-standard level design was a big break from the way things were done at the time. I have heard others say that everything about those early levels was a masterclass in game design. Not a week goes by where a well-known game developer doesn’t credit Doom for inspiring them and starting their career. And it’s still going, now playableon everythingfrom pianos to ATMs and pregnancy tests.Iain Cook, musician, producer and composerView image in fullscreenMile melter … A Nintendo 64 with a Mario Kart 64 cartridge.Photograph: Sam Stephenson/AlamyI had mostly kicked my video game addiction for the only period in my life between 1997 and 1999, but fell off the wagon hard when the PlayStation 2 was released. The next-gen allure of Metal Gear Solid 2, Silent Hill 2 and Gran Turismo 3 convinced me that I was missing out on something revolutionary. But in 2001 I was suddenly in the recording studio and on tour in Europe and America with my first proper band, Aereogramme, and there was a lot of downtime to fill. Eight-hour driving days in the back of a smokey van; endless post-soundcheck afternoons, waiting anxiously to go on stage. Not that I didn’t succumb to other vices, but video games made the hours melt away. Advance Wars was a huge hit with me and my bandmates; the pass-and-play turn-based strategy really worked to engage the brain in between service station piss stops and weed-induced naps. But it was Mario Kart (1992-present) that really got the heart pounding.In time trials on 2001’s Super Circuit I would spend an hour or more trying to shave a tenth of a second off the previous best three laps laid down by the fastest racer in the band. Once we’d dialled in on a new course, identified the shortcuts and mapped out the best racing line, you had to stitch all of those things perfectly together in a single run. Mess up and there’s no point in continuing. Restart. Deep breath. Palms sweating. You needed total focus as well as muscle memory. The mounting anxiety explodes in expletive-filled euphoria when you cross the line. This game has brought me together with some amazing people. I’m now part of a WhatsApp group where my friends and I compete with other bands and video game industry people, setting a new course every couple of weeks, posting screenshots to validate authenticity. I know for sure that when Mario Kart 9 drops, my productivity is going to drop sharply again.Sam Barlow, game designer and founder of Half MermaidView image in fullscreenWay to go … Super Mario Bros.Photograph: NintendoSuper Mario Bros (1985). What more to say? You move a character – he looks like ahuman, and a characterful human. There is a world: the one in the background, evocative landscapes and skies; and the one in the foreground that you run and jump over. The imagery! Natural landscapes mashed up with Alice in Wonderland. The physics and the controls allow expression – you can go fast, slow, cautious, bold … it’s the way in which we exist as a primal level as a biped that walks through the world, condensed down into a game. Challenge, exploration, expression. We go left to right, and there are levels and goals and bosses … and secrets! This game laid down the structures and the ideas that we’ve been using ever since – but also showed that masterful execution is the heart of a video game.Shuhei Yoshida, former head of PlayStation StudiosView image in fullscreenSentimental … Journey.Photograph: SonyMy most influential game of all time is Journey (2012). Journey moved players deeply; they had tears in their eyes at the end. It was proof that a game, like movies and novels, could affect people emotionally.This game, which was developed by a small team of 18 people and could be played in three to four hours, swept most of the industry’s highest game of the year honours, competing against AAA blockbuster titles. I believe it was the first time that had happened in the industry.Meghna Jayanth, writer and narrative designerView image in fullscreenSim sensation … Princess Maker 2 Refine.Photograph: CFK Co/Bliss BrainThe Princess Maker series (1991-2007). You are tasked with raising a fairy princess disguised as an ordinary human girl, managing her time between learning important skills, pursuing her interests, adventuring and dating. This early social simulation game is surprisingly crunchy and punishing; it’s extremely possible for your “daughter” to die or be exiled during the various social and political trials that mark her coming-of-age. Each instalment varies, but it’s not uncommon to have 50+ endings as well as branching dialogue and narrative events conditional on your princess’s particular stats and attributes. As a narrative designer this game was a revelation, and apart from in my own work, I think you can see its influence in everything from the wildly successful Persona games to last year’s intriguing indie meditation on capitalism Final Profit to any of Hanako Games’ niche but satisfying offerings. In fact, I see a genre through-line all the way to the ambitious and genuinely brilliant design of indie game Closer the Distance, one of this year’s Independent games festival narrative nominees. Oh, and it was unashamedly marketed to and interested in girls. I wish more publishers and executives would pay attention. This is a game that I wish was evenmoreinfluential.Keith Stuart, Guardian video game correspondentView image in fullscreenWeirdly therapeutic … PaperboyPhotograph: AtariIn the early 1980s, most of the games I played were extremely abstract: you were a space ship fighting aliens, or you were a hungry yellow circle being chased by ghosts. But in 1985 Atari released Paperboy, a game in which you were a boy delivering papers. Not only was this arcade classic revolutionary in that it featured a real-life job, it also presented a world that was absolutely full of detail and experimentation, in which players were actively rewarded for messing about. What if you threw a paper at a window or a passerby? You got feedback. Windows smashed, people chased you. As a schoolboy with an actual paper round it felt weirdly therapeutic to do the job badly, but in game design terms it also taught a generation of creators that the everyday world is an exciting, amusing and challenging place to set a video game. And as a game that rewarded mischief, it was GTA a dozen years early.Explore more on these topicsGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This malign strategy must be stoppedThu 6 Mar 2025 13.50 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 18.54 ESTShareIt is two months since Justin Trudeau announced his resignation as Liberal party leader and Canada’s prime minister. After a decade in power, Mr Trudeau had become increasingly unpopular. Two out of three Canadians thought he was doing a bad job. The opposition Conservatives led in almost every poll. With the Liberals staring a 2025 general election defeat in the face, Mr Trudeau’sministersforced him out. His successor will be chosen this Sunday.But then cameDonald Trump. Mr Trump wants to strengthen the US at the expense of its neighbours. His hostility to Canada is thus visceral and deep. Without any justification, he promised illegal 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican imports. As a fig leaf for his intentions, he falsely claimed that Canada’s 5,000-mile border with the US was an open door for migrants and drugs. He talked, repeatedly and deliberately, of annexing Canada and making it the 51st state. He mocked Mr Trudeau, referring to him as merely a state governor.It is a malign strategy, at odds with the previous long alliance between the two nations. InCanada, Mr Trump’s aggression has backfired spectacularly. Unsurprisingly, Canadian national feeling has been turbocharged. Canadians are boycotting US goods and cancelling US holidays. The US national anthem has been booed at sports events. Mr Trudeau is quitting, but he has been giving as good as he gets in the fight against Mr Trump.This week, Mr Trump finally brought in the tariffs, in flagrant breach of the North American free trade agreement. Then, following emergency talks with manufacturers that built their businesses around the cross-border terms of that agreement, hesuspendedthose on cars for a month the next day. Stock markets tanked on day one, but rebounded a little on day two.On Tuesday,addressing Congress, Mr Trump again told outright lies about the scale of migration, drug smuggling and trade imbalances with Canada. Yet the chaos continues, with global economic implications. Further tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium are scheduled next week. It amounts to a systematic and wholly unprovoked attack on the economy and sovereignty of a peaceful and prosperous neighbour, for which there is no excuse whatever.Ironically, Mr Trump’s main political achievement is to have revived the Canadian Liberals, who have turned a large polling deficit around and are nowclosing the gapwith Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives. Whether that gap closes even further will depend partly on the choice of Mr Trudeau’s successor, which lies between the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland and the former Bank of England chief Mark Carney.The Trump onslaught also posesa testof judgment and patriotism for all western Conservative parties, and certainly for Canada’s. An election contest that was previously about the incumbent Liberals’ record has been transformed into one about who is best placed to stand up for Canadian sovereignty. Mr Trump’s unpopularity is the central election issue. Mr Poilievre has been slow to adjust. This week he suggested, with all the sensitivity of Liz Truss, that the answer to the tariffs was tocut taxes.Mr Trump has overturned Canadian politics as well as the international order. As a result, in the worldwide battle to protect a rules-based trading system, and to defend an international order based on respect for sovereignty, it is Canada that finds itself in the frontline.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He didn’t even expound on his planfor the US to take overthe devastated territory and turn it into a “Riviera of the Middle East”, while expelling 2 million Palestinians to neighboring Arab countries.But Trump is already going down the same failed path as his predecessor, Joe Biden, who sent Israel a virtually unlimited supply of weapons – and failed to use US political cover at the United Nations and billions of dollars in arms as leverage to stop Israel’s war on Gaza. On 1 March, the Trump administration announced it had approved $4bnin new weaponsto Israel under emergency authorities, meaning the deal would bypass even a perfunctory review in Congress. A day later, Benjamin Netanyahubanned all food and other aiddeliveries to Gaza, imposing a new siege that threatens to collapse a fragile ceasefire reached in January.While he goes easy on the Israeli prime minister, Trump this weeksuspended all US military aidto Ukraine, days after Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a dramatic on-camera confrontation in the White House. Trump and his aides say they are using the suspension of billions of dollars in military support, along with apause in intelligence sharing, as leverage to persuade the Ukrainian leader to cooperate with US efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Trump’s sudden cutoff of weapons toUkraineproves that the US president is capable of swiftly ending arms shipments to any American ally. But Trump, like Biden before him, refuses to use that same kind of leverage to force Netanyahu to change his policies toward Gaza. Both Trump and Biden simply decided they don’t want to stop sending billions of dollars in weapons to Israel, depriving themselves of the most powerful influence they have over Netanyahu and his extremist government.Since launching the Gaza war, Netanyahu has shown that he will respond to raw power and leverage, which Trump has decided to use only against UkraineFor a businessman who prides himself on his ability to negotiate tough deals with hardball tactics, Trump is being a weak negotiator. He is refusing to play his strongest cards with the Israeli leader to ensure Netanyahu sticks to the ceasefireTrump supported. Netanyahu also knows how to placate Trump, being sycophantic in ways that Zelenskyy has so far refused to do. After Washington announced the latest $4bn in weapons shipments to Israel, Netanyahuthanked Trumpprofusely and called him “the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House”.Trump is so eager to show his support to Israel that he and his top aides are claiming credit for massive weapons deals that the Biden administration approved in its final days. In announcingthe latest dealthat skirted congressional review, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, claimed that the US administration had approved nearly $12bn in new weapons to Israel just six weeks into Trump’s second term. But more than $8bn of these arms transfers wereinitiated in early Januaryby Biden, who insisted on arming Israel into the twilight of his presidency despite being undermined and humiliated by Netanyahu for more than a year. (Those weapons included 3,000Hellfire air-to-ground missilesworth $660m, andtens of thousandsof heavy bombs, artillery shells and GPS guidance kits and fuses for bombs, totaling $6.75bn.)The latest batch of munitions approved by the Trump administration includesmore than 35,000 US-made, 2,000lb “bunker buster” bombs, which cause enormous casualties when dropped on population centers. In the first month of its war on Gaza, which started after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel, the Israeli militarydropped hundreds of 2,000lbbombs on the territory – an intensity unmatched since the US bombardment of Vietnam. Israel’s extensive use of these bunker buster munitions, along with “dumb bombs” that often kill and wound civilians indiscriminately, probably constitutewar crimes, according to UN experts. At least one US-based human rights group hasasked the international criminal courtto investigate Biden and two of his top cabinet members for “aiding and abetting” Israeli war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza, based on the unfettered flow of US weapons and intelligence support.View image in fullscreen‘Trump’s cutoff of weapons to Ukraine proves he is capable of ending arms shipments to any ally. But he refuses to use that leverage in Israel.’Photograph: Evan Vucci/APWhile Trump has nothing but contempt for international law, he’s been emboldened by Biden and other western leaders who for 15 months ignored and tried to discredit international courts and prosecutors in order to protect Israel while it waged its devastating war on Gaza. Trump’s disdain for therules-based international order, which was put in place after the end of the second world war to manage global conflicts, is partly rooted in seeing that order shattered by both Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Israel’s destruction of Gaza.Netanyahu has also been emboldened by the collapse of the west’s even nominal rhetoric about respect for international law and human rights. Since launching the Gaza war, Netanyahu has shown that he will respond to raw power and leverage, which Trump has decided to use only against Ukraine. With Trump maintaining an uninterrupted supply of weapons to Israel, Netanyahu has little incentive to change course and be less obstinate. Already, the Israeli premier has been working toundermine the ceasefirewith Hamas, which was brokered by the Biden administration and Trump’s incoming Middle East envoy,Steve Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer. The truce took effect a day before Trump’s inauguration on 20 January.As the ceasefire’s first phase expired on 2 March, Netanyahu refused to start the second phase, which requires a complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza and negotiations over a more permanent truce. Instead, Netanyahuwants to change the dealand is pressuring Hamas to accept a six-week extension of the first phase of the ceasefire, with Hamas committing to release more hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, but without an Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal or long-term truce. Netanyahu is worried that his governing coalition would collapse if he agrees to a permanent ceasefire, especially since the far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich,has repeatedly threatenedto resign and bring down the government if Netanyahu ends the war before destroying Hamas.With Trump’s support, Netanyahu is now violating the ceasefire he had accepted by imposing another blockade on Gaza. Israeli officials say theycoordinated the cut-offof humanitarian aid with the Trump administration, which issued a statement thatblamed Hamasfor the suspension of ceasefire talks, even though the group had agreed to move to the second phase. As the Biden administration did for months, Trump put all the blame on Hamas while absolving Netanyahu of responsibility for trying to change the ceasefire terms and drag out negotiations so he can stay in power.Israel’s latest siege deprives Palestinians of basic needs like food, fuel and medicine – and it plunges Gaza back into the worst days of the Israeli military assault, which killedmore than 48,000 Palestiniansand displaced nearly 2 million. The blockade also opens Israel to renewed charges that it is committingwar crimes in Gaza. Both the Geneva conventions and theRome Statute, the founding document of the international criminal court, prohibit using starvation of civilians as a weapon of war, and consider it a war crime. In November, theICC issued arrest warrantsfor Netanyahu and Israel’s former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, on charges of using starvation as a method of warfare and other crimes against humanity.Today, Trump is repeating the failed and morally bankrupt policies of the Biden administration – unwavering support and unrestrained weapons shipments toIsrael, even as Netanyahu backs out of his commitment to the ceasefire that both administrations pushed him into accepting. And Trump risks becoming as deeply complicit in Israel’s war crimes as Biden had been.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionIsraelDonald TrumpUkraineIsrael-Gaza warGazacommentShareReuse this content"

But the president’s crypto plans and job cuts leave Americans holding the bagThu 6 Mar 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 11.56 ESTShareElon Musksaid onJoe Rogan’s show last week that social security is “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time”.Rubbish. In a Ponzi scheme, a con artist lures investors into a fake investment project, pockets the cash, and then gets new “investors” to funnel cash to the older ones – until new recruits slow down and the whole thing collapses. Suckers are left holding worthless bags.Social security isnota Ponzi scheme. It’s an exceptionally efficient part of the American social safety net – theoppositeof a Ponzi scheme. Which is why the overwhelming majority of Americansoppose cutting it.Social security is a “pay as you go” program. Current workers, via the payroll tax, fund payouts for retirees and disabled people. In 2024,about one in five US residentsreceived social security.I used to be a trustee of the social security trust fund. I know social security.As the social security administrationexplains: “In 2025, when you work, about 85 cents of every social security tax dollar you pay goes to a trust fund. This fund pays monthly benefits to current retirees and their families and to surviving spouses and children of workers who have died. About 15 cents goes to a trust fund that pays benefits to people with disabilities and their families.”The only reason social security is running out of money is that its trustees never anticipated America’s current degree of income inequality – with so much of the nation’s income in the hands of relatively few people (such as Musk).The way to fix this is to lift the cap on income subject to social security payroll taxes, which is now $176,100.You want a real Ponzi scheme? Look at the crypto investments Musk and Trump have hypedElon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg fulfilled their 2025 social security payroll tax obligations a few minutes past midnight on 1 January. Most Americans keep paying payroll taxes all year.You want a real Ponzi scheme? Look at the crypto investments Musk and Trump have hyped.Trump’s new cryptocurrency, $Trump,soaredand then crashed – exactly like a Ponzi scheme. It generated enormous profits for insiders anda cumulative $2bn in lossesfor more than 800,000 other investors.Trump claims ignorance. “I don’t know if it benefited” me, hesaid. “I don’t know much about it.” (The Trump family and its business partners earned nearly $100m in trading fees alone on the coin.)Musk has been promoting Dogecoin since 2019. Its value surged over 70% in the days following Trump’s announcement of the launch of Musk’s so-called“department of government efficiency” (Doge). Since then, it’s dropped like a rock. A classic Ponzi scheme.With Trump now in office, crypto is emerging from a four-year federal crackdown on crypto fraud, market manipulation and other scams following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX in 2022, one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in recent memory.On Friday, Trump is holding a “crypto summit” at which he’ll promote the idea of a federalcrypto reservethat will give crypto schemes a temporary boost by increasing demand for them.But why should American taxpayers foot the bill for a crypto reserve? The most obvious winner will be Trump, whose own crypto venture carries millions of dollars in tokens that are to be included in the reserve. Other winners will be crypto executives, many of whom donated extensively to Trump’s re-election effort.One example: Ripple – whose XRP token is one of the five that Trump said would be included –donated $45mto an industry-wide Pac that sought to help elect Trump and other Republicans.In fact, most of Trump’s crypto schemes are just ways to curry his favor by paying him off.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Robert ReichFree newsletterGet Robert Reich’s latest columns delivered straight to your inboxEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Pax Americana that long ensured peace, security and freedom in Europe is over. Anyone who still doubted this will hopefully now realise, after the disgraceful treatmentUkraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy enduredlast Friday at the White House, that we can no longer rely on the Americans for our collective security.We must hope for the best, but hope is not a policy. We – theNetherlands, the EU, and all western countries standing with Ukraine – must prepare for the worst. The question is this: how do we keep Ukraine free and independent, and how do we protect our economy, our freedom and democracy, and our borders?This begins with the awareness that our security is already directly threatened by Russia. Trump wants to do business over our heads with this country. It appears that he and Vladimir Putin have dividedEuropeinto spheres of influence like two mob bosses in a low-budget movie. As the saying goes: if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.The Netherlands is not an island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean; we are fully exposed when geopolitical and economic storms brew on our continent. It is the Russian aggression inUkrainethat has made our energy prices rocket. We cannot batten down the hatches and wait for the storm to pass. We are a medium-sized country with significant European and international interests. It is high time we acted accordingly.But political divisions at the heart of our government are leaving us exposed. The biggest party in the coalition governing the Netherlands, the Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, has a history of pro-Kremlin rhetoric. While other parties, such as the centre-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), formerly led by Mark Rutte, are staunch advocates of unwavering support of Ukraine. Combined with an unelected prime minister, Dick Schoof, who serves no specific political party, the coalition government is rudderless and unstable.It is abundantly clear that our national scale is far too small to make a real difference. Today, we need the EU more than ever before. We must also work on closer ties with countries that share our sense of urgency and are not EU members, primarily the UK and Norway, but also Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The EU will also need to take a much firmer stance against member states such as Hungary that spare no effort in promoting Putin’s (and Trump’s) agenda.View image in fullscreenThe Dutch prime minister, Dick Schoof, at The Hague, The Netherlands, 5 March 2025.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/REX/ShutterstockThe most urgent priority now is to support Ukraine. We must fill the gaps that Trump is leaving behind. Financially, this should not be too complicated, but in military terms, this is a different challenge. Russia will now intensify its attacks, so all available military equipment must be sent to Ukraine as quickly as possible. With additional financial support, we can also get the Ukrainian defence industry up and running at full capacity.The Russians are struggling more than it appears at first glance; sanctions are damaging the country, the losses are significant, and the war economy is creating large gaps elsewhere. Sanctions need to be scaled up much further, and all frozen Russian assets in the EU must be transferred to Ukraine immediately.Geert Wilders won’t be Dutch PM, but he can still harm Europe. He must be challenged | Ties DamsRead moreEU member states must wake up and stop squabbling over trivial matters. The same goes for the Schoof cabinet. It is all hands on deck now. This means thinking creatively about European war bonds and finding the fastest possible way to bolster our defence in preparation for a confrontation in which the Americans may leave us to fend for ourselves. This requires investing in areas that the Americans currently cover within Nato. Moreover, it is vital for the overall resilience of Dutch society that defence investments do not come at the expense of our social safety net.In the longer term, we must first establish a partnership that provides the collective security guarantee of Nato without having to rely on the US. Crucial to this is the involvement of Britain and possibly Canada, and European countries that are not members of the EU. Therefore, it should go beyond the EU and perhaps also exclude countries, if these, such as Hungary or the nominally neutral Austria and Ireland, for example, do not want to participate.Second, it is of national security interest to make progress on a genuine energy union. High energy prices constitute the primary economic threat to this continent. This requires much more collective investment in energy networks, renewable energy, and also joint procurement of gas for as long as we need it.The Netherlands can play a leading role in all these areas, but it is not doing so. Because the coalition is deeply divided, the prime minister speaks too hesitantly, too late, and too ambiguously. Because the coalition is not allocating additional funds for Ukraine and is implementing utterly nonsensical cuts to the contributions to the EU, the words of support are literally and figuratively cheap. Because the largest coalition party is at best ambiguous and usually sides with Trump – who is now also siding with Putin – our government is adrift.Fortunately, there is still hope. The rudderless government may be on the brink of despair, but the people are not without hope, and our country is certainly not without prospects. The Dutch people see that the world order is changing. In such extraordinary, dangerous times, they deserve a decisive, united government.Frans Timmermans is the leader of the leftwing alliance of the Dutch Green party and the Labour party (GroenLinks/PvdA)Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I spoke to someone who knows all about the power – and price – of protestThu 6 Mar 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 06.02 ESTShareSince Donald Trump took office for his second term, he has taken a blowtorch to America. Hehas pardoned January 6 rioters, started thegutting of the federal government, eliminateddiversity, equity and inclusion programs, insultedwho we thoughtwere the country’s allies, andvilified immigrants.Etan ThomasWhile there have been voices of dissent in the sports world – such asformer NFL punter Chris Kluweandsoccer coach Jesse Marsch– athletes have largely stayed silent on Trump’s policies, a stark contrast to his first term in power. In recent months, Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce spoke of their pride in playing in front of Trump at the Super Bowl, while the Philadelphia Eaglesare reportedly keento visit the White House to celebrate their NFL title,a decision supported by Charles Barkley, who believes boycotts make the nation more divided.I couldn’t disagree more with Barkley. So I wanted to sit down with the epitome of the athlete activist, someone who didn’t hesitate to express his beliefs,even in the face of enormous backlash. And that is the great Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, whose protest during the national anthem in 1996 cost him his NBA career. Below is our conversation, which was has been lightly edited for length and clarity, about the importance of protest under the Trump administration.Etan Thomas:Do you think athletes have gone a little quiet since Trump has taken office? How important is it for athletes to not stay silent?Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf:It’s definitely not just athletes, but for the context of this discussion, we can focus on athletes. And, yes, it’s super important [for athletes to speak up]. I can’t help but think of years ago, J Edgar Hoover was discussing the power of the athlete. And how [the] goal was to shift [focus] from the Muhammad Ali types to the more quiet type of athlete because those in power recognize the power that athletes had to influence people. Especially an athlete that’s articulate and knows how to communicate and is current with all of the issues. So, there is an enormous amount of power that a lot of athletes … don’t realize that they have.ET:A lot of the reasoning given as to why athletes may be more reluctant to speak out now is because they are making so much more money and have much more to lose.MAR:Well, to whom much is given much is expected. Sometimes, people are quiet when they’re trying to get ahead in fear of messing up their chances to succeed, and I understand that. But when you get to a point where you are making millions and your finances are all taken care of, you would think that it would embolden you even more. But for so many of us, it makes it even worse … Sometimes, people listen to athletes more than they will academics who have studied the issues continuously.The 2026 Trade War World Cup encapsulates our new nativist world order | Aaron TimmsRead moreET:Has the time of athlete activism passed? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar once told me “if you have someone with that type of power and influence, pushing for something you don’t agree with, of course they are going to try to do whatever they can to silence them, because they are a threat to them.”MAR:Mr Abdul Jabbar was absolutely correct. So athletes having that power, have to prepare themselves for that responsibility. And if you want to improve on anything, you have to practice. We have to prepare ourselves just like we do on the basketball court. Just as we train, plan and strategize to overcome the opponent, exploit their weaknesses, capitalize on your strengths to win the game, that same strategic analysis has to be applied in real life. You can’t lose those lessons. It has to carry over. And let me add to that, the more athletes surround themselves with people who can influence them in a positive way, the better.ET:Like Muhammad Ali being mentored by Malcolm X.MAR:Exactly. Without the influence of Malcolm X, we may have only known Muhammad Ali as the greatest boxer of all time. And that would’ve been tragic. An athlete can be utilized as a mouthpiece to wake up the masses … because if an athlete says it, they pay more attention. It shouldn’t be that way of course, but a lot of times, that’s the reality. But honestly, the masses shouldn’t need anyone to point out what is clear and evident. It is amazing that a small cabal of people have convinced the masses to accept their oppression while they know they are being oppressed.ET:Like Trump getting so many people to vote against their own interests for a second time.MAR:Exactly, yes. So to answer your original question, it’s mandatory [for athletes to speak out against Trump]. Too much is at stake. I have conversations with different athletes all the time, just as I’m sure you do. Different races, ages, colors, coaches, administrators, everyone. But I also have conversations with different people of everyday life all the time; not just athletes, people from all races, backgrounds, owners of companies, people in the workforce. But so many people are afraid to make it public. They got us so fearful right now.ET:Almost like everyone is afraid to stand up to the school bully. The whole reason I wrote my book We Matter: Athletes And Activism is because I wanted to praise athletes like LeBron James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant who were using their voices in Trump’s first term, despite the criticism and backlash, and showing younger athletes that they can follow suit.MAR:And they should look at those criticisms as a compliment. If the powers that be are speaking highly of you, in a system that doesn’t mean you or your people well, you should ask: “Why are they praising me?” Because they always have an angle. They are always trying to manipulate and conform to fit their agenda. But on the flip side, if they are going out of their way to tear you down, that means you are doing something right. The civil rights leader John Lewis talked about “good trouble”. Well, this is “good backlash”.ET:I like that. In your day, there was no social media. Nowadays, athletes don’t have to wait for a reporter or media outlet to interpret what their message is. They have the power to construct their own message, however they want to. But power unrecognized is just a waste.MAR:I wish we had social media back in the day. Being able to control your own narrative and get your own message out the way you want to is invaluable. And to add to that, now athletes have the ability to feel the support of the community through social media. So just as you can feel the backlash, you can also feel support. We didn’t have that when we were coming up. We kind of felt like we were on an island by ourselves because we only heard the media backlash. So, yes, social media plays a big difference in many ways.ET:Any final thoughts?MAR:OK, let me end it with this. If you’re really about human freedom and justice you have no choice but to speak up. With everything going on right now, it’s crucial for everyone to use whatever platform they have – not just athletes but everyone. I want to make that point clear. We can’t put this all on athletes even though we know and understand the level of influence athletes have. Silence is acceptance, compliance and ultimately agreement with the status quo. It was Huey P Newton who said: “I do not think life will change for the better without an assault on the establishment”. With the magnitude of where we are right now, remaining silent isn’t an option. Either you’re part of the solution, or you’re part of the problem. And that goes for everyone, not just athletes.Explore more on these topicsUS sportsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsNBANFLBasketballcommentShareReuse this content"

Now it’s a stubborn problemJon ArnoldAn anti-gay slur’s at San Diego FC’s home debut prompted a strong response from the club. They’re not the first ones forced to address a tired tropeThu 6 Mar 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 13.16 ESTShareIt all started as a bit of a joke, just not a funny one. Now infamous enough to be known as ‘the chant’ or ‘the p-word’ even in English, historical accounts say the homophobic chant that has remained persistent in Mexican soccer began in Guadalajara. Atlas fans were infuriated by goalkeeper Oswaldo Sánchez’s departure from their team and his eventual return to their rivals Guadalajara. That’s when they tweaked a traditional gridiron football ritual, building up noise before belting out an anti-gay slur whenever Sánchez took a goal kick.The chant appeared again – this time with more venom – at a game between USA and Mexico in a 2004 pre-Olympic tournament in Guadalajara. Mexico fans were still smarting from El Tri’s loss to the US at the 2002 World Cup. That led to 60,000 Tapatios directing the slur at US goalkeeper DJ Countess during Mexico’s 4-0 win. The ugly trend has continued, and grown, despite campaigns from the Mexican football federation,Fifa fines, and efforts from Liga MX, who named a full season after an alternative chant in 2021.Last week the chant once again made an unwanted appearance, during San Diego FC’s home debut as an MLS expansion team.San Diego FC condemns homophobic chant heard at first MLS home gameRead moreThe club reacted swiftly. Sensing the opportunity to nip things in the bud, San Diego head coach Mikey Varas made statements after the match, in English and Spanish, condemning the chant.“Look, we can’t have racism, we can’t have discriminatory words in our sport, at our club, in our community. It’s unacceptable,” he said. “It doesn’t represent me, the players or the club and doesn’t reflect San Diego as a community. This is a diverse community that is full of love. We can’t go and say things like we did in this game … This was people in the general seats, not everyone, but a group we heard and I want to say that if they’re going to keep doing that it’s better that they don’t come to matches. Those aren’t the values we have.”San Diego sporting director Tyler Heaps echoed that sentiment. Clips of Heaps’ and Varas’s statements were posted on the club’s social media accounts next to celebratory posts about the team’s successful start to life inMLS. The team continued its push Monday, releasing a statement from club ownership saying they “will take immediate steps to address this behavior and will communicate a detailed plan prior to the next home match.”MLS talking points: Messi’s no-show, Lozano’s injury and Zaha’s debutRead moreThe club’s effort toward inclusivity has perhaps been necessitated by its location. San Diego has wisely marketed itself not just to communities across San Diego but also to fans over the border in Tijuana. The cities are so close fans in Tijuana can easily cross over fromMexicofor the match and be home in time for dinner. To this end, the team signed Hirving Lozano, a wildly popular Mexico international, to be the face of the franchise. “El Chucky” has been welcomed by throngs of fans at every press tour stop, many wearing his green Mexico jersey.View image in fullscreenSan Diego FC fans were largely positive in their support during the home opener.Photograph: Sean M Haffey/Getty ImagesSan Diego should want those fans at matches. The Mexican population is a huge part of the city’s fabric, and it makes sense for a brand new team to want as much buy-in as possible from all parts of the city’s population. But that’s also part of the problem. Mexican fans – although by no means all of or exclusively them – are the most likely to use the forbidden chant, which itself makes other groups feel like a San Diego FC game may not be a space for them after all.Fans who yell the word will typically say they aren’t trying to hurt anyone, or that it isn’t a slur. They argue that the word can be used in other contexts in Spanish: it is often heard when someone complains about traffic or is used to add emphasis to something great. In soccer, though, its usage and the context around it is clearly negative. No one shouts the word at their own team. Many LGBTQ and human rights groups in Mexico have asked for the chant to end, and they’re making that request for a good reason.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On-the-spot enforcement is difficult, not least because it can be difficult to suss out who is yelling the word in the first place. Part of the Mexican FA’s efforts to stamp it out include asking security workers to throw out offenders, something anyone who has attended a crowded match knows is highly improbable even with highly trained personnel, let alone overmatched security contractors. The Mexican FA has also threatened fines and point deductions, but some frustrated Mexico fans have used this as a misguided excuse to force change, using the chant when their team is losing in an effort to enact those very sanctions.It’s also clear that many casual fans are yelling the word to show they’re in on the “joke.” There’s a feeling that yelling the word means you’re in the know, not avillamelón, a fairweather fan. A home opener is an event that attracts many more of those fans than subsequent matches; it’s a game to see and be seen at rather than one midway through the long slog of a season.Those who yelled the word may think they are being savvy, but they expose themselves as anything but. The chant isn’t a clever chirp from the supporters’ section that gets under a rival’s skin or a new song for a new hero on a brand-new team. It’s a boring, dismal device whose only impact is embarrassing the broader fanbase and hurting people right next to them in the stands.San Diego FC’s statements seem to acknowledge this. If their efforts to eradicate the chant are successful, officials have to hope it’s something that can be replicated elsewhere. The magnifying glass of the 2026 World Cup is coming to North America next year, and far too many fans are still trying to get a laugh out of the same tired ‘joke’ that isn’t funny now, and never was.Explore more on these topicsMLSMexicoUS sportsSan Diego FCcommentShareReuse this content"

Instead, let’s build an economy for everyoneThu 6 Mar 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 11.40 ESTShareFamilies in the US are exhausted. They deserve a government that chooses them over billionaire donors. TheRepublicanbudget plan that passed the House last week calls for $4.5tn in tax giveaways for the ultra-rich and corporations. It will be paid for with enormous cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and other federal programs that serve our families and the working class. These are the folksElon Muskrefers to as the “parasite class”.The agenda of the billionaire president and the richest man in the world is crystal clear: making the rich richer while working families struggle.Our democracy is dominated by the ultra-rich because our economic system concentrates ownership and investment power into their hands. Extreme inequality is often addressed by doing one of two things: redistributing wealth, via taxes and social programs, or changing laws and policies to increase worker incomes, such as raising the minimum wage. While these strategies are certainly necessary, in both cases our economy’s core institutions – the multinational corporations, banks, pension funds and hedge funds – are left to run as usual. But this is where so much power in the US lies.There is a third option: creating ademocraticeconomy that widely distributes the power that comes through ownership and decision-making.In a democratic economy, ownership is extended beyond the wealthy few, to public and private institutions driven by the interests of ordinary peopleIn a democratic economy, ownership is extended beyond thewealthyfew, to public and private institutions, such as cooperatives and non-profits, driven by the interests of ordinary people. In many worker cooperatives, for example, the workers own the firm and elect the board on a one-member, one-vote basis. This makes power on the shop floor and pay scalesmuch more equal.The groundwork of a more democratic economy can already be seen across our country, incommunity land trusts, community development corporations,multi-stakeholder cooperatives, community development credit unions,housing cooperatives, community solar arrays,municipal broadbandand the publicBank of North Dakota, which has operated successfully for more than 100 years. Glimpses of a new economy are there within the cracks of our failing system.We have also seen political crises provide opportunities for larger scale public ownership. In the wake of the 2008 crisis, the US government became the largest shareholder ofGeneral Motors,CitigroupandAmerican International Group. While these stakes were eventually sold back, the next time, instead of bailing out failed businesses, we should transition them intodemocratic public ownershipat the municipal, state or national levels. Other firms might be converted into worker cooperatives or multi-stakeholder cooperatives, governed by workers, consumers and community representatives, ensuring those same groups benefit from the company’s operations. And monopolized banks and large asset managers can be converted into democraticregional and local public banksthat serve communities rather than shareholders.Trump is turning the media into a mouthpiece of the regime | Lawrence DouglasRead moreBeyond crisis moments, which this government is sure to produce, new public options can be established or expanded in industries such as education,childcare,housing,pharmaceutical development, healthcare,asset managementand more. These public options can provide needed goods and services at prices accessible to all, while injecting competition into monopolized industries.FromLos AngelestoNew York, for example, there are dozens of grassroots movements across our country building public options for finance. Democratic public banks and public asset managers are not run by a corporate board at the command of profit-driven shareholders lounging on yachts somewhere on the other side of the world. Instead,democratic financedraws people from across a community, through processes of random selection, election or appointment, to deliberate over and make binding decisions about how pools of assets should be allocated and invested. Without shareholders or marketing expenses, and often tax exempt, these forms of democratic finance can offer much lower-cost loans and services to working people.Powered by democratic mandates, they can make investments in renewable energy, affordable housing, community wealth-building and other institutions that meet people’s real needs. The Detroit Justice Center, for instance, is working to develop community land trusts, which are non-profits that establish community control of land and permanent affordability of housing. Democratic public banks, such as those promoted by thePublic Banking Act of 2023, could provide a ready source of capital.In a democracy, power should be in the hands of workers, community members, and democratically accountable representatives – not billionaires who govern toenrich themselves. The Republican budget is the natural outcome of an economy that funnels power and wealth to elites, while leaving working people to fend for themselves. Let’s show the billionaires we can build a democratic alternative to their corporate oligarchy.Rashida Tlaib represents Michigan’s 12th district.

The Soviet sphere of influence would infest easternEuropefor decades and US foreign policy dominated the second half of the 20th century. Churchill resisted the end of the UK’s global empire and independence for Britain’s colonies came piecemeal; they were let go with bitterness.Eighty years on, the logic present at Yalta – that large states can impose their will on smaller states – is back. Might is once again right. But history is repeating itself with a striking difference – for this time, there is no European leader at the table. Russian and US delegations have sat down to discuss Ukraine’s future withoutUkraineor the EU’s input. Eighty years down the line, Europe is no longer seen as relevant by the great powers.The urgency of Europe’s shifting geopolitical landscape was laid bare last Sunday in London,where European leadersgathered with their counterparts from the UK, Canada, Turkey, the EU and Natofor a high-level defence summit. That meeting came as a result ofthe very public collapseof White House talks between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump, and Trump’s suspension of military aid to Ukraine.EU leaders talk the talk on defence. But where will they find the billions to pay for it? | Paul TaylorRead moreEven if areported reconciliationbetween Washington and Kyiv materialises, European officials are still reeling from the rapidity of the transatlantic rupture so early in Trump’s second term. Trump’s defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, last month warned Europe it could nolonger rely on US security guarantees. JD Vance, the US vice-president, went further at the Munich Security Conference, calling Europe – not Russia or China –the primary US threat.Pax Americana – the postwar period of relative peace in the western hemisphere, with the US as the dominant economic, cultural and military world power – is over. Europe will quickly have to adapt to the new reality, with the loss of its primary strategic and military partner. What part now will the EU’s largest member state,Germany, play?Despite large gainsby the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which doubled its support in the federal election on 23 February, Germany willbe led by Friedrich Merz, head of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The chancellor-in-waiting lost no time in declaring that Europe, faced with an increasingly adversarial US, must take its fate into its own hands.“It is my absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that we can actually become independent from the US step by step,”Merz said, hours after his election victory. Stark words from a politician who as recently as a few months ago was a bona fide Atlanticist.Merz wants to forge greater unity in Europe and establish an independent European defence capability. It remains to be seen how he will go about achieving this, but he clearly aims to put Germany back into the European driving seat.German leadership has been lacking in recent years. While Paris and Warsaw took increasingly assertive positions on European security, Berlin has remained cautious. After the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, spoke of aZeitenwende– a turning point in German policy to reflect the new realities of the world. But, in the end, little but hot air was produced.Since the end of the second world war, Germany has invested relatively little in military capacity. Under the Nato umbrella, and with the close partnership with the US, this was not seen as a problem. But the world has fundamentally shifted, and Merz sees that Germany, finally, must change, too.However, an emboldened new Germany, at the head of the EU, faces a harsh world and an even harsher set of realities. The country will not only have to increase its military capacity, bring about bloc-wide military cooperation and perhaps even station troops in Ukraine, but it will also have to pay for all of this.This will require overhauling Germany’s strict ceiling on public borrowing, the so-calledSchuldenbremse(debt brake) enshrined in the constitution. Merz has now begun that process; on Tuesday, his partystruck agreementwith its prospective coalition partners, the SPD, on the creation of a special €500bn (£390bn) fund to boost defence and infrastructure spending that would be exempt from the debt constraint. If approved by the German parliament, this would amount to a dramatic and some critics warnrisky looseningof the budgetary straitjacket.Merz will also have to rally the EU (though Trump’s harrying of Europe and Zelenskyy is already pushing European leaders toward his vision), as well as face down Trump-friendly far-right parties, many of them in ascendence across the bloc.At a recent meeting in Madrid of the rightwing radical bloc of the European parliament, the Patriots for Europe, Geert Wilders, leader of the far-right PVV in the Netherlands, praised Trump as a “brother in arms”. Slovakia’s prime minister, Robert Fico,expressed his supportfor Trump’s pro-Russian policy at the rightwing Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland last month. AfD co-leader Alice Weidel has said that “Trump is implementing the policies that the AfD has been demanding for years”.These rightist politicians seem willing to risk Europe’s security and prosperity for political gain. The US turn toward Russia and away from democracy will be an existential test for the European project and Europe’s commitment to law and democracy. The art of European cooperation has long been to achieve the possible in unforeseen circumstances. Germany, under chancellor-elect Merz, has a steep learning curve ahead. But the task of stepping up to save Ukraine – and Europe – falls to Berlin.Catherine De Vries is professor of political science at Bocconi University in MilanDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He has faced two since he became prime minister last year, one domestic, the other international. The first came with the riots that followed the Southport killings, when Starmer’s response was impressive and effective. The second is Donald Trump’s attempt to stitch up Ukraine, where Starmer has been surefooted in trying to hold the line against a sellout to Russia. In both cases, he has looked like the right person in the right place at the right time.There was another example of this deftness on Wednesday in the Commons, when Starmer went out of his way to mark the anniversaries of the deaths of UK service personnel in 2007 and 2012. A total of 642 died in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars alongside their US allies. They would not be forgotten, he said. The name of JD Vance was not mentioned. Nor was the US vice-president’s contemptuous “some random country” insult this week. But Starmer’s reprimand was unerring.It is far too soon to say whether Starmer’s response to Trump’s embrace of Russia and to the US administration’s denunciations of Europe will be effective in the long run. What can be said is that, in public and private, the prime minister has so far led with tact and clarity and has scored one or two apparent successes against the run of play. Nevertheless, these are very early days. Trump boasted to Congress on Tuesday night that he was “just getting started”.Starmer’s ability in a crisis is an unexpected contrast with his leadership in the ordinary business of politics. Since July 2024, Starmer’s calm, methodical, long-game approach has succeeded only in squandering much of Labour’s election-winning goodwill, and in making him seem out of his political depth. But his deployment of these same unflashy tactics at moments of acute crisis, as in the case ofUkraine, could be gold dust. It has at least given the prime minister’s ratings a boost. There are echoes here of the rallying around Boris Johnson at the start of Covid. But remember where that ended up.It is useful to note that this low-key approach marks a notable break. Throughout the postwar period, British leaders faced with international crisis modelled themselves on Winston Churchill in 1940. Margaret Thatcher saw herself this way during the Falklands war. Tony Blair echoed it after 9/11 and over Iraq. Johnson pretended he was Churchill when Russia invaded Ukraine. Starmer’s calm approach evokes Clement Attlee more than Churchill. In every way he is unTrump.Yet Starmer has not got much to be calm about. The world of 2024 no longer exists. Trump has triggered a crisis in the North Atlantic alliance. At stake are two epochal things. First, whether Russia’smain western border will henceforward be with Ukraine, with Poland or with Germany. Second, whether the US accepts any role in ensuring future European stability. These are not small questions.There are three levels on which Starmer can try to deal with Trump, both now and for the coming four years. All of them tacitly and sometimes openly recognise the vast seriousness of the moment. All of them are predicated on the undesirability of what Trump is doing and the need to create alternatives. All of them, however, also rest on a determination not to make an enemy of the US.The first is to firefight the immediate problems that Trump creates. This involves constantly engaging with the US administration by whatever means are available to prevent or mitigate crises. It means building up defence spending. It means working with allies and so-called coalitions of the willing. It means using any leverage to earn a hearing. Essentially, it is an attempt to manoeuvre Trump to follow a different or less extreme course, while avoiding confrontation or denunciation. But it is all done under the pretence that nothing fundamental has changed.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Volodymyr Zelenskyy shake hands outside Downing Street, 1 March 2025.Photograph: Krisztián Elek/Sopa Images/Rex/ShutterstockThis is essentially the strategy that Starmer is now pursuing on Ukraine. It is why he keeps talking to Trump – three times in the past week, perhaps contributing to Trump’s relatively polite mention ofVolodymyr Zelenskyyin the speech to Congress. It is why he deploys King Charles’s soft power. It is why, perhaps, he will soon return to Washington with Zelenskyy and Emmanuel Macron in an overwhelmingly important effort to restore military aid and intelligence support to Ukraine.The second approach is to decide to suck it all up for four years, in the hope that things will then get easier. This means accepting the likelihood, though never saying so publicly, that Trump is always going to be destructive and mean-spirited. At the same time, it means working to keep US links – especially military and intelligence links – strong enough to be revived more effectively after 2028, when Trump is due to step down.For Starmer, this could mean a lot of firefighting over the next four years, without any certainty of a post-Trump dividend or British public approval. Such fires could break out on any number of issues, including not just Ukraine but also the Middle East, bilateral trade, Nato, US-EU relations and, judging by this week’s speech, Canada, Greenland and the Panama canal. Much will depend on Friedrich Merz and on Macron’s 2027 successor, too. Starmer and his national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, are also likely to have an intense under-the-radar interest in the candidates vying to succeed Trump.Starmer highlights UK’s war record in implicit rebuke to Vance as Lib Dems mock Badenoch for defending him – UK politics liveRead moreWhich leaves the third strategy. This is to accept that Trump’s approach is now the US’s new normal and that there will be no comforting return to past arrangements. Whoever comes after Trump may be friendlier, more rational and less rude. Either way, US exceptionalism, isolationism and disengagement from Europe are likely to be here to stay. So too are the immensely tough consequences for countries like Britain, which can no longer rely on a US security and intelligence shield against Russia or any other hostile states. Rearmament is back. This will require something close to a war economy, and it cannot be created overnight.At present, Starmer has one foot in the first approach and another in the second. But it is the third approach that will loom largest as an option as the next four years unfold. None of these is a soft option, and all of them overlap. Starmer is right, for example, to oppose false binary choices between Europe and the US.Nevertheless, if Trump’s speech to Congress is to be taken seriously, this is a president who has changed sides in the battle of values between democracy and authoritarianism. Starmer may feel he has to tell Europe that Trump will still “have our backs”. But Trump could just as soon stab Europe in the back too. After all, that’s exactly what he just did.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationForeign policyUS foreign policyVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkrainecommentShareReuse this content"

Trump himself is either a victim of disinformation or he is a willing participant in an effort to deceive Americans about the causes and consequences of the war.Trump’s lies include claiming that Ukraine is equally to blame for the war; that Volodymyr Zelenskyy doesn’t “have the cards” to end the conflict on favourable terms; and that Ukraine could not have defended itself without US help. Yet the whole world knows thatRussialaunched an unprovoked invasion, and we all remember the initial weeks, when Ukrainians valiantly defended an 1,800-mile frontline against a supposedly superior army, long before deliveries of western artillery, armoured vehicles and air defence systems arrived.The disgraceful scene in the Oval Office on 28 February highlighted Trump’s hostility toward Zelenskyy and fondness for Vladimir Putin. Is it just that Trump loves authoritarian figures who have fulfilled his own ambitions? Or is it that Putin haskompromaton Trump (as was widely suspected during his first term)?Would handing frozen Russian assets to Ukraine be better than reparations?Read moreWhatever the case, Trump rejects the very idea of the rule of law because he subordinates it to political interest: the law should be used when it serves the president’s interests and ignored when it does not. Agreements between countries (even those he signed) can be broken at will. The US, with the UK and Russia, promised to defend Ukraine’s territorial integrity 30 years ago under theBudapest memorandum, signed in December 1994. In exchange, Ukraine agreed to give up the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal, inherited from the Soviet Union. Russia violated the agreement when it invaded and illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, and now Ukraine has been betrayed by two of the agreement’s parties.Trump’s refusal to honour America’s word is disgraceful. The Ukrainians upheld their end of the bargain and they expected the US to do the same. These betrayals have deadly implications, and not only for Ukraine. For decades, Europe’s own security has relied on article 5 of the Nato treaty, according to which an attack on one member is an attack on all. Yet it is now obvious that the US will defendEuropeonly if doing so serves what Trump believes are his interests. International law and treaty obligations mean nothing to him, just as they mean nothing to Putin.Europeans are coming to terms with these harsh realities. The most immediate tasks are to create a self-sufficient defence force and to decide what to do with the $220bn (£170bn) in Russian sovereign assets (out of the $300bn-$350bn immobilised in 2022) now held in European jurisdictions. In June 2024, the G7 agreed to use the interest ($50bn) from these assets to provide financial aid to Ukraine, and the European Commission made the first disbursement of$3bnin January. But with the US likely to end its own financial assistance, this half-measure is no longer sufficient. Europe must go further by seizing all the Russian assets under its control.We previouslyarguedthat these assets should be used to fund Ukraine’s reconstruction, since the damage caused by Russian aggression far exceeds $220bn. But the money is needed even more urgently now. One cannot rebuild a country that is still under attack and partial occupation. Justice and common sense dictate that these resources go to fund Ukraine’s defence. Europe can use whatever legal manoeuvres it needs; what matters is that Ukraine receives the money immediately, so that it can buy military equipment and repair the infrastructure that Russia is continually destroying.The message to Democrats is clear: you must dump neoliberal economics | Joseph StiglitzRead moreThere can be no question of liability. Russia should not be allowed to claim that the assets are legally protected at a time when it is shredding the rule of law and freely confiscating western assets within its own jurisdiction. Moreover, making the funds immediately available to Ukraine would be in Europe’s own interest. Whatever Ukraine spends on its defence industry will ultimately strengthen Europe’s own defence capacity and stimulate its faltering economy.There is no time to waste. Using the funds as collateral for a future international claims commission, as has been proposed, would cause unacceptable delays. The tide of authoritarianism is rising and Europe has become the world’s bulwark against it. European values – and the defence of civil liberties, democracy and human rights globally – are on the line.AsEmmanuel Macronrecentlyput it: “Europe should rediscover the taste of risk, of ambition, and of power.” If he and other European leaders want to follow through on their rhetorical support of Ukraine after the Oval Office debacle, they must seize the moment, which means seizing Russia’s assets. Ukraine is defending all of Europe. Europe must not hide behind legalistic excuses.Joseph E Stiglitzis a Nobel laureate in economics, a university professor at Columbia University and a former chief economist of the World BankⒸProject SyndicateExplore more on these topicsBusinessProject Syndicate economistsUkraineRussiaEuropean UnionTrump administrationEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Black Inc, the publisher of the Quarterly Essay as well as fiction and nonfiction books by many prominent writers, had asked consent from its authors to train AI models on their work and then share the revenue with those authors.Now I have a dog in this race. Actually two dogs. I have published four books with Black Inc, have a fifth coming out next month, and have a contract for a sixth by the end of the year. And I have also been an AI researcher for 40 years, training AI models with data.I signed Black Inc’s deal. Yes, the publisher could have communicated its intent with more transparency and a little less urgency. With whom exactly is it trying to sign a deal? And for what? And why only give us a few days to sign? But all in all, I am sympathetic to where Black Inc finds itself.Small publishers such as Black Inc provide a valuable service to Australian literature and to our cultural heritage. No one starts a new publisher to make big money. Indeed, many small publishers are struggling to survive in a market dominated by the Big Five. For example, Penguin Random House – the world’s largest general book publisher – recently acquired one of Australia’s leading independent publishers, the TextPublishingCompany.‘Sign our own death warrant’: Australian writers angry after Melbourne publisher asks them to sign AI agreementsRead morePublishing is like venture capital. Most books lose money. Publishers make a return with the occasional bestseller. Small publishers like Black Inc nurture new Australian authors. And they publish many works that are worthy but are unlikely to make a profit. I am grateful then for their support of my modest literary career, and of the esteemed company I share, authors such as Richard Flanagan, David Marr and Noel Pearson.But I am outraged.I am outraged at the tech companies like OpenAI, Google and Meta for training their AI models, such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Llama, on my copyrighted books without either my consent or offering me or Black Inc any compensation.I told Black Inc that this was happening in early 2023. They asked how I knew since the tech companies are lacking in transparency on their training data. I told them that ChatGPT could give you a good summary of Chapter 4 of my first book.The tech companies claim this is “fair use”. I don’t see it this way. Last year, at the Sydney Writers’ festival, I called it the greatest heist in human history. All of human culture is being ingested into these AI models for the profit of a few technology companies.To add insult to outrage, the tech companies didn’t even pay for the copy of my book or likely the tens of thousand other books they used to train their models. My book isn’t available freely online. And, as far as I can tell, they trained on an illegal copy in books3, an online dataset assembled by Russian pirates. That’s not fair.Nor is it sustainable. We’re at the Napster moment in the AI race. When we started streaming music in the early 2000s, most of it was stolen. That wasn’t going to work in the long run. Who could afford to be a musician if no one paid for music? Napster was shortly sued out of business. And streaming services such as Spotify started, which paid musicians for their labours.Streaming is still not perfect. Popular artists like Taylor Swift make a good living, but the pennies being returned to struggling musicians for their streams is arguably still inadequate.Publishing needs to go in a similar direction as streaming. And for that to happen, small publishers especially need a strong position to negotiate with the mighty tech companies. I therefore signed Black Inc’s contract. It is, in my view, the lesser of the two evils.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The controversial changes would allow AI developers to train their models on any material to which they have lawful access, and would require creators to proactively opt out to stop their work from being used.It is outrageous that the technology companies argue that AI models being trained on books is no different from humans reading a copyrighted book. It’s not. It’s a different scale. The AI models are trained on more books than a human could read in a lifetime of reading. And, as theNew York Times lawsuitagainst OpenAI argues, it’s taking business away from publishers that is keeping them alive.Imagine a future where these large AI models ingest all of our digital knowledge. Not just books. All of science. All of our cultural knowledge. All of personal knowledge.This is Big Brother but not exactly as Orwell imagined. It is not a government, but a large tech company that will know more about us and the world than a human could possibly comprehend. Imagine also that these companies use all this information to manipulate what we do and what we buy in ways that we couldn’t begin to understand.Perhaps the most beautiful part of this digital heist is that all of this knowledge is being stolen in broad daylight.

The House of Lords defence committee has pointed out that decades of underinvestment have hollowed out our defences, and that our vulnerabilities, especially in air defences, couldput the UK in peril.The prime minister also promised that the government “will translate defence spending into British growth, British jobs, British skills and British innovation”. Our 70,000Unitemembers working in UK defence companies will certainly hold him to it.The first test of this “brave new world” will be how we replace our ageing RAF fighter jets. The RAF has 24 T1Eurofighter Typhoonsthat need to be replaced. The obvious thing to do is purchase two new squadrons of the upgraded T5 Typhoons. All the UK’s other partner nations in the Eurofighter Typhoon consortium – Germany, Italy and Spain – have recently made similar decisions.But it seems the UK is going in another direction, perhaps purchasing American-made F-35 jets. The Royal Navy already uses F-35s on its aircraft carriers. Unite is not proposing to change that. But replacing British RAF Typhoons with American F-35s would make a mockery of the prime minister’s promise on British jobs and British skills.View image in fullscreenA Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 (above) and an F-35B Lightning II aircraftComposite: NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock, MoD/Crown copyrightUnite research has determined that a UK order of 24 F-35s would only secure two or three months of work in the UK, for about 2,000 workers. An order for 24 Typhoons would secure more than 20,000 jobs for years for workers in BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Leonardo and the UK supply chain.The skills issue is, if anything, even more concerning. Right now, the UK can develop, deploy and control our own fighter jets. And we are part of a vital programme to continue that capacity into the future. The global combat air programme (GCAP) will allow the UK to produce the next generation of fast fighters, beyond Typhoons, known in the UK as Tempest, along with our partners Italy and Japan.As the House of Commons defence committeerecently warned: “Retention of the existing Typhoon manufacturing workforce … until full-scale production of Tempest is under way, must be a priority.” Tempest is planned to enter service in 2035. If we don’t get more Typhoons to assemble in the UK in the interim, it will be too late.The UK is one of the few countries in the world with the capacity, atBAE Systems in Warton, Lancashire, to do final assembly on the most modern fighter jets. At Rolls-Royce we also have the highly specialist capacity to manufacture and maintain what the Americans call afterburners for military jet engines. To retain these critical skills, and the vital military capability that follows from that, we desperately need a new order of Typhoons. If that doesn’t happen, these skills, these jobs and our national sovereignty over our air defences will be lost.The F-35 is not a better aircraft. The Typhoon has better range, better air defences and can carry both British and US-made weapons. RAF Typhoon fighter jets are much better suited to policing Nato’s borders to fight any future Russian threat than F-35s, which were designed as stealth fighters for much shorter missions.The world has changed – it’s time for a radical Labour rethink on the economy | Heather StewartRead moreWe have to also avoid becoming dangerously reliant on American technology. This is all the more important because of President Trump’s recent insistence that he favours some conciliation with Russia to end the Ukraine war, and that the UK and Europe are now on their own when it comes to defending their borders. The way the US president is behaving, he might just have a bad morning one day and decide to deny us access to the data that we would need to go into combat with F-35s. We could be locked out of our own defence system.So, vital decisions for defence beckon. The Labour government’s strategic defence review is due soon. It must include the renewal of the RAF fighter fleet by buying new Typhoons. The alternative would not only endanger thousands of jobs, it would compromise our national security and, after the PM’s announcement, would see this government snatching defeat from the jaws of victory – with a bad choice and another failed promise.Sharon Graham is general secretary of the union UniteExplore more on these topicsDefence policyOpinionUniteRoyal Air ForceMilitarycommentShareReuse this content"

Surely it would be easier if men just did more housework?Lucy ClarkDividing household tasks fairly and upending some gender norms along the way is good for everyoneThu 6 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 15.29 ESTShareMany moons ago, when I was much less cynical than I am now, I wrote a story for a newspaper about a marriage in which the man stayed home to look after the kids and household while the woman stayed in her higher-paying job.It was a financial decision that made obvious sense for this couple - they’d both had good jobs but had together decided her career was the more promising in the long term, so he stepped back because they wanted an at-home parent while the kids were little, and because they could afford it. It was deemed “newsworthy” in a soft kind of way, because in the 1990s it went well against the norm – it was a good illustration of what was possible when you start with a negligible gender pay gap, mutual disrespect for gender norms, and ego-free assessment of which career is best going to provide for the family unit.Australian men doing no more housework than they were 20 years ago – still 50% less than womenRead moreThe funny thing was that when I interviewed them both separately, the man told me he now did all the housework, and I believed him. I wanted to believe him – this was something to aspire to. Meanwhile, the woman said “…allthe housework? He said he doesallthe housework?”I’m just guessing, but it’s possible they had a big fight that night.Couples fight about housework. Couples fight about housework so much, it’s one of the main reasons cited for divorce. Couples fight about housework so much that it’s still incredible that men haven’t twigged to the fact that surely it would be so much easier to just do a bit more housework than it would be to go through a divorce.In the three decades since that story, what’s changed?Very little, it seems. The latest Hilda report shows that men are still doing50% less housework than women, even though they think they are doing their fair share. Hilariously, they reported great satisfaction with this arrangement.Women do not want to carry the mental load of what has to be done. Why would we? Why would anyone?You can see how it happens. Women who have children step back from careers for a while, not because they are biologically more suited to parenthood, but because they generally earn less, as evidenced by this week’sgender pay gap report- which is also called the motherhood pay gap because it only gets worse from this point. Women may be brought up to believe they are equal to men, but if they have children, they quickly find out they are not.They then have to do more unpaid, unvalued work and become resentful. This resentment, by the way, is real and understandable because it’s not fair to be automatically expected to do something on the basis of your gender, especially if you never agreed to it. It’s also not fair that at this rate it’s going to be almost another300 years before we achieve pay parity, but that’s another story (it’s the same never-ending story).Because women are forced into being in charge of the unpaid, unvalued and often invisible work, even after they have returned to work, they have to ask for help. Repeatedly. This is sometimes called nagging.Nagging, of course, is not gender specific, and is only a function of who has the greater responsibility and needs help.Womendo not want to be in charge of the laundry. Women do not want to be in charge of the mopping. Women do not want to be in charge of that thick layer of dust that gathers on top of the skirting boards. Women do not want to carry the mental load of what has to be done. Why would we? Why would anyone? No one expects men to actively want to be in charge of it either – most people do not like doing this stuff – but household things have to be done.So what are the solutions that might bring real household change, apart from the absolutely obvious?‘I felt like I was his carer’: why straight women in relationships lose interest in sexRead moreOne suggestion from a social scientist that has stuck with me – from one of the hundreds of articles, studies or books about this subject I have read over the years – was that couples could, instead of being at loggerheads with each other over their household tasks, be united against an unfair world.This requires an unshakeable bedrock of allyship as a starting point; an understanding that it is indeed an unfair world for women and that here, in our house, we can make it right and fair. Work out what needs to be done to keep the household running – factoring in paid, unpaid, unvalued and invisible work – and divide it fairly, hopefully upending some gender norms along the way. Traditional gender norms, by the way, aren’t good for men either.It beggars belief that these things still have to be said – it feels like feminism for dummies, and I think I have written a column like this a dozen times. I’m so tired of it. I thought things would be better for my daughter but at this rate, it won’t even be better for her great-great-granddaughter. My only consolation? The cleanest, tidiest person in my family is one of my sons.

It’s impossibleAdam RutherfordAt a time when US scientists are under attack from their own government, the illiteracy around these elephantine fantasies is dangerousThu 6 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 12.49 ESTShareYou will never ever see a living woolly mammoth. While this is an obvious truth to most geneticists, zoologists and mammoth experts, the endless promises that you might get tomeet an extant versionof this very-much extinct elephantid apparently necessitate me typing it.The latest on the conveyor belt of mammoth resurrection stories came this week in the form of a slightly hairy mouse.Colossal Biosciences, the US company behind the“woolly mouse” and ensuing media frenzy, published a non-peer-reviewed paper in which it has genetically engineered a mouse to express a gene that relates to mammoth hair, resulting in a mouse with slightly longer hair than normal.Mice are a crucial part of the story of genetics, not least because of their utility in the study of human genes, and particularly disease. But this unusually hirsute mouse was not created for any such noble purpose but rather as a farcical little sideshow for the fantasy that one day Colossal will breed a living mammoth.“The woolly mammoth is a vital defender of the earth,” it claims on its website, despite the fact that mammoths are extinct and therefore – I feel this shouldn’t really need saying – have literally no role in defending the Earth. Colossal states that packs of mammoths were a crucial part of tundra ecosystem management in their heyday tens of thousands of years ago – that much is true – and that bringing them back might be a useful tool in the fight against global warming. It is a ridiculous suggestion for tackling the climate crisis – and more than that, it is scientific folly.How is it folly? Let us count the ways. A few years ago, the firstmammoth genome was sequencedfrom remains acquired off eBay. You can get some today from as little as a tenner. The genome sequence allowed scientists to piece together some aspects of the lives and the biology of these magnificent beasts, as indeed we have for many animals – including humans – that are long dead. This is good science, gifting us insights into the adaptations that helped mammoths evolve to suit their environments. What the ancient genome of the sadly departed does not allow us to do is bring them back.DNA from dead creatures is profoundly degraded, chewed up by time and bacteria, and what we actually recover is fragments. Whenscientists unveiledthe “complete” genome of our Neanderthal ancestors in 2009, it was in fact sparse bits and pieces of the interesting parts, the genes, which we could usefully compare with our living DNA. But genes make up a tiny proportion of the total amount of DNA in a living creature, most of which is lost in time, like tears in rain. Much of that lost DNA has function in living cells and is species specific. This is not cloning as per thefamous Dolly, whose actual complete genome was taken from a living sheep. This is not photocopying – it’s trying to assemble a book with only a clutch of sentences.Colossal knows this and is proposing to modify the genes of an Asian elephant so they are more like mammoth genes. The proposed resulting creature would be a mixture of elephant and mammoth. These two elephantids parted ways on theirevolutionary treesroughly 6m years ago. That was at about the same time we separated from what ended up as chimpanzees. That’s how different they are; that’s the equivalent hybrid being proposed.Cast your moral distaste over that particular monster aside and just consider that we don’t know the gestation period for a mammoth. We don’t know how big a mammoth neonate would be. We don’t know if a mammoth could digest Asian elephant milk. We would be performing artificial insemination and experimental IVF on an elephant that I am guessing did not give informed consent for this procedure.Should Colossal manage to overcome all of these apparently insurmountable scientific barriers, it will have an Asian elephant mother giving birth to a different species into a social group with which it has no affiliation in an environment it has not evolved to be part of because it ceased to exist many millennia ago.And it will be utterly alone. The best possible outcome will be one single boutique animal that is profoundly confused. More likely it will die very quickly. At present the Pyrenean ibex is the only animalbrought back from extinction, via cells taken from the last known member of its wild goat species. Born to a surrogate in 2003, the kid immediately died, making it the only species to have gone extinct twice. The mammoth, should Colossal succeed, would surely be the second.Scientists aiming to bring back woolly mammoth create woolly miceRead moreThe absurd and frankly ghoulish claims about the mammoth’s resurrection amount to a textbook case of science miscommunication and hubris. At a time when US scientists areunder attackfrom their own government, the illiteracy around these elephantine fantasies is not just vexing but dangerous. The Trump administration’s threatened cuts span all scientific disciplines, but most pertinently to conservation and climate-crisis research. We are witnessing – and party to – the greatest biodiversity and species loss in human history. More than ever, science needs money, public support, and government backing. Perhaps focusing our efforts on preserving the millions of threatened creatures that actually exist should be the priority in these hostile times.The only way you will ever see a living mammoth is if our physicist friends finally crack time travel. I am a mere geneticist, but my understanding is that this remains very much in the realm of fiction. Perhaps in the meantime we could direct our scientific excitement and energies towards real problems, things on which millions of lives depend, rather than on this mammoth circus of macabre fantasy and moral bankruptcy.Dr Adam Rutherford is a lecturer in genetics at UCL and the author of How to Argue With a RacistThis article was amended on 6 March 2025.

Except complain to the rest of usRebecca ShawAfter years of this discussion my patience is wearing thinThu 6 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 18.01 ESTShareAcouple of years agoI wrote aboutthe nepo baby discourse that had kicked off, arguing that focusing all of our energy on the very rich and famous was a distraction, when we should be talking about class and opportunities among the rest of us ugly losers. I still stand by this position. However, I am now being forced to expend a bit of the energy I have saved up. After years of discussion around this, my patience is wearing thin. No matter how measured and logical I attempt to be about the issue, it turns out I am still vulnerable to getting really pissed off by it.Last week, Patrick Schwarzenegger turned out to be the straw (nepo baby) that broke the camel’s (my) back (made me so mad I’m writing this). Schwarzenegger is an actor who is currently starring in thenew season of The White Lotus, one of the most coveted jobs in TV. He plays the arrogant and awful son of a very wealthy man, and he’s good! If you don’t know Patrick’s work, you might know his father, Arnold Schwarzenegger, or his mother, Maria Shriver, due to the fact they are extremely famous and powerful, both politically and in Hollywood.Sure, moaning about ‘nepo babies’ is fun – but we're missing the bigger problem | Rebecca ShawRead moreInan interviewlast week, Schwarzenegger (the smaller) said:I know there are people who’ll say I only got this role because of who my dad is. They’re not seeing that I’ve had 10 years of acting classes, put on school plays every week, worked on my characters for hours on end or the hundreds of rejected auditions I’ve been on. Of course, it’s frustrating and you can get boxed in and you think at that moment, I wish I didn’t have my last name. But that’s a small moment.Aw, I’m playing the world’s muscliest violin. This is the crux of the thing that I can’t stand. Nobody is saying this genetically gifted man can’t act, or that he doesn’t work hard, or that he didn’t earn his way on to The White Lotus. He has been largely praised. This has only become a problem because he has the common Achilles heel of a privileged life – being defensive about it. It’s annoying. It’s being unable to look at your life and the surname you have, and recognise all the opportunities that your privilege afforded you, and the ways your career has been easier, even if you have worked hard. It’s not thinking about the ways you have beenableto get better, because you had the time and support and wealth to spend on it.Actors from different backgrounds don’t get to study theatre full-time while also doing acting lessons with Nancy Banks, one of the best (and I assume most expensive) in the country. They don’t get to walk on to Hollywood sets as a child and meet everyone in the industry.But this isn’t even about connections; it’s about the fact that living life as a normal person means dedicating a huge amount of your available energy to surviving, especially as an aspiring creative in this time of dying industries. Many very talented people have to give up, many chase their dreams forever without ever catching them, while a select few get to dedicate every bit of their energy to acting, because the issue of survival just isn’t on their radar. And that is perfectly fine and good; they should do what they want. Except complain about it to the rest of us, publicly.When Lily-Rose Depp (among others)says somethinglike:Maybe you get your foot in the door, but you still just have your foot in the door. There’s a lot of work that comes after that.OK! Everyone else works hard as well, they just don’t get their foot in the door automatically from birth – the hardest part. For the rest of us that door is hidden behind a series of similar looking doors in the world’s biggest door factory. Not recognising or conceding the truth of that? I can’t handle it. Not only are these some of the blessed in life who got this incredible leg up into the thing they love to do, not only were all the draining hard parts of life taken off their shoulders – they are defensive about it. They still can’t just admit they got help, they had advantages, and used them well. That’s literally all we want.In recent years, a few nepo babies have decided to be direct and honest, and it’s absurdly refreshing. Jack Quaid, one of the most nepo baby babies in existence, son of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid,said:People have called me a ‘nepo baby.’ I’m inclined to agree. I am an immensely privileged person, was able to get representation pretty early on, and that’s more than half the battle.Allison Williams, star of Girls and M3gan, whose dad (journalist and news anchor Brian Williams) isn’t even the same field as her,said:Meet the ‘nope baby’: the nepo baby who bites back, with teethRead moreTo not acknowledge that me getting started as an actress versus someone with zero connections isn’t the same – it’s ludicrous. It doesn’t take anything away from the work that I’ve done. It just means that it’s not as fun to root for me.That’s it! That is literally all it takes for us to move on and feel warmly about you forever. Having a semblance, or even some tiny crumb, of self-awareness.I understand it must be a bit annoying for Patrick Schwarzenegger to have a few people say he got into acting because of his dad. I’m sure if you are someone who works very hard and takes acting classes and has rejections and a few people still say your dad got you the work, that may feel dismissive. But on the other hand … who cares? You have been given every single advantage in life and you aresucceedingin what you want to do, and your ego is so fragile that you can’t even acknowledge the clear help you have had? It comes across as clueless and thin-skinned, insecure, selfish – and it’s deeply annoying.If the worst thing about your blessed situation is that you have to convince people you’re good at acting in your own right, you should stop complaining and do that. You’ve had enough lessons.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsCelebrityOpinionTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Decades on, I am horrified that an approach that wreaked havoc in the global south is still being pursued in the UK.Britain was of course the trailblazer forprivatising infrastructurein the Thatcher years, and subsequent UK governments went on to use public-private partnerships to fund new schools, hospitals, roads and prisons, with much of the capital being raised overseas. While many countries in the global south have been coerced into selling off their assets, successive UK governments have done so enthusiastically, watering down our regulations and lowering tax barriers – known as “de-risking” in today’s parlance – to attract foreign entities seeking to buy up British assets.And buy up they have. According to thelatest count by the Office for National Statistics, 38% of all turnover of non-financial businesses in Britain went through foreign owned companies. US businesses have been the primary beneficiaries of Britain’s mass sell-off of its assets, with the value of (known) holdings domiciled in the US rising from£242bn to £708bn in the decade to 2023(likely to be far greater if we knew how much they also have of the £630bn or so of further holdings being routed through low-tax regimes like Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK’s own crown dependencies).I don’t think even Thatcher would have imagined that a quarter of British GDP would today be made up of sales of US multinationals like Amazon, Coca-Cola, Goldman Sachs and Uber. What that means is that key decisions are being made elsewhere, intellectual property is often held overseas, profits are extracted and taxes not paid here.As the economist Angus Hanton argues, the UK hasbecome a vassal state, paying economic tribute to theAmerican owners of its assets. Indeed, some have speculated that Donald Trump may spare the UK in hisglobal trade tariff warbecause the UK has already removed most obstacles to US economic supremacy and wealth extraction.Having sold off our public assets, and hollowed out the state’s capacity to directly deliver services and infrastructure, we now rent our public services from the foreign entities that own our buses,water companies, energy networks, prisons,care homes, and provide us with the IT services needed to run the state. There is also a bitter irony that some of these foreign entities are actually state-owned enterprises.The chancellor’s recent endorsement ofairport expansionwill have been music to the ears of the Qatari, Saudi and Chinese governments, who own stakes in Heathrow airport, and the foreign private equity firms that stand toprofit from both HeathrowandGatwick’s growth. But these expansions are more likely to divert money away from high streets, the domestic tourism industry and foundational economies across the UK than they are to produce any “useful” sort of growth.This is especially true in countries where the state has dismantled the rules that protect the public from market failure and help businesses to do the right thing. The UK already has low levels of regulation by international standards. And yet, over the years, successive governments have weakened genuine public protections – from environmental safeguards, to food standards and workers’ rights – and eroded the capacity of UK regulators to enforce the rules. By asking regulators to prioritise economic growth over other important social and environmental priorities, the new UK government risks following the same dangerous path.What UK policymakers forget are lessons being learned the hard way by manydebt-laden countriesof the global south: that today’s “foreign investment” can lay the ground for tomorrow’s extraction and dependency. The optimism of investors seeking new opportunities in the global south in the early part of this century has turned to horror as money has moved to what are seen as safer markets amid the global economic turbulence of recent years – and rising interest rates have meant higher debt servicing costs.Indeed,projections by the ONE campaignshow the net flow of international finance into the global south has actually gone into reverse, with developing countries collectively paying back more to international lenders than they are receiving in new funding. This is what makes the announcements of cuts to the UK’s aid budget – an important resource for softening the impact of liberalisation on the poorest – all the more painful.Arguably the most dangerous aspect of the orthodox approach to economic development has been its wilful negligence ofdangerous levels of inequality. Not only did countries that pursued these economic policies become more unequal but there was also active collusion between political and economic elites to further rig the rules to their mutual benefit. In India, we’ve seenbusinessman Gautam Adani– briefly, in 2022, the world’s second wealthiest man – reaping extraordinary benefits from hisclose tieswith the prime minister, NarendraModi. Soon after the Indian government changed its rules to allow companies with no prior experience in the sector to tender for airports,Adani had six. Adani has been charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in connection witha $250m (£195m) bribery plot. The Adani Group has denied the specific allegations, and more generally said that it has not benefited from political patronage. Those who think the UK is immune to corruption need only look at how the VIP lane worked when governmentcontracts were issuedduring the pandemic response.The UK has seen income and wealth inequality soar in recent years, leaving us looking far more like the US than continental Europe. The consequence of this could not be starker. Earlier this year,a reportfrom King’s College London and the Fairness Foundation warned that growing wealth inequality in the UK could be a “major driver of societal collapse” within the next decade. And even those benefiting from rising inequality think it is dangerous, with more than half of rich peoplepolled by Patriotic Millionairesthinking that extreme wealth is a “threat to democracy”.The new UK government has shown some signs that it is learning the lessons of global worst practice, for example by promising to renationalise railways, create anational wealth fundthat can make strategic investments, and by raising capital gains taxes. But we need a coherent new strategy that doesn’t repeat the mistakes of the past and prevents us sleepwalking into economic disaster.

And peak happiness eludes the young: who knew?Zoe WilliamsGiven recent history and the state of the world now, perhaps the thing that makes older people happiest is not being under 45Thu 6 Mar 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 10.59 ESTShareSo there are two studies,one commissioned by Weetabix,one by the UN, but we don’t need to decide which one is likely to be the more reliable because, praise be, they both say the same thing: 45 is now the age of peak happiness. A massive 77% are more content with their lives after they hit 40, with two-thirds saying they no longer cared what other people thought, and 59% having attained self-actualisation – or, at least, they say they “now know what really matters in life”. Which is probably about as self-actualised as it gets. That data is all from the high-fibre breakfast treat funded study.The UN, meanwhile, has survey results from the UK, Ireland, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and kicks off cheerfully enough – happiness used to be conceived in a U-shape, when it was bliss to be alive in youth, miserable in middle age, and then picked up again as you got older. Now it’s more of a straight upward trajectory, although that can’t literally be true as it would make babies the saddest people on Earth. Fair play, they do cry a lot.The problem with the UN’s research is that it’s pretty clear about what’s driving this change, and – newsflash – it isn’t pilates.The economist David Blanchflower, co-author with the academic psychologistJean Twenge, is blunt: there’s a “crisis in wellbeing among the young”. They’ve become isolated, they don’t go out, they’re not carefree, they don’t have sex.Separate research has demonstrated, repeatedly, that there’s a mental health crisis in the under-35s, with more than 500,000 excluded from the workforce. The proportion of young people out of work owing to mental health problems has nearly doubled since 2012. It’s possible that people hit peak happiness at 45 just by dint of the tremendous good fortune of not being younger than 45.There are so many explanations for this that crumble as soon as you pick them up. Covid is often thought to have hit the young harder: it disrupted school and warped exam results; those at university paid the price for the best years of their lives without actually enjoying them; those just starting work missed out on the comradeship and knowledge-sharing of offices. Blanchflower contends that the trend started before 2020, however, and didn’t end when normal life resumed – so it must be something else, maybe social media use, cyberbullying, online body shaming.Trying to make sense of that, people in their 40s and 50soften fall back on the snowflake hypothesis. If these features of modern life – which the rest of us manage OK – have overwhelmed one generation, maybe they’re just not robust? Too hung up on identity politics, too easily offended, too ready to protest over offence they’ve taken, too keen to diagnose themselves with things, and then too strident in asking for allowances – just too fragile for the world. I’ve heard variations on this from people who work alongside gen Z and younger millennials for so long I started to take it on trust. I only ever spoke to those young ’uns on the phone, when they seemed like regular, resilient humans. But what did I know? I worked at home.Increasingly, though, these narratives seem more like elevator music – soothing, formless – than coherent melody; it’s just not plausible that digital natives would be so much more affected by online behaviour when they’re so much cannier about it. There are much more obvious explanations, which young people will freely volunteer: student debt, the immense barriers to well-paid work for those without a degree, the fact that even putatively high quality jobs are no longer secure, and the fact that wages have stagnated yet housing costs have done the opposite.Of course there are variations within the generation, but the overall picture is that life is simply much harder. Generational wealth transfer will bake in existing inequalities, and middle class millennials areset to gain most– but real distribution happens through inheritance, which is to say, not when you’re young. More likely, when you’re about 45.Young people face hard-scrabble living standards, a political discourse that says it’s your own fault for buying too many lattes, and a wellness culture that centres individual discipline. It seems the only way to keep yourself sane is to organise collectively. As soon as you do, though, you’re most likely to join the fight against the climate crisis, where you find yourself in the same position: the only generation without blinkers on.Is it really happiness, for the over-40s, if it’s powered by denial (also, according to Weetabix, hiking)? Or is denial what any generation would choose, if their material conditions allowed it? Either way, I suspect the range of and capacity for joy is the same across every age group; we’re the same people, dealing with different facts.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHappinessOpinionYoung peopleHealth & wellbeingMental healthWork & careersIncome inequalityHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

The constant checking of media sites. Cross-checking against multiple sources as to not get caught out – again.I am hardened to the onslaught.Disillusion was hanging in the air in days leading up to realising that we needed to respond. People were careful to not be alarmist, as to not add tension to tender hearts hoping for the best. But deep down we all know the true threat and we are desperately willing it to spare us this time. We have lived through the worst and we know that wishful thinking isn’t an imaginary force field to safety.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailJust two weeks ago the studio I share with four other female artists gathered in Lismore for a flood preparedness meeting. This building was completely submerged in the 2022 climate disaster. The sun has been shining on us all year, the first “proper summer” since the bushfires in 2019, so this meeting felt far from our flood plan needing to be implemented. As a result of more than half of us losing our homes in 2022, most of us now living out of town on roads that get cut off in big rains, our approach was to act early. Our hard-earned wisdom and new modular way of existing in the floodplain means that we are always one foot out the door, ready to pack up for higher ground.Mixed feelings bounced around town about those preparing early while the sun was still shining and the river hadn’t yet swelled. Some thought it premature – “Why would I pack up? The river doesn’t have any water in it yet” – while others were not prepared to take the risk of the Wilsons River’s unpredictable temperament. It is hard to know which thinking is rational when the collective PTSD still swells among us, residing just beneath the surface.Each disaster steals years and energy we will never get backLife in one of Australia’s most flood-prone cities has a very specific flavour. Perhaps we can we now call it disaster culture? The little nuances adapted in response to surviving in this environment. In the houses that have been re-built you will find light switches above the highest tide line, plaster board replaced with villaboard, hooks in ceilings to save precious items, stainless steel kitchens and the avoidance of anything made of chipboard. These small improvements now offer small solace in the face of having to do it all again.We are facing a new kind of threat: a cyclone. We don’t know cyclones. The combination of being attacked from the sky above and the rising waters beneath our feet is honestly terrifying.Almost 4,000 of our homes where deemed uninhabitable after the 2022 climate disaster. Of these, only 600 have been bought back by the government, with temporary fencing holding down their perimeters to unknown futures, soon to take wind and beat down what little is left of Lismore’s spirit.Cyclone Alfred live updates: Chalmers expects ‘billions of dollars of damage’ from Alfred; storm slows approachRead moreMore than 90,000 sand bags have been collected around the northern rivers. Cars swept by cyclonic swell in Currumbin, there were reports of winds breaking off one of the Big Prawn’s feelers in Ballina, fallen trees have caused blackouts in Byron Bay – and Alfred has not even hit land yet. We are watching dominoes fall on our screens while we still have internet to view it.Friends who have uprooted their devastated lives in Lismore to start afresh on higher ground, trading community for safety and landing in northern coastal areas, are now fleeing yet again. This time they’re heading south, below where the cyclone is predicted to hit. Back to making difficult decisions based on what is best for their families, abandoning renovations they are in debt for, having invested everything they had and more into a peaceful life that is potentially being ripped away from them once more.New place, different disaster.A friend phoned me this morning for advice. Her dad lives on the same street in South Lismore we moved from after 2022. She can’t get him to prepare, he is dissociated and instead asks where the evacuation centres are set up. He can’t muster the means to move his things up again. Disbelief wins.Another friend turned 30 when the preparation began and posted “thanks for the birthday love”, also pointing out that eight out of the 10 years of her 20s was spent in disaster recovery or preparation in some way.Each disaster makes a thriving future feel less and less realistic. Each disaster steals years and energy we will never get back.Somewhere in a parallel universe we’re having a great time.Kate Stroud runs a one-woman creative studio specialising in vision hunting and visual communicationsRead more of Guardian Australia’sTropical Cyclone Alfredcoverage:When and where is Cyclone Alfred likely to hit?Is climate change supercharging Cyclone Alfred?Which suburbs are at risk of flooding?How to prepare for a cycloneExplore more on these topicsTropical Cyclone AlfredOpinionAustralia weatherFloodingExtreme weathercommentShareReuse this content"

Pushing Tin (1999)Cate Blanchett played a pretty generic “wife” role in this interesting, somewhat forgotten US comedy about air traffic controllers from director Mike Newell, whose title is their slang for guiding planes. It was saddled with a terrible ending by its screenwriters, Glen and Les Charles (creators of TV’s Cheers), and blitzed at the box office by The Matrix. Its genesis is amusingly described by its producer, Art Linson, in his memoir What Just Happened? Blanchett plays the wife of hotshot young air traffic controller John Cusack, who has an affair with Angelina Jolie – who is married to Cusack’s workplace rival, Billy Bob Thornton.19. Robin Hood (2010)View image in fullscreenRobin Hood.Photograph: Universal/Everett/ShutterstockBlanchett brings out a sturdy, unshowy north country accent as Marian (nothing so quaint or sexually naive as “Maid” Marian) – a plausibly tough and capable love interest for Russell Crowe as Robin, whose own accent in this film notoriously ranged across the British Isles. She has long, glistening locks and a martial attitude – but, like the sheriff of Nottingham, her character is not allowed to upstage Russell’s Robin in any way. There’s not much for Blanchett to get her teeth into in Ridley Scott’s film, and it’s an example of how her distinctive, severely patrician beauty sometimes got her typecast in mannish or off-kilter roles.18. The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004)For Wes Anderson, Blanchett played a terribly grand British magazine writer – mischievously named Jane Winslett-Richardson – whose commission is to write an in-depth piece about star oceanographer Steve Zissou (played by Bill Murray) and his latest maritime adventure. Zissou of course develops a tendresse for her. Effectively, she plays the droll and exquisite unworldly thoroughbred role that Anderson was later to give to Tilda Swinton; perhaps Blanchett did not find the idea of being an Anderson repertory player congenial enough to continue – but she carries it off well here.View image in fullscreenCoffee and Cigarettes.Photograph: Photos 12/Alamy17. Coffee and Cigarettes (2003)One of the interesting portmanteau-type movies that Blanchett has made. Jim Jarmusch’s indulgent, doodling sketch of a film has big-name cameos in quirky one-on-one encounters with other big-name cameos. Easily the best is Blanchett meeting Blanchett: she plays herself meeting a cousin (played by herself) for coffee, and this relative is fascinated and envious of Cate’s alpha-celeb lifestyle. It’s a minor film in her repertoire, but a revealing glimpse of what it might well have been like for Blanchett having to deal diplomatically with people who can’t quite get over what a big deal she is.16. Rumours (2024)Blanchett can do funny – but is rarely allowed to do so. When she is, the results can be impressive and sometimes even sensational. (See Steve Zissou and Blue Jasmine.) Here, in Guy Maddin’s rarefied absurdist comedy of euro-political breakdown, she plays a German chancellor of Merkelesque seriousness and studied hostess-like charm. She presides over a G7 summit in Germany, dealing with some unspecified crisis, and has to shepherd everyone into signing up to a bland communique that will not commit them to any action (and, meanwhile, the world is coming to an end). Not quite humour with a light touch, but Blanchett gives it class.Cate Blanchett: ‘I think you can smell when something is cynical’Read more15. Notes on a Scandal (2006)Blanchett is rarely upstaged in any movie, though she had to resign herself to being outshone by Judi Dench on her best-ever big-screen form in this delicious psychological thriller. However, Blanchett handles the subordinate role with typical style. She is Sheba, a new art teacher at a state school with liberal-patrician attitudes, who wafts entrancingly about the place and doesn’t need a teacher’s salary. All her colleagues love her, except the pursed-lipped Barbara (Dench), whose reaction is more parasitically envious fascination that evolves into a delusion of friendship. Blanchett’s Sheba must submit to sexual blackmail and finally disgrace, but rises above her ordeal in a way that the more culpable Barbara cannot.14. Lord of the Rings series (2001-2003)Blanchett played Galadriel, queen of the elves, in all three movies of Peter Jackson’s mighty Lord of the Rings trilogy, and it is her voiceover at the beginning that tells us about the mythology of the ring. She is ethereal, blond, queenly and otherworldly, with pointy ears – an interesting caricature of the exotically blue-blooded and at times almost extraterrestrial classiness that Blanchett brings to the movies. She also has a very intense emotional relationship with Ian McKellen’s grey-bearded icon Gandalf.View image in fullscreenThe New Boy.Photograph: New Boy Productions13. The New Boy (2023)It was always on the cards that Blanchett would have to play a cantankerous and scary nun at least once in her career, and she gets it under her belt here, in Warwick Thornton’s weirdly mystical drama set in an orphanage in the 1940s Australian outback. She gives it the full wimple as a fiercely authoritarian nun, Sister Eileen, who runs her remote institution with a rod of iron and has covered up the death of a senior male cleric, faking his signature so she has full control – and then has a crisis with the arrival of an Indigenous youth she calls “New Boy”. A huge performance from Blanchett, perhaps overpowering the film itself.12. Thor: Ragnarok (2017)This Marvel movie from Taika Waititi is a winning comedy in which Blanchett shows she gets the joke as well as anyone else. In days of old, she might have guested on The Morecambe & Wise show, like Glenda Jackson. Here she plays Hela, the goddess of death, tricked out with evil antlers and black garb, like a mirror-image version of Tolkien’s Galadriel. Hela is the sister of Tom Hiddleston’s Loki and she is absolutely hilarious, playing it straight but with a twinkle in the eye: it makes you long for Blanchett to appear in panto.11. Little Fish (2005)A valuable, complex and difficult film in the Blanchett canon, which deserves to be better known. She plays against type as a loser in the game of life: Tracy Heart, a former heroin addict living in a blue-collar Sydney suburb, always teetering on the brink of using again. Heart is desperately trying for a respectable life but keeps getting dragged down by her stepfather (Hugo Weaving), who is still an addict, and her ex (Dustin Nguyen), who is now a dealer. Blanchett is tough, forthright and in command of the screen, perhaps unconsciously elevating her character.10. The Talented Mr Ripley (1999)One of Blanchett’s most alluring early roles: the super-rich, dizzily naive, young Meredith Logue, taking a trip from the US to Europe on a first-class liner and bumping into the plausible low-born conman Ripley (Matt Damon), who road-tests his impersonation of the wealthy Dickie on her before he has to do it for real. Meredith breezily waves away the absurd trappings of inherited wealth – claiming to be “only comfortable around people who have money and despise it”. An unusually absurd figure for Blanchett to play, the epitome of the vain and insecure rich whose delusions make Ripley’s crimes possible.9. The Man Who Cried (2000)Another rich and tasty early role for Blanchett, who showed movie audiences what an extraordinarily seductive and expressive face she had in closeup. Always pushing at the boundaries of theatricality and self-parody, Blanchett plays Lola, a Russian dancer in interwar Paris; she befriends the young immigrant Suzie (Christina Ricci) while pursuing a Sally Bowles lifestyle, yearning for a rich protector of her own. It’s a role she puts over with terrific brio and wit.8. Elizabeth (1998)Playing Queen Elizabeth I in her early years, this was the film that made Blanchett an above-the-title star and set the blue-chip, blue-blood style of her screen career ever since: the queen of the screen but with the heart and stomach of a king. It’s a tough, cerebrally complex account of court intrigue (and the film is far superior to the 2007 follow-up, Elizabeth: The Golden Age), which tracks Elizabeth’s ascent from vulnerable princess and insecure young monarch to iconic Virgin Queen.View image in fullscreenManifesto.Photograph: PR7. Manifesto (2015)One of Blanchett’s most audacious and radical screen adventures – and something to show that Tilda Swinton isn’t Hollywood’s only experimentalist and patron muse. Working with artist and film-maker Julian Rosefeldt, Blanchett creates a movie-installation crossover piece – and another of her portmanteau films. She appears as a number of different personae, all mesmerically and slightly scarily addressing the camera, declaiming philosophical manifestos by the likes of Karl Marx, Guy Debord and Tristan Tzara, and haranguing the audience to wake up to the possibilities of art. An exhilarating multi-performance.6. The Aviator (2004)An Oscar for best supporting actress was Blanchett’s reward for one of her funniest and most attractive performances – as Katharine Hepburn in Martin Scorsese’s The Aviator, with whom the gauche multimillionare Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) falls in love. It took some nerve to impersonate Hepburn, but Blanchett succeeds, in the process absorbing some of her prestige: delivering the drawling Bryn Mawr vowels, the Yankee boho patrician elegance and the frank sexuality.5. I’m Not There (2007)View image in fullscreenI’m Not There.Photograph: Jonathan Wenk/Weinstein Company/AllstarTodd Haynes’s multiple-personality gallery of Bob Dylans was an intriguing buffet of interpretations by actors like Richard Gere, Ben Whishaw and Marcus Carl Franklin. But everyone was blown out of the water by the extraordinarily funny and convincing impersonation by Blanchett: a stylised, theatrical but still beautifully observed rendition with frizzy hair and dark glasses – Blanchett is playing the Dylan that did the “Judas” tour of England. It was a reimagining of the musician that Blanchett conceived with sympathy and wit, a turn with the vigour of pure comedy but the force of high drama.4. Nightmare Alley (2021)This freaky noir melodrama from Guillermo del Toro gave us Blanchett in full Veronica Lake mode: she is wonderful as the shady lady with secrets, sophistication and dark sexual power. She plays Lilith Ritter, a fashionable psychoanalyst in 1930s America, with a curtain of peroxide hair, a vivid slash of lipstick, a palatial art deco consulting room and a super-rich client list. Ritter is intrigued to come into contact with Bradley Cooper’s cheesy nightclub mind-reader Stan, sensing perhaps that he is in the same business as she is, and also feeling attracted to him. It’s another classically theatrical bravura performance.View image in fullscreenCarol.Photograph: AJ Pics/Alamy3. Carol (2015)This was the movie that showed us Blanchett’s ability to inhabit a character who is grand, haughty, but aware of her own vulnerability – a weakness for beauty – and also self-dramatisingly aware that this is a flaw with something tragically magnificent in it. In this adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith novel, she is the unhappy divorcing woman, Carol, who is struck by a coup de foudre on meeting Therese (Rooney Mara), a gamine and beautiful young store assistant, and falls in love with her at that moment. Later, they will have an exploratory lunch in which every moment is erotically charged with promise and in which Blanchett’s Carol is thrillingly dominant.2. Blue Jasmine (2013)Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine is a tragicomedy of a woman’s social descent, whose resemblance to Tennessee Williams’s A Streetcar Named Desire the director always denied. Blanchett plays Jasmine, a former Manhattan socialite and Park Avenue princess who, divorced and broke, has come to stay with her resentful sister in her modest apartment. She dreams of finding a way back into the broad sunlit uplands of wealth and social standing, from which she feels she has been unfairly exiled. Jasmine talks, talks, talks, believing herself capable of charming her way back in, building magic bridges to prosperity in the air – but she is actually gabbling, monologuing, and becoming embittered and crazy. This won Blanchett a best actress Oscar.1. Tár (2022)Here is the most extravagantly haughty and magnificently mad of all Blanchett’s creations on screen: the orchestra conductor Lydia Tár at a Berlin orchestra, a former protege of Leonard Bernstein. Her rock-star prestige and queenly conceit mean that she cannot acknowledge the midlife crisis or crackup that is heading her way, preferring to see it as an imminent epiphany or breakthrough. She is using the mentorship programme for young musicians as a way of pursuing affairs: she is arrogant and cruel – humiliating a bumptious student for presuming to criticise Bach on political grounds, and then terrorising a tiny child outside her daughter’s primary school. The role of Tár brings out the strangely mannish side to Blanchett’s sensuality, her intelligence and breeding, but with a black-comic self-awareness. There could be something Wagnerian in Tár’s lordly deployment of power, although it is Elgar’s Cello Concerto that unlocks her derangement, finally culminating in an unthinkable scene on the conductor’s podium. With the baton in her hand, arms flung out, she is crucified by her own passion and dedication.Black Bag is released on 14 March. The Seagull is at theBarbican, London, from 26 February to 5 April.Explore more on these topicsRankedCate BlanchettfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You can imagine a collective sigh of relief chez Gaga: she has been experiencing what you might call a case of career sea sickness, in which unadulterated commercial triumphs have been followed by very public flops. In the credit column, there’s Die With a Smile, a power-ballad duet with Bruno Mars that went to No 1 in 28 countries and spent 10 weeks as the world’s biggest-selling single. (Released last August, it also appears on Mayhem.) In the debit, there was her starring role inthe disastrous Joker: Folie à Deux, a film that was estimated to have lost Warner Brothers something in the region of $150m (£116m), and which seemed to take both the Gaga-heavy soundtrack and her own, jazz-based“companion album” Harlequindown with it. You might have expected the legions of Little Monsters (as her fans are known) to rally around the latter, but apparently not. Outside of a couple of remix collections, it was the lowest-selling Lady Gaga album to date and her second jazz album to noticeably underperform: a follow-up collection of duets with the late Tony Bennett, 2021’s Love for Sale, failed to replicate the success of its predecessor, Cheek to Cheek.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

The fact that you never quite know what she’s going to throw out next – electronic dance-pop, soft rock, jazz, country, AOR – should be cause for celebration, but perhaps it has proved a bit much in a world dominated by streaming’s overload, where artists are advised to maintain a clear brand lest they get lost amid the sheer torrent of new music. Maybe what was needed was a bold restatement of Gaga’s original core values. That was precisely what Abracadabra, and indeedits predecessor, Disease, provided: big dirty synths; big noisy choruses; high-camp, fashion-forward videos and, in the case of Abracadabra, a hook apparently designed to remind listeners of the word-mangling intro to 2009’s Bad Romance.All this turns out to be a fair advertisement for the rest of Mayhem, which does a lot of things that anyone who fell hard for Gaga’s debut album, The Fame, might reasonably want her to do. Fizzy electronics battle for space with piano and guitar hooks. Virtually everything seems to have been constructed with one eye on the dancefloor: there are nods to Daft Punk, disco and 80s boogie and house. There are songs gleefully hymning the pleasures of the fleeting clubland hook-up as balm for the soul (Garden of Eden). And there are songs ruminating equivocally on the nature of fame: “Sit in the front row, watch the princess die,” she sings on Perfect Celebrity, both a decent pun and analogous to her “performance art piece enacting the death of celebrity” at the 2009 MTV awards, during which she sang Paparazzi while appearing to bleed out from a gash on her stomach.Lady Gaga: Abracadabra – videoLady Gaga: Disease review – a return to form, and to her classic soundRead moreIt’s consistently well-written, teeming with hooks and liberally sprinkled with intriguing musical left-turns. The Prince-esque electro-funk of Killah suddenly erupts into a double-time beat that’s equal parts clipped new-wave rock and techstep drum’n’bass; the Chic-style disco of Zombieboy is unexpectedly disrupted by a widdly-woo hair metal guitar solo. Equally, it is smart enough to marshal its star’s diversity. LoveDrug indulges Gaga’s love of AOR, but a four-to-the-floor rhythm means it doesn’t jar with its surroundings. Her penchant for old-fashioned power ballads is manifested in Blade of Grass, but the song is smartly tacked on to the end of an otherwise dance-focused album, alongside the similarly minded Die With a Smile. The only obvious misstep is How Bad Do U Want Me?, which starts out great – a homage to early 80s synth-pop, specifically Yazoo – but devolves into a song over which the melodic influence of Taylor Swift hangs a little too obviously.In truth, How Bad Do U Want Me? isn’t a bad song, but there’s something a little craven about it. Moreover, Lady Gaga doesn’t really need to chase current pop trends: Mayhem may be a reversion to core values – to the Lady Gaga of 2008 – but the striking thing is that it doesn’t feel particularly retro. Instead, it seems curiously of the moment: bothChappell Roan’s drag-queen aesthetic and outsider appeal andCharli xcx’s avant-trash place them in Gaga’s lineage.Mayhem can’t replicate the jolt that accompanied Lady Gaga’s arrival, blood-spattered live performances and all, but it doesn’t need to. It’s a reversion to first principles that reminds you how prescient its author was in the first place: she sounds like someone returning to claim a place in a pop world that has come round to her way of thinking.Explore more on these topicsLady GagaAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

We meet workers who feel ‘disposable’ – and the groups pushing for changeRachael HealyThu 6 Mar 2025 10.57 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Mar 2025 11.15 ESTShare‘Every time I think about starting a new job,” says Lucy, a documentary maker, “I feel triggered. Because every job I’ve done in the last five years, bar maybe two, I’ve had some kind of absolutely horrendous experience. I nowexpectto be put in danger at work.”Lucy (not her real name) is by no means an isolated case. According to new research into “the human toll and economic impact of injury”, nearly 80% of cast and crew members working in stage or screen productions have been injured at some point in their careers. The survey, conducted by the Injury Prevention Consultancy and shared with the Guardian, found that almost half of stage and three-fifths of screen performers have been placed in unsafe situations. Among crew, nearly three-quarters said that adhering to a show’s creative vision had compromised their safety, while only a quarter felt their wellbeing was regarded as a priority.I got an email from the executive producer saying: ‘I want you all to adopt a Dunkirk spirit’Stories make the headlines when the worst happens: take the tragic death ofcinematographer Halyna Hutchins, accidentally shot on the set of Alec Baldwin movie Rust in New Mexico in 2021; andcameraman Mark Milsome, who died after being hit by a Land Rover when a stunt went wrong during the shooting of Black Earth Rising in Ghana in 2017. Likewise, when the injured person is sufficiently famous, as in Ian McKellenfalling off a London stagewhile performing Player Kings last year (the star said his fat suit “saved” him). What the research suggests, however, is that many more people are suffering unseen, with almost a fifth saying they were left permanently damaged by an injury.View image in fullscreenLong hours … a film crew on location after dark.Photograph: Justine Evans/AlamyWhat the report also highlights is a lack of preventive measures, worsened by a culture of fear, with workers scared to speak up when they feel in danger. Some told the Guardian that a lack of regard for safety, coupled with a lack of support should an injury happen, made them feel “disposable”. With financial pressures squeezing both industries, they said conditions are becoming even more hazardous. Lucy says that, in many ways, she had a lucky escape while shooting a high-risk documentary overseas: although she feared for her life, she survived. But it has caused lasting trauma. She was left alone, waist-deep in water, during a lightning storm. “If I had slipped,” she says, “I would’ve been washed away. They would never have found me.”The production, she adds, was poorly funded and she had been abandoned by the person tasked with helping her film. “It left me with this choice: either I stand in moving floodwater in pitch-black darkness filming – or I don’t get any shots and get fired. I felt I had to put myself in unbelievable danger.” Lucy’s case is a shocking clash between two categories of danger: the life-threatening and the career-threatening.Tome Levi, the woman behind the Injury Prevention Consultancy, used to work as a professional dancer and conditioning coach. “I was witnessing a lot of injury,” she says, “seeing friends and colleagues go through things I deemed avoidable.” This made it all the worse when Levi saw the repercussions injuries had, both psychological and financial: productions halted, earnings lost, everyone stressed.Eight years ago, inspired by the rise of intimacy coordinators, Levi created a new role: injury prevention consultant. She will observe a show, then figure out a plan to prevent injuries, which could include a simple change to choreography that does little to alter the impact of a show.Crews often do heavily physical work, on their feet for long periods, wrestling heavy equipment about. But it’s not just heft and power that can lead to injuries. In theatre, a performer might do the same material eight times a week, for months on end, while in TV and film, actors might do 10 or more takes. “I’ve heard shocking stuff,” says Levi. “Repetitive strain injuries that become so acute people have to leave their jobs. Even if the initial event wasn’t avoidable, the exacerbation of it was.”View image in fullscreen‘The precariousness of work makes people less inclined to rock the boat’ … dancers’ toes.Photograph: Hans Neleman/Getty ImagesJennifer Caldwell, a performer who has starred in various hit shows including Six the Musical, spent years early in her career dancing on a painful foot, often rehearsing eight hours a day in heels. There’s pressure to “push through it”, she says, even holdingback tears of pain on stage at times. After nearly four years of the pain following her through different jobs, an MRI scan found a broken bone in her foot.She says there’s a stigma to talking about injuries: “I end up downplaying everything, to not appear weak or unable to do the job. Which is ridiculous, because it’s an injury I’ve sustained by going into work and worsening it.”Working on Six, things were different:Levi was there as a consultant, suggesting costume and movement adjustments so that all the repetition was more sustainable. “Having a third party there felt amazing,” she says.Ricardo Castro also broke a bone, in his case while dancing on stage. It left him unable to land new roles for four months. “There’s this mindset of, ‘the show must go on.’ But sometimes we can’t carry on – and that has to be OK.” The show involved high-energy moves, but he believes there weren’t enough understudies, standbys or swings: “It meant there was pressure to not get injured.” He raised concerns abouthis footwear but says: “I didn’t feel like I was heard.”Castro said the “family” ethos of theatre felt suddenly absent after his injury. His union Equity stepped in and he was able to claim money to weather the months he was unable to perform. The experience has made him more likely to speak up, he says, even if it can mean you’re viewed as ungrateful.View image in fullscreenHeavily physical work … a film set.Photograph: Striking Images/Studio Shots/AlamyNick (not his real name) was a camera operator on a long-running reality show for a major broadcaster. Feeling unsafe filming on uneven terrain, he asked for a spotter, but didn’t get one. He lost his footing and fell on his back. “You get up and get the shot, because that’s all they care about. You fight through the pain.”This tallies with the survey, which found that a third of workers felt similar pressure to work through an injury. The culture, says Levi, leads workers “to associate taking a break with letting colleagues down”.Nick continued working, however, carrying a heavy camera. The pain worsened, affecting his performance and he was dropped from that job and struggled in his next. He feels he’s been blacklisted by the company.The survey found that two-thirds of people feared raising concerns for exactly those reasons. “You don’t want to cause trouble for a production company,” Caldwell says. At one point, she had to take 12 weeks off and she hasn’t been hired, or seen, for anything by that company since.The Film and TV Charity has called for an independent body to report such concerns to. Many hope CIISA, the newly formed Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority, will take on this role. Levi hopes independent organisations such as hers can offer similar support.View image in fullscreenFear of saying no … a film crew at work on a bridge.Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesMany employees said they felt companies acted to protect themselves rather than their workers. “The immediate response,” says Cathy Sweet, Equity’s head of film and TV, “is, ‘It wasn’t our fault.’ They need to put the artist’s wellbeing first, then look at ongoing support. There should be no cost spared, but it feels like there is.”Workers are legally entitled to 11 hours off between finishing one day of work and starting the next. But they’re often asked to forgo that – in a practice called “broken turnaround”. Creative industries union Bectu is calling for action after its own research found that only 4% of crew members hadnotbeen asked to break turnaround across their last three jobs. Almost everyone said breaking turnaround affected their ability to work safely. They described accidents, falling asleep at the wheel, mental health issues.“Smaller budgets, last-minute script changes, poor scheduling and inexperienced producers can and do exacerbate this issue,” says head of Bectu Philippa Childs. “It is often the crew that are most significantly impacted.” Stage workers are affected too, though, she adds: “The UK’s theatre industry is also plagued by long hours, near misses and challenging environments.”Lucy faced “endless pressure” to work 18-hour days. Requests for additional staff or time were ignored. On other jobs, she’s worked 90 hours a week. Many workers are unaware they can object to broken turnaround, says Sweet, or fear saying no when asked.View image in fullscreenAwkward lifting … documentary fim-makers.Photograph: Leblond Catherine/AlamyTV production manager Rachel Wood recalls many jobs where this was an issue, including one particular shoot much earlier in her career. “Even before going out on location, we were leaving the office between 11pm and 3am,” she says. “I got an email from the exec producer saying, ‘I want you all to adopt a Dunkirk spirit.’ This line will stick with me until I die.”And then out on location, she found herself working 15 to 17 hours a day. “Three weeks in, I slipped over in the shower from exhaustion,” she says. “I hit the back of my knee. It was like an electric shock going through my body. I was screaming in pain.” She was summoned to a meeting. “They go, ‘You’re obviously not able to handle it, so we’ll have to let you go.’ I never heard from them again.”The response of companies and colleagues to injuries left many feeling undervalued. Wood says: “The first thing isn’t, ‘How are they?’ It’s, ‘Who can you get to replace them?’” Nick agrees: “There is no support. You’re so disposable – because so many people want your job.”Levi hopes theatre and TV companies will realise that safeguarding their staff has a positive effect for them, too. Injuries can mean costly staff replacements, insurance claims, delays, even cancellation. “The precariousness of work, especially now, makes people less inclined to rock the boat. That puts the onus even more on industry leadership to make sure that boat is steady.”Measures suggested by Bectu include giving health and safety advisers the power to enforce change, and providing training for all staff. “The industry,” says Childs, “must focus on ensuring that staff and freelancers have the appropriate qualifications and training. The industry needs to take this issue much more seriously.”See the full Impact of Injury reporthereExplore more on these topicsCultureTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You’ll be engrossed for three hoursJack SealeThu 6 Mar 2025 17.00 ESTShareWhat function does a television series have when the disgrace it covers is already in the public domain? The “spy cops” scandal has been the subject of extensive reporting,spearheaded by the Guardian. There is no need to demand a public inquiry, either:one is under way.Yet ITV’s three-part The UndercoverPoliceScandal: Love and Lies Exposed – produced with the Guardian and featuring its journalists Rob Evans and Paul Lewis – more than earns its place. Aside from television simply hitting a wider audience, the way it unfolds narratives using personal testimony has a power a written summary may not achieve. And, as the series uses the tricks, and some of the cliches, of the true-crime documentary to keep viewers happily engrossed for three hours, it gives us the time we need to sit with the story and absorb its importance. Because this injustice asks huge questions about Britain.Over several decades, peaking in the 1990s and 2000s, undercover police officers infiltrated local campaign groups using false identities. You might argue this is an outrage in itself, but the scheme went much further. More than 60 women are now known to have had sexual liaisons, often developing into long-term relationships, with men they thought were political allies. Some even had children with the impostors.Women who fell victim to these conmen – virtually all the undercover officers were male, targeting female activists – appear on camera to tell their stories, although most are disguised with wigs and makeup or their names are changed. Lisa spent five happy years with her boyfriend before a glimpse of his passport suggested he was not who he said he was. When the partner of “Alison” suddenly left her, she remembered finding a debit card with an unfamiliar surname. Helen – which is her real name, because she is the activistHelen Steel, of McLibel fame– was similarly abandoned by the love of her life and wondered if the gaps in his family history might offer an explanation.It is a tale with all the twists, coincidences and courage that the intrigue-hungry viewer would want, told using tested true-crime tradecraft. Genre thrills kick in as the women remember apparently idyllic courtships, followed by creeping doubts, then their transformations into dogged amateur detectives. By the time one of them involves the Guardian and a snowball starts rolling, they have each independently busted the cover of a different professional spy. Then the scandal goes national.The real value of this series, though, is in seeing the faces of the victims and hearing their anguish, which brings new clarity to the depth of the harm done. In photographs and home movies, and in memories of the times their partners accompanied them to siblings’ weddings and parents’ death beds, we are privy to those moments, all irreplaceable, all now tainted.It’s not just the cruelty and professional misogyny that linger. That the women’s experiences were eerily alike underlines that this was an elaborate and expensive state-sanctioned operation. That raises the question of what would drive our government to such extremes. We learn part of the answer when we are told that “Alison” was in a community group that supported the families of Black people killed in contact with the police – and that, as the home secretary, Theresa May was forced tocommission an inquiryin 2014 when it emerged that the Stephen Lawrence justice campaign had beeninfiltrated and undermined.Many of the women were engaged in nothing more subversive than small-scale anti-fascist or environmental campaigns, yet were seen as nuts to be cracked with a sledgehammer. One valid response to this level of official chicanery is hopeless, reclusive terror; another is to be encouraged by how paranoid the spy cops scandal shows those in power to have been. In her interview, Steel reminds us that every significant right and privilege citizens enjoy today was won through protests that began at grassroots level.“Alison”, recalling the day she deduced that her boyfriend was a cop, says: “I felt like I had uncovered something you weren’t supposed to uncover.” Shocking and disgusting as the facts of the case are, this documentary is part of a preciously rare moment when we can lift that lid a little higher.The Undercover Police Scandal: Love and Lies Exposed airs on ITV1 and is available on ITVXExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewPoliceDocumentaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

From Michael Jackson to David Bowie, why are some stars uncancellable?Read moreSix years on, as MJ the Musical premieres in Australia, audience members might also ponder the ethics of buying a ticket to a show that is not only sanctioned by Jackson’s estate, but a source of revenue for it. Two production companies that were owned by the singer at the time of his death and are now owned by his estate are contesting allegations of child sexual abuse by the late artist as part of a civil suit, set to go to trial next year – and the attorney working for the alleged victims has described the musical as “propaganda” that “adds injury to his survivors”.View image in fullscreenMJ the Musical at the Prince Edward Theatre, London in 2024. The show is set in 1992 during rehearsals for Jackson’s Dangerous tour.Photograph: Johan PerssonMJ, which opens in Sydney this weekend, seems to believe youcanseparate the music from the man – or at least, from his baggage.When theGuardian reviewed MJ on Broadway, we described the musical, which is made in cooperation with the late singer’s estate and co-produced by its co-executors, as “a rollicking parade of hits, vocal high points, and a sanitised spin through Jackson’s life that sketches demons without filling them in”, and an exercise in “compartmentalization”.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningSet in 1992 during rehearsals for Jackson’s Dangerous tour, MJ sidesteps the lurid tabloid controversies – including allegations that he abused his pet chimpanzee Bubbles, speculation about his changing appearance and plastic surgery, and his death from a cocktail of prescription drugs in 2009. It also ignores multiple allegations of child molestation made against the star over three decades, including the claims at the centre of a forthcoming civil trial.‘Secrets will eat you up’ – inside the shocking Michael Jackson documentaryRead moreThe omissions can be justified by the plot’s narrow timeframe: MJ is set before the first claims of child molestation were aired in 1993, and doesn’t reference the settlement Jackson made in 1994 with the boy and family at the centre of those allegations. Nor does it mention Jackson’s arrest in 2003 on charges of child molestation.Jackson was acquitted in a 2005 trial and Jackson’s estate has vehemently denied all allegations of sexual abuse made against the star since his death. However some have found the show’s failure to even acknowledge this significant part of the star’s story discomforting, particularly in the wake ofLeaving Neverland, in which Wade Robson and James Safechuck aired fresh allegations that Jackson sexually abused them when they were children. (A sequel to Leaving Neverland will be releasedlater this month.)View image in fullscreenWade Robson (L) and James Safechuck (R), pictured in 2019. The two men have accused Jackson of sexually abusing them when they were children, which Jackson’s estate has denied.Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian“Can we really sit in a theatre and pretend his music can live on without scrutiny?” askedGuardian reviewer Anya Ryanwhen MJ went to the West End. “Some might be able to separate Jackson’s art from the artist. But as [performer Myles Frost] took his final bow and the audience leaped to their feet, I felt queasy – bad, even.”The Michael Jackson estate did not reply to the Guardian’s request for comment, nor did Michael Cassel Group, who are bringing the show to Australia. Butin an 2019 interview with the New York Times, conducted while the show was still a work in progress, the musical’s book writer, Lynn Nottage, and director and choreographer, Christopher Wheeldon, discussed the complications of making MJ the Musical after the documentary had aired.“You can’t watch the documentary without being profoundly disturbed by it, but again, we’re not judge and jury,” Wheeldon said. “[Our role is to] paint a balanced picture. Yes, lean into the complexities, lean into the darkness, but also recognise the great amount of music and film and choreography that Michael left behind.”“We’re not journalists,” Nottage added. “Have I had restless, sleepless nights? Absolutely, and I probably will continue until the day we open.”View image in fullscreenRoman Banks (centre), in the lead role of Michael Jackson for MJ the Musical at Sydney’s Lyric Theatre.Photograph: Bianca De Marchi/AAPThe show did open, and following its premiere on Broadway in 2022, Wheeldon told the Washington Post that after grappling with the ethical considerations, the pair “felt we needed to look at this as making a piece of entertainment first and foremost”. The estate did not dictate the show’s content, he said. “We ended up telling the story we wanted to tell. We were not told what we had to do.”Robson and Safechuck’s allegations are the subject of a joint suit against MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures – owned by his estate – that is due to go to trial in November 2026. Robson alleged that Jackson abused him from age seven to 14. Safechuck alleged that Jackson abused him over the course of four years, starting in 1988 when he was 10. Both men allege that company employees did not adequately protect them from Jackson, helping to coordinate visits and ensuring Jackson could be alone with them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But their attorney John C Carpenter, who says he has seen the show, accused it of being “propaganda” engineered to make money. “It’s entertainment, not the truth,” he told Guardian Australia. “They skirt the entire issue [the allegations of child molestation] and try to makeMichael Jacksonlook like a saint.”People attending the musical have the option to separate the man from the accusations ... victim-survivors don’t have that optionAlison GealeLawyers for Jackson’s companies and his estate maintain Jackson was innocent and have previously alleged he was targeted for his name and money.“We remain fully confident that Michael is innocent of these allegations, which are contrary to all credible evidence and independent corroboration,” a lawyer for Jackson’s estate said in a statement, after a 2023 decision from the appeal’s court which allowed the men’s claims to progress.The estate receives “grand rights” (AKA dramatic performance rights) revenue from MJ the Musical; it likely gets a producer’s cut too, as estate co-executors are two of the show’s three major producers. As of May 2023, they hadrecouped their initial investmentin the show.The Jackson estate “is free to try to make money off of the intellectual property made by Michael Jackson during his lifetime”, Carpenter said. “But doing it at the expense of misrepresenting and discounting the truth that he abused and hurt other people adds injury to his survivors … You can imagine how difficult it might be for other people to celebrate your abuser. That’s hurtful.”View image in fullscreenMichael Jackson’s estate receives dramatic performance rights revenue from MJ the MusicalPhotograph: Johan PerssonAlison Geale, CEO of Bravehearts, an Australian organisation representing adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse, worries about the message that MJ sends. “It’s a Tony award-winning musical that’s had record-breaking ticket sales. And for victim-survivors, not just of Michael Jackson, but those others looking on, it’s as if it [the alleged sexual abuse] didn’t happen,” she says.“When victim-survivors come forward, there are many roadblocks to disclosure, and one of them is, ‘Am I going to be believed?’ And if you can imagine that on a scale where it involves Michael Jackson. Whether Michael Jackson is guilty or innocent in the public’s eye, that is a worldwide question everyone has an answer for – so they [Robson and Safechuck] are in the middle of also not being believed by so many.”MJ the Musical review – sterilised moonwalk through the King of Pop’s lifeRead moreIn Leaving Neverland, Robson describes his first encounter with Jackson, seeing Thriller on VHS when he was five years old: “Everything changed for me. The music, I couldn’t help but move to it, it kind of set me on fire … I slowly but surely started plastering my walls with images of Michael … [I was] going to sleep, waking up in Michael Jackson land.”Geale, from Bravehearts, urges Australians weighing up whether to buy a ticket to consider the victim-survivor perspective. “[The music] is part of the man and part of the machine that, from a victim-survivor’s perspective, allegedly enabled grooming and offending,” she says. “People attending the musical have the option to separate the man from the accusations. And victim-survivors don’t have that option. The man and the music and the crime are all linked for them.”MJ offers a whirlwind tour of “Michael Jackson land”: the music, the moves, the almost mythic artist.

The price-tag on that victory, as well as all the marketing and press tours costs for the film, was $20m (£15.5m).They brought in the final bill for Baker’s movie slightly under that, at $18m – a figure that is nonetheless three times its budget. Neon’s strategy for the film, explained CEO Tom Quinn to Variety, was to lean in to the film’s Gen Z and homemade appeal, rather than to traditional critics and tastemakers.For example, aone-day only popup shopfor Anora merchandise appeared in November in the parking lot of King’s of Body, an auto repair yard on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. Queues of 300 fans began at 10am for a 3pm opening for the car-boot style retailer, which sold a range of clothing and posters also available at Neon’sonline store.View image in fullscreenAnora’s Fuckin’ Cinderella T-shirt.Photograph: NeonThese include red branded “little wifey” thongs, a snip at $15, plus T-shirts with various slogans from the film, including “Stay jealous, babe!”, “You hit the lotto, bitch!” and “Fuckin’ Cinderella” ($35).Two limited-edition prints are also available, which feature 70s style artwork showing star Mikey Madison in alluring poses. “This isn’t allowed … but I like you,” runs one tagline; “She’ll take care of everything you need,” the other. The first Hollywood screening of film was filled by publicists with sex workers, rather than Oscar voters.The campaign’s eventual success is evidence of the cut-through of such a strategy, as well as the evolving makeup of the Academy’s demographic. Its chief rivals at theOscars– The Brutalist, Conclave and A Complete Unknown – were all perceived to have fans that were older, white and male, a hegemony the Academy has sought to correct in recent years.Baker’s film was made for $6m – the lowest on the best picture shortlist. Also acclaimed for its tight costs was The Brutalist, which was brought in for $10m, and whose additional marketing spend is likely to rival that of Anora’s.Both films have taken just over $40m, with Anora’s streaming deals with Apple and Amazon suggesting its real profits may be yet higher. The film is topping charts on those streaming services, and a cinema rerelease is scheduled.A24, the rival indie distributor behind The Brutalist, brought out a more modest range of merchandise for their film, including two T-shirts and a small-scale model of the community centre (based on a concentration camp) designed by the architect character as its heart. Thelimited edition of 500 zinc modelscost $75 and are already sold out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Levi’s is selling a suede jacket inspired by the film for $1,200, while vintage-style 501 jeans are $495. A Triumph motorbike like that ridden by Chalamet’s Bob Dylan retails for $12,895.Meanwhile New York cocktail bar Dante partnered with Bob Dylan’s whiskey brand Heaven’s Door Tennessee Whiskey and Searchlight Pictures to offer an exclusive cocktail called Like a Rolling Stone. “We wanted to create a drink that reflects Dylan’s raw, authentic style and his ability to blend genres, just as he blended folk, rock and blues in his music,” said Dante’s beverage training director Renato Tonelli.Tonelli adds: “A combination of bourbon and palo cortado sherry offers a rich, soulful base, while crème de mûre blackberry liqueur brings a touch of complexity and depth, echoing Dylan’s poetic lyrics. Toasted oat syrup and walnut bitters add a nutty, earthy warmth, reminiscent of the grit and resilience that defines Dylan’s journey through life and music.”Conclave, about wrangling cardinals electing a new pope, cost $20m with marketing costs likely to gently exceed that.

After all, it is about a king who loses his throne thanks to loving a male courtier. The other nobles, disturbed by Edward’s devotion to Piers Gaveston, close rank. From that point on, Gaveston’s days are numbered, as are those of the king.But it is more complicated than that. Daniel Raggett’s urgent, brooding production highlights the dilemma from the start. The old king is dead and lying in state. The audience are invited to process around the coffin, with its extravagant silver crucifix caught in the beams of Tim Lutkin’s austere lighting. The live score by Tommy Reilly is reverent and sombre.The mood only darkens as the nobles gather around the coffin, all gold braid and military medals. This is the establishment at its most regimented.Such discipline makes the first sight of Gaveston all the more arresting. Appearing high above the mourners amid a dazzling string of lights and a blast of techno, he holds forth in an all-male bath house, flirting with his bare-torsoed companions. Played by Eloka Ivo, he symbolises freedom, disruption and disorder. He is the dangerous opposite of courtly formality.View image in fullscreenFreedom, disruption and disorder … Eloka Ivo, standing, in Edward II.Photograph: Helen MurrayIt is this, rather than his sexuality in itself, that provokes consternation. As far as the nobles are concerned, the king can snog whom he likes. They would prefer it to be Isabella, his queen, played haughtily by Ruta Gedmintas, a mirror to Gaveston in stature and attire, but that is not really the issue. What bothers them is a breach of protocol. Anything that pulls the monarch’s attention away from matters of state is a threat they must respond to. Raggett presents them as reasonable diplomats not reactionary zealots.‘We were booed. I felt proud’: Daniel Evans on his rollercoaster journey to RSC supremoRead moreThis is something Edward never grasps. Leading from the front, the RSC’s co-artistic director, Daniel Evans, plays the king with impetuousness, a sore loser irritated not to get his own way but lacking the wit to do much about it. He is too besotted with Gaveston to understand anyone else’s point of view.In truth, he is out of his depth with both parties. Gaveston has a wild sexual energy at odds with Edward’s buttoned-up decorum, while the nobles have political power he is incapable of mastering. His flaw is bad governance. “Commend me to my son and bid him rule better than I,” he says in a rare moment of self-awareness.His downfall exposes the illusory nature of authority. Only if everyone agrees to believe can a leader remain in control. When faith dissipates, so too does power. By the end, when we find Edward stumbling into the wastewater of Leslie Travers’s unforgiving set, this king literally has no clothes. Meanwhile his son assumes power despite being still a boy.Only in the grisly manner of Edward’s death, involving a red-hot poker shoved inside him, do we see homophobia cruelly at play. What hits home most forcefully in Raggett’s production, performed without interval for added intensity, is a clash of values, the orthodox reacting against the untamed, the forces of order punishing the violators.At theSwan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 5 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Shakespeare CompanyChristopher MarlowereviewsShareReuse this content"

He will succeedLynette Linton, who is leaving after six years in charge of the venue which is known for nurturing new playwrights.Lawson, whose first season of work will be presented early next year, will also act as co-CEO in partnership with Mimi Findlay. He said he was honoured to be taking over “at a time when the need for enduring original narratives is so important”. Praising the work of Linton and associate artistic director Daniel Bailey, who has also stepped down, Lawson said he would build on their achievements and “programme bold pieces that speak to our hearts and stimulate our minds, that both comfort and challenge us”.The Bush, whose previous artistic directors include Josie Rourke and Madani Younis, has gone from strength to strength under Linton and Bailey, who co-directed Lenny Henry in his playwriting debutAugust in Englandin 2023. The Bush’s 2022 production of Waleed Akhtar’s playThe P Wordwon an Olivier award and another of its hits,Red Pitchby Tyrell Williams, transferred to @sohoplace last year. The West End transfer of Benedict Lombe’sShifters, which sold out at the Bush, is up for best new play and best actress (for Heather Agyepong) atnext month’s Oliviers.Lawson acknowledged the “legacy of exceptional leadership that has brought the Bush to where it is today”. Currently a Genesis fellow and associate director at the Young Vic, he was previously an associate director of the Kiln theatre in London and has held resident director roles at Sheffield Theatres, the Almeida and on the West End run of the musical Hamilton. His credits as a director includeAn Unfinished Manat the Yard theatre andNW Trilogyat the Kiln, where next year he will direct a Black British retelling of Chekhov’sThe Seagull, co-written with Dipo Baruwa-Etti.Uzma Hasan, chair of theBush theatreboard, said: “Taio is a leader in a new generation of theatre-makers. His vision, passion and commitment to artists and audiences is deeply inspiring. He shares the Bush’s mission to prioritise new writing, artistic innovation, sustainability and deeper engagement with our community.” Findlay said Lawson’s work “has consistently challenged and uplifted the discourse of what theatre and new writing can be”.The Bushfirst opened above a pub in 1972. It has two performance spaces at its current site, a former library which underwent a £4.3m renovation and is close to Shepherd’s Bush Market.Explore more on these topicsTheatreBush theatreLondonLynette LintonnewsShareReuse this content"

One thing I got mad at a lot of artists for is that they would make a genre or sound, and then they wouldn’t do it no more, they went super pop and sold their souls to the devil. I think that you need to keep doing whatever you are doing.”The French duo Daft Punk mentioned DJ Funk in their track Teachers, from theirdebut album Homework, in which they list all the producers who had influenced their sound. The French connection continued when Justice asked DJ Funk to remixLet There Be Lightin 2013.Speaking tothe Guardian in 2015, DJ Funk discussed how he’d like to be commemorated. “I really don’t want a funeral,” he said. “I’d like to have a party so people remember all the good times and aren’t sad. Then at the afterparty there’ll be a lot of booty shaking with all my music played.”Explore more on these topicsChicagoHouse musicnewsShareReuse this content"

It also earned Miranda a MacArthur Foundation “genius” grant.The show played the Kennedy Center in 2018 during Trump’s first administration and again in 2022 when Joe Biden was president. It was scheduled again from 3 March to 26 April next year. Those plans are now off. Tickets had yet to go on sale.“We are not acting against his administration, but against the partisan policies of the Kennedy Center as a result of his recent takeover,” said Seller. “These actions bring a new spirit of partisanship to the national treasure that is the Kennedy Center.”The Kennedy Center has been in upheaval since Trump forced out the center’s leadership and took over as chair of the board of trustees. His decision to do so is part of his broad campaign against “woke” culture.Actor Issa Rae, singer-musician Rhiannon Giddens, author Louise Penny and the rock band Low Cut Connie also have canceled scheduled Kennedy Center events. Singer-songwriter Victoria Clark went ahead with her 15 February show, but on stage wore a T-shirt reading “ANTI TRUMP AF”.This is not the first time Hamilton has taken a political stance. In 2016, the cast delivered a curtain call appeal to Mike Pence, then the vice-president-elect, who was in the Broadway audience, asking that theTrump administration“uphold our American values” and “work on behalf of all of us”.The Kennedy Center, supported by government money and private donations, attracts millions of visitors each year to a complex that features a concert hall, an opera house and a theater, along with a lecture hall, meeting spaces and a “millennium stage” that has been the site for free shows.Explore more on these topicsHamiltonBroadwayTheatreTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

I have some sympathy with the typist faced with such unfamiliar matter; though evidently she wasn’t paying much attention.”He mocked her confusion of “poche for poetic, highballs(!) for high halls, and arias for cries”.The letter is within a collection of largely unpublished correspondence that reflects Tolkien’s loathing of sloppiness and love of language.It is part of an archive that includes the last major Tolkien manuscript in private hands, The Road Goes Ever On, his collaboration with the composer Donald Swann of the musical comedy duo Flanders and Swann.The collection, which offers insights into the creative process of one of the most influential literary figures of all time, is being sold by Jonkers Rare Books, antiquarian specialists in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.The bookseller’s founder, Christiaan Jonkers, said: “It is unquestionably the most important archive of Tolkien material to be offered for sale in more than a generation.”View image in fullscreenA collection of largely unpublished by JRR Tolkien correspondence is being sold.Photograph: Donald SwannManuscripts and working drafts for some of his most celebrated books, including The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, were bought by Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1956. Its then director of libraries, William B Ready, recognised The Lord of the Rings as a masterpiece and approached Tolkien when no other institution was interested, buying the entire collection for just £1,500.Tolkien’s fantasy masterpieces went on to sell more than 150m copies worldwide, inspiring screen adaptations such as Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings, one of cinema’s most successful film series.The rest of his manuscripts were donated posthumously by his estate to the Bodleian Library in Oxford.Jonkers acquired this last archive from the family of Swann, who died in 1994. Its £550,000 price reflects its rarity.He said: “It was because this work was a collaboration that all this material lay with the Swann family and slipped the net.”The Road Goes Ever On is a song cycle that draws on verses from The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, set to music by Swann. The archive features 21 letters, as well as songs and poems and 13 pages of notes.They reflect an extensive discussion between the two men over how the songs might be sung, because they had not been translated until then, Jonkers said: “When they appeared in Lord of the Rings, they were simply in Elvish. The idea was that the reader enjoyed language that they couldn’t in any way understand, just as a sort of phonetic exercise in itself … Swann had chosen two poems in Elvish and it quickly became apparent that these would need Tolkien’s assistance with pronunciation and metre, both to aid the composer and any performer. In their correspondence, Tolkien offered instruction for performance and also context for the language.”Tolkien’s letters to Swann reflect their mutual admiration and friendship, which lasted from their introduction in 1965 to shortly before Tolkien’s death in 1973. Tolkien was flattered that Swann wanted to set his songs to music, performing them in 1966 with the baritone William Elvin.Jonkers said the letters showed the evolution of a genuine friendship, “which runs contrary to the portrayal of Tolkien at this time as somewhat wary of newcomers and an often irascible and closed personality.“Tolkien gives the impression of being uncharacteristically starstruck by Swann’s show business reputation, but also seems to have quickly decided that Swann is a man of intelligence and discernment.”In one letter, Tolkien wrote of enjoying a Flanders and Swann performance: “I have not laughed so much … since I last saw an archbishop of Canterbury slip on a banana-skin.”Jonkers Rare Books will offer the collection at the New York International Antiquarian book fair in April.This article was amended on 6 March 2025 because an earlier version said Donald Swann died in 1984, rather than 1994.Explore more on these topicsJRR TolkiennewsShareReuse this content"

Profit before tax more than doubled to £521m, up from £193m a year earlier.The company refused to comment on reports that it could consider a deal to merge or sell offITVStudios. Carolyn McCall, ITV’s chief executive, said the board regularly reviewed options for the company’s future, and added that “every board everywhere has to keep all options open”, but said she would not comment on “speculation”.ITV has been seeking to make itself less reliant on the volatile earnings from its UK broadcast TV channels, with investors expecting linear television to wither as the shift to online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ progresses.Growth in ITV Studios has been key to that aim, outstripping revenues from advertising through traditional TV channels andITV X, its own online streaming app. The production arm makes shows for ITV and for competitors, and it has benefited from thedemand for big-budget dramason top of commissions such as Line of Duty for the BBC – although 2024 sales were hit bywriters’ strikes in the US a year earlier.McCall said the focus on studios was “really paying off as a strategy”, and noted other efforts to diversify revenues including creating videos for Alphabet’s YouTube, a discount shopping app, and online games that earn revenues from younger audiences who do not otherwise tend to watch ITV programmes.However, McCall hasstruggled to persuade investors, despite ITV Studios’ growth and a cost-cutting plan that found £60m in permanent savings in 2024. The company said it would save £30m more this year, without job cuts, including millions saved from licensing fees after ending standard definition broadcasting.ITV’s share price is down more than 12% since July, despite rallying by 6% to 73.8p in early trading on Thursday after its results were released, and nearly half from the £1.30 levels reached during the coronavirus pandemic.That share price decline came despite the potential bid interest late last year. Interested parties reportedly included the private equity company CVC Capital Partners, the French broadcaster TF1, RedBird IMI, which recently acquired the Traitors maker, All3Media, for £1.2bn, and the production group Mediawan, which bought a controlling stake in Brad Pitt’s Plan B Entertainment two years ago.McCall said UK media companies were being undervalued relative to American rivals. She called on the UK government toremove stamp duty on share transactionsand to “encourage pension funds in a more determined way to keep some of that money in the UK”. TheLabour government is considering changesto try to increase UK investment from pension funds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His family ask that you respect their privacy at this time, a celebration of Roy’s life will be forthcoming.”Ayers was born in Los Angeles on 10 September 1940. His mother, Ruby, was a schoolteacher and local piano instructor while his father, Roy Sr, worked as a parking attendant and a trombonist. Ayers began learning the piano from an early age, and went on to be taught bythe jazz musician Bobby Hutchersonwho lived nearby. He studied advanced music theory at Los Angeles city college before releasing his debut album, West Coast Vibes, in 1963, which led to a string of solo records.He then formed his band Roy Ayers Ubiquity and developed his signature jazz-funk sound that featured him on vibraphone, an instrument he was inspired to learn after meeting the jazz musician Lionel Hampton, who gave him a pair of mallets when he was five years old.After the release of his debut album in 1963, Ayers’ output was prolific. By the time Everybody Loves the Sunshine was released, Ayers had already put out more than a dozen albums, earning himself the title of Godfather of Neo Soul. In the early part of his career, Ayers collaborated with Herbie Mann, with the pair working together for four years and playing at Newport jazz festival.When asked about his genre-hopping approach to music, Ayers said: “I don’t think I’m really so unique. What we call ‘soul’ has been around a long time. It comes out of a particular culture that is African in origin, but influenced by 250 years of slavery, as well as other forms of racial oppression.”Ayers had several hits in the UK. Get on Up, Get on Down; Heat of the Beat, and Don’t Stop the Feeling all reached the top 50, and in 1973 Ayers composed the score for theBlaxploitation film Coffy. The film starredPam Grier,who would go on to become amainstay of the genre, but Ayers’ soundtrack was critically acclaimed in its own right, and featured vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater and Harry Whitaker on piano.How we made Roy Ayers’ Everybody Loves the SunshineRead moreIn 1976 he released his most famous track, Everybody Loves the Sunshine, a mellow song about lazy summer days. In 2017, Ayers toldthe Guardian about the processbehind the hit.View image in fullscreenAyers was inspired to learn the vibraphone from the age of five.Photograph: Leon Morris/RedfernsHe recorded it at Electric Lady studios in New York on a hot summer day. “I just got this phrase in my head,” he said. “‘Everybody loves the sunshine.’ I started singing: ‘Feel what I feel, when I feel what I feel, what I’m feeling.’ Then I started thinking about summer imagery … It was so spontaneous. It felt wonderful.”The song became one of the most sampled jazz records ever. Mary J Blige’s My Life, Common’s Book of Life and Mos Def’s Life Is Real all feature elements of the track, and its popularity ensured Ayers was a regular feature at festivals around the world, including London’s Maiden Voyage, whichhe headlined in 2019.“The song changed everything for me,” Ayers said. “It’s still the last song of my show. People always join in and it’s been sampled over 100 times, by everyone from Dr Dre to Pharrell Williams. It seems to capture every generation. Everybody loves the sunshine – except Dracula.”Explore more on these topicsMusicJazznewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, a group of creatives in the same artistic hub are racked with fear about their future.Dozens of artists working in V22 Ashwin Street, a studio that has long been a space for developing talent, have been told to vacate the building by the end of the month.Hackneycouncil, which owns the site, says this is because it is unsafe for those inside.The building is situated down a bendy side road, behind McDonald’s on Dalston’s high street. The unremarkable approach expands into a bright mashup of bold, artistic buildings. Among them is Cafe Oto, which sits near the soon-to-be shuttered studios.The coffee shop and performance venue, which is the beating heart of the local creative community, was namechecked on the Dolby Stage in Hollywood after the composerDaniel Blumberg won the Academy Award for best score.Those who could be forced to leave Ashwin Street say the success of Blumberg, who was a regular face in the area, as well as his affectionate words for the cafe, show the value of keeping creative spaces open.“That Oscar mention really exemplifies how much of a creative community there is here,” said the artist Leon Scott-Engel. “One of the UK’s largest industries is the creative industry and we are celebrated for what we output. But a lot of people forget that to create something you need space to make it.”View image in fullscreenPainter Leon Scott-Engel says hiring studio space in Hackney costs almost as much as renting a flat.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe 25-year-old painter attested to the financial challenges faced by young artists. “You’re renting a studio that costs almost the same amount as a flat. When you’re newly emerging and juggling part-time work it’s a struggle,” he added. “We’re all struggling with trying to relocate somewhere that’s affordable.”Scott-Engel is a fairly new arrival to the building, but painter Ansel Krut, 65, is a veteran, having worked in the studios for 15 years. For him, the reality of being forced out of Dalston is sad, but not surprising.“The situation with artists is: we find affordable workspace, and then at some point, the area becomes more sought-after and we get kicked out,” he said.Krut has lived in Hackney for 35 years. “When I moved into this little corner of Dalston, the area was kind of desolate and a little derelict,” he said. “Over the years, it’s become what Hackney likes to call Dalston’s cultural quarter.”He believes that artists contribute to the local economy in ways that raw numbers fail to track.View image in fullscreenArtist Ansel Krut has lived in Hackney for 35 years and worked in Ashwin Street for 15.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian“A lot of the artists in the studios are associated with things like teaching in the area, having their work exhibited locally and supporting local shops.

Nearby Ridley Road market has been at the heart of campaigns to keep it out of developers’ hands.Kei Yoshino, 40, has already found herself at a loss due to rampant redevelopment in the area. Shortly before Covid, she was evicted from her studios above Ridley Road market.“I’ve been working on this career for 10 to 15 years, but I might have to consider ending it,” said the set designer and prop stylist for luxury brands. The nature of her work means she cannot follow in the footsteps of others who have relocated to creative enclaves on the south coast, such as Margate and Hastings.View image in fullscreenSet designer and prop stylist Kei Yoshino relies on easy access to locations and suppliers in central London.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian“We have a very early call-time, usually at about 7am,” she said. “I have to come to my studio before that to collect my stuff to bring it to the shoots, which are usually in centralLondon. Moving outside of London is not a workable option, neither is moving away from this area. I have all my suppliers in the area.”Hackney council said the Ashwin Street building could not be sustained without significant investment and must be vacated because of significant health and safety risks. It added that it had been working with V22’s studio manager to find alternative space for the artists.V22 says it has consistently obtained all necessary safety certificates, to ensure a safe working environment in Ashwin Street. It said that it was “devastated” by the decision to evict the artists by the April 2025 deadline imposed by the council.Explore more on these topicsLondonGentrificationHackneyOscarsEnglandArts fundingOscars 2024newsShareReuse this content"

It pairs the two serenades for wind octet – pairs of oboes, clarinets, bassoon and horns – that Mozart composed in 1781 and 1782 for the newly formed wind band court of Emperor Joseph II, with one of his supreme instrumental masterpieces, the Gran Partita for 13 wind instruments.View image in fullscreenMozart: Complete Works With Clarinet Vo 1: Nicolas BaldeyrouThe first two works make a sharply contrasted pair, with K388, in C minor, a far more ambitious work (which Mozart later adapted as a string quintet) than the E flat, K375. But both are outstripped in scale and achievement by the Gran Partita, which contains an almost operatic range of expression within its seven movements. The performances of all three works by Baldeyrou’s ensemble are bright toned and crisply characterised; there’s a nice reedy edge to the oboes and bassoons, and an agility to Baldeyrou’s clarinet that makes light of the technical difficulties of playing this music on 18th-century instruments. Some performances of the Gran Partita might find more pathos in its great Adagio third movement than this one does, but there’s much not else to complain about here.Listen on Apple musicAllow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on unknown.

Into this vacuum has rushed a new generation of spy stories on streaming television: action-intelligence office procedurals such as Black Doves, The Day of the Jackal, Slow Horses and indeed The Agency, starringMichael Fassbender, remade from the French show Le Bureau Des Légendes. These are secret agent dramas that give us the violence and the tech, juxtaposing suspected treason and infidelity in the traditional way, but with a new kind of workaday realist sexiness, and more elaborately about showing up for work: much emphasis on ID badges of various security-clearance levels that beep on card readers and can be worn round your neck on lanyards.Steven Soderbergh’s downbeat, affectless tongue-in-cheek spy comedy (“caper” isn’t quite right) is in this new mode, though taking itself to the edge of self-satire, with a few 007 refugees in the cast, efficiently scripted by David Koepp. It is very much part of Soderbergh’s auteur business model: another new movie shot with limber energy on digital – Soderbergh is as much an evangelist for digital as others are for celluloid – whose budget is perhaps largely taken up by fees for the stars whose prestige gets this into cinemas.Fassbender andCate Blanchettplay George and Kathryn, a married couple who work together in the Secret Intelligence Service: there’s a very New Spy moment when George, for inscrutable reasons of his own, smuggles his own ID card into his wife’s bag over breakfast and then has to wear a temp card on a lanyard. Also: their overall boss, played by Pierce Brosnan, is nettled at the sight of George outside the office where he’s having an important meeting and with a remote, switches the glass pane to opaque frosting. George is tasked with discovering who has leaked to the Russians an important security device which is so old-fashioned and McGuffiny it has to be transported around in the analogue real world. So he and Kathryn host a dinner party for the suspects, who are to be covertly fed a truth drug in the chana masala which results in a bizarre outpouring of suspicious craziness from one and all: Clarissa (Marisa Abela), Zoe (Naomie Harris), James (Regé-Jean Page) and the dishevelled Freddie (Tom Burke) – this last being the spy drama’s traditional blokily down-to-earth “other ranks” figure familiar from Roy Bland in Tinker Tailor or indeed Jackson Lamb in Slow Horses, a show whose novelty resided in part in making this persona the lead. But what if Kathryn, to whom George is so uxuriously devoted, is the rat?So the action of Black Bag bops along with wry self-awareness from the office, to the various sleek city locations in which people take life-or-death calls on their mobiles, to George and Kathryn’s gorgeous London townhouse (is there family money there?) to their little country place where George drives around in a cap and a Land Rover and goes fishing. Fassbender, in his habitual slot-mouthed way, delivers lines of dialogue which are allusive, indirect, with the manner of drollery, but sometimes not as droll and revealing as they should have been. Insofar as this slightly absurdist display can be taken seriously, its importance resides in George and Kathryn’s married love. If you can believe in that, or anyway find it an entertaining contrivance, then there is entertainment in Black Bag, whose title is slang for the place where secrets are kept, and where married people find the truth about their spouse is hidden.Black Bag is in Australian cinemas from 13 March and UK and US cinemas from 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsSteven SoderberghMichael FassbenderCate BlanchettThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

German conductor Thomas Guggeis’s rather neat solution here was to stitch them together into a relatively seamless whole. It certainly worked well in the second half of this Wagner and Strauss program, the London Philharmonic segueing effortlessly from Tannhäuser into Lohengrin and on to Die Meistersingers von Nürnberg.Guggeis, whose Wagnerian credentials are impeccable, was an urgent presence, his eloquent body language and balletic arms conveying his every musical wish. If it was a little distracting at times, the results spoke for themselves. In the Tannhäuser Overture, the burnished brass of the Pilgrims hymn contrasted with skittish violins and woodwind in the Venusberg music. Sensual strings were coaxed to an orgiastic climax replete with crashing cymbals and clacking castanets before Guggeis crouched low to tease out a balmy post-coital epilogue.The subsequent Prelude to Act I of Lohengrin featured radiant violins and a sonorous brass chorale. The Meistersingers Overture was crisp and confident, with an ardent sweep to the love music. It was a pity the brass smothered the violin figurations towards the end, taking the top off of an otherwise fine account.The first half was less fluid. Of course, the Prelude and Liebestod from Tristan und Isolde comes pre-stitched, as it were, a 17-minute musical odyssey that tops and tails four hours of opera to create a surprisingly effective tone poem. Opening with an impeccable pianissimo, Guggeis crafted the music’s twin peaks with persuasive attention to dynamic detail.While Strauss’s Four Last Songs don’t exactly mirror Tristan, they share common themes of transcendence and memory.Renée Flemingis an experienced hand, having first recorded them in 1996. The voice retains much of its creaminess, even if the acrobatics in the opening Frühling (Spring) seem more of a stretch these days. She was at her finest spinning the long lyrical lines of Beim Schlafengehen (Going to Sleep) and in the resigned musings of Im Abendrot (At Sunset), where her communicative gifts reached out to touch the soul.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicLondon Philharmonic OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a fitting backdrop for a tour showcasing the British artist’s 2023 Grammy-nominated album,I Inside the Old Year Dying, which ventures deep into the woodlands and folklore of Dorset, where she grew up.Harvey is as ethereal as the setting itself, gliding on to the stage in a flowing white dress patterned with tree trunks. She lingers in the darkness, waiting for the applause to fade before stepping into a solitary beam of light. Then she opens with the reverential Prayer at the Gate. “Look behind, look before … life knocking at death’s door,” she sings in pure, piercing vocals. Like an incantation, it’s mesmerising and almost theatrical, albeit not quite thePJ Harveyaudiences are used to.PJ Harvey: I Inside the Old Year Dying review – a disquieting escape into the wilds of DorsetRead moreTuesday’s performance is a striking departure from the artist who last toured Australia in 2017, a year after releasingThe Hope Six Demolition Project– a raw, politically charged album that exposed the stark realities of war, poverty and displacement. The album’s writing took her to Kosovo, Afghanistan and the United States, and in its aftermath she admitted she had considered stepping away from music altogether.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningSix years later, her eighth studio album takes a deeply introspective turn, transforming herpoetry collection Orlaminto 12 enigmatic tracks that blur the lines between folklore, memory and dream. Written partially in the Dorset dialect, it follows a year in the life of the fictional Ira-Abel, a nine-year-old girl navigating childhood, desire, death and transformation in a mystical version of rural England.Tonight, Harvey and her band bring I Inside the Old Year Dying to life with an immersive, almost cinematic quality, alongside a deep dive through her epic back catalogue. The show is littered with echoes of Harvey’s childhood in Dorset, from birdsong to warped school bells, while nature-inspired visuals bloom across the screen behind them.In Autumn Term – performed with longtime collaborator John Parish – the stage glows with imagery of cracked crimson earth as Harvey twirls and writhes across it. It’s part ballet, part fever dream. Then comes Lwonesome Tonight, a peculiar yet sonically rich track, layered with harmonies and subtle synth undertones. Woven with Elvis references, it draws from Orlam’s Wyman-Elvis, a Christ-like character embodying love and desire – a fitting tribute from Harvey, who adored Elvis as a child.The energy shifts as she picks up an acoustic guitar for the album’s title track. Thumping, urgent, it offers a glimpse of Harvey the rock goddess. She stands firm, commanding. Over the years, she has played guitar, saxophone, autoharp and piano and, tonight, she moves between instruments effortlessly.As the set moves into her back catalogue, The Colour of the Earth takes centre stage. A song from 2011’s Let England Shake, it explores the battle at Gallipoli in the first world war. The band steps forward, playing without Harvey, evoking a solemn marching band.When she re-emerges, she’s in a sleek white dress, launching into the electrifying 50ft Queenie, followed by Man-Size and Black Hearted Love. Now, she’s all swagger and sass, prowling the stage like a 90s grunge frontwoman.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s breathtaking.She closes with a raucous, smoke-drenched To Bring You My Love, the stage bathed in pink and purple light. Then, finally, she addresses the audience. “It’s been a long time since I’ve been here,” she says warmly. “Thank you so much for coming.”After five minutes of roaring applause, the band returns for an encore. They begin with C’mon Billy, a tender track about a woman’s plea for her lover to return. Then Harvey closes with White Chalk, a homage to the cliffs of Dorset – the place whose imagination has loomed large through all of tonight’s set.

A vacation in Indonesia was the backdrop to Luke Horton’s compelling debut novel, The Fogging, which traced the slow unravelling of a couple’s relationship. Now, in Time Together, a seemingly relaxing beach trip probes at ageing, parenthood, relationships and grief.Phil, whose ill mother has recently died, has invited some old friends to stay with him at his parents’ coastal home while his father is away. There’s no-nonsense Jo and her Marxist-reading husband Lucas; the highly strung Bella and her dad-joke-incarnate partner Tim; and the beautiful Annie, recently single after leaving a bad relationship. On the cusp of middle age, these friends have weathered the decades, with their gathering a reunion of sorts: they’ve meant to keep in touch around the bustle of relationships and raising a family – an entourage of young children attend the holiday too – but the years have slipped by.Time Together is narrated from the alternating points of view of Phil, Bella, Tim and Annie, with Horton moving fluidly among them. As the holiday stretches on, we witness the stripping effect of prolonged time spent between old friends who were once inseparable, now scattered. Flawed assumptions and dormant grievances are exposed, as well as a sense of self forgotten to time and circumstance. Horton writes authentically of this intimate interplay of warring insecurities, nostalgias and unrealised aspirations.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningHowever, Horton doesn’t manage to evoke the same granular psychological detail as he did in The Fogging, the sole protagonist of which was compellingly vivid. In Time Together, having multiple narrators dilutes things, a blurriness exacerbated by a persistent, vague orbiting of meaning – Phil enjoys the kids’ company “for some reason”; Tim reflects “there was something about” the early morning light; Annie can’t “put into words” why Phil’s mannerisms encapsulate him perfectly. This may speak to these friends’ shared feelings of estrangement, but it also means it takes a while for Phil, Bella, Tim and Annie to materialise.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe savage suburbia of Helen Garner: ‘I wanted to dong Martin Amis with a bat’Read moreCutting through this is Horton’s restrained, crisp writing, so unadorned with superfluity that his simple descriptions of nature and light resonate: “It was a sky so uniformly blue, it felt less a clear view of the infinite and more the lid of a great dome that was closed over them.” There are moments, though, when an occasional uninspired image – Phil’s ageing body feeling as if “his entire skeleton was jolting in his skin” – disrupts the book’s otherwise illustrative storytelling. Elsewhere, too, well-intended references to First Nations culture and history read more like sensitivity to optics rather than meaningful engagements.Time Together takes a while to find its footing, but it culminates in a compelling rendering of personal and interpersonal tensions and the subterranean currents that shape them. Without sentimentality, Horton tenderly evokes the at times quiet, opaque nature of grief, drawing subtle threads between Phil’s mourning of his mother as well as a version of himself relegated to memory. The nihilism that can arise after a parent’s death, too, is sketched with poignant restraint: “That love used to be a constant,” Phil says. “Humming away in the background. Always there. Now gone. The world is that much more indifferent to me now.”In a lesser novel, these characters may have succumbed to revelation while on holiday, but Horton is more interested in the interminable struggle of sloughing off our ghosts and not haunting our children the same. Natures are difficult beasts to tame, and to bend them otherwise is to misunderstand them, to tell ourselves a fairytale. As Bella remarks: “Maybe that was part of the problem – our need to make everything a stupid story, to narrativise, when really all this wasn’t a ‘story’ at all. It was something else altogether.”Ultimately, change is not the point of Time Together. Early in the book, Tim goes to look for two of the children down by the beach and observes a swimmable channel: “It seemed not to be running fast. The surface was still. But he knew beneath the surface strong currents ran out to sea.” It’s the perfect metaphor for the surging rapids beneath us – the version of ourselves we project and behind which we’re never truly known, even by those closest to us.Time Together by Luke Hortonis out now in Australia (Scribe, $34.99)Explore more on these topicsFictionAustralian book reviewsAustralian booksreviewsShareReuse this content"

(That is how she was gazetted, at all events, although Dame Twiggy has a ring to it.) With comments from A-listers including Edward Enninful and Suzy Menkes, it tells us the story of a working-class heroine with an almost eerily beautiful gamine face who became a fashion legend with a pop-star status that eluded earlier figures such as Jean Shrimpton, though without the smouldering attitude of the supermodel generation that came later.Twiggy made a glorious success of her life, and never conformed to any tragic narrative about how triumph in the ephemeral world of fashion and fame must surely be punished with disaster. Subject to incessant sexist questioning about her body, she retained her good humour – perhaps because it never occurred to her to do anything else – and was at the centre of stunning fashion pictures in the late 60s, includingMelvin Sokolsky’s amazing, quasi-Warholian shot of Twiggy in New Yorksurrounded by people in Twiggy masks – surely one of the most vivid images of celebrity in modern times.Twiggy quit fashion aged 22, went into movies, where she became a double Golden Globe winner for starring in Ken Russell’s The Boy Friend, and got a Tony nomination for starring on Broadway in George and Ira Gershwin’s musical My One and Only. She had a hit TV show where guests included Bing Crosby and Bryan Ferry and showed herself to have a lovely singing voice. And then she gracefully segued back into fashion. It’s an extraordinary career and the curious fact is that although Twiggy is not known for being a movie or stage actor, those awards and nominations would appear to show she has done better than many who are far better known in those fields.Frost’s film shows that Twiggy’s life has had its share of heartbreaks. Her original boyfriend-slash-manager Nigel Davies, who renamed himself Justin de Villeneuve and gave her her epithet (an inspired expansion of her erstwhile nickname Twigs), became an oppressive and unfaithful controlling figure. Their relationship ended just as Twiggy broke through to mega-fame in the US; De Villeneuve is not interviewed here, however. She later married and divorced actor Michael Witney who, after they split, died of a heart attack at a restaurant in front of their young daughter.These events are not represented here as serious setbacks or dark-night-of-the-soul crises. Maybe they actually weren’t. Maybe Twiggy, in her admirably no-nonsense and uncomplaining way, just got on with it, like a member of the royal family. And whatever misogyny and snobbery she undoubtedly faced clearly had no effect at all on her success. Perhaps her life story doesn’t resonate all that far beyond her own CV, but this is a likable documentary about an eminently likable person.Twiggy is in UK and Irish cinemas from 7 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsModelsTelevisionSadie FrostCelebrityreviewsShareReuse this content"

Up in Helmsdale [in the Scottish Highlands], in my studio, I have an art deco radiogram speaker which has a sort of sunburst thing with that phrase written on it. For £60 on eBay – pristine! It was the BBC World Service motto. When we were casting about for a title for the new record, it seemed like a great expression. Grace said, if you’re going to call it that you have to write a song with that title. So I did.I very much enjoyed the new songKnowledgeand the video, shot inHelmsdale. Do you like to travel much these days or are you pretty much happy at home?nogs09I like Helmsdale, and Grace loves it. When I was seven, eight years old, I spent every holiday in Helmsdale, walking with Stuart, my grandfather. And, one year, Mum and Dad said, I think we’ll go to Spain. I said, you can go wherever you like – I’m going to Helmsdale. We’ve been abroad loads of timessince I had the stroke[in 2005] – to Japan once, to Australia. But I love getting home to the studio. That fragrance of the air. The fresh air. It’s beautiful.The Possibilities Are Endless[the documentary about Collins’s recovery from his stroke] is such a motivational and inspiring watch. How easy was it for youto put it out there for all to see?Aubrey26At the beginning, it was difficult to form my language. But you shouldn’t hide any of it away. There’s no point. I express myself and sometimes I get it wrong – the words, the meaning of things … So what? I am a private person, but with no shame.Is your favourite song stillBoredom[by Buzzcocks, namechecked onOrange Juice’s Rip It Up]?James1968In the punk days, I liked the Sex Pistols, but particularly Subway Sect and Buzzcocks. I was obsessed with Pete Shelley. And then, years and years later, after my stroke, we were sitting in Inverness, and this guy came up to me and went: “I don’t know if you remember me. I’m John Maher. I was the drummer in Buzzcocks.” I said: “I remember you, you were the handsome Buzzcock.” He came over from Harris [in the Outer Hebrides, where Maher now lives] and took all the photographs for theBadbea album. He’s a great photographer. Still handsome.Did you plan to break up Orange Juice on the evening of theminers’benefit showat Brixton Academy inJanuary 1985?ChrisBartleyOrange Juice had come to an end. Polydor were dropping me and Zeke [Manyika, drummer] was busy with his solo career. It came to its own conclusion, really. So I said, I might as well say this will be Orange Juice’s last gig. It was Grace’s idea to play Rock and Roll (I Gave You the Best Years of My Life) by Kevin Johnson. “And Zeke followed me through London, through a hundred hotel rooms / Through a hundred record companies who didn’t like my tunes.” There were people crying in the audience.View image in fullscreen‘Orange Juice came to its own conclusion, really’ … Collins, second left, with the band in London in 1981.Photograph: David Corio/RedfernsWould an Orange Juice reunion ever be on the cards?RattonRedNo!I remember that you were quite caustic about other bands in interviews back in the 80s and 90s.Have you mellowed? Most of the bands you slagged off deserved it!1234 RamonesBack then, every indie band was nasty about everybody. Nowadays, everybody’s nice about everybody. Some of the people I’ve been horrible about are very, very lovely to me now. Then you meet people and they’re really nice and you just feel like, what a wanker I am. I remember Pete Wylie from Wah! Heat [aka The Mighty Wah!]. I said [to him]: “Aren’t you sort of like Abba?” And now we are good buddies.I’m currently rereadingGrace’s memoirFalling and Laughing. It’s even more inspiring second time around. Have you written songs about her?SalfordRed64Yes, I have. There’s one called You’re Better Than You Know on Hope and Despair. That’s a lovely song. A song of encouragement. And then Graciously. That’s about it.View image in fullscreen‘I’m not a punk any more. I’m too old for that’ … Collins on stage in Edinburgh in 2020.Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/RedfernsWhen you first wrote and recordedA Girl Like You, did you have any inkling that it would be such a huge worldwide hit, or did its success take you by surprise?VerulamiumParkRangerVic Godardfrom Subway Sect, who sang backing vocals, said: “Yes, that’s the one, that’s the No 1 single.” But, no, we didn’t. It was obvious it was the single – but it didn’t get playlisted. Much later,Mickie Most, the genius producer, said that occasionally there’s a record you can bury under the Empire State Building that will still find a way out. High praise from Mickie. There was absolutely nothing you could do to that record to stop it. It was an unstoppable force. Even I couldn’t mess that record up.I love the fact thatPaul Cook from the Sex Pistolsis the drummer on theGorgeous GeorgeLP. But a mate told me there were loads of other first-generation punks on that record. Can that be true? And do you still consider yourself a punk?frenteboqueronWell, Vic was on the record. And we have worked a lot with Dave Ruffy elsewhere, who was a Rut: “Babylon’s burning!” But I’m not a punk any more. I’m too old for that. I love punk records. I also love northern soul, soul, indie music. In my opinion, there are good records and bad records. And good records, I’ll always love.Will you be making music withVic Godardagain?GrahamCarrisgodPossibly. He’s always running around like a maniac. So we’ll pin him down and see if we can get him to come up and do some recording in Helmsdale. He’s the best company.View image in fullscreen‘I am a private person, but with no shame’ … Collins at Orange Juice’s last gig, at Brixton Academy, in 1985.Photograph: Steve Rapport/Getty ImagesSeventies Night, a song that you recorded withthe lateMark E Smith, became a staple in my DJ sets. Mark was quite a character. Did you two get along in the studio?CoopertapesNot exactly! RIP, of course. The first time I worked with him he said: “I’m not worthy, Edwyn.” Then he came back to our studio and terrified Seb, my sidekick. Poor Seb. Grace told him off and he said sorry – he could be very sweet. He also said: “Right, I’m putting the nails in.” During that session, he sacked his entire group. But he ultimately had a nice person in him, a polite person.Never mind the back pain: how rock’s drummers cope with furious sets in their 70sRead moreI can’t tell you how much I admire your strength, determination and fortitude to recover from a stroke. My question is: what inspires you to keep going?EducatedRitaIn hospital, even my pupils didn’t react. It looked like curtains for me. But my doctor decided to operate. And I’m grateful. Even when I was unconscious, I felt I was fighting for my life. My dreams didn’t die. There was wonderful satisfaction to come. Now, sometimes it’s difficult for me to get about.

A sailor, stricken in a wild and furious sea, fell to the deck of his ship to pray for salvation. The almighty unveiled a mountain in the midst of the tempest where the ship duly made landfall: in gratitude the sailor built a church on its summit. The devil – who had unleashed that evil storm – did his best to prise the church from its foundations, but Archangel Michael sprung to its defence and became the patron of this Devon parish. The tale has many versions, but this is the general gist.Map of Dartmoor, south DevonToday, St Michael de Rupe counts as the highest working church in southern England – poised dramatically on top of a western outlier of Dartmoor’s tors. This medieval building casts a striking silhouette over the west Devon landscape, but it also marks the start of theArchangel’s Way: a pilgrimage route created in 2021 by the diocese of Exeter that travels 38 miles eastward from here across Dartmoor to a second St Michael’s church in Chagford. I chose to walk the route in February when the moor was at its quietest and most mysterious – and though the seas of the famous folk tale had receded, on my visit the storm had not.Storm Herminia was thrashing through the West Country as I climbed the muddy path to the porch of St Michael de Rupe. Inside, the church had the mood of a ship in a storm. There was the whistle of the wind in the roof: gusts pressing lead-lined glass into ancient panes. The winged figure of Archangel Michael adorned the stained glass behind the altar. In folklore he is the guardian of high places, and the vanquisher of heathen forces that once held dominion over the peaks.St Michael de Rupe is the highest working church in southern England – poised dramatically on top of a western outlier of Dartmoor’s torsSitting in the porch, I unfolded a map and considered the path ahead of me. The Archangel’s Way passes villages with parish churches, pubs with warm hearths, places where you can find succour and society. However, it also skirts the North Moor – the more desolate and remote half of Dartmoor, where signs of Christendom are still outnumbered by prehistoric pagan edifices, such as stone circles and cryptic megaliths.In Dartmoor folklore there is barely a crossroads the devil does not frequent to barter for a soul, nor a hill nor stone at which some evil entity claims authority – phantom, beast, horned figure. To walk this route was, in a sense, to walk a line between dark and light. To be a wanderer of the English wilderness for, if not exactly 40 days, then at least about 40 miles.The path led to Lydford and then climbed the western flank of Dartmoor proper. Green fields turned to bracken the colour of a well-thumbed two pence piece. A final stone cross guarded the approach on Brat Tor: to the south red flags fluttered on poles, a warning sign that the army were conducting live firing exercises nearby.View image in fullscreenThe Nine Maidens stone circle.Photograph: ASC Photography/AlamyThe storm blew on. The overflow waterfall of the Meldon reservoir flew upwards into massing clouds. I was walking with my friend, Justin Foulkes, a Devonian who has been exploring the moor since he was 15. He pointed out the lonely ruin named Bleak House, and Amicombe Hill, the scene of fires attributed to the devil by residents of the farmland below. Justin was clear that, for him, Dartmoor was never a sinister place. As a teenager he had found himself too anxious to revise for exams at home and so brought piles of textbooks out on to the moor to find focus. “When you’re sitting on top of a bronze age burial chamber it puts everything in perspective,” he said.We wanted to harness the spirituality of the moor in the creation of the Archangel’s WayChloe Axford, diocese of ExeterAfter a night on the moor at a friend’s near Belstone, further prehistoric remains followed on the second day of walking. First came the Nine Maidens stone circle – the stones said to come alive with the ringing of the church bells (out of earshot in the wind). There followed the stone rows on Cosdon Hill, arriving through a thick Hammer Horror mist. Lastly came the spectacular Scorhill stone circle – supposedly protected by a magic forcefield which prevents livestock from entering.Folklore is an errant guide to these relics of an unfathomable past – whose meaning and function are lost to an age before recorded history – indeed an age before climate change helped lead to a large-scale human exodus from Dartmoor’s high country.View image in fullscreenSt Michael’s, Chagford, marks the end of the route.Photograph: Ian Goodrick/AlamyHowever, where certainties are absent the imagination steps in to complete the picture. It was perhaps natural for God-fearing folk to populate the moorland with supernatural entities that could thrive in the wild weather and hostile terrain where humans could no longer live.“Dartmoor is like the sea,” Chloe Axford of the diocese of Exeter later told me. “It’s a rugged, wild and unpredictable place. We wanted to harness the spirituality of the moor in the creation of the Archangel’s Way. And also encourage people to visit its churches and chapels, and give them a warm welcome there.”How I found my Dartmoor moment with the gift of wild campingRead moreEventually, there were signs I was returning to society: a cattle grid, a row of conifers. A country lane winding down to St Michael, Chagford, where snowdrops were sprouting among the graves. Inside the beautiful little church was a rough-hewn sculpture of St Michael – a demon vanquished beneath his foot. Yet, you could still hear the wind pressing upon the rafters, as if Herminia herself was trying to get inside.On This Holy Island: A Modern Pilgrimage Across Britainby Oliver Smith is published byBloomsbury(£10.99).
