If that won’t save the world, what will?Tue 2 Sep 2025 08.24 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 21.31 EDTShare“If I hear one more of our people saying that deckchairs are being shuffled on the Titanic,” a government supporter of Keir Starmerconfided to the Daily Mail, “I will scream.” No need for shrieks. The prime minister’s No 10 hokey cokey on Monday wasn’t so much shuffling the deckchairs as restructuring the deck crew and announcing that some fresh faces will enable the team to work with new focus towards their ultimate goal of reshuffling. Expect the first strategy whiteboard to be broken out 370 miles off the coast of Newfoundland.For now, hold on to your aperitifs and continue to dress for dinner, because the erstwhile chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, becomes something called chief secretary to the prime minister. To Starmer, Darren is a Mr Fixit; to many of his cabinet colleagues, he is a Mr Fuxit. That’s not the official line Downing Steet is going with,preferring instead to claimthat yet another reset means Starmer is focused on “relentless delivery”. Delivery of what? They’ve barely passed any legislation. Hand on heart, meanwhile, I’m not sure the word “relentless” means what Starmer reckons it does. All he ever does is relent, on both staff and policy. The role of his comms chief, for example, is now essentially a gig economy job, while doing a monthly U-turn is the only thing he hasn’t U-turned on. We are watching a movie in which it’s not clear what the main character wants. Unsurprisingly, it has turned out to be box-office poison.But look, maybe it just needs a better tagline! Certainly, Monday found the Starmer administrationtoggling betweennew official and unofficial slogans. We have “delivering growth people can feel in their pockets”, which sounds suitably masturbatorial, and “just fucking do it”, which sounds suitably devoid of strategy. Both, however, are preferable to the way one member of Starmer’s inner circle characterised the latest reboot of the franchise,telling the Timesthat “this is about bringing the grownups in”. Oh no – not the dreaded grownups. Just as Batman reboots only ever promise to be even darker and even grittier, so Starmer reboots only ever promise tosend for more grownups. Starmer has been claiming the grownups are coming since 2017. Doing it again now suggests he spent the first 14 months of government running an administration staffed by kids.Then again, non-cinematic inspiration was available. “We’re not pitching you a new Netflix series,” explained the then shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds in the run-up to last year’s general election. “We’re not putting on politics as entertainment.” Finally, a pledge on which the government has delivered. Unfortunately,as I suggested at the time, it would have been much better if the government had emulated Netflix in one crucial regard. When the streamer greenlights a series, it tends to know how much it is going to cost, and precisely how it will all be paid for. Keir Starmer’s government remains “on a journey” on that front, and it is this more than anything else that is going to do for him. Or, if you prefer, has already done for him.It was barely nine months ago thatRachel Reeveswas defending last year’s budget to the CBI, declaring: “I’m really clear: I’m not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes. That is why at this budget, we did wipe the slate clean to put public finances and public services on a firm footing, and as a result, we won’t have to do a budget like this ever again.” Spoiler alert: they’re going to have to do a much worse one. Yes, in a development that was both clearly predictable and clearly predicted, the promise not to raise any of the three biggest taxes – but to give Britain a far better lifestyle than that to which it had become angrily accustomed – has not come off. In related news, Britain is now much angrier. And it’s going to be a whole lot angrier still come the budget. People will be quite within their rights to say they never voted for any of the things Reeves is going to have to do. It’s extremely difficult see how she survives that.During the last election campaign, Rishi Sunak’s claim thatLabourwould have to raise taxes was treated like some whopper for the ages, with Starmer calling it “absolute garbage” and hotly claiming that the then PM had broken the ministerial code by suggesting that a £2,000 tax hike per person across the parliament would be the way a Labour government would fill a £22bn hole. “He knew very well what he was doing,” sniffed Starmer. “He lied about our plans. And that is a true test of character. As we go to the polls it is important for voters to know about the character of the two individuals who want to be prime minister.”Well quite. And yet, it is genuinely difficult to suspend one’s disbelief enough to be able to believe that the current economic position can be a surprise to Starmer. He must have known that what he was promising in the run-up to the election – an election he was always going to win – didn’t add up. And if he didn’t, he and his chancellor are even more incompetent than they have so far come across. Their lofty promises amount to a form of populism almost as corrosive as the ones they say they disdain – indeed, it may end up the midwife to them.Evasions this big should simply be called lies. Unfortunately, every single political party’s manifesto majored on them last time round. During the Brexit years, the term cakeism was popularised to sum up the prevalent mood that everything could be acquired without cost. Boris Johnson famously announced that he was “pro having it and pro eating it” – yet despite seeing how that turned out for everyone from Theresa May to Johnson himself, Starmer and Reeves’s economic promises were cakeism of the first water. These days, so are Reform’s. Nigel Faragehas already promised£80bn of new spending with no remotely serious suggestion as to how it will be funded. Mister Honest is lying to the British people,just like he did in the run-up to the referendumon Britain’s EU membership, and if he does make it into No 10, we will yet again see where kicking the can down the road gets us.Except perhaps by then, we will have run out of road. Someone, at some point, is going to have to approach a position of honesty with the public – but the appetite for self-delusion suggests the time where that would be a winning position is some way off. Until then, we will become ever more stuck – trapped in a never-ending episode of The Great British Cakeism-Off.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourBudget 2025Tax and spendingRachel ReevesDarren JonesEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Are they victims of a terrible era for hospitality or part of a growing shift in cultural values?Isobel LewisTue 2 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 03.15 EDTShareWhen London’s Unity Diner wrapped up 2024 with the announcement that it would soon be shutting its doors for good, it expected some sadness from its customers. After all, the not-for-profit restaurant had been an innovator in the city’s vegan scene, serving up 3D-printed “vegan steak” (made of plant protein with the fibrous feel of the real thing) and disarmingly realistic “tofish” (tofu fish) alongside the classic burgers and chips. Throw in its animal sanctuary fundraising, and the restaurant had been faithfully embraced by vegans.But, from the reaction it received, you would think its supporters were genuinely grieving. “We had people coming in and crying and hugging the staff,” says its co-founder, Andy Crumpton, his surprise audible. There was another element to the devastation, he says. For its plant-based punters, Unity Diner was yet another meat-free establishment that had outwardly appeared to be prospering, only to suddenly shut down.Ask anyone who frequents plant-based establishments – whether they are vegan, vegetarian or simply trying to cut down on meat – and it is likely that they will have seen a favourite spot go under in recent years. Many of my London favourites, such as Rudy’s Vegan Diner, Halo Burger and Neat Burger, have closed, while friends across the country have lamented their own losses: The Glasvegan in Glasgow, Veggie Republic in Liverpool, Jungle Bird in Birmingham. Some go out in style; some fade without a trace, leaving online reviewers to complain about unhonoured reservations and Reddit detectives to seek out information.View image in fullscreenRevival … the popular Unity Diner has been resurrected.Photograph: Steven TillerThere seem to be two popular theories as to why so many apparently successful plant-based restaurants are closing. Some argue that the hospitality industry as a whole is struggling; others say that the never-ending, oversimplified discourse about protein and ultra-processed foods has driven people away from veganism. Given the volume of chatter about thecarnivore dietandthe myriad mythsconcerning plant-based eating – that it is impossible to build muscle as a vegan, that plant milk is always bad for you, that kids should never be fed a vegan diet – the idea that people are forsaking veganism is understandable.But, despite the negativity, interest in veganismis still on the rise, with environmental and health concerns now considered more significant contributing factors to giving up animal products than animal welfare. According to Damian Watson from the Vegan Society,about 2 million Britonsnow identify as vegan or follow a plant-based diet (vegans usually referencing the philosophy, while for those on a plant-based diet it is more about the diet itself).Crumpton is right about the ominous feeling across the sector, though. As Herbivorous, a small plant-based chain from the north of England,put itwhile announcing its own demise in April: “It seems you can’t open social media at the moment without reading about another hospitality business closing down.” Then there wasthe newslast month that the New York-based Eleven Madison Park (EMP), the only plant-based establishment in the world with three Michelin stars, would be putting meat back on its menu this autumn. The head chef, Daniel Humm, explained: “The best way to continue to champion plant-based cooking is to let everyone participate around the table.” Unsurprisingly, this announcement did not go down well with EMP’s nearly half a million followers. “So good to hear climate change and animal ethics have been solved and we can focus on the most important moral issue: maximising profit,” one Instagram user wrote.View image in fullscreenMichelin standard … the chef and owner of Eleven Madison Park, Daniel Humm.Photograph: Lucas Jackson/ReutersAnother voice criticising EMP’s “backwards move” was Clare Every, a vegan influencer highlighting the best plant-based food London has to offer on her blog, The Little London Vegan. When a restaurant goes under, Every’s followers make sure she is the first to know. “I get so many messages from people saying: ‘Oh, just so you know, this place you’ve got on your website is closed down.’ And I think: ‘I had no idea they were even struggling,’” she says.Ask Every, and many British vegans, which recent loss cut the deepest, and they will often reference The Vurger Co. Founded by Rachel Hugh in 2016, Vurger felt like a huge success story. It had four stores across London, Brighton and Manchester, a cookbook, and a range of condiments sold by Co-op, Ocado and Whole Foods. Its menu was varied and consistently delicious, offering vegetable-based patties and mock meat, including a limited edition “pork-crackling” burger so crisp and juicy that the memory still makes me salivate.Vurger gained a loyal customer base from the start, says Hugh, and planned to expand. But after Covid, priorities had to change. “Business decisions became more about resilience day to day and pushing through the tough economic environment,” she says. First, its Canary Wharf branch went. Then, in February 2024, Hugh announced the three remaining restaurants would be closing, too.Not all brands are so upfront about their closure. Many social media accounts simply stop posting. Phone numbers ring out. Websites display out-of-date information or fail to load; or, in the case of a once popular vegan pasta business that had sites across England, redirect to a scammy-looking cam-girl site. The meat-free, user-based restaurant review app HappyCow usually has the most accurate information, but relying on it shifts the onus from the businesses to customers.The end is not always permanent, however. After the Manchester vegan haven Wholesome Junkies said they shut down its “packed every weekend” Cheetham Hill branch last year, due to “rocketing” costs, it reopened in a new spot in a matter of months. Unity Diner’s announcement seemed equally set in stone when it closed post-Veganuary. “It got to a point where we were just getting deeper and deeper in debt,” Crumpton tells me.View image in fullscreenMuch missed … the Vurger Co had a loyal fanbase for its vegan burgers.Photograph: PRBut the support was immense and, for once, it wasn’t too little, too late. Veganuary proved so lucrative that Unity Diner tripled its normal monthly profits. Despite being a “done deal”, liquidation was halted. Unity reopened in April, delighting and baffling fans in equal measure – but it definitely felt like a much-needed win. It is still “barely breaking even”, Crumpton clarifies, but its London-first vegan Sunday roast carvery (complete with unlimited sides, including that most hard-to-make beast, the vegan yorkshire pudding) has been a real “saviour” since the relaunch.Unity’s renaissance is swimming against the tide of today’s hospitality industry. Between January and March this year, theUK experienced 20restaurant, pub and hotel closures a week, with the cost of living crisis continuing to have an impact on the industry. Consumers have less disposable income to spend on meals out, while increases in national insurance and the minimum wage mean those meals are pricier and feel like even more of a luxury. Hugh says inflation had a dramatic impact on Vurger’s fortunes. At times, ingredients were cheaper at Tesco than the wholesaler, she says. Elsewhere, electricity bills soared so high that they would switch off their grills during quieter points in the day, which caused “major operational issues across the board” and amounted to a “totally unsustainable food chain”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

Disinformation about what is and isn’t healthy (and what healthy even means) is rife on social media, and vegan food – and vegans in general, as Watson puts it – have become easy targets. Despiteresearchby the Food Foundation, among others, finding that plant-based alternatives to meat are better for the planet and mostly healthier than the same products made from animals, as they contain fewer calories, less saturated fat and more fibre,half of Europeansdo not eat plant-based meat and dairy alternatives because they want to avoid ultra-processed foods. “We’re fighting two battles at the same time,” Every says. “People either think: ‘Oh, it’s too healthy, there’s no protein, that’s not going to fill me up,’ or they think: ‘Oh, it’s processed, it’s not healthy.’”Yet The Vegan Society’s statistics are clear: there are more vegans than ever. And Veganuary, which was founded in 2014, sawan estimated25.8 million people worldwide try veganism in January 2025. “The appetite for plant-based food is still there, and many customers want to eat in a way that aligns with their values,” Hugh says. “What’s missing is the structural support to help those businesses thrive.”But while veganism is on the up, Watson argues that eating habits have changed. If the vegan boom of the 2010s played out through the repeated launch of “dirty” vegan junk food spots specialising in sinewy chick’n nuggets or juicy burgers drenched in barbecue sauce, then today’s buzziest restaurants reflect a redefined focus on protein. Every says vegan Asian restaurants, such as London’s Tofu Vegan and Mali Vegan Thai, or the national chain Wawin, are thriving: cuisines that have a long history of integrating vegetables, tofu and other soy products.A stickier point for the industry is one that, on paper, is great for the average vegan. As meat-free living has grown in popularity, most UK restaurants (particularly in larger cities and towns) have upped the game with their plant-based options. A beef burger can be swapped for Beyond Meat with ease. Vegans are no longer forced to choose chips or a limp side salad, and are catered for by most establishments.‘People just lie’: How Riverford’s Guy Singh-Watson became the most brutally honest farmer in BritainRead moreA side-effect of this is that cash-tight groups with mixed dietary preferences are less likely to frequent solely plant-based establishments. In “a super price-sensitive market”, Hugh says, an independent restaurant cannot compete with a vegan burger from McDonald’s that costs a fiver. Hospitality is tough enough when you cater for everyone, Crumpton says. When you’re “a bit niche”, things only get more difficult.For Hugh, what needs challenging is the prevailing view that “everyone is served” at omnivorous restaurants, whereas they are not at a fully vegan place. This wasthe argumentgiven by EMP’s Humm for its reinstatement of meat. Every takes issue with this. “They said they changed their menu to be more inclusive, but I think nothing is more inclusive than plant-based food,” she says. “Veganism has an image problem … [but] it’s for everyone.”There is also a sense that vegans feel a stronger connection to the restaurants they visit than the average diner. It is what Watson calls veganism’s “team spirit”. The closure of a restaurant often feels like the loss of a group member, particularly in small UK towns, many of which still have a smattering of purely plant-based options, if any. There is a reason people cried on their perceived final visit to Unity Diner: it is a community that goes beyond food.View image in fullscreenHaute cuisine … EMP’s $335 vegan menu, which includes tonburi with pea cream and baby lettuce.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesHugh remembers the day she announced that Vurger was closing with immediate effect, and the “overwhelming” fan response: “We heard from so many people – longtime customers, staff past and present, fellow founders – and it reminded us why we started in the first place. The message we kept getting was: ‘You mattered.’” These flurries of support are often tinged with sadness and regret: if only we had visited more when we had the chance.But had Unity Diner vanished into thin air and not received all that social media support about its closure, it would not be here today, with burgers being flipped inside, and meat-free gravy being poured. “It wasn’t a plan by any means,” Crumpton says. “We were done for. We were making a huge loss every month, and we managed to come back.” Of course, “things can change at any time”, and success for a vegan restaurant in 2025 is all relative. But, for now, Crumpton is happy: “I don’t think we’re making any money, but we’re not losing money, put it that way.”Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkVeganismRestaurantsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That might be pushing it, but they were certainly more consequential than Kemi Badenoch’s “drill, baby, drill” keynote speech in Aberdeen. Not a single broadcaster could be bothered with that one. It might as well not have happened. Shame. Because as well as receiving a scholarship to Stanford University to study medicine at 16, it’s a little-known fact that Kemi was also invited to be a visiting professor in climate science at Harvard at the age of 11. One day her true talents will be revealed.But not today. Tuesday morning was all about the Greens, and Harriet Lamb, the party’s chief executive, seemed rather overwhelmed by the attention. Standing room only at the Coin Street neighbourhood centre in central London. A phalanx of news cameras and journalists. It’s been a while since there’s been this much interest in the Greens. Lamb bobbed up and down behind the lectern, gulping nervously.This was a pivotal moment for the whole country, she said. The Greens were poised to help create the next government. Er … Run that one past me again. Just who will the Greens be going into coalition with, given that they’ve ruled out any deals with Reform, the Tories and Labour? That just leaves Jeremy Corbyn’s as yet unnamed party and possibly the Lib Dems. If they aren’t too rightwing. Not sure I can see that coalition getting enough seats to form a government. But maybe I’m just nit picking.In any case, this wasn’t a time to sweat the small stuff. If you can’t dare to dream on your first day in the new job, than when can you? For this day was all about Zack Polanski. Everyone knew that Zack was going to win weeks ago: the only question was by how much. Even so, nobody quite expected the scale of the victory, with Polanskigetting 85% of the vote. A landslide. Out with the old, easy-does-it, Lib Dem-adjacent gradualism of previous Green leaders. In with a more radical, leftist eco-populism.Zack was all smiles. Big hugs for the defeated Ellie Chowns and Adrian Ramsay. You would never have guessed the leadership campaign had been a fairly bad-tempered affair. For the Greens, that is. During an LBC debate, Ramsay had refused to say whether he liked Polanski or not. I think we can assume not. But for now, all was forgiven.Then came the victory speech. Mainly a list of thank yous and tributes. Starting with the four Green MPs. Just as well. Zack is only a member of the London assembly and is going to have to work closely with his Westminster colleagues. No point alienating anyone just yet.“I stand on the shoulders of giants,” he said. Starting with Ramsay. Adrian had been brilliant. Just brilliant. Couldn’t have managed without him. Same with Ellie. Her work in holding the government to account over the genocide in Gaza had been matchless. It made you wonder what all the problems between them had been. Carla Denyer and Siân Berry both got a drive-by accolade. They were great because they just were.Let bygones be bygones. Zack was there for everyone. Not just those who voted for him. Everyone in the party had a common cause, but no one had to feel the same way about everything. Finally he took aim at the enemy. The water companies pumping sewage into rivers. The charlatans of Reform who were part of the millionaires’ cabal. Last, but not least, the Labour party. The lowest of the low. A party that had pretended to be on the side of workers but was no better than Reform. He didn’t even mention the Tories because everyone now treats them as irrelevant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As leader, I’ll offer real solutions to Britain’s problems | Zack PolanskiRead moreWe’re not here to work with Labour, Polanski declared. We’re here to replace you, Keir Starmer. We will have the people’s back. We will talk truth to power. In the blink of an eye, Westminster would be full of Green MPs. This was a pivotal moment in the country’s politics. The day the world changed. Those of us with long memories might feel we have heard all this before. Not just from Corbyn when he became Labour leader, but from every party leader who has ever been elected. But Zack sounded as if he believed it more than most. This was his moment and he was going to make the most of it.After a brief interlude in which the deputy leaders were announced, Polanski took to the stage once more to take questions from journalists. The first reporter asked why Zack felt he could succeed with a radical left agenda where Corbyn had previously failed. He would succeed because he would succeed. The people wanted what he had to offer. Nationalising the utilities. Taxing the billionaires. Acting on climate change. Not so much radical leftism as a no-brainer.Zack began to warm to his theme. He would think big. Aim to win 30 Westminster seats. Within half an hour he had increased that to 40. Who knows where we would have been if the interviews had gone on any longer? It wasn’t all about him, he insisted. It was the members who decided policy. But just at this moment it did feel all about him. The man who wanted to take on Farage at his own social media game. The man who would deal with “despicable” Starmer only if he had a brain transplant. The man who doesn’t think twice about calling people fascist.It’s been quite the journey for Polanski. From actor to hypnotherapist promising to increase women’s breast size. Bygones, he says. From Lib Dem to eco-populist. It’s also been quite the journey for the Greens. No longer playing it safe. Choosing a leader who is not afraid to say what he thinks. Fighting fire with fire. Happy to make enemies. Leave Nato? Why ever not? Doing anything for attention. Just desperate not to be ignored. They’ve had enough of that.Explore more on these topicsGreen partyThe politics sketchnewsShareReuse this content"

It has not been simple but Adrien Truffert and Bafodé Diakité, in particular, have slotted in seamlessly and there is excitement at the promise of Amine Adli, Ben Gannon Doak and Álex Jiménez, a deadline-day addition from Milan. Bournemouth consider Djordje Petrovic, a permanent No 1, a significant piece of business that will allow them to kick on under Andoni Iraola.BFBrentfordThe departures ofBryan MbeumoandYoane Wissa,who scored 39 of Brentford’s 66 Premier League goals last season, brought in more than £120m but have left a huge hole. Signing Reiss Nelson on loan from Arsenal represented an underwhelming end to the window for the new head coach, Keith Andrews, especially after deciding not to follow up a club-record £45m offer for Borussia Dortmund’s Max Beier that was rejected last week. The onus will be on Dango Ouattara – signed from Bournemouth for £42m – and Igor Thiago to provide the goals, while Jordan Henderson adds experience in midfield after the loss of the captainChristian Nørgaard.EAView image in fullscreenDango Ouattara will be key if Brentford are to cope without Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.Photograph: Richard Lee/ShutterstockBrightonMost of the club’s business was done early as usual. Maxim De Cuyper was the last new arrival in the first week of July, the Belgium defender joining Olivier Boscagli, Charalampos Kostoulas, Diego Coppola and Tommy Watson at the Amex Stadium, while Stefanos Tzimas also arrived after signing in January. After seeing off strong interest in Carlos Baleba fromManchester Unitedand selling João Pedro to Chelsea, it was a busy end to the window in terms of outgoings, with Tariq Lamptey, Abdallah Sima and Pervis Estupiñán among those departing.EABurnleyThe revolving doors at Turf Moor kept spinning until the deadline. It was a hectic window asBurnleyattempted to give themselves the strongest possible chance of staying up. The deadline-day arrival of the defensive midfielder Florentino Luís from Benfica, on loan but with an obligation to buy for £20.8m next summer, made it 14 incomings. That includes four of last season’s loanees being signed permanently. There were 19 departures, with the exits of CJ Egan-Riley, James Trafford and Josh Brownhill significant blows.Andy HunterView image in fullscreenKyle Walker’s move to Burnley from Manchester City was one of the window’s early surprises.Photograph: Peter Powell/ReutersChelseaKey business was completed early, with Liam Delap and João Pedro arriving to fire Enzo Maresca’s team toClub World Cup glory. Estêvão Willian is a sparkling addition on the right wing, replacing Noni Madueke. Alejandro Garnacho and Jamie Gittens are new arrivals on the opposite flank. Chelsea, who combined their expenditure with a lot of sales, did not pursue a new centre-back despite Levi Colwill’s knee injury and losing Delap with a hamstring injury led to confusion over Nicolas Jackson’s move to Bayern Munich before that wasconfirmed on deadline day. Maresca will hope Facundo Buonanotte, a surprise arrival on loan from Brighton, provides depth in attack.Jacob SteinbergPremier League clubs break record with £3bn spend in Summer transfer windowCrystal PalaceA chaotic end to the window summed up Palace’s summer asMarc Guéhi’s move to Liverpool was called offat the last minute after they failed to find an adequate replacement. It was a major victory for the manager, Oliver Glasner, having lostEberechi Eze to Arsenaland having to wait for reinforcements because of uncertainty over the club’s European participation, while the chairman, Steve Parish, will be counting the cost of turning down £35m for a player with less than 12 months of his contract remaining. But at least Palace were able to add to their squad late on with the teenage French defender Jaydee Canvot joining on deadline day after they snapped up the Spain forward Yeremy Pino from Villarreal.EAEvertonDavid Moyes said from the outset that his mission to rebuildEvertoncould not be achieved in one window and he failed to hide his frustration at times as numerous targets rejected a move to Hill Dickinson Stadium. Ultimately, however, the club delivered. The squad remains light at full-back and in attack, but the signings of Jack Grealish, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Tyler Dibling represent a significant uplift in quality. They are the calibre of player Moyes wanted. The deadline-day signing of the central midfielder Merlin Röhl from Freiburg addressed another problem area.AHView image in fullscreenThe midfielder Merlin Röhl has joined Everton from Freiburg.Photograph: Daniela Porcelli/Getty ImagesFulhamFulham’s only piece of business going into deadline day was for a No 2 keeper – Benjamin Lecomte. Marco Silva did not exactly hide his frustration. The Portuguese received a late boost, however, after Fulham completed the £34.5m signing ofthe Brazilian winger Kevin from Shakhtar Donetskafter also agreeing a loan deal for Milan’s Samuel Chukwueze. Fulham also kept their tight-knit squad together. Andreas Pereira, who joined Palmeiras, was the only big-name player to depart.JSLeedsDaniel Farke has remodelled Leeds along taller and more powerful lines, but whether such newfound physicality translates intoPremier Leaguesurvival remains to be seen. Much hinges on the fitness of the key attacking signings Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Lukas Nmecha. Can they remain sufficiently injury-free to showcase their very real talent? Only time will tell if Patrick Bamford’s attacking skills were jettisoned too quickly. Midfield seems to have been fortified sensibly by the addition of Sean Longstaff and Anton Stach, while Lucas Perri promises to prove the reliable goalkeeper Farke has long craved and Jaka Bijol offers necessary competition in central defence.Louise TaylorLiverpoolAn outstanding window before deadline day was upgraded to sensational by close of play. The champions had clear, ambitious priorities from the start and acquired almost every one in a lavish recruitment drive that leaves Arne Slot with a more formidable squad than he had last season. Having played Newcastle all summer,Liverpool finally landed Alexander Isakfor a British record fee of £125m – £25m below Newcastle’s valuation – but a £35m move for Marc Guéhi was thwarted late on. The sale of squad players for high prices, along with the benefits of being a sensible and well-run club, helped to fund an outlay of more than £440m.AHView image in fullscreenAlexander Isak got his move to Liverpool.Photograph: Nikki Dyer/LFC/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesManchester CityTijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Aït-Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli arrived early, with the first three involved in a start to the season in which City have lost two of their opening three fixtures. This suggests the club’s recruitment may be going awry. Their arrivals were followed by thearrival of Gianluigi Donnarummafrom Paris Saint-Germain, a standout addition but also a curious one given the Italian can be clumsy with his feet – a head-scratcher as “Guardiola-ball” hinges on the keeper being slick in this area. Ederson has departed to join Fenerbahce.Jamie JacksonManchester UnitedManchester United entered the window needing one No 10 and ended up with two – Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. They needed at least one midfielder – a No 6 – and ended up with none. They also needed an elite goalkeeper and signed a 23-year-old prospect in Senne Lammens, albeit there is a belief at Old Trafford that he can challenge André Onana andAltay Bayindir for the No 1 spot immediately. United did sign the No 9 they wanted inBenjamin Seskofrom RB Leipzig but, overall, this has been an odd window for the 20-time champions.JJView image in fullscreenManchester United have assembled a new forward line with Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha all arriving this summer.Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United/Getty ImagesNewcastleA turbulent, unedifying summer on Tyneside dominated by Alexander Isak’s ultimately satisfieddesperation to leave for Liverpoolhas, on paper, actually ended rather well for Newcastle. Nick Woltemade – AKA “the two-metre Messi” – and Yoane Wissa may yet turn out to be a better attacking duo than Isak and Callum Wilson. Similarly, Aaron Ramsdale’s loan arrival offers Nick Pope real goalkeeping competition, Malick Thiaw strengthens the central defensive department, Jacob Ramsey adds midfield quality and versatility, and Anthony Elanga is a high-calibre winger.LTNottingham ForestThere is so much to like about Forest’s business but recruitment, overseen by Edu, the global head of football for Evangelos Marinakis’s stable of clubs, is also behind the friction with Nuno Espírito Santo. Only one of Forest’s new faces – Dan Ndoye, a £34m buy from Bologna – started on Sunday inthe defeat against West Hamand Nuno would have preferred all 11 signings to have been embedded during pre-season. No fewer than four arrived from Botafogo, including the left-back Cuiabano and the goalkeeper John Victor. Nuno counts last summer’s preparations as a driver behind their historic season.BFView image in fullscreenThe winger Dan Ndoye moved from Bologna to the City Ground.Photograph: Richard Bowcott/IPS/ShutterstockSunderlandSunderland have not quite eclipsed Nottingham Forest’s record of signing 21 new players in a single window but Regis Le Bris’s squad has certainly been refreshed. If turning Enzo Le Fée’s January loan from Roma into a formal transfer was a triumph, the arrival of the impressive Netherlands Under-21 goalkeeper Robin Roefs, the Switzerland captain and former Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka and the former Strasbourg midfielder Habib Diarra look three more terrific deals. At the last count, Le Bris had overseen the arrival of 14 new faces for a combined £141.5m this summer. Retaining squad harmony amid such wholesale change is vital but, if Sunderland stay up, the investments will look shrewd.LTTottenhamWhen James Maddison ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season against Newcastle on 3 August, Tottenham’s need for a new playmaker became desperate. Dejan Kulusevski was already a long-term injury casualty. So there was anxiety when the club failed with moves for Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze.The signing of Xavi Simons, then, brought relief as well as excitement. Mohammed Kudus had arrived earlier to plug the gap left by Son Heung-min’s departure, while João Palhinha reinforces the base of the midfield.Randal Kolo Muani will providea needed extra option up front as the club prepare for the demands of a Champions League return.David HytnerView image in fullscreenRandal Kolo Muani arrived at Tottenham from Paris Saint-Germain on a deadline-day loan.Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/ReutersWest HamForced to sell in order to buy, West Ham were unable to do anything beforeMohammed Kudus joined Spurs for £54.5m. The attacker’s departure heaped pressure on the club’s unpopular board. There was cautious optimism when deals for Mads Hermansen, Callum Wilson, Kyle Walker-Peters and El Hadji Malick Diouf went through, but the pressure rose when a dreadful start to the season exposed gaps in midfield. Then the mood lifted, Edson Álvarez’s exit making room for West Ham to sign Mateus Fernandes and Soungoutou Magassa. However, they encountered frustration with their attempts to sign a centre-back on loan to replace Nayef Aguerd, who followed Emerson Palmieri to Marseille on deadline day.JSWolvesRetaining Jørgen Strand Larsen amid sustained interest from Newcastle was a victory for the chairman, Jeff Shi, a target for criticism among supporters. Shi personally informed Strand Larsen, who joined permanently in July, that he would be staying put despite Newcastle’s interest. Better still, Wolves finally have another forward option after a £24m deal for Genk’s Tolu Arokodare. Offloading Fábio Silva and Gonçalo Guedes was also a significant step, but it is difficult to argue Wolves have done sufficient business to avoid another season of struggle after the sales of Matheus Cunha and Rayan Aït-Nouri. Vítor Pereira wanted three signings before the deadline and there is only one piece missing – a midfielder.BFExplore more on these topicsTransfer windowPremier LeagueLiverpoolChelseaArsenalTottenham HotspurEvertonanalysisShareReuse this content"

We brave the hot tents and random ravers to see what they’re likeIman AmraniTue 2 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 07.35 EDTShareAs a DJ plays MJ Cole’s UK garage classic Crazy Love, adults across London’s Cross the Tracks festival lift up little children in brightly coloured ear-defenders to dance. A smile spreads across my baby son’s face as he bounces his body, finding something that looks like rhythm. Later that day, my daughter snuggles into my chest in her carrier as I dance to songs by Ezra Collective that she has heard in the car many times.My mum took me to Reading festival when I was 16 and as I’ve grown up there have been new ones to match the seasons of my life. Then came motherhood: last year I became a single parent to a pair of delicious, curious, boisterous twin babies. But I don’t want to stop indulging my inner child alongside my actual children, and I’m determined to keep music festivals in my life.It’s not just me: Camp Bestival, already firmly family friendly, had an 155% rise in weekend camping tickets for two- to four-year-olds this year. A Ticketmaster study of 2,000 people last month found that 42% of parents see festivals as a genuine alternative to a traditional family holiday, and 73% said festivals were better than other family trips in terms of introducing kids to new cultural experiences. International travel is expensive and daunting, but a festival – while not without its own costs and potential stresses – seems to me to be an enhanced staycation.View image in fullscreenIman and kids get playing in the fields at Green Man festival.Photograph: Kirsty McLachlanSo, buoyed up by my one-day warmup at Cross the Tracks, I decided to embark on two weekend festivals in the countryside. Wilderness, in Oxfordshire, is often described as the poshest festival in Britain, which sounds awful, but the festival’s own promise of “wholesome hedonism” intrigues me. When I arrive, an impressive number of children are being carted around in trolleys filled with pillows and blankets, and lovingly decorated with fairy lights. The effect these kiddie chariots have on the landscape at night is mystical, alongside the light installations set up around the enormous trees.Eloise and Fernand, both in their 30s, have come from south London with their two-year-old son and are staying in the family camping area. Eloise praises the “massive sense of community” with parents posting on a Facebook group for the kid supplies they’re missing, and Fernard calls it “a utopia – it’s almost disarming because everyone’s so nice”.Call me the fairest of fair-weather campers, but I knew that if I was going to really enjoy these weekends and treat them as our holidays for the year, we’d have to be arriving at pre-erected accommodation. These options start at £623 while the furnished one I got hosted in would have set us back £1,600 – but regular family camping tickets cost £238 and kids under six go free.I also brought a pop-up playpen, which saved my life. Hoodies and hats that covered their ears were useful when the temperatures dropped at night and also provided some light protection when the ear defenders weren’t going on. My biggest fear was that the babies would escape the tent, so having their mobility restricted with cosy baby sleep bags was reassuring. The best thing you can bring with you to a festival with little ones, though, is the right attitude. You’ve got to just surrender and adapt to what’s going on; you’re probably not going to make all the sets you might want but that’s not the point any more.Clinical psychologist Dr Martha Deiros Collado is at the book tent on Sunday to speak about her bookHow to Be the Grown-Up. Like the rest of us, she’s let go of routine and nap times for the weekend. “Time is so restrictive of the choices that you make in day to day life,” she says. “But when you’re in a festival like this, responsibility kind of goes out of the window. Obviously you still have to keep an eye on your kids, but there is more freedom.”People ask: why would you go to a festival and dump your children? But it’s not like thatTanya Jelley, Mortimer NanniesParents at festivals are the first to get up, alongside their children: who needs a cockerel when you’ve got two small humans in a hot tent? Early risers at Wilderness head to theFamilyField, a thoughtful, sensory curation of performances, crafts, installations, and a soft play tent for the tiniest ones. It also hosts Mortimer Nannies, who work with Wilderness as well as Camp Bestival and others, and have their own dreamland nursery with fancy dress, crafts and more. “Most people don’t know that festival childcare exists,” says company founder Tanja Jelley. “Or when they do, they ask why you would go to a festival and dump your children. But it’s not like that: it’s two and a half hours where you can just go and breathe for a bit.”At £75 for the four-hour evening sessions, it’s not cheap, but it’s a staff ratio of one-to-one or one-to-two children. There’s also a premium service of private nannies who go out to individual tents or accommodation for £45 an hour looking after up to three children. The food scene is a big thing at Wilderness, and can be similarly expensive: as I’m on the press guest list we are invited to a chef’s table dinner from Andy Beynon of Michelin-starred Hackney restaurant Behind, which is normally £160 a seat. I never spent money like that on food even before I became a single mum, so we enjoy ourselves and no one bats an eyelid when I start breastfeeding.I didn’t want to like the very bougie Wilderness as much as I did – but it really had the wow factor. In future years I would rope in more people to help put tents up, as the best bits for me and the kids were included in the basic ticket: the twins were in awe of everything in the main areas, poking their heads out of the pushchair to get a better view.A few weekends later we head toGreen Manin Wales, where the setting in the valleys of Bannau Brycheiniog (formerly the Brecon Beacons) gives it the edge over every other festival that I’ve been to. The babies bliss out to the South African a cappella group the Joy as the sun shines down, and I take them to dip their little toes in a stream where lots of other kids are doing the same.View image in fullscreen‘A pop-up playpen saved my life!’ Iman and her children in front of the main stage at Green Man.Photograph: Kirsty McLachlanLittle Folk, their version of Wilderness’s Family Field, caters to babies and children up to 12 years old, and there’s a separate area for children above that age. An adult weekend ticket for Green Man is £275 but a week-long “settlement pass” ticket for £350 (with a range of sub-£50 children’s ticket prices depending on age) allows you to turn the festival into a longer family holiday. (Be quick when they go on sale: last year all 25,000 tickets sold out in an hour, 11 months before the event.)Fiona Stewart, the founder of Green Man and a single mother herself, says that across the British festival scene, potential brand partners “are keen on [sponsoring] children’s areas as they want to attract early adopters, and the children’s market is massive”. But Stewart says she dislikes “the way children are manipulated by the media. So Little Folk is a safe friendly space with play, performance, fun and discovery without any of those distractions” – like the whole festival, it’s free from heavy-handed corporate branding.Green Man festival review – Kneecap and CMAT lead the charge in a utopian Welsh idyllRead moreAt both Wilderness and Green Man, the adult world comes more alive as we’re heading to bed, but Stewart explains that striking the balance between families and those who come child-free is about “investing equally in areas for both”. There are corners that cater more directly to the needs of different age groups which helps things feel more cohesive in the shared main spaces. One of my favourite memories of Green Man will be when my twins tottered into the fringes of the Chai Wallahs tent to some soulful house, and a group of adults having a good time started hyping up their dance moves.I’m at an age where half of my peers are having kids and the other half are very much enjoying child-free lives, and it’s heartening to have festivals that don’t try to divide these groups. Someone told me this summer that being a mother is like being part-fairy, part-witch – and the most natural setting for a fairy-witch and her kids is always going to be somewhere we can suspend reality and enjoy the magic like this.Explore more on these topicsMusic festivalsFestivalsGreen ManChildrenParents and parentingFamilyChildcarefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The GuardianOver a few brutal days in March, as sectarian violence and revenge killings tore through parts of Syria, two friends from different communities tried to find a way to surviveByGhaith Abdul-AhadTue 2 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 07.03 EDTShareOn the night of 6 March, Munir, his wife and their two sons, both in their 20s, got no sleep. They huddled together in a small bedroom in their apartment as government troops and militiamen entered their neighbourhood of Qusour in the coastal city of Baniyas and went from house to house. The fighters seemed to be moving through the streets with little coordination. One house might get raided by five separate groups, while others were left untouched. “There was no plan,” Munir said, “just violence and looting.”The first question the fighters were asking when they stormed into an apartment was: “Are you a Sunni or an Alawite?” The answer decided the fate of the residents. Sunnis were spared – although in some cases their apartments were looted. When the raiders found an Alawite home, some stole what they could carry and left; others had come for revenge and would steal first and then shoot. “If one didn’t kill you, the next one might,” Munir said.Munir, a committed Marxist, had spent more than a decade as a prisoner in Bashar al-Assad’s brutal prison system. When the regime ended in December last year, he was jubilant. But Munir is from an Alawite family, the sect that had been associated with the Assad regime since the 1970s. Members of the community had been involved in some of the worst atrocities of the civil war that broke out in 2011, including disappearances, imprisonment and torture. Munir knew that this could not be brushed aside.After Assad’s fall, a climate of fear and uncertainty descended over the countryside around the cities of Homs and Hama, and in the mountain villages. There were daily reports of arbitrary arrests, humiliations at checkpoints, kidnappings and killings. Some of those killed were former regime officers orshabeeha(thugs) accused of past crimes. Others were murdered because of disputes over confiscated lands. In some areas, people displaced by the war returned from years in refugee camps, only to find their homes destroyed and neighbouring Alawite villages thriving. There seemed to be no organised efforts by the forces of the new General Security Service to capture people accused of crimes under the regime. The result was individual acts of revenge, looting and murder by armed gangs.The attacks in Munir’s neighbourhood and all along the coast were the culmination of a series of tit-for-tat raids and attacks. A few days earlier, government troops in pickup trucks had driven through the streets of Baniyas, firing indiscriminately and terrorising local people. On Thursday 6 March, a General Security unit on its way to carry out arrests in an Alawite village in the Latakia countryside was shot at by armed men. That was quickly followed by a wave ofcoordinated attacksby Alawite gunmen, who killed scores of security forces, police and civilians, seizing control of neighbourhoods and public buildings. Not far from Munir’s house, they had attacked two General Security checkpoints at the entrance of Baniyas, killing half a dozen men.Syrian media referred to these gunmen as “foloul” – a term meaning remnants, used initially after the Egyptian revolution of 2011 to describe the vestiges of a defeated regime attempting a comeback. The government mobilised troops and called for reinforcements from armed units elsewhere, before launching a large-scale military operation on the evening of 6 March to regain control.Munir and his family stayed in the apartment right through that Thursday night and the following morning, listening to the gunfire. At around noon on Friday, he received a phone call. It was his nephew, who lived two streets away. He told Munir that gunmen had been knocking on doors in their apartment building. Munir’s brother had opened the door. He was in his 70s and stooping. The gunmen asked if he had any weapons. He answered no. Then they asked if he was Alawite or Sunni. He told them he was Alawite. They had taken him and his son, along with three men from another apartment, up to the roof, where they shot them. The son alone had survived. He managed to crawl back to his apartment to call Munir.“From that moment,” Munir said, “we were waiting for our turn.”Ahmed al-Sharaa, the new ruler of Syria, is tall and eloquent, confident in his new attire of western suits and freshly trimmed beard. At first, he seemed to float on a wave of goodwill. In the early days of his rule, he worked hard to reassure the Syrian people, as well as the outside world, persuade the US to lift sanctions, and start the daunting process of rebuilding the country. He stood before hundreds of rebel commanders, declaring victory and the end of the revolution. He ordered all military factions, including his own, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, to be dissolved and reformed into a new national army, and declared the establishment of a new transitional government. Earlier, reciting words attributed to the prophet Muhammad, he had issued a blanket amnesty to Syrians: “Go, for you are free.”It seemed to be a promise of safe conduct to the regime’s soldiers and officers who had not resisted the rebels – and also, perhaps, an assurance to the Alawite community that had supplied so many of Assad’s loyal forces that they would not be collectively punished.In the early weeks of the new government, Munir hosted meetings in his small apartment, travelled to remote villages and attended funerals and weddings, trying to tell people in his Alawite community that now the former rebels were in power, authority rested with them and the best option was to support them. If this new authority collapsed, he told them, no one else had the power to govern Syria. “By engaging with them, we can gradually help shape the direction of the new state,” he would say. “If we can transition from Assad’s hell without a massive bloodbath, then we should be grateful to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.”But the administration that emerged looked less like a body representing all Syrians and more like a continuation of the tight-knit Islamist group that had ruled the rebel-held areas during the long civil war. After decades of minority rule, the new state was assertive in its Sunni-majority identity. One of the first acts of the transitional government was to purge Alawite employees and workers from state institutions and public services, under the pretext of “eradicating remnants of the former regime”. The army and all security forces, where Alawites held disproportionate influence, were disbanded. Tens of thousands found themselves unemployed, with no source of income.There were plenty who were in no hurry to forget the sectarianism of Assad’s era. When Assad and his family fled, they left behind a ruined country. The scars of 15 years of wars, compounded by decades of authoritarian rule by Assad’s father, Hafez al-Assad, then Assad himself, are everywhere to be seen: the rubble of destroyed cities, a ruined economy, the displacement of half of the country’s population, mass graves and cemeteries holding more than half a million killed. Deep scars have been left by sectarian violence, and anguished families are still searching for the tens of thousands forcibly disappeared. To tell those people that their oppressors were free – without offering the promise of justice – was too much for many of them to bear.View image in fullscreenSyrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa at the opening ceremony of the 62nd Damascus International Fair, 27 August 2025.Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/ReutersIn the city of Homs, I met a former prisoner who had spent 13 years in one of Assad’s jails. He was frail and thin, after recurring bouts of tuberculosis contracted in prison. After a long description of the torture and suffering he endured, he grew livid with anger when I asked him about reconciliation.“What reconciliation? What forgiveness? The massacres the [Alawites] committed in our areas are too horrific to even speak of,” he said. “How can you ask me to forgive? I swear to God, I can’t. I just can’t. If I shake hands with one of them, or sit with one of them, then I would be trading in the blood of my brothers, in the blood of the women they raped and the people they killed and slaughtered.”Others who have suffered at the hands of Assad and his supporters feel differently. To the north, in the village of Houla, where, in 2012, regime paramilitaries from neighbouring Alawite villagesmurdered more than 100 people, mostly women and children, I spoke to a woman who sat on the floor, frail from a long illness, as she slowly and painfully recounted how she hid in a barn for eight hours as the militiamen rampaged and killed. When she returned to her living room, she found the bodies of 15 family members – men, women and children – slaughtered.“Men from our village came to me the other day and told me they had captured a group of men who were among the killers. I told them: what can I do to them? Will killing them bring back my family? What is gone is gone, and God will compensate me for my losses,” she recalled, in a hoarse voice. “Even the other day, when they killed one of the masterminds, I didn’t approve. And why drag his corpse through the street? I am tired. I don’t want to see anyone killed. I don’t want to see one more drop of blood spilled.”Munir, too, was desperate for an end to the violence – and in the early days of the new government, he had believed that such a thing might be possible. But hiding in his apartment, hearing his nephew tell him that he had been shot and his father killed, he recognised that peace was a long, long way off. All he could do was wait, trying to figure out a way to get his family to safety.Around six on Friday evening, they heard the sound of doors being smashed. It came from a motorcycle shop in the neighbouring building. “We told ourselves: ‘Good. If they’re busy looting the shops, maybe they’ll leave us alone for a time.” He began making calls, trying to find someone who could help get him and his family out of the area. First, he contacted a family friend in Idlib, the rebel capital before the fall of Damascus, who said he would do what he could. The friend called back not long after, and said a General Security car was on its way to extract him. Hours passed. Eventually, the friend called again and said the car had broken down. Munir suspected they had been caught in clashes on the outskirts of the city.It was then that he called his friend Anas, a Sunni Muslim from another part of town. He knew that in asking for Anas’s help, he would be asking him to risk his own safety, but he thought that, as a Sunni, Anas had a better chance of negotiating the checkpoints. He also knew that Anas, as much as him, hoped that Syria’s fractured communities could eventually be brought together, and that a fragile, crucial balance between reconciliation and justice could be found. Such a balance, both men knew, would be the only way to determine whether the decades-long cycles of war and trauma could finally come to an end.Imet Munir early in the summer, at his apartment. Thin and bony, he was dressed in shorts and a shapeless T-shirt. The skin on his face was tightly drawn, and his eyes were alternately wide and glaring, or soft and sad, shielded behind a film of tears, at other times narrowing as he stared into the distance. He pulled strands of coarse yellow local tobacco, tucked them into small rolling papers and rolled them into filterless cigarettes, which he smoked greedily between sips of mate, tipping the ash into an old tin can. A soft breeze from the nearby Mediterranean Sea rustled the curtains beside him.I wanted to talk about recent events, but he kept going back in time. I wondered whether, by building an inventory of his generation’s traumas, he was trying to make sense of what happened later.He was born in 1960, into an impoverished Alawite family in the mountains overlooking the coastal cities of Baniyas and Latakia. For centuries, peasants there had been scraping a living in steep and stony terrain. Most were either smallholders working marginal plots or landless sharecroppers bound to absentee landlords. Over the generations, many had been driven by desperation to the Syrian plains, where they worked for Sunni landowners, despised and discriminated against because of their religious beliefs.Witnessing the injustices and poverty surrounding him, from a young age Munir was drawn to rebellion. Like many of his generation’s youth, he drifted towards the militant left. A friend from his village who worked as a journalist in Damascus had introduced him to Marxist reading circles, and Munir would trek many miles to the city to attend a clandestine discussion, or obtain a single copy of a Marxist newspaper. He formed his own cell and began distributing leaflets among peasants in the fields and workers at the nearby oil refinery. Many of his comrades were educated Alawites, who, he told me, were a reservoir of the political left, especially those who didn’t own agricultural land. They saw in education and state employment their only means of social advancement. “Their religious background didn’t pose any hindrance to adopting secular or leftist views,” Munir said. “Alawite doctrine is esoteric. There are no rituals or formal institutions, no visible symbols in daily life to mark someone as an Alawite.”After a short period of democracy in the 1950s, Syria endured two decades of coups and counter-coups. In their struggle for power, a number of military leaders cultivated a patronage network and a circle of loyalists drawn from a particular clan, region, and sect. The rise of Hafez al-Assad, from the Alawite sect, was the culmination of this process. In 1970, he seized power, bringing the Alawites to a position of dominance within the security services and the army.View image in fullscreenA toppled statue of the former Syrian leader Hafez al-Assad in Latakia.Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The GuardianMunir became a schoolteacher in the late 70s, travelling between remote villages, witnessing the extent of the deprivation of mountain peasants. He was confident that only through class struggle could the situation of the rural poor improve. But for many of the Alawite children he was teaching, it was the state, under Hafez’s leadership, that offered a path out of poverty. Often, while registering attendance at his classes in the morning, Munir would ask, “Where’s so-and-so?”, and the students would laugh and say, “Oh, he volunteered for the Saraya militia”, a group led by Hafez’s brother Rifaat. It began to dawn on him that these boys, aged 14 or 15, were being “indoctrinated, brainwashed and shaped” to become the regime’s enforcers.Munir met Anas in the late 90s in Baniyas. They were both outsiders within their own communities, where neither man fitted the role ascribed to him by sect and family. Even during the height of the civil war, when Baniyas fragmented along sectarian lines and fighters from both sides were kidnapped and killed, the two men maintained their friendship.Anas – short, stocky and balding – is a wealthy businessman who hails from a prominent Sunni mercantile family that had owned farmland and warehouses since Ottoman times. For nearly two decades, the two friends met for coffee every day. Around noon, Munir would leave the small apartment that served as his office, crammed with old newspapers, files and boxes; walk down a dim, dank corridor with stained walls and the smell of mould; and enter Anas’s flat, which was larger, neater and filled with sunlight. With a pot of thick Turkish coffee between them, the two men would exchange gossip, discuss books, talk about their sons, or just sit smoking in silence – Anas with his long, slim cigarettes; Munir with his hand-rolled tobacco.Anas grew up in Baniyas, raised by parents who had attended private, western-style schools. They were raised to dress, speak and behave like the European bourgeoisie, and they brought up their son in the same way. When Anas was a child, Alawites had begun migrating from the mountain to his city, driven by poverty, seeking government jobs and education. He remembered how children in his Sunni neighbourhood would chase away those impoverished Alawite peasants with rocks and taunt them.In his own family, religion acquired a more dominant role after the 1967 war with Israel. “I know it’s a cliche,” he said, “but after the defeat, people started saying: we tried the left, we tried pan-Arabism; neither managed to defeat Israel. Let’s try Islam.” That same year, one of his aunts began wearing the hijab, something his family had associated with the “backward” and poor peasants.From the mid-1970s, the Muslim Brotherhood and its military wing, the Fighting Vanguard (al-āli’a al-Muqātila), assumed the mantle of opposition to Hafez al-Assad. The fighting that followed, and Hafez’s brutal repression of the Muslim Brotherhood, resulted in tens of thousands being killed or imprisoned. It culminated in the massacre in 1982, when the regime deployed the army and the predominantly Alawite militias to brutally suppress an uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood. In Hama, about 25,000 people were massacred. This dark history kept the mistrust and fear between Sunnis and Alawites fresh, and the regime exploited it.At 15, Anas was arrested, tortured and sent to jail. To this day, he does not know why. He was not religious; he did not pray or fast. He thinks perhaps someone passed him a book, or maybe he was swept up in the larger crackdown against Sunnis under the guise of fighting the Muslim Brotherhood. “Thousands were arrested just for being from a particular family or Sunni neighbourhood, or because their relative was in the Muslim Brotherhood,” Anas said. “Or for reading a book, saying a word or attending a religious lesson. Being a Sunni made you a suspect.” He was one of 120 people shackled together and seen by a judge for a minute or two before receiving their sentences. He believes that only six or seven were members of the Brotherhood. After a few months in prison, Anas started praying, and in two years, he had memorised the Qur’an and become a staunch believer.View image in fullscreenResidents of Homs walk among the ruins of the city.Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The Guardian“Don’t be surprised,” he said, “because if you put Richard Dawkins – do you know him? – if you put him in the middle of that bleak prison amongst the believers, he will become a believer,” Anas chuckled. “Because you are in isolation, you have nothing beyond the 0.3 sq metres, that is your space. If a war breaks out, you don’t know; if a prime minister is assassinated, you don’t know; if an earthquake hits a faraway region and hundreds of thousands die, you don’t know. Death was our daily companion. We had tuberculosis, cholera, scabies. I was lucky that when I was tortured and beaten, I didn’t receive deadly blows, just broken ribs. I lost consciousness many times, but I didn’t lose an eye or have a brain haemorrhage.”By the time he was released in 1992, Anas had become a fully fledged Islamic fundamentalist, refusing to listen to music or watch TV, speaking the language of jihad. But his religious conviction faded with the years. By the time he met Munir, he was more moderate in his thinking.Munir had been dismissed from his teaching job in the mid-80s. Soon after, he was arrested along with his two brothers for their political activities. Officers searching their house found a schoolbook belonging to their younger sister, in which she had gouged out Hafez al-Assad’s eyes in a photograph. She was arrested too. Even the girl Munir was in love with was detained.In prison, torture sessions lasted for up to 12 hours. “We wanted death to come quickly, just to end the torture,” Munir recalled. “You weren’t even screaming any more, but some of us were crying out: ‘Oh, mother … I beg you, mother … I beg you, let the pain stop!’ What we experienced was not only physical torture, but a spiritual, political and moral defeat.”When Munir came out of prison in 1993, he found that Hafez al-Assad’s security regime had not only crushed the intellectuals and political dissidents, but also arrested thousands of university students. The Communist party had died and the Muslim Brotherhood had been dismantled. “There were no more political forces, because when you’re imprisoned for 15 years you’re effectively erased,” he said. Syria entered a state of political desertification, and that, for him, explained a lot of what would happen later.As we talked, Munir was sitting on an old, threadbare sofa, its wooden armrests smoothed by years of use. He stood up, his figure slightly bent, and walked to the edge of a curtain-covered balcony, which overlooked an intersection marked by a large mulberry tree. Over that weekend in March, he said: “That tree became the gunmen’s main gathering point. From here, we could see them moving around. Sometimes, they’d fire an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] at a storage room door to blow it open, setting the building on fire.”During Friday prayers, Sunni preachers called for “Faz’a”, a rallying cry to arms, and protesters poured out of mosques in Idlib, Homs, Hama and Damascus, demanding arms and vengeance for slain security personnel. That’s when the next wave of violence descended on Munir’s neighbourhood; it was anyone with a gun – many driven by sectarian rage, revenge and fear, he told me. Some of these armed civilians were from areas that had suffered massacres by the Assad regime, and they were afraid Assad might stage a comeback.The gunmen broke into shops and ground-floor apartments, firing at civilians and loading their loot into pickup trucks. Munir’s second brother called and told him that his house had been raided. Armed men asked him: “What will you give to save your life?” He gave them his car keys and they left.Munir took his two sons and made them climb up into a small storage nook under the kitchen ceiling. He begged them to stay in there, whatever happened.“When the killing started [on 6 March], at first we did not think of leaving the area,” Munir’s wife, Wassan, said as she entered the room, carrying a tray with a pot of Turkish coffee and small cups. She placed it on the table between us and sat on the sofa next to Munir. She wore pink pyjamas under a bathrobe and was calm and serene, with a round face, large glasses and a soft voice. Her manner was the opposite of Munir’s animated, wide-eyed gesticulating.View image in fullscreenSecurity forces loyal to the interim Syrian government ride in the back of a vehicle in Latakia, 9 March 2025.Photograph: Omar Haj Kadour/AFP/Getty Images“Why would we leave?” she added. “We had nothing to do with those attacks on security forces, nor did we have any weapons or anything like that.”In a quiet voice, she said that during Friday night, as they waited for the fighters to storm into their apartment, she decided to gather all their valuables, and whatever money they had, laying them out on the table. “We thought maybe this way they would think that they don’t need to waste time searching the apartment and hopefully they wouldn’t discover the boys,” she said. “I looked for anything of value, but all I could find was a gold wedding band, a bracelet, and 300,000 Syrian pounds, about 20 dollars.” She laughed with embarrassment, like someone who had failed to offer her guests proper hospitality.Sectarian massacres had happened here before, Munir told me. Again, he seemed compelled to talk about the past. The Syrian uprising that followed a wave of anti-government protest across the Arab world in 2011 had unleashed violent crackdowns.“The Alawites saw the revolution as an existential threat,” he said. They started sending their young men to volunteer for the National Defence Forces – death squads that served alongside the army to crush the uprising.Before the revolution, Munir had been seen as a member of a harmless leftist opposition. After it, he was perceived as a threat to his community. Playing on historical traumas of past oppressions and massacres, the regime message was clear: if Bashar al-Assad falls, this will be your fate.His neighbours suspected him of plotting with the armed rebels, and assaulted him and his family members. For weeks, he was unable to leave the housefor fear of being attacked. “If my son had to go to the corner shop,” he said, “I would hold my breath until he returned.”A few weeks after the revolution, Munir had to abandon Baniyas and seek shelter in his village, where he felt safer. The houses of his extended family were clustered together, and he was surrounded by brothers and cousins who protected him, even if not all of them agreed with his politics. He stayed for a couple of months, but there, too, he was too scared to leave the house because of death threats, both from regime loyalists and the neighbours.He knew his name was on a regime detention list, but in May that year he had to return to the city because of the children’s schooling and his wife’s job. Less than an hour after his return, men from the regime’s security service knocked on his door. One of them, holding a rifle, ordered him to come with them. He was taken first to the political security branch, and from there he was transferred to the city’s newly built, but not yet inaugurated, football stadium, which had been converted into a detention centre. Thousands of men, nearly all the male population of the city, were rounded up and herded in there.What he saw in the stadium still haunts him to this day – not the torture or beatings, but the smell. He dropped his cigarette as he described how the young men were sitting in lakes of excrement. “Everyone was shackled, some for 10 days straight, forced to relieve themselves where they sat, while still handcuffed. There were no toilets, just pools of shit.” He repeated the word a few times. “At night, regime thugs would come torturing and beating the detainees, cursing mothers, sisters, God and religion. They did it simply to entertain themselves.”He was released a few days later, but was rearrested after his faction of the communist party affirmed its support of the revolution and elected him a member of the political council. This time, he was led into the military intelligence branch, and while he waited for the clerk to register his name and ID, he was beaten with electrical cables until he fell unconscious.On the evening of Friday 7 March, when Anas got the call from Munir, he had no idea how he could help get him out of the area. The fact he was Sunni gave him some protection, but he didn’t know the men roaming the streets, and they didn’t know him. As the two huddled in their apartments, one in a Sunni and the other in an Alawite part of town, they watched a massacre unfold, on a par with some of the worst days of the war. Anas wondered whether he would ever see his friend again.On Saturday morning,the sound of gunfire resumed, and Munir began making frantic phone calls. The wife of his second brother, the one whose car had been taken the night before, called to say that a different group of fighters had dragged her husband and his son, a 35-year-old schoolteacher, up to the rooftop along with two neighbours, and shot them all.Under the mulberry tree in front of the house, the fighters had brought a man and put him up against the wall. “Over there, near the tree,” Munir said, pointing. “They sprayed him with bullets. Then one of them kicked him with his boot to make sure he was dead.”View image in fullscreenSyrian security forces detain a man in Latakia, 8 March 2025.Photograph: Mohamad Daboul/EPAEarly that morning, Anas received a call from his old university professor, pleading for help. “He was a friend. His son was an engineer who had worked in my office. His other son was a judge. Like me, they had liberal, progressive views. He called me at 7.30 or 8 in the morning and asked me for help. By then I had found a route into the area.” Anas called Munir. “Get ready,” he said. “I’ll be right under the building in two minutes.”Munir and his family were too scared to even look from the balcony to check if the car was there, afraid the gunmen across the street might spot them. “I told my wife and the kids: ‘We’re going to take the risk.’ We went downstairs. When we reached the building entrance, I left them inside and poked my head out, just a little. I saw the car.” Munir yelled at his family to move. “‘Ya Allah,’ we said, and we ran as fast as we could and jumped into the car.”Anas also sent a car to his professor’s house. He called the professor to tell him. When the professor heard the sound of a car approaching, he and his wife, their two sons and their wives, rushed downstairs and into the street – but it wasn’t Anas’s car. When they realised their mistake, they ran back into the building, but gunmen got out of the car and followed them inside. They shot the professor and two of his sons. The gunmen told the women: “We will spare you so that you die of grief.”Anas’s car pulled up two minutes later. It picked up the survivors, who arrived at Anas’s house – some in a state of shock, some hysterical. By then, a third family had arrived. They had survived a similar ordeal and were also in a desperate state. Anas begged the more than a dozen people gathering in his apartment to be silent, lest the neighbours hear their cries and denounce them.As far as he knew, he was the only person helping the Alawites escape, and he was scared. “Some families stayed for two or three days, but the professor’s family stayed for 10 days; they were too scared to leave.”Anas heard the government spokesman announcing on Saturday evening that the situation was back to normal and that the streets were clear of corpses, but he did not believe it. It later came to light that the killing had continued to the end of Sunday. On Monday, Anas drove Munir back to his home and continued to the professor’s house.The streets were deserted, ground-floor shops were gutted and burnt black cavities spewed faint trails of smoke. Some buildings were still being looted. He found the professor’s body at the entrance to his building, next to those of his two sons. Further down was the body of the professor’s sister, who had been killed a day before him. It was early March and the nights were cold, yet the bodies were beginning to fester and reek. “I walked through the building. There were four apartments. In each, I saw two or three bodies,” Anas said.He called the Red Crescent. When they arrived, he joined them in collecting the dead, then followed them to the cemetery. “I stayed there until six in the evening, performing the burial rituals, as there were no men from that family present.”It was an Alawite cemetery, and he was surprised to see that most of the people gathered there were Sunnis, people who had also been sheltering Alawite families and were now helping the survivors bury their dead. “Maybe that’s the only positive thing that came out of this massacre,” Anas said.I asked him if he was ever scared. Of course I was, he said. “When I brought the families to my building, I told them not to make noise or even turn on the lights. The night before, on the Friday, when I wanted to bring a family and put them up in my brother’s house, the neighbours refused and told me: if you bring Alawites here, we will denounce you.“By Monday morning, we realised that the whole of Baniyas had been sheltering families. I wouldn’t be exaggerating if I told you that 60% of the Alawite neighbourhood was in our neighbourhood.“Every family around here survived because a Sunni family took care of us,” Munir said.“I don’t believe all this crap about martyrdom and life after death,” said Anas. “I spent 15 years in jail with the jihadis. Humanity – humanity is the only power that is bigger than fear.”View image in fullscreenA cafe on the ground floor of a ruined building in HomsPhotograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The GuardianAnas was sitting on the sofa next to Munir, whose wife had gone to the kitchen to make another pot of coffee. In his pressed short-sleeve shirt and slacks, the man who braved checkpoints to rescue victims of organised violence resembled a bank manager in a provincial town. He spoke in a measured voice, elegant in its Levantine refinement but devoid of emotion, like someone auditing a financial report.When Hafez al-Assad became the president in 1971, Anas said, he inflicted disaster on the Alawites. He used the sect to enact violence on his opponents, and the sect would take the blame for it. “It was in prison that I realised that they, the Alawites, had been oppressed as a community. They were mistreated as peasants, so they wanted to take their revenge when Hafez came to power, and now the others wanted to take their revenge. If we continue in this cycle, it will be people like me and Munir who will be destroyed.”The cement company that paid millions to Isis: was Lafarge complicit in crimes against humanity?Read moreOn 9 March, in his second address to the nation since the beginning of the massacres, president Sharaa promised a national inquiry to investigate the events of the weekend. On 22 July, the government released its report on the massacres. It identified 1,426 victims – 238 from the security forces and the rest civilians – and promised to “bring the perpetrators to justice”. It said there were 298 suspects. Any attempt toclaim the killings as sectarian in nature were rejected; they were described as acts of revenge, devoid of ideology.Over the phone in mid-August, Munir told me that intimidation, kidnappings and assassinations of Alawites had not stopped, though attention had moved on. Sectarian fighting had broken out elsewhere.In mid-July, a feud between a Druze farmer and Bedouin tribesmen in southern Syria spiralled into clashes between the two communities. When government forces intervened, the violence widened into new sectarian battles, including summary executions of Druze civilians. Israel, which had intensified its attacks on Syria since the fall of the Assad regime, intervened on the side of the Druze, bombing Damascus and government positions. The government promised another report.“Yesterday the Alawites, today the Druze, tomorrow maybe the Kurds,” Munir said. “Without a coherent new social contract for Syria, the killings will continue.”Munir and Anas are pseudonymsListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readSyriaBashar al-AssadMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

A smaller number were arrested, detained and wrongly deported to countries they had left decades earlier.Rudd stepped down afterthe Guardian revealedshe had set herself targets for deporting irregular migrants despite having told MPs that she had not done so. Many at the time blamed the Home Office’s attempts to create what May as home secretary had called “a really hostile environmentfor illegal migrants”.View image in fullscreenUnder Theresa May, the Home Office’s tactics included the use of ‘go home’ advertising vans.Photograph: Home Office/PAExperts and former government advisers liken some of the government’s moves in recent days to the clampdown that May oversaw when she ran the Home Office.On Monday Coopertold the Commonsshe would not let those who had refugee status bring their family into the UK until spring 2026, by which time she would have set new rules over family reunions.She also said she would change the process by which those whose asylum claims had been turned down could appeal against that judgment. Instead of going before a court, the government is planning to set up a panel of trained members of the public who will hear such cases, under the guidance of legal professionals.On Tuesday the home secretary said she waslooking athousing asylum seekers in industrial sites such as warehouses as a potential way to end the use of hotels, which have attracted protests throughout the summer.Keir Starmer meanwhile hosted a ministerial meeting on Tuesday afternoon to discuss a range of solutions to bring down the number of asylum cases. Downing Street said one of the options being examined was digital ID cards to help keep track of people once they entered the country.Starmer has also mounted an aggressive social media campaign to get his message across. Inone tweet, sent alongside a series of images of young black men apparently being detained, he said: “If you come to this country illegally, you will face detention and return.”The Home Officehas launchedits own campaign to contact about 130,000 students and their families, warning them they will be forced to leave the UK if they have no legal right to remain. That move, along withintensified raidson workplaces in an attempt to find undocumented migrants, has been compared to the controversial “go home” vans that May’s Home Office ran in 2013.View image in fullscreenRudd stepped down as home secretary in April 2018 thenresigned the Tory whipand her post as work and pensions secretary in September 2019.Photograph: Alastair Grant/APRudd said some of the steps being taken now would not even have been contemplated by May. “This wouldn’t have happened under Theresa May,” she said.But Rudd said she was supportive of Cooper’s attempts to bring asylum numbers down, saying: “We are in a very different world now. When I was home secretary in 2018, 300 people came across the Channel, and we returned another 300. We now have an industry of people-traffickers which has been set up to get people across on a much larger scale.”One former Home Office adviser said Cooper’s new regime was a continuation of what the department had been trying for years. “We are not returning to a hostile environment; we never left it,” they said. “It is the definition of madness – doing the same thing and expecting a different result.”Cooper herself has sought to distance her response from that of her Conservative predecessors. On Tuesday she criticised the previous government’s Rwanda scheme, saying ministers had “spent £700m and sent four volunteers after running it for two years”.Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said Cooper’s approach differed from May’s in that she still stressed the importance of compassion, as well as control. But he warned that Starmer’s social media posts risked undercutting that message: “There is a real risk that the way things are being communicated by the prime minister on social media does sound like the hostile environment message.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeYvette CooperAmber RuddConservativesTheresa MayLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Treasury officials pointed to similar increases in yields on Tuesday in Germany, the US and France.But with the government already spending more than £100bn a year in interest on the UK’s debts, the latest jump highlighted the extent to which the government feels constrained by the bond markets.The 10-year gilt yield, which the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) uses to forecast future government borrowing costs, also rose on Tuesday, hitting its highest level since January.Meanwhile the pound weakened, falling by more than 1.5 cents against the US dollar to $1.3390, its worst day since early April, when Donald Trump launched his global trade war.Fall in value of the poundThese latest market jitters followeda shake-up of key figures inside No 10that was widely read at Westminster as an attempt by Keir Starmer to get a firmer grip on economic policy.This included poaching Reeves’s deputy, Darren Jones, to a new role as Starmer’s “chief secretary” and appointing a heavyweight new economic adviser, the former Bank of England deputy governor Minouche Shafik.How can the UK avoid trouble in the gilts market? | Sushil WadhwaniRead moreConcern that the chancellor is being “managed out” is weighing on UK government bonds, suggested Kathleen Brooks, the research director at XTB.“The last time there was a threat to Reeves’s position, back in early July, bond yields jumped as the market worried that she could be replaced by a more left-leaning member of theLabourparty,” Brooks said.The chancellor was filmed in tears in the House of Commons chamber in July, briefly prompting bond yields to rise as investors speculated she could be replaced with a more spendthrift alternative.Brooks confirmed that the UK was “not an outlier” in bond markets for the moment, but added: “As we lead up to the budget, the chancellor’s options are narrowing, and we could see more frequent bursts of bond market volatility. While we are not quite at Liz Truss levels of stress in the UK bond market, the ‘Starmer moment’ for markets could be coming down the line.”Reeves has argued that her fiscal rules, which some Labour MPs feel unnecessarily limit the government’s scope for action, reflect real-world limits on investors’ appetite for the UK’s debt.The rules, which apply in five years’ time, require her to balance day-to-day spending with tax receipts and reduce debt as a share of GDP.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This has likely facilitated a move higher in yields in the UK, notwithstanding the global move in long-end yields,” Jennings said.The Treasury is keen to damp down some of this speculation.Bank shares fell sharply last Fridayafter suggestions of a tax on the highly profitable sector. Ministers are also believed to beexamining options for taxing property more heavily.Officials insist that tax changes will be focused on boosting economic efficiency, while Reeves’s central focus will remain improving the UK’s lacklustre productivity.It is a downgrade of the OBR’s forecasts for future productivity – the amount UK workers can produce in an hour, and a key determinant of economic growth – that is expected to weigh on its budget projections.The institution’s expectations for productivity are more optimistic than those of many other forecasters, and have repeatedly been disappointed in the recent past.Any shortfall against Reeves’s fiscal rule appears unlikely to be closed through significant spending cuts, after a backbench rebellion forced Downing Street to abandon plans for £5bn of disability cuts earlier this year.While bond prices fell on Tuesday, traders piled in to precious metals in a flight to safety. This pushedthe gold price up to a new record highof $3,508 (£2,607) an ounce on Tuesday, while silver rose over $40 an ounce for the first time since 2011.Anxiety over fiscal sustainability is another factor hitting the bond market, withDonald Trump’s recent tax cuts and spending billexpected to add trillions of dollars to the US national debt. Trump’s recent attacks on the independence of the central bank, the Federal Reserve, have also rattled investors.Explore more on these topicsGiltsBondsGovernment borrowingRachel ReevesEconomic policyEconomicsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

It fulfils a pledgeLabour included in its manifestofor last year’s general election.“How can we expect children to do well at school if they have the equivalent of a double espresso in their system on a daily basis?”, saidWes Streeting, the health secretary.“Energy drinks might seem harmless but the sleep, concentration and wellbeing of today’s kids are all being impacted, while high sugar versions damage their teeth and contribute to obesity.”Shops, cafes, restaurants and websites will be prohibited from selling energy drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to anyone under 16. That will affect drinks such as Red Bull, Monster, Relentless and Prime Energy and force their makers to reformulate their products.For example, a 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine, the same as one espresso or two cans of cola. Tea, coffee and soft drinks containing lower amounts of caffeine will be unaffected.It is unclear when sales to under-16s – including from vending machines – will become illegal. The ban will be done using secondary legislation under the Food Safety Act 1990.Supermarkets voluntarily stopped selling the drinks to under-16s in 2018. But some smaller convenience stores still allow under-16s to buy them. Drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre already carry warning labels that they are “not suitable for children”.“High-caffeine energy drinks have no place in children’s hands. This is a common sense, evidence-based step to protect children’s physical, mental and dental health”, said Katharine Jenner, the director of theObesity Health Alliance.The success of preventing young people buying alcohol and cigarettes showed that age-based restrictions work, Jenner added. “Age-of-sale policies like this have a proven record of reducing access to products that are not suitable for children.”Teachers have voiced concern about how energy drinks have left young children “bouncing off the walls in lesson time” after consuming them on their way to school.Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said the move would help tackle the “scourge of poor classroom behaviour”, which is caused in part by “the harmful effects of caffeine-loaded drinks”.Research by the NASUWT unionfound 71% of teachers worry about pupils misusing energy drinks at school and 70% while elsewhere.“The drinks create a situation in which pupils can’t focus, can’t sit still and just think it’s cool to drink them”, one teacher said. Another said: “Energy drinks make it very difficult for students to focus and engage with learning and seem to make students noisier and agitated.”Matt Wrack, the union’s general secretary, said under-16s will still be able to get the drinks from parents or other adults, despite the ban.Dentists urged the government to go further. The ban should be extended to include zero and low-sugar energy drinks to help tackle tooth decay, the British Dental Association said.“Products that are habit-forming, highly acidic and can contain over 20 teaspoons of sugar have no place on the menu for children”, said Eddie Crouch, the association’s chair.Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition and head of research and impact at Action on Sugar, said trading standards officers would have to enforce the ban to ensure it worked.Gavin Partington, the director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said firms do not market or promote the drinks to under-16s.He added: “Our members have led the way in self-regulation through our longstanding energy drinks code of practice.“Our members do not market or promote the sale of energy drinks to under-16s and label all high-caffeine beverages as ‘not recommended for children’, in line with and in the spirit of this code.“As with all government policy, it’s essential that any forthcoming regulation is based on a rigorous assessment of the evidence that’s available.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryYoung peopleHealthObesityWes StreetingHealth & wellbeingNutritionnewsShareReuse this content"

The consortium is calledLondon& Valley Water.It wants to use about £20.5bn of consumers’ cash to prioritise key activities but deliver fewer projects than under a deal set out by water regulator Ofwat.People familiar with the London & Valley Water proposal said last year’sfinal determination– the highly detailed plan of how much suppliers can charge consumers – was not deliverable and the new plan offered value for money.They said the new plan would make Thames viable and avoid putting the UK’s largest water company, which serves 16 million consumers, into a form of temporary nationalisation.The four-page summary of the plan describes “significant writeoffs by investors across the capital structure” but does not yet detail how significant these will be. Instead, it will “fix the foundations of Thames Water and set a clear pathway to addressing current compliance gaps”.The financial setup for Thames proposed by the creditors, including how much of a haircut investors will take on the debt, is being discussed with Ofwat this week.The proposal will then be submitted to credit ratings agencies to see if it would bring the water company back into investment grade territory, a requirement of its operating licence.Ofwat had agreed to defer a referral by Thames to the Competition and Markets Authority of the bill increases it had allowed in December last year. This deferral lasts until October, leaving a bargaining window in which to try to agree an alternative option.Some insiders at Ofwat said the plan amounted to a partial rewrite of the final determination but that this was all but inevitable in the pursuit of a market-based solution for the beleaguered water company.It has not been revealed how much money, alongside the £20.5bn from consumers, will be provided by the consortium.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is in relation to posts on X.“After being taken to police custody, officers became concerned for his health and he was taken to hospital. His condition is neither life-threatening nor life-changing. He has now been bailed pending further investigation.“The arrest was made by officers from the MPS aviation unit. It is routine for officers policing airports to carry firearms. These were not drawn or used at any point during the arrest.”Legal and regulatory oversight of social media posts in the UK has become an increasingly contentious political topic on both sides of the Atlantic. US officials haveexpressed concerns over the Online Safety Actand the country’s vice-president, JD Vance, has said the UK is going down a “very dark path” oflosing free speech.The case of Lucy Connolly, a British woman who was jailed after last summer’s riots for a post on X calling on people to set fire to hotels housing asylum seekers,has become a cause célèbre for the right.The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, has said he will raise Connolly’s case in an appearance on Wednesday at the House judiciary committee in Washington, where has been asked to testify about online regulation in the UK and Europe. Connolly, who was jailed for two years and seven months, wasreleased last month.Linehan’s arrest prompted a backlash from various figures, including author JK Rowling and opposition politicians.Downing Street declined to comment directly on the arrest. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said the arrest was “an operational matter for the police”. He added: “The prime minister and the home secretary have been clear about where their priorities for crime and policing are, and that’s tackling antisocial behaviour, shoplifting, street crime, as well as reducing serious violent crimes like knife crime and violence against women.”He also rejected Rowling’s claim that the UK was engaging in “totalitarianism”.Rowling had earlier attacked Linehan’s arrest, in a post on X asking what the UK had become. The tech billionaire Elon Musk reposted Rowling’s tweet, adding: “Police state.”Opposition politicians also criticised the arrest. Former shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick called it “ridiculous and a complete waste of police time”.Shadow cabinet minister Claire Coutinho said: “You live in a society? Occasionally you’re going to be offended. That’s how it works.”Labour backbencher Jonathan Hinder said the arrest showed the need for a “serious reset to get the priorities right” in policing, while Independent MP Rupert Lowe said: “I stand with Linehan.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

In response, its committee chair, the historian Lars Trägårdh, said that Sweden needs to embrace “democratic nationalism”, telling Swedish television last week that since the second world war Swedish culture had been characterised by modernism, internationalism and multiculturalism. “They have turned their gaze away from Swedish culture and the Swedish nation,” he told SVT’s 30 Minutes.The ‘big church move’: Swedish town begins to roll historic building 5kmRead moreThe list is divided into 11 categories, including poems, music, economy, religion and inventions, and encompasses places, laws and even concepts.It features Lilla Hyttnäs, the cottage in Darlarna that belonged to artists Karin and Carl Larsson; Hilma af Klint’s Målningar till templet (Paintings for the temple); Stockholm city hall, designed by Ragnar Östberg; and two songs by Gothenburg troubadour Evert Taube.It also takes in cross-country ski race Vasaloppet, Systema naturae by naturalist Carl von Linné, Kakelungnen (a popular 18thcentury heating stove) and Lappkodicillen, the 1751 agreement that recognised that Sámi people have the right to move freely between Sweden and Norway.With the exception of one of Sweden’s first synagogues, Marstrand, the religion category is dominated by Christian entries, despite Sweden’s Muslim population. It does, however, include Nattvardsgästerna (Winter Light), Bergman’s 1963 film about a priest in existential crisis, and the Swedish church’s 1958 decision to allow women to be priests.The Swedish Arabic news site Alkompis noted that the list did not include any Islamic landmarks. “Sweden’s first mosque, Nasir Mosque, was built in Gothenburg in 1976, 49 years ago,” it said.The decision to create a Swedish cultural canon was part of the coalition agreement for the Moderates-led government, which depends on the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats. The project has been the subject of heated debate ever since the investigation was commissioned in 2023, and has been criticised by the Swedish Academy, the Swedish Writers’ Association and members of Sweden’s national minorities, a group which includes Indigenous Sámi people.Additionally, the committee invited the public to create an online “people’s canon” which received about 10,000 submissions, including rapper Silvana Imam, whose music includes songs protesting against racism and the far-right Sweden Democrats, and the kebab pizza, one of Sweden’s favourite dishes. Neither features in the official canon.Former Swedish security adviser on trial for allegedly mislaying classified papersRead moreTrägårdh said at a press conference at Uppsala University on Tuesday that Sweden’s canon should be a “moving object” to be regularly updated and “something that creates rich possibilities for all to be successful people in modern Swedish society.”Marlen Eskander, the founder of the Reading Promotion Institute, who left the committee last year, described the canon as “very exclusionary”.“Setting a 50-year limit is deliberately excluding contemporary experiences,” she told news outlet Svenska Dagbladet, adding that Sweden had undergone huge changes since 1975.Anita Kitok, head of language and culture for Sametinget, Sweden’s Sámi parliament, said: “Sametinget has not been involved in the cultural canon so I do not have any comments about the result or the process.”The canon announcement comes at a time of heightened identity politics in Sweden that have seen the far-right flourish amid an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment, in part through nostalgic messaging and by connecting immigration and criminality, which has since become a mainstream narrative.The Swedish culture minister, Parisa Liljestrand, rejected criticism of the project, saying: “The canon project has been attributed with intentions that never existed anywhere else except possibly in the critics’ imagination.”She denied that the canon marked a victory for the Sweden Democrats’ culture politics. “That is the absolutely worst way to see this. This is a project that is about inclusion,” she said.One critic said the outcome was “laughable”. “You can’t get away from the thought that AI could have suggested it,” wrote Björn Wiman in Dagens Nyheter.Explore more on these topicsSwedenEuropeAbbaIngmar BergmanAugust StrindbergnewsShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday Nigel Farage plans to raise her case with allies of Donald Trump on a visit to the US Congress, as “a symbol of Keir Starmer’s authoritarian, broken, two-tier Britain”.The US has criticised the UK’s Online Safety Act, which aims to regulate online content and will affect social media companies – most of which are headquartered there. The vice-president, JD Vance, said the UK government was going down a “very dark path” over free speech.The White House previously said it was “monitoring” Connolly’s case back in May, adding that the US “remains concerned about infringements on freedom of expression”.Connolly was arrested and charged with distributing material with the intention of stirring up racial hatred, which carries a maximum seven-year sentence. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years and seven months in prison, but served less than a year.She would later portray it as something that could happen to anyone. But court documents tell a different story about Connolly, who had repeatedly made what the judge in her trial described as “racist remarks” in multiple social media posts.This included a comment on a video posted by Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, of a black man being attacked. Robinson claimed this was for masturbating in public, and Connolly responded “Somalian, I guess. Loads of them”, followed by a vomiting emoji.Another tweet, five days after the Southport murders, implied “illegal boat invaders” were “unvetted criminals” and would lead to people being “attacked, butchered, raped”.In the case she was jailed for, evidence was shown in court that she deleted the post after it had been viewed 310,000 times and reposted 940 times, and only when she became aware of the public backlash.She told a friend the post had “bit me on the arse lol” and that if she was caught she would “play the mental health card”.The fact that someone only days later actually did set fire to a hotel housing asylum seekers seemed to be of no significance to Connolly, who had “little insight into, or acceptance of, her actions”, according to the judge who rejected her appeal. She believed she had personally been made an example of by Starmer.Her husband, Raymond Connolly, later accused the prime minister of having “picked” his wife as “the poster girl of the far right”. Connolly herself has done little to discourage this.In the only two interviews Connolly took part in after her release from prison, with Dan Wootton, the former GB News presenter, and Allison Pearson, a Telegraph correspondent, she denied being far right, going on to use a tactic that is becoming more common: denying the concept even exists.To Wootton, she said: “In fact, this far-right thing is just not even a thing, is it really? Let’s face it.”He replied: “It’s a way to deride patriots.” Connolly responded: “It is.”Money hadbegun flowing towards Connolly from the rightearly on, with the legal expenses for her appeal paid by the populist Tory peer Toby Young’s Free Speech Union.Patriotic Alternative, a far-right group, said they sent her family £1,000. And almost £170,000 has been raised to date in a public campaign through a fundraising platform run by Reclaim the Media, an organisation set up by the far-right agitator Laurence Fox.Politicians on the hard right have rallied round Connolly, keen to seize on her case as evidence of a hypocritical “two-tier” justice system, a conspiracy theory that white or right-wing people are treated more harshly by authorities.Gavin Phillipson, professor of law at University of Bristol said: “It’s so selective, people just seize on one or two cases and then build a whole narrative about two-tier justice on that without looking at the overall picture.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Israel Defense Forces began mobilising tens of thousands of reservists on Tuesday after calling up 60,000 for an expanded offensivein Gaza City, one of the few places in the devastated territory outside its control. More will be ordered to report to military bases if the fighting continues for many months, as analysts expect.Many reservists interviewed by the Guardian last week said they would face “a hard choice” when asked to serve again, citing personal and ideological reasons. Few said they would refuse the call-up, however.“We are willing to give up our lives … but the obvious truth is that we are dying now for no reason,” said Aviad Yisraeli, a combat medic who was inGazalast month. “Militarily, there is nothing more to gain … but then it also seems a bad choice to end this war with Hamas with some part of power in Gaza and [holding] some of the hostages and with the kibbutzim [in southern Israel] still vulnerable. So these are hard questions.”Many oppose the coalition government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and want the war to end now to bring back hostages still held by Hamas.“I never trusted [this government] … Every time I’ve gone back to serve since March 2024, I’ve gone with a heavy heart,” said a 47-year-old paratrooper who has served 450 days since the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023 in which militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted 250. “So if I go, it will be out of commitment to my battalion – because it’s like family, and I feel a huge responsibility toward them.”View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers mourn over the coffin of Reei Biran, an army captain reportedly killed in combat in the southern Gaza Strip in July.Photograph: Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty ImagesA poll in July found thatthree-quarters of Israelisfavoured a deal to release the hostages and more than half said Netanyahu’s war leadership had been bad.More than 63,000 people, mainly civilians, have been killed by the Israeli offensive in Gaza and most of the 2.3 million population have been displaced many times. Much of the Palestinian territory has been reduced to rubble.Polling last week showed that nearly three-quarters of Jewish Israelis partly or totally agreed withthe claim madeby Israel’s government that “there are no innocents in Gaza”.The paratrooper said: “After 7 October, I didn’t feel much conflict with Palestinian suffering … Gaza deserved to be struck for what happened on 7 October. I lived with that – the hostages come first. But still, their suffering weighs on me, even if less.”Many reservists, like many Israelis, remain fully supportive of the offensive and said they had no doubts whatsoever that they should obey any draft orders.“It is a long war but we have no alternative,” said Erez Eshel, a reservist colonel who has done 550 days of duty in the conflict. “Is it tiring? Yes. Is it painful? Yes. But for the sake of Israel and for the sake of democracies all around the world, there is no way we can stop in the middle.”Eshel, who lives in the occupied West Bank and has three children serving in the IDF, added: “We are in a world war, a clash of civilisations … [and] when you speak to our warriors you get an answer of strength.”Reservists constitute about 70% of the IDF’s full strength and about half of some combat units, experts say.Reserve duty, like conscription, is a cultural institution among those eligible, mainly Jewish Israelis and some minorities. Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, the chief of staff of the IDF, last week described them as a “precious natural resource”.View image in fullscreenA protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and for a ceasefire in the war in Gaza.Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty ImagesBut the huge demands of the conflict in Gaza, which has mobilised hundreds of thousands, with some serving up to 700 days, is unprecedented.Many reservists have seen businesses and marriages collapse and about 12% show signs of PTSD, according toa recent survey. The cost to the economy is high. Such strains have sharpened divisions over the refusal of Israel’s ultra-Orthodox community to serve in the military.“We cannot accept a situation in which not all parts of society bear the burden. Conscripts, career soldiers, and tens of thousands of reservists embody the deepest expression of Israeli solidarity,” said Zamir while touring Gaza last week.An unknown number of reservists avoid or postponejoining their unitsby telling commanders that they are sick or wounded or by simply explaining that they fear for their relationships or businesses.“The number who refuse officially is very low at the moment but you can decide you don’t want to go to war for all sorts of reasons. You can refuse ideologically but [then] go to your commander and tell him your back hurts or your grandma isn’t well,” said Ariel Heimann, a reservist colonel and former head of the IDF reservist system.He estimates that around half of reservists think “we have to continue and hit Hamas” while an equal number “protest [against continuing the war] on Saturday and go to fight on Sunday”.High-profilepetitions and letterscalling for a swift end to the conflict have been signed by thousands of former military personnel, though fewer reservists.Maor, a 34-year-old air force reservist who is organising a letter which has 350 signatures, said the war in Gaza had become pointless.“After 7 October there was a really high motivation to defend the country and dismantle Hamas. They held hundreds of hostages and were shooting rockets at us. But … the war was not managed properly. There is no clear strategy,” said Maor, who served 200 days in a combat role.Eyal Fidel, 30, has already notified his commander that he will not rejoin his artillery unit.“There is a conflict between what the government want and what the people want. It is important to make a statement and I hope that to refuse publicly will make a difference,” Fidal said. “I am not a pacifist. We were attacked and I did go into the army and, yes, you should follow orders, but some orders are illegal and it is your duty to refuse them.”Most reservists will not be sent to Gaza but will serve on Israel’s borders or be deployed in the West Bank. This will free up regular forces, including professional soldiers and those doing their mandatory service.Heimann said that, although service was a legal requirement, “no one comes because of the law”.He added: “Anyone can find an excuse – so of course the system would collapse if everyone did what they wanted, but they don’t and it doesn’t.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It perfectly captures the melancholy of being an ex-proPhil HarrisonTue 2 Sep 2025 17.35 EDTShareSympathy for the financial plight of formerPremier Leaguefootballers, you say? No, wait, hear us out. You might be surprised by this previously untold story. Richard Milway’s documentary, Football’s Financial Shame: The Story of the V11, is a gripping, moving and human enough tale to inspire more than a little fellow feeling.The V11 may sound like a fictional spy ring from a shonky airport novel but they’re actually a group of retired footballers whose careers spanned the 90s and early 00s. This era-specificity is crucial. They are members of the Premier League’s in-between generation. They’re mid-rankers: household names but it depends on the household. Danny Murphy. Rod Wallace. Brian Deane. Tommy Johnson. Michael Thomas. Craig Short. If you know, you know. And they played at a time when wages were merely brilliant and not yet mind-boggling. At that point in football history, there was still a fragment of connective tissue linking the lives of players and supporters. As Deane puts it, having money meant being able to buy a house and pay off your parents’ mortgage, too.View image in fullscreenTrapped … Danny Murphy is one of the V11 campaigning ex-footballers.Photograph: BBC/Noah MediaDuring the early, upwardly mobile stages of their careers, each of these men came into contact with a company called Kingsbridge Asset Management. Fronted by David McKee and Kevin McMenamin, Kingsbridge promised to invest the money the players were making. Its reputation was good; even managers were using the company. And so began the construction of a bewildering house of financial cards involving a short-lived government tax exemption for film funding, property developments in Florida, and eventually the vengeful attentions ofHMRC. Even after Kingsbridge’s schemes had collapsed, investors were still liable for tax on their outlays: the resultant bills have cost players their fortunes and, in some cases, their sobriety and nearly their sanity. The V11 are a team of 11 players representing many more.Wisely, the documentary doesn’t dwell too long on the inner workings of Kingsbridge’s financial gambits, although it does make various hair-raising claims – for example, the strong suggestion that signatures were forged on documents – that seem, to the casual observer, to go way beyond simple bad advice. McKee and McMenamin offer carefully written rebuttals and bland statements of regret, denying all allegations of wrongdoing. McKee claims the players “suffered from HMRC’s change in approach to film schemes”, that they “understand their dissatisfaction and disappointment”, and that “there was never any fraudulent activity that I witnessed with signatures or anything else”. Beyond that, McKee and McMenamin are unsurprisingly nowhere to be seen – although they do pop up in Michael Thomas’s wedding photographs, which indicates the extent to which they infiltrated the lives of their clients.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The lack of any non-footballer-aligned voices prevents this subplot from taking convincing shape. Instead, the story is inconclusive in a fascinatingly Kafkaesque way. The City of London police investigated Kingsbridge but didn’t find enough evidence to proceed with a prosecution. So the players remain trapped in a state of limbo. They are classified as victims of crime by the police. But they’re still potentially on the hook to HMRC for millions of pounds’ worth of unpaid tax directly resulting from the alleged fraud.Communicating their sense of impotence and unfairness is where the film excels. Rather than a detective story, it becomes a sensitive meditation on age, adversity and disappointment. It captures the melancholy of being an ex-pro. Of being astoundingly successful in your youth, drifting into anonymity, then finding that the money is gone as well as the fame. It’s a study in quiet desperation; middle-aged men looking crestfallen in their soon-to-be-repossessed mansions. Murphy talks about dalliances with drink, drugs and gambling. Deane breaks down as he remembers how the affair haunted the last few years he had with his mother before her death. “Now that time’s gone,” he says. “And she’s gone, too.”Former footballers claim ‘financial grooming’ took them to ‘hell and back’Read moreBy the end, most potential avenues of redress have been exhausted. Wallace and Johnson are forced to sell their homes. Wallace is declared bankrupt. Finally, all they have is each other. As Deane falteringly gives evidence to a parliamentary committee (the involvement of politicians is one of their last resorts), Thomas gently puts his hand on his back. It’s a sweet, sad moment of comradeship between two men unexpectedly out of their comfort zones.As their legal representative Ben Rees points out, most footballers come from relatively modest backgrounds. Inexperience with money can make them easy prey for unscrupulous or careless advisers. Since the salad days of the V11, footballers’ pay has multiplied exponentially. This film asks what kind of financial advice are today’s megastars receiving, how devastating might any fallout be, and whether Premier League footballers deserve a fragment of our sympathy? Against the odds, by teasing out the emotional costs of a vertiginous rise followed by a terrifying plunge, this film suggests they probably do.Football’s Financial Shame: The Story of the V11 aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewPremier LeagueFinancial fair playHMRCDocumentaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is Christopher Marlowe’s moment. Starring Edward Bluemel (My Lady Jane, Killing Eve) as hardworking, wary Will and Ncuti Gatwa (The Importance of Being Earnest, Doctor Who) as randy, troublesome Kit, Liz Duffy Adams’ new chamber play squirrels the literary titans away in a room in 1591 to 1593, playing out an energetic, erotic version of some historians’ suspicions that the playwrights’ lives – and Kit’s violent death – were more intertwined than we think.“It is a history play,” Will chides, as Kit bends the truth in the script of Henry VI Part I, which the two great poets are writing together. “All the more reason to use our imaginations,” Kit retorts with an exaggerated flourish of his quill. Enjoying the historical license her character grants her, Duffy Adams whips the competitors into a frenzy and releases them at each other’s throats, letting them flirt, threaten, fight - and very occasionally write.View image in fullscreenLithe … Ncuti Gatwa in Born With Teeth.Photograph: Johan PerssonBut the bold imagination Kit calls for in reframing history is restrained by Daniel Evans’ staging. Three walls of Neil Austin’s blinder lights form the writers’ cage. A wooden table is their stage, bed and barrier as their charged emotions flip-flop from rivals to lovers, their sometimes overly earnest outpourings sitting flush with stabbing insults and religious musings. The sharp shock of innovation in the opening scene exists in isolation, with the rest of the show relegated to the two men prowling around the table. Bursts of violent action are reserved for mid-act screens, though tension is diffused as Will steps out to address the audience, undermining the intensity of the locked-door environment.Bluemel is a raggedy Will, shedding his initial weediness as his star rises. We watch as his reputation shifts from a wry whine that “no one’s studying me”, to an aside referencing his legacy where, “well,” he shrugs, “you know”. Sincere where his counterpart is scandalous, Will grapples with his feelings for Kit, simultaneously desiring acute proximity and terrified of giving in to temptation.But this is Gatwa’s show. His boisterous Kit sweats in Zoë Thomas-Webb’s leather two-piece, his every lithe action a flirtation. He lunges towards Will first out of pure instinct, as something to shag, but he grows gentler, softened by his literary sparring partner. Beneath his restless exterior, he hides genuine admiration for his uncertain lover and unmistakable fear for the murky waters he has waded into.The Elizabethan England Duffy Adams paints is one of heavy surveillance, as Kit tries to lure Will into his underworld of royal spies. But for all we’re told of the dangers outside this room, they remain at a distance. The stakes simmer throughout but never reach boiling point.The ego-pumped versions of these men we see on stage would be delighted to know audiences and academics continue to ogle their lives and work – though Kit would no doubt be fuming that Will’s star has so drastically eclipsed his. An intelligent slice of historical fiction that offers muscular performances and reminds us to lavish more attention on the other great Elizabethan playwright, Born With Teeth yearns for a sharper bite.AtWyndham’s theatre, London, until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreChristopher MarloweNcuti GatwaWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When I wrote the Filter’s guide to thebest electric toothbrushes, one brand I didn’t need a sample from was Suri. I already owned one of its brushes, drawn in by its impressive commitment to sustainability in a sector that seemed blissfully unbothered by theclimate crisisunfolding around us.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Unfortunately, a few things held it back from taking the top spot, and I’m pleased to say that these have mostly been addressed with Suri 2.0. Is it the best you can buy? Still not quite, but the gap has significantly closed, and there are fewer caveats than ever when giving it a recommendation.If you care about sustainability in any way, it’s the best choice. And now there are fewer drawbacks to doing the right thing.View at SuriView at BootsHow I testedView image in fullscreenThe new Suri toothbrush was tested over a month of daily brushing.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianIt doesn’t take a great deal of imagination to figure out how you test a toothbrush: brush, brush and brush again. Fortunately, Suri was decent enough to give early reviewers a month-long loan, rather than expecting us to burn through several tubes of toothpaste in a matter of hours.Equally fortunate was the fact that, although I’d donated most of the toothbrushes from the group test to Causeway (asexplained here), I held on to our current favourite, theSpotlight Sonic Pro, as a point of reference. Plus, I already had my personal Suri toothbrush, so I could really see where the improvements existed.Suri 2.0 electric toothbrush: what you need to knowView image in fullscreenThe Suri 1.0 and Suri 2.0 are virtually indistinguishable.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianView at SuriView at BootsMy beef with the original Suri toothbrush was essentially twofold. First, it didn’t feel as powerful as its rivals, offering 33,000 brush strokes per minute (BPM), compared with others that went as high as 62,000.The second was a deeper problem: the spring pin chargers felt temperamental, and I personally got through three over the years, deeply damaging the sustainability of the product as a whole. This was likely partly my fault (from not adequately drying brushes before charging, causing them to rust), but I wasn’t the only one with the problem.Suri has addressed both of these weaknesses, and some others that hadn’t bothered me. While the first is a relatively minor tweak – it still vibrates at 33,000 BPM, but with what I’m told is a “more powerful sweeping motion, delivering 25% higher intensity”, whatever that means – Suri 2.0 now charges via wireless induction, both on the charging stand and in the bundled carry case. No more spring pins to rust or snap.Other improvements include the introduction of a pressure sensor, a quieter motor (50dB rather than 54), a bundled plant-based brush head cover if you want to ditch the travel case, and a travel lock to stop it turning on by mistake. As someone whose luggage was once delayed by an electric toothbrush prompting a bomb threat, I can’t believe “not being mistaken for a terrorist” wasn’t on my wishlist of upgrades, but there we go.Finally, the travel case has been upgraded to include a battery. This isn’t for charging the brush, but to power a built-in UV-C light to kill bacteria on the go. The UV light was a feature on the original brush, too, but it required a USB-C cable to work, making it a little-used extra for me.All of this comes in the form of a brush that looks virtually indistinguishable from the original, as you’ll see in the photos. This feels like an odd choice from a marketing perspective, but it does have the advantage of meaning therecyclable plant-based headsare interchangeable between Suri 1.0 and 2.0.SpecificationsType:sonicModes:two (clean and polish)Power:33,000 BPMPressure sensor:yesBattery life:1+ monthApp:noWarranty:one year (extended to two years with registration)What we loveView image in fullscreenThe new wireless charging system is a huge improvement.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianThe main thing we love about Suri 2.0 is the same thing we loved in the original – the heads are plant based, made from cornstarch with castor oil bristles. Suri will recycle these free of charge, and provide a self-addressed compostable bag to put your used heads in when you’ve collected four. Apack of three costs £14.99, but if you subscribe, you’ll get two sent out every six months for £8.98. Cheaper than some of the big brands, but more expensive than some third-party heads.As a brush, it’s light and easy to use. One press of the button turns it on, with a friendly buzz every 30 seconds reminding you to move on to the next quarter of your mouth before it shuts itself down after two minutes. There are two modes, one gentle and one slightly firmer for a stronger clean.As for those refinements, the pressure sensor is a very good addition indeed. If you push too hard, the brush will buzz three times and then fall asleep. As soon as you reduce the pressure, it’ll stop playing possum, with the timer continuing from where you left off. (Note that you can inadvertently turn this off – something that wasn’t in the review unit’s manual, causing me to think the device might be broken. If your pressure sensor stops working, try pressing and holding the power button for five seconds with the brush switched on. When a light flashes, turn the brush off and back on, and the pressure sensor should be restored.)The new wireless charging system is a huge improvement, too. Just pop Suri 2.0 on to the USB-C charging stand or into the case (connected to a USB-C cable), and charging starts immediately. Despite losing the unreliable spring pins, the new stand is still magnetic, so the brush handle won’t topple without a push.Speaking of magnets, one of my favourite design elements of the original is back. Each Suri comes with a magnetic wall mount to prevent cabinet clutter. No screws required: just remove the tab and stick it to a wall or mirror with the pre-applied adhesive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The built-in battery makes it easier to get into the habit of using the UV-C light, even if it’s not what I’d call an essential feature.There’s also now a plant-based head cover in the box. To prevent accidental activation, a travel lock mode has been added, requiring a five-second press to switch on and off. This is extremely handy if luggage is at an absolute premium and even the slimline case is too bulky, letting you keep your toothbrush head free from fluff and other detritus.What we don’t loveView image in fullscreenThe Suri 2.0 is still a touch underpowered compared with other electric toothbrushes.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianI generally agree with Suri that toothbrush features such as Bluetooth and connected apps are pointless gimmicks. However, having tested a whole host of sonic toothbrushes, I do think that 33,000 BPM is still a touch underpowered, even with the supposed higher intensity.To put that into perspective, on the Spotlight Pro, the 30,000 BPM setting is called “gentle”, and it has four settings that go all the way up to 50,000 BPM. Whether it’s down to the speed or less planet-friendly bristles, all I can say is that after a cider-heavy night at the pub, Spotlight remains notably more effective at eliminating that disgusting furry tooth feel than Suri. (This is not one of my regular toothbrush tests, but it’s an effective one.)Using both Suri 1.0 and Suri 2.0 side by side, I couldn’t feel much of a difference, though it’s possible that things are still happening on a level only visible to dentists. While the travel case was an optional extra before, it now comes with every brush. The company says most people wanted the case, so it made sense to include it, but it does mean the starting price has risen to compensate, as well as creating more e-waste in the long run. While you can still buy a Suri 1.0 brush for £75, the starting price for Suri 2.0 with the case has risen to £105.Finally, it’s a pity that there’s currently no way to trade in the Suri 1.0 brush for its successor. While the company is yet to confirm this, I would be surprised if this remained the case forever, given its commitment to minimising e-waste.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenSuri’s toothbrushes are carbon neutral with offsetting.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianOn that note, Suri’s sustainability credentials remain second to none in the world of toothbrushes. Admittedly, this isn’t especially high praise, but nonetheless, the company’s visible positive environmental choices should be applauded.The plant-based heads can be recycled free of charge, as previously mentioned, but that’s really just the tip of the iceberg. The body is built from aluminium, the packaging is moulded paper, and the product is carbon neutral with offsetting.There are limitations to this. There is still a lithium-ion battery on the inside, and some plastic involved, as well as a battery in the mandatory travel cases (something Suri previously avoided on environmental grounds). But there are practical reasons for these ecological compromises, and the company holds itself to account withtracking from ClimatePartnerand annual sustainability reports. You canread the 2024 document here, which explains the rationale for limited plastic and lithium-ion battery use, among other things.Suri 2.0 electric toothbrush:should I buy it?All in all, Suri 2.0 is a huge improvement over the original. The enhancements are thoughtful and address real gripes I had, while not feeling the need to lean into gimmicks such as Bluetooth connectivity. A toothbrush I could previously only endorse with a “but” is now an easy recommendation, even if it’s still not the most powerful brush around.Ironically, I’ll now add a “but” – albeit one I imagine Suri will be happy to read. As the company itself points out, every toothbrush that has ever been built still exists, whether it’s in a cabinet or a landfill, broken or working.With that in mind, if you need an electric toothbrush, then Suri 2.0 should definitely be on your radar. If you already have one that works well enough, make a mental note and consider picking one up when the time comes(and when it does, you canfind out where to recycle your old electric toothbrush locally here).View at SuriView at BootsAlan Martin is awriter who has been putting products – including phones, gaming devices and wearables – through their paces for more than a decade.

I worry about how vulnerable this has made meKate LeaverTue 2 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 16.18 EDTShareOrdinarily, I’m a sensible person – at least part-time. A journalist, an asker of questions, a checker of sources. Historically, a big fan of research.But three years into a debilitating chronic illness, I am willing to try anything to get well. Even things that would have once made me roll my eyes. Chromotherapy, sound baths, mushroom extract. Reiki, leg compression boots, strategic humming.If the devil (hopefully the Liz Hurley Bedazzled version) offered me full health in exchange for my soul, I would have a hard time saying no.And so, I am an easy target. I have become a selectively gullible person – disillusioned with mainstream medicine, waiting for a cure, sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of an infrared light panel wearing nothing but a pair of protective wraparound sunglasses and hoping for the best.I contracted Covid-19 at a Harry Styles concert in June 2022. Three months later, I was diagnosed with post-Covid-19 syndrome, colloquially known as long Covid because, well, it does like to hang around.‘We’re losing decades of our life to this illness’: long Covid patients on the fear of being forgottenRead moreSince then, I have sampled from the200+ available symptoms, including but not limited to heart palpitations, gastrointestinal chaos, joint pain, the ability to feel my heartbeat in my arms, brain fog so bad I once forgot how to turn off the shower and the type of fatigue that regularly makes me Google “can you die from tiredness”. At times, a five-minute phone conversation has sent me to bed for days. I’d have to rest halfway up a small set of stairs. I’d answer a single email then slip into a sleep that felt much closer to a coma than a nap.When things are that grim, the promises made by the wellness industry sound very,veryappealing. An industry worth$6.3tn globally, with some of the most diabolically persuasive advocates available – celebrities, influencers, internet strangers, a friend’s sister’s boyfriend’s colleague who swears this one supplement made him better in a week. I shudder to think what my own contribution to that figure has been – and I will not be voluntarily doing maths to find out. I’ve been through enough.Whenever someone recommends something new, I haven’t had it in me to ask “Where’s the rigorous scientific proof of this thing’s efficacy?” when I’ve had “Help me! I will do anything to feel well” playing inside my head on a loop for thousands of days. Sometimes this is fine, even great – there are many alternative things that really work for me – I love my acupuncturist! Somatic dance! Shiatsu!Other times, it has been more sinister.During the screening call for a wellness program I now believe to be at best a pyramid scheme, at worst a cult, I was asked if I felt able to “put aside” my “critical thinking” before they signed me up. I practically begged them to let me.I’ve submerged myself in ice-cold bath tubs. Sweated in saunas. Let a man strike a drum balanced on my belly so the vibrations would stimulate my cellsThankfully, one day into a dangerously stupid three-day initiation course designed by some guy called Paul or Peter or Ian, I saw it for what it was, sent an eviscerating email and received a full refund. I had found the limit of my wilful gullibility.I found it again by accidentally taking part in a ceremony to commune with angels because it was advertised as a nice relaxing group meditation. And again, when my local gym offered a free rehabilitation program that went against all the prevailing advice on treating my condition but conveniently herded me towards a long-term membership.These are times when suspending my scepticism has felt like a betrayal to myself, when I feel that I’ve been exploited. Now I feel extremely protective of other people like me, too sick to necessarily have the clarity of mind to tell the false promises of wellness culture from the legit.What else? I’ve done 90-minute sessions lying in a sealed hyperbaric oxygen chamber, which felt somewhat like road-testing my own coffin.A small, frighteningly positive man poked my spine and pulled my arms and pummelled my back while he bellowed things like “your immune system works perfectly”.I’ve submerged myself in ice-cold bath tubs. Sweated in saunas. Let a man strike a drum balanced on my belly so the vibrations would stimulate my cells. Stirred mushroom powders into hot water for an alleged boost to my cognitive function. Prodded my collarbones, armpits and groin to drain my lymphatic system. Had my chakras realigned. Asked a psychic what to do. Drunk what must now be gallons of celery juice.I do aqua aerobics with women in their 80s – it’s the most fun I’ve had exercising | Kate LeaverRead moreAll of these things exist on a spectrum of efficacy and intentions – from a floret of kale to a full-blown cult. We will each have our own quota of what we are able to believe. On hard days, I still worry I’m too vulnerable and not discerning enough. On better days, I’m just grateful to have things to try.Recently I’ve been going outside first thing, to ask the sun to set my circadian rhythm. I down a pint of water and electrolytes. Place a little device that looks like a high-end sex toy on my sternum to stimulate my vagus nerve. Stand on a vibration plate to move muscles that may otherwise atrophy after roughly 900 days of lying down. Dance aggressively to a Selena Gomez-heavy playlist to release trapped emotion from my body. Put my legs up a wall at every possible opportunity. And guzzle a handful of supplements, thinking to myself,at the very least, maybe I can have some placebo effect, as a little treat.Do I think these things have helped? Yes.Am I sure about that? No.But what else can I do? There is no treatment protocol, no known cure for long Covid. Experts disagree on what it even is –tiny blood clotspreventing oxygen from circulating my body properly?Mitochondrial dysfunction?Inflammation?An extreme histamine reaction?Dysautonomia?So long as we know so little about something that affects my life so completely, there is always the possibility that something wacky could help.Until there is an advance in medical science and evidence-based treatments, all I can do is hope. Hope, rest, stay hydrated and try my very best not to join a cult again.Explore more on these topicsLong CovidAustralian lifestyleHealth & wellbeingCoronavirusInfectious diseasesAlternative medicineMedical researchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now Bemi Orojuogun, 56, has urged her army of fans to share her appreciation for the hard-working bus drivers who keep the capital running.The mental health nurse has been overwhelmed by the response to the quirky, bite-size videos she began posting on social media last year. They feature clips of her standing at the roadside, sometimes at landmarks such as Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus, as buses drive past.“My love for London red buses started a long time ago, when I first came to this country in the early 90s,” said Orojuogun, who is from Nigeria. “There are four parts of London that I really, really love: red buses, red telephone booths, all the London bridges and Big Ben. But buses are main my love.”She showcased this enthusiasm last March, posting a video of a 241 bus driving past her in Plaistow, east London. For Orojuogun, there was nothing unusual about the video but it quickly racked up millions of views when it was shared worldwide.“I received a call from my daughter saying: ‘Mummy, you’re going viral’,” Orojuogun said. “I loved the way young people really liked the video, their comments and the way they were reposting it, and then I did more of it. Some of them love to guess where I’ll be going next and suggest where I should visit next, and that’s how it all started.”Orojuogun’s most popular video has amassed 48.1m views. The one-minute clip shows her standing in front of a bus stop in Greenwich as a series of buses drive past her to the soundtrack of Back for Good by Take That.“It’s still all a dream and a shock to me,” she said of the popularity of her videos. “A lot of celebrities have been in my DMs, congratulating me, telling me they’re proud of me. But not only that, I’m so glad the way social media has accepted me, the way they have come behind me and supported me.”Orojuogun rarely speaks in her videos, instead beaming into the camera with her distinctive glasses, colourful headscarves and dangly earrings. She often appears perilously close to the kerb, leading some viewers to fear she may be standing in the road. But she insists it is all in the camera angles and she is always on the pavement.Her popularity has landed her advertising deals withTransportfor London, Ikea and Burberry, which described her in a campaign last month as “our fare lady”. But her motivation for posting videos remains her love of the capital and its buses which she said allowed her to get to work during the pandemic.“I love those buses,” she said. “Since Covid, the buses have been my main means of travelling, from home to work, shopping, everywhere. London is a beautiful place to see from the top of the bus. That’s my belief. I love it. And those red buses, take it from me, they represent London. I just wish we loved them a bit more. I wish people could love them the way I do.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think a lot of us, we go on buses and we just take them for granted, ‘just take me from A to Z’.“There’s nothing wrong with saying ‘good morning’, ‘good afternoon’, or ‘thank you’ when you get out of the bus. That’s just my view. Since I started going around London, I meet so many of them, we get into conversations, and I love them and I think they’re doing a fantastic job.”Explore more on these topicsTikTokLondonPublic transportSocial mediaTransportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But only when it’s warm outside.I have to say, this sounds like a lie.And yet there is undeniable proof of it, in the form of a survey of 2,000 people that was recently commissioned by LG.The television manufacturing brand?That doesn’t make it any less valid. What’s more, there’s a good chance that the survey is conservative. The true number of icy beer fanatics is probably much higher.Why is that?Because another 10% said embarrassment was holding them back from requesting ice in their beer, and another 20% said that they had previously been told off by friends, family and bar staff for requesting it.Seriously, though, why is putting ice cubes in beer a bad thing?Because beer is already delicately flavoured enough as it is, so diluting it with melted ice risks rendering it tasteless. Plus, a lot of work went into crafting that flavour profile. Don’t just mess it all up because you like your glass to clink when you swirl it.Where did this horrible trendoriginate?France, apparently. In the southern regions, it is normal to do it on a hot day.Even though TikTok is perpetually full of American people complaining about France’s innate hatred of iced drinks?Listen, things change. People put ice cubes in beer. It’s progress.This has to be the worst drinks trend of the year.Clearly someone hasn’t seen Materialists yet.OhGod, why?Because that’s the film where Dakota Johnson orders a drink that’s half beer and half Coca-Cola, known as a diesel in Germany.What is happening to the world?Calm down. People drink shandies all the time, and that’s beer and lemonade. What’s so bad about using a different fizzy drink?I suppose that does make more sense than putting ice cubes in beer.Don’t worry, this isn’t actually going to be the future.Why’s that?Because younger generations typically drink less than their older counterparts. And this, combined with the World Health Organization’s goal to reduce alcohol consumption by 20% per capita by 2030, means that drinking culture as we know it is on the verge of disappearing.Oh fine, I’ll turn a blind eye this time.That’s more like it. Barman, one half-beer, half-cola slushie, please.Do say:“I put ice cubes in my beer to stay cool.”Don’t say:“I prefer to submerge a baked potato in mine to make it more filling.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This has been very much on Black artist Amy Sherald’s mind. When Ispoke to herin advance of the debut of her exhibition American Sublime, she told me that Black representation was foundational to her practice: “I developed this idea that, when I look at art history, for the most part I don’t see portraits of people that look like me. So it started there.”Amy Sherald: ‘Sublimity in Black life can be seen in our ability to persist’Read moreThat exhibition’s curator, Sarah Roberts, also spoke about Sherald’s passion for representing the LGBTQ+ community: “Amy has thought a lot about her role as an artist and the need for representation, and she has long been a champion of LGBTQ+ rights. This work is thinking about who gets depicted as being American.”It was no surprise, then, that Sherald would have a very strong reaction when the Smithsonianattempted to censorTrans Forming Liberty, a portrait that she made of the Black trans woman Arewà Basit, out of American Sublime in advance of its arrival there. As Sherald told theNew Yorker: “Trans Forming Liberty challenges who we allow to embody our national symbols – and who we erase. It demands a fuller vision of freedom, one that includes the dignity of all bodies, all identities … This portrait is a confrontation with that truth.”More than just censoring Trans Forming Liberty from American Sublime to appease the Trump administration, the Smithsonian added insult to injury when it suggested that Sherald replace her artwork with a video of cisgender people debating whether or not trans people deserved inclusion in American society. The artist lost no time in responding to these actions by pulling her show from the Smithsonian.View image in fullscreenAmy Sherald’s Trans Forming Liberty on display.Photograph: Matthew Millman/Matthew Millman PhotographyThe skirmish over Sherald’s piece highlights the importance of trans representation in the artwork that hangs in our museums and galleries – a2022 Pew pollfound that less than half of Americans believed that they had ever met a trans person, meaning that seeing representation such as Sherald’s might add a dose of empathy and connection to a community that is in need of compassion from cisgender Americans. At the time when the trans community is being demonized with the fervor of a moral panic, it is no exaggeration to say that such encounters are transformational.The Bay Area trans artist Éamon McGivern has made trans portraiture central to his artistic practice. His collection, Still Lives, a Trans Portrait Project, was recently shown in the Tenderloin Museum in San Francisco as a tribute to his connection with the trans community.McGivern was appalled, although not surprised, at the idea that trans people are now being erased from museums with strong ties to the federal government. “We’re at a point where you can’t show a picture of a trans person at a federally funded institution and that’s bad, that’s fascism,” he said. “If cis artists are being asked to edit, what does that mean for queer and trans people?He awarded Sherald points for understanding the importance of representing trans people in her art. “Since Sherald’s an artist of color, I’m sure she has to think these issues through more than the average person. The fact that she cares enough about trans people enough to include them in her body of work means that she gets it.”View image in fullscreenÉamon McGivern – Ray and Sathya, 2022.Photograph: Éamon McGivernWhile showing his work, McGivern has frequently seen cisgender people have to wrestle with their preconceived stereotypes around who trans people actually are. “The response I get from cisgender people is that they didn’t know trans people looked like that,” he said. “And that really opened my eyes, where I’m like: ‘Wow, people have such a narrow view.’ That we can just be normal people living normal lives.”McGivern sees trans portraiture as far more than just a way of acquainting cisgender viewers with the trans experience. He shared that his series of portraits of trans people came out of his own experience of isolation after undergoing gender-affirming surgery: “I lost my housing during recovery from top surgery,” he said. “I looked around, and I realized that I didn’t have any capital T trans people in my life. I needed trans people around me who got it.”Painting portraits of trans people became a lifeline at the very time he needed it: his art helped him build exactly the community he was in search of. “I started reaching out to people who I thought were cool hot trans people. I wanted to show portraits of people who were not alone and in community. Reaching out to people who seemed to have that in their lives, showing that in my art was subconsciously a way of getting that for myself.”Like McGivern, Atlanta artist Sean La’Mont began creating trans portraits as a way of being in community. She recalled that in 1997 she began to frequent drag clubs and was astonished by the beauty of the trans women who danced there. “I thought: ‘Wow, these are amazing people!’ and it was that curiosity that started me drawing them.”View image in fullscreenArtwork by Sean La’Mont.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistLa’Mont’s years of drawing the trans community have brought her into contact with some astonishing trans people, including surgeon Dr Marci Bowers, who is considered one of the top vaginoplasty surgeons in the world. La’Mont recalled that at a trans health symposium in Atlanta she got the chance to come face to face with a personal hero – and draw her portrait.“I was invited to do a show with the Trans Symposium, and Bowers happened to be the guest speaker that year,” she recalled. “The event organizers asked me to draw her, and then they presented it to her at the event. She was so gracious about it. She’s been an idol, she’s pretty incredible.”For La’Mont, it’s the love of her community that has kept her inspired to draw portraits of trans people for decades now, something she’s eager to share with the cisgender population. “Art reflects how people live and love, and some of the greatest pieces are the ones that show how we live and love. I see their reaction, it’s like: ‘Oh my God, that’s beautiful.’”Explore more on these topicsArtPaintingTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s hard to feel hope when agenocidehas been livestreamed to our phones for almost two years and there is no justice in sight; just a systematic slaughter of thejournalistswho serve as messengers. No peace prospects on the horizon; just well-paid consultants putting together ethnic cleansing prospectuses so a “Gaza Riviera” can be built. (Oh, sorry, we’re supposed to say “voluntary relocation”, aren’t we?)As a British Palestinian, I urge you to keep (or start!) speaking up for Gaza and Palestinians. The situation in Gaza and the West Bank gets worse daily. But please do not succumb to hopelessness or assume that you are powerless to change things. While it may seem like nothing will shame politicians into meaningfully upholding international human rights law, your voice does make a difference. Writing to your MP; protesting; donating; supporting theFreedom Flotilla Coalition; advocating online; boycotting companies such as Airbnb which profit fromillegal settlements. These sorts of things do make a difference.Plenty of people are keen to tell you otherwise. There is a certain form of hopelessness that has been repackaged as sensible centrist thinking. Don’t bother with your silly little acts of activism or your social media posts, these people will tell you, they won’t achieve anything.Look, for example, at the contemptuous reaction in many quarters to Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey’s decision to boycott King Charles’s state banquet for Trump in protest over Gaza. Per asneering piecein the Telegraph, this boycott “betrays a serious lack of seriousness”. Davey would be far more serious, apparently, if he just joined other politicians in doing nothing, except perhaps issuing an occasional statement expressing “serious concern” about Israel bombing another hospital orexecutinganother aid worker.Of course, Davey’s boycott won’t shame Trump into acting. But it might cause someone to think more deeply about the perverseness of holding an extravagant state banquet while a US-enabled Israel, which has a history of weaponising food andcontrolling the calorie intakeof a captive Gaza population, has orchestrated a human-made famine. It may pressure other politicians into some sort of action.And of course your tweet aboutGaza, or the Palestine flag in your window, aren’t going to stop the genocide. But I’ll tell you what these things do achieve: they help stop despair from taking over. Perhaps, if you do not belong to a group that has been systematically dehumanised for decades, it might be hard to understand the impact of these acts of solidarity. But whenever I see a stranger wearing a keffiyeh, or a celebrity raising money for Gaza, or a Palestinian solidarity sign in a window, it gives me hope. It reminds me that not everyone has normalised a genocide. Not everyone has given up on Palestinians.More importantly, small acts add up. Politicians rarely do the right thing for the hell of it; they have to be pressed into progress. Do you think women would have got the vote if suffragettes hadn’t made a nuisance of themselves? Do you think the US civil rights movement would have succeeded if African Americans sat compliantly at the back of the bus? Do you think same-sex marriage would have been legalised if the queer community and their allies had just quietly hoped for the best? Do you think apartheid in South Africa would have ended when it didwithout global boycotts?Celebrities can play an outsized role in shaping politics. When Ellen DeGeneres came out in 1997, first on the cover of Time magazine, then in character in her sitcom in front of an audience of42 million people, it was a watershed moment for gay rights. People who had never met an openly queer person started to understand that they weren’t weird deviants but people just like them. That episode helped pave the way for gay marriage in the US. So don’t let anyone tell you that asking celebrities to speak up is a waste of time. If celebrity advocacy didn’t make a difference, there wouldn’t be suchan aggressive campaignfrom pro-Israel voices to smear Ms Rachel, the children’s entertainer and educator who has done an enormous amount to humanise Palestinians, and said she is willing to risk her career to keep advocating for children in Gaza.They may seem trivial but social media posts aren’t meaningless either. If online advocacy didn’t matter, US politicians – many of whom openly lamented there was toomuch pro-Palestinian contenton the app – wouldn’t have made a bipartisan effort to ban TikTok. If angry tweets were irrelevant, Israel’s government wouldn’t be pumping an additional $150m (£115m) into shaping public opinion. Last year the Times of Israelreported thatthe foreign minister said the increasedhasbarabudget “would be used to influence sentiment in the foreign press and on social media”.Israel committing genocide in Gaza, world’s top scholars on the crime sayRead moreIt is hard to stay hopeful in today’s “monstrous times”, but for the sake of the people bearing the brunt of modern monstrosities, it is imperative that we do. Ask yourself this: if you were in Gaza, watching your babies wither away from engineered starvation, would you want someone to speak up for you? If your kids were buried alive under rubble, left to die a protracted and painful death over several days, would you want people to demand accountability? Or would you simply say to yourself: as a sensible geopolitical realist, I know this is all far too complex for the average citizen to understand; too hopeless for them to solve. Far better if good people do nothing. The politicians will sort it out.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s what the prime minister promised as he announced yet another government reboot, insisted he would get all asylum hotels closed “as quickly as possible” and was filmed with the ubiquitous union flag in the background. (“Look, I’m the leader of the Labour party who put the union jack on our Labour party membership cards,” he boasted.)Let’s quote Keir Starmer’s deliverance speech in context: “We are now into phase two of the government, which is where we focus on delivery, delivery, delivery and start to show what a difference a Labour government really makes.” Which, of course, can be happily soundbited as “delivery, delivery, delivery”. That’s the thinking, anyway.But if there’s one thing that sums up why Starmer is a useless politician, it’s this mantra. You can see what the PM is trying to do. He’s echoing Tony Blair – again. “Education, education, education”. The same trick. One word repeated three times. Even the same number of syllables, so we can chant it from memory.There’s only one problem. “Delivery, delivery, delivery” (which he tried out in a practice run last December in Scotland) doesn’t mean anything. It’s vacuous nonsense. What’s more, “delivery” is almost impossible to remember as a word, let alone a slogan. Not even the Post Office could get away with it. (Nor the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for that matter). “Delivery, delivery, delivery” might just be the worst political slogan of all time.“Education, education, education” works because it’s real. We know what education is and think it’s important. Most of us don’t know what delivery means, and I reckon the few who do don’t actually want it delivered. Take the cuts to Pip by tightening eligibility rules or restricting the winter fuel allowance to the poorest pensioners. We didn’t want that delivered, so the government had to backtrack earlier this year.Or take the demonising of asylum seekers and thesuspension of family reunion applications. Most traditional Labour voters don’t want that delivered either because, as the great Labour peer Alf Dubs said yesterday, the government has to argue for morality, rather than try to out-Reform Reform on the bigotry front. Dubs’s life was almost certainly saved when he fled Prague on the Kindertransport in 1939 and was offered refuge in Britain. Nowthatkind of delivery was something we could be proud of.The sad thing is that Starmer is an able man, and was once an admirable lawyer who fought for the underdog. But as a politician he is clumsy, leaden-footed and pusillanimous. And as a creator of winning catchphrases, he is second to all. Remember “security, prosperity, respect”, “secure, protect, rebuild”, “a new leadership” or, possibly my favourite, “another future is possible”? No, I thought not.And let’s not forget, Starmer is the (staunchly anti-Brexit) fella who was convinced he could co-opt the Brexit slogan “take back control” andmake it his. Hard-right campaigners outside hotels “hosting” asylum seekers have shown who really owns that sentiment.Starmer should focus on delivering more hope in the decency of British people and embrace the many counter-arguments to the anti-migrant gutter rhetoric. Asylum seekers have escaped unimaginable horrors. And it is our duty to support refugees under the 1951 refugee convention. We know as well that migrants boost the economy (figures consistently show that overall they pay more tax than they receive in benefits), andthey fill posts in vital public services(about 20% of NHS employees in England are non-UK nationals). If the prime minister did this, there may still be time for him to win back some disillusioned Labour supporters.But even if he did decide to dedicate himself to delivering the moral argument, “delivery, delivery, delivery” would still be a rubbish catchphrase. As it is, when he’s applying it to lowest-common-denominator politics, it might ring more true sense as “populism, populism, populism” or “utterbollocks, utterbollocks, utterbollocks”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterComing soon: Guardian voices in conversation about a key debate of the week, every SaturdayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Labour should rethink its North Sea stanceNils PratleyRachel Reeves could make geopolitical, economic and environmental case for limited boost in productionTue 2 Sep 2025 14.16 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 15.04 EDTShareIf the chancellor is looking for a pro-growth, pro-jobs, tax-raising policy that would be popular with major trade unions and might even be noticedby the bond markets, here’s one: boost production of oil and gas in the North Sea. And make the argument that the UK’s current over-reliance on imported supplies isn’t doing anything to help the climate emergency.There are obvious political problems, of course. First, Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, has just madeher pitch to ramp up North Sea volumesand it’s rarely a good look to be accused of pinching the opposition’s clothes.But Labour’s vision could be different. It would not say that “all” our oil and gas must be extracted – Badenoch’s implausible ambition. It would emphasise that achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is still the priority and the energy transition will still happen. But it would concede that the decline in domestic oil and gas production must be addressed in light of geopolitical risks, the carbon consequences of relying on imports, and concerns over jobs.The second political problem is more basic: Labour’s manifesto ruled out new licences to explore new fields, arguing they would “only accelerate the worsening climate crisis”. But is there wriggle room there?The hard reality is that the UK will still consume a lot of fossil fuels even under a successful 2050 transition. From a climate perspective, an almost unarguable point is that the UK’s reliance on imported gas in liquefied form is an outrage. Such imports from the US, Qatar, Algeria and other countries made up a quarter of UK gas supplies last year and are demonstrably worse for the planet than gas produced at home.The government’s own licensing and regulatory body, the North Sea Transition Authority, has been clear on the pollution point. “The average carbon intensity of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) is almost four times the carbon intensity of UK production,”it said in a reporta couple of years ago. The reason is straightforward: liquefaction, transportation across oceans and regasification all add emissions.At a push, one might argue that LNG was temporarily tolerable if UK consumption of gas were set to disappear by, say, 2035. But you’ll struggle to find an energy analyst who thinks that will happen. Gas may dwindle to next to nothing for the purposes of electricity generation, but the lion’s share of its use is for domestic heating and cooking, where phasing out will inevitably be slower.The case for boosting oil production is trickier because most North Sea production is exported (partly because that’s how the oil industry works, and partly because of the closure of UK refineries such asGrangemouth). But the overall picture is still that oil and gas accounts for 75% of the UK’s energy needs today and the reliance on imports has reached 40%. Nobody pretends the UK will ever again become a net exporter of oil and gas – the North Sea is still a basin in long-term decline – but the net cost of energy imports last year was almost £21bn. It all counts against the balance of payments and ripples through the economy.Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), the industry’s trade body, thinks North Sea-dependent jobs are being lost at a rate of 1,000 a month. Gary Smith, the leader of the GMB union, joined the political dotsin an interview with the New Statesman in July: “We have been decarbonising through deindustrialisation and it’s counterproductive because the communities that have seen their industries closed down, they’ve been abandoned and will end up voting for the right, and exactly the way that they have in America.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The most interesting idea on that score came last week from Prof John Underhill, the director for energy transition at the University of Aberdeen.Switch to a system of “bespoke” applications for “near-field exploration or infrastructure-led drilling around existing fields and … strategically important pipelines,” he said. In other words, make best use of the existing infrastructure to ensure supplies aren’t shut in. But also, argued Underhill, ensure homegrown emissions are driven down by banning flaring and promoting electrification on platforms, which is how Norway’s modern industry has achieved its leading status.It sounds a more intelligent and nuanced approach than a blanket “no new licences” policy. The bottom line is that the UK, even under a successful transition, is still going to use 10bn-plus barrels of oil (and gas equivalent) on the way to 2050 on most projections. The current trajectory is for 4bn-ish barrels of UK production, thinks OEUK, which reckons a “realistic target” would be 6bn under a more incentivising tax regime (the other political obstacle).The big-picture point is that a policy that encourages domestic production to the least polluting standards – while keeping 2050 targets intact – has merit if the UK will consume the oil and gas anyway. “The UK still relies heavily on oil and gas and, without a clear and pragmatic plan, we risk replacing homegrown supply with higher-emission imports,” argues Underhill. It is the point the government needs to address.Explore more on these topicsBusinessNils Pratley on financeOil and gas companiesEnergy industryOilFossil fuelscommentShareReuse this content"

Not only is our economy in dire trouble, with the cost of basic goodsshooting upagain and again, but trust in those running the country is at a record low. These are the conditions in whichfar-right politics festers. With the help of his friends in some of the media, Nigel Farage is feeding off that anger.This is the Green party’s moment. We know Keir Starmershuffling the deckchairsthis week is not the real change we need. We are not here just to be concerned or disappointed with this Labour government. We are here to replace it.Things have to change, and it’s my job as the new leader of theGreen partyto work with communities, bring people together and turn anger into hope.Most people know one thing about the Greens: that we care about the environment. And this won’t change. But increasingly, and in every corner of this country, people are voting for us because we’re the only party talking about everyday solutions and pointing the finger at those who are causing the real problems we face.It’s actually fairly simple. For years now, the very richest in society have accumulated more and more wealth. While they sleep at night, the money pours in, not from work, but from assets such as stocks, shares and multiple properties. The wealthiest 1% of households in this country hold agreater proportionthan that held by the least wealthy 50%.And while that tiny proportion at the top gets richer, our NHS is buckling, disability benefits are under threat and the two-child benefit cap threatens to push hundreds of thousands of kids into poverty.The UK’s economy is on its knees. GDP growth, the scorecard on which this government wants to be marked, is crawling along at just 1.2% this year. For most of us, the squeeze is relentless. Tenants are handing over nearly half their wages in rent. The Trussell Trust says at least9.3 million peopleare going hungry, a third of whom are children. Food inflation is at an 18-month high. And all this is happening under a Labour government – and with little prospect of things getting better.It can’t go on like this. Under my leadership, the Green party is going to be relentless in our opposition to a politics that favours the super-wealthy over the rest of us. That’s why the first people I will meet as leader today will be trade unionists: cleaners, carers and hospital porters. That’s why whenever you hear from us, you’ll hear our calls for a wealth tax, our demand for public ownership of water companies and our pledge to make childcare universal and free.View image in fullscreenZack Polanski at a demonstration outside the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, London, 30 September 2023.Photograph: SOPA Images Limited/AlamyWe know that the ongoing climate crisis will be devastating for our communities, but we’re here to harness the imagination, the hope and the vision of what an alternative looks like: new jobs in public services, communities that people love and a council housing programme that makes sure no one is left sleeping rough.I disagree with Reform UK and Farage on almost everything. But they’re correct to point at our politics and say it has failed. What they refuse to admit is that it’s their wealthy backers, including fossil-fuel finance, who have fanned the flames of the crises we face now.In coming votes – whether local and assembly elections next year or the general election when it next comes – people in this country will face a stark choice. Do they stick with a tired, failed politics of a Labour party that has abandoned its principles one by one? Do they opt for Farage’s financiers? Or do they choose a Green party that has a plan to improve lives and turn this country around?At the last election, a record number of nearly 2 million people voted Green, leading to40 second-place finishes– our central mission is to turn them into new Green MPs. Along with our councillors across the country, that’s how we turn our country around.Right now, more than one in 10 people say they’d vote Green in a general election. And, yes, I am going to significantly build on that. But my politics is also about community; about grassroots movements. Millions of people are desperate for change and angry that those elected are not acting in their interests. I’m ready to build ideas with them and give them a political voice. I am here to offer bold leadership and to fight for a country where no one is left behind.Zack Polanski is the newly elected leader of the Green partyExplore more on these topicsGreen partyOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

It basically means you’re bereaved or getting divorced – because if you’re just a regular, organised person who goes to the dump a lot, you’re in and out of there like a ghost.So anyway, I wouldn’t call it a friendship, between me and the guy in the recyclable items aisle; it’s more of a Tom and Jerry thing. I try to leave stuff where it might find a new home, and he tries to get me to put it in landfill. I say, “Butsir,it’s a brand new commode, there are people who’d bite your hand off for one of these,” and he says, “Give it back to the NHS,” and I say, “Do you think I haven’t tried that?”. And he shakes his head, and I put it in landfill, but then wait until his back is turned and run back with three Zimmer frames.We rarely clash, but probably our longest discussions have been about tech.

Some people adhere to it by eating solely animal-based products, while others have variations that might include some fruits or vegetables.What do the experts think of it?There are two issues when it comes to diets relying on meat – what you’re missing out on, as well as the risk of what you could be consuming too much of, says Dr Eden Barrett, a public health nutrition researcher and dietitian at the George Institute for GlobalHealth.The chance of deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C and folate, is really high. You’re also virtually eating no fibre, a nutrient that evidence shows isprotective against heart disease,certain cancersand a lot ofchronic diseases, as well as crucial for digestive health, Barrett says. You could also be missing out on the variety ofbioactive compounds in food, such as antioxidants. Those aren’t essential nutrients – we don’t need them to survive – but they canhelp us live longer.There is also the risk of consuming too much animal meat. This can be high in saturated fat, which tends to raise levels of bad cholesterol – a known risk factor for heart disease, she says. Red meat and processed meat has also been shown to be associated with risk of cancers, while consuming too much protein can also put kidney function at risk, Barrett says.There isn’t a lot of scientific evidence for what the long-term effects of a carnivore diet are, as opposed to the benefits of a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, meat and meat alternatives, dairy, nuts and legumes on a daily basis, which is based on “years and years of accumulated evidence”, Barrett says.Social media’s gut feeling is all wrong: there is no fast track to a healthy microbiome | Natasha MayRead moreBut what about all the people who say it has helped them?“People say they feel better when they’re on the carnivore diet, and that’s not something that we should dismiss,” Dr Emma Beckett, an adjunct senior lecturer in nutrition at the University of New South Wales, says. They commonly mention less brain fog, more energy, improved sleep and better skin health.“But feeling better is only part of health, and we can’t feel things like our arteries getting clogged and … our blood pressure going up, so just feeling better doesn’t mean you’re necessarily doing yourself any favours in the long term,” Beckett says.UK-based nutritionist Dr Richie Kirwan has called the carnivore diet the world’s most hectic elimination diet – a kind of diet used in medicine to figure out which foods people are having adverse reactions to. “That explains why people feel better on it, because if you’re responding negatively to a food, cutting it out will make you feel better,” Beckett says.But with elimination diets, foods are gradually reintroduced – which is not happening with the carnivore diet. Instead, people continue eating a low-diversity diet.Is the carnivore diet dangerous?Some of the benefits influencers claim might actually be red flags, Beckett points out. She takes particular umbrage with Ma’s claim that she never farts and only poos once a week. “This is the weirdest brag ever, because we need to fart andwe need to poop, and if you are not farting, then there is something not right in your gastrointestinal tract.”Associate professor Emma Halmos, a research dietitian at Monash University, clinically sees a lot of patients who have followed the carnivore diet and similar variations (keto and paleo) who are not eating enough fibre and have subsequently developed gastrointestinal symptoms or gastrointestinal disease. As a dietitian who only sees people with gastrointestinal conditions, she acknowledges there is a bias.Often her clients have gone on the carnivore diet because they believe it is healthy and will help them lose weight. Because the carnivore diet is a zero carbohydrate diet, people can lose weight on it, but that doesn’t make it a healthy diet, Halmos says.People can only absorb about 30 grams of protein in a sitting, Halmos says. The body excretes the protein it doesn’t absorb. When there are very large amounts, it can have negative effects, particularly for the large intestine, which goes through a process called putrefaction. “What that means is that it suppresses good bacteria and it changes the pH of the bowel so that nasties can grow,” Halmos says. The theory is that too much excreted protein can lead to bowel disease but we don’t have the evidence to back that up, she says.How much meat is healthy?TheAustralian Guide to Healthy Eatingrecommends up to three serves of meat or meat alternatives a day. “Three serves is way, way, way less than what we think,” Halmos says. Having meat once a day for most people would actually tick their requirements, meaning a lot of us actually exceed our requirements for meat,” she says.The fact that some carnivores have turned to the diet after being vegan, Beckett says, “speaks to what are the real motivations for following the diet. Is it truly about health? Or is it about having a simple set of rules to follow … It creates a sense of community.”A lot of people have decision fatigue where there’s so many food choices to make, and these diets make life feel easier, Beckett says. She recommends if people feel overwhelmed they can consult a health practitioner such as a dietitian who can help them develop what’s known as “nutritional self-efficacy”: feeling that you have the skills and the confidence to be able to make food decisions in any given environment.Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporterAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Keir Starmer cannot afford to ignore itTue 2 Sep 2025 13.38 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 15.15 EDTShareZack Polanski’s landslideelectionas leader of the Green party marks a turning point for Britain’s fractured left. Young, rhetorically fluent and unafraid to cloak climate arguments in those about class, Mr Polanski is nothing if not ambitious. He sees his party not as a parliamentary pressure group but as areplacementfor Labour itself.His ascent might have seemed fanciful last July when Labour had just won a thumping majority. Yet Labourlanguishesin the polls. Sir Keir Starmer’s personal ratings have collapsed. On the extreme right Reform UK now boasts237,000 members, 870 councillors, and 10 councils under its control. The Greens have more MPs than ever before. And theuneasyleadership team of Jeremy Corbyn and Zara Sultana is preparing to launch a new party to Labour’s left. This is no longer political noise at the margins. This is about the structural failure of leadership at the centre.Sir Keir’s attempt to anchor Labour as a party of managerialism has created an ideological vacuum. He has offered nomoralproject, no radical agenda, no post-crisis settlement. In response to Nigel Farage’s rise, he has chosen not to confront the Reform UK leader’s rhetoric but toadopt it as his own, notably refusing to challenge the scapegoating of migrants.The consequence is that Reform has increasingly come to own the debate around immigration and national identity. And on the left, Mr Polanski and theCorbyn-Sultana projectsee their chance. Both seemopentocooperating. Both have the same analysis – what they consider to be Starmer’s vacuous centrism – but offer slightly different solutions. Mr Polanski speaks of a climate-anchored politics rooted in solidarity with workers andmigrants. Mr Corbyn brings anti-imperialism and name recognition; Ms Sultana brings radical identity politics. These insurgents claim to represent the 99%. They appeal to younger, disillusioned voters and are building parallel movements.The paradox is that while Britain’s left is surging it remains splintered. Mr Polanski calls for an “intellectual coalition” rather than an electoral one – a reminder that one has to win the battle of ideas before being able to win power. The Greens took second place in40 Westminster seatsat the last election. Mr Corbyn is already drawing thousands to public meetings. Yet both risk mimicking Reform’s effect on the right: successful enough to weaken Labour, but not presently coherent enough to win power.More than one in five voterssaythey’d consider backing a new leftwing party. While Mr Polanskiappealsbeyond the Greens, the Corbyn allyJames Schneidercalls for a deeper break with Labourism and electoralism. He suggests a left project that unites the dispossessed – low-paid workers, precarious graduates and racialised communities – through grassroots organising and alternative models of government rooted in agency, not just representation.Sir Keir’sretreatinto economic orthodoxy and cautious incrementalism has allowed insurgents, most obviously on the right, to set the terms of debate. He now faces a left rebelling not just against injustice but Labour’s growing irrelevance. Crucially, a new form of mass politics has given rise to movements – fromPalestinian solidarityto climate activism to anti-austerity – that the Labour leadership refuse to assimilate. Labour’s defence of an old order that is crumbling away has only helped Mr Polanski. Unless Sir Keir reclaims the narrative terrain and offers transformative policies – and fast – British politics will not see only realignment but rupture.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And ‘golden hellos’ won’t solve the problem on their ownTue 2 Sep 2025 13.38 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 15.15 EDTShareDisadvantaged primary school pupils at the government’s first wave of new breakfast clubs can expect to be trained in toothbrushing, as well as fed. Data showing that a fifth of all five-year-olds in England have experienced tooth decaypersuaded ministersto make improved oral health part of the early years and reception class curriculum. But the prevalence of decay is not evenly spread across the country. And research showing how much worse the situation is for children in deprived areas is in line with other findings about widening health inequalities.New analysis from the Local Government Association highlights thediffering availability of dental careacross council areas – a situation sometimes described as adental divide. It found no specific correlation between the numbers of NHS dentists and young children with tooth decay. But it adds to a body of research showing that people in poorer areas are generally less well provided for. In Middlesbrough, for example, there are just 10 NHS dental practices per 100,000 people, while in wealthy Richmond upon Thames there are 28.Health inequalities are, of course, nothing new. Ensuring a more equitable distribution of healthcare – one of the greatest of all social goods – was Labour’s aim when setting up the National Health Service in the first place. But as the number of people living indeep povertyhas increased, while healthcare costs and expectations have risen,disparities in health experiencesand outcomes between people from different socioeconomic backgrounds have become more starkly apparent. This includes a widening gap in life expectancies.Deprivation is not clearly related to the provision of all NHS services.Data on diagnostic waitssuggests a fairly even picture across England (since health is devolved, data in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is captured separately). But along with A&E admissions, which are nearly twice as high in the poorest communities, dentistry is an area in which geographical differences are troubling – and all the more so givenwell‑established linksbetween poverty and other diet-related health problems, including obesity.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has pledged toreform the dental contractwithin this parliament, and introduce a “tie-in” obliging dentists trained in the UK to work in the NHS for three years after qualifying. But it is hard to see how services in deprived areas will be improved unless funding for NHS dentistry is increased to the point where practices are viable without the cross‑subsidy provided by private patients. Currently, dentists’ reliance on fees is a strong incentive to work in areas with plenty of such patients.Theshift of £2.2bn of NHS spendingto poorer parts of the country, announced by the government in June, should make a difference to dentistry as well as health overall. But if gaps both in access and outcomes are to be narrowed, then funding for dentistry will need to be prioritised. Evidence so far suggests onlymodest take-upof a “golden hello” scheme of one‑off payments to reward dentists setting up practices in underserved areas. A parallel scheme to address localised GP shortages isat risk of being cut.A far higher proportion of dentistry than healthcare overall is delivered in the private sector. Another lesson to be drawn from “dental deserts” is about what happens when market forces, and not democratically accountable policymakers, are in charge.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Our bright, eager, quirky son left school at 16 with no qualifications, despite entering year seven with a reading age of 17.The sausage machine of education forbids second chances and assumes homogeneity. Epic bullying at school and online was remedied by our son still attending school (box ticked), but being left alone in a room for the final few months leading to hisGCSEs. Even prior to that, the system of negative points and petty uniform rules led to an attitude of resigned passivity and despair.Along with 30% of other 16-year-olds, he has failed English and maths, and joins them in the futile retake cycle until he’s 18.He is developmentally not ready for GCSE work: for the intensity, cramming and “learning for the test” that’s prescribed. He was exhausted by the cruelty of the bullying, yet no allowance was made for this. Instead he was praised for turning up at school to spend the days on his own.He asked why he was learning poems by rote, as he asked why he was learning fronted adverbials in year six. Even reading has now been targeted, with the introduction of Sparx Reader in addition to Sparx Maths. For my younger son, I have taken over the Sparx Reader, and my lifelong love of literature was tested to its limit to earn enough points to stave off a detention.Teachers are anxious, and the atmosphere and culture at school is one of fear. Fear and then relief that “my child hasn’t failed”. Our outmoded education system feels viscerally wrong and utterly joyless, and Caro’s children know it. We need a rethink. I have been radicalised by my son’s experiences – quite how we proceed to effect change is yet to be determined.Name and address suppliedYour article highlights the distress faced by many young people, yet it does not go far enough in questioning the assumptions underpinning our schooling system. As a consultant nurse and psychotherapist who has worked extensively in both schools and prisons and mental health services, I cannot ignore the institutional similarities: rigid timetables, enforced conformity and the pervasive use of shame as a behavioural tool. Some individuals adapt, even thrive, in such environments, but for many others the experience is terrifying, alienating and psychologically damaging. Their difficulties are too often pathologised, when in reality the issue lies in the system itself.Families who choose home education often face stigma, as though the decision signals deficiency in the child. This reflects a narrow view of learning that fails to account for individual differences. The familiar defence of school as a place for “social interaction” is unconvincing; by that logic, prisoners should emerge from long sentences with exceptional interpersonal skills, which is rarely the case.The rise in school refusal should not be seen as a crisis of children’s resilience but as a warning sign that our educational model requires urgent reform. A hybrid approach – part-time attendance combined with home-based learning, supported by technology – would reduce pressure, foster autonomy and provide a healthier balance between structure and freedom.Denis McVeyOundle, NorthamptonshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

If he did so he would discover that those of faith are continually reminded to “show hospitality to strangers”(Hebrews 13:2)and “to provide the poor wanderer with shelter”(Isaiah 58:7). There are at least 30 verses in the Bible that encourage us to look after those seeking refuge.The problem Mr Tice faces is that the Bible is a very political book. It being so, he cannot be surprised that our archbishop is commenting on his party’s plans to deport asylum seekers who arrive in small boats. As Christians, we are called to love each other and to offer help to those who are suffering.I would be happy to welcome Mr Tice to our church should he wish to learn more about the Christian faith.Rev Richard StainerBradfield St George, SuffolkThe archbishop of York is right to call Reform UK’s immigration proposals short-term and isolationist. But words aren’t enough – the church must offer practical alternatives.One possibility is staring us in the face: our half-empty churches and cathedrals. These buildings have vast unused space, often with soaring ceilings. With modular pods or mezzanine units, living quarters could be installed above while worship continues below.This would reduce reliance on hotels (saving the taxpayer millions), provide dignified accommodation and give historic buildings a renewed community purpose. Above all, it would embody the Christian principle of sanctuary in a way that is visible, practical and desperately needed.Sal MansfieldPill, SomersetHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

As a longtime advocate of such changes, and a former BBC newsreader, I can point to one very significant lacuna: the massive hole where counter‑arguments should be coming from ministers.IfKeir Starmerand his colleagues a) spoke about the importance of immigration to Britain’s economic and social wellbeing; b) pointed out that we actually receive and resettle fewer asylum seekers than peer countries such as Germany and France; c) praised the efforts of communities that welcome and integrate newcomers; and d) highlighted some of the success stories of immigrants or asylum seekers, media outlets such as the BBC would be obliged to cover it.Instead, they uphold a long and ignoble tradition of keeping stumm on the assumption that, if unaddressed, the issue will lose salience. This has the disadvantage of allowing toxic and fact-averse notions of “Britishness” to remain unchallenged, ready to be activated as sleeper frames by troublemakers such asNigel Farageand his acolytes, who now have the story effectively to themselves.

On reflection, I needn’t have done, but the chemical company rep was very generous with samples and lunch, and there was never any suggestion that they might be harmful.Now, after decades of practising the greenest chemistry I can, I know for sure thatPfasare entirely unnecessary; I have yet to find them particularly better or more economic in any of the many recipes for everyday useful stuff that I have worked on.

Eberechi Eze.Randal Kolo Muani. We’re hearing that Coventry has fallen. In the bottom corner of the screen a picture of Marc Guéhi would flash up now and then reproachfully, Guéhi wearing a strange, lost smile as though he has in fact died. And below it all the countdown clock replaced with the simple end‑of‑days message: WINDOW CLOSED.‘Forever grateful’: Isak makes belated attempt to rebuild bridges at NewcastleRead moreBut the man behind the desk was also right. Name a more sensational window. Or at least a more all-encompassing window, a sustained emotional, strategic, plot-driven entertainment product, all wrapped up in a single epic three-month tracking shot. So much so that the fact we now have to play an actual football season feels like being told you’ve got to go for a walk on Christmas morning after opening all your presents by 8.30am, already crashing through the floor on chocolate orange segments.We must recite the numbers now, because the Premier League’s numbers are, as ever, boom‑time numbers. A record £3.1bn spent! A record £1.4bn trading loss! The Premier League’s top five spent more, gross, on players than all the big five leagues combined. Reeling this off is like striding the floor of some wild early noughties boiler room trading room. Ring the bell. Unleash the cocaine leopards. Cue the champagne-spraying montage, the rueful voiceover about FBI investigations.At this point it is also necessary to answer two key questions. First, who won the window? Because the window can and will be won. Goals, pots, balance sheets will tell us this. And second, what does it mean? Is it real? Is this rising balloon territory, all dangling guy ropes and ever-thinning air? Are we in fact heading for the fall? The second of these is easier to answer, because essentially it doesn’t matter. This is all real because the Premier League says it’s real. There has been a sense of collective hysteria around the window, fans, players, owners, the media losing their minds in concert. But this is also a design feature. The Premier League is an entertainment exchange, its income related directly to the level of reach, grab, eyeballs.The excitement is in itself exciting, the conversation a self‑fuelling resource, the endless outraged inventory-taking of player-grabs and commercial wins oddly reminiscent of the online claustrophobia of Covid times. Kneel before my tinned tomato armoury. Behold how much toilet roll I now have.Does hard value actually matter in this environment? The Premier League has once again triumphantly asset-stripped the Bundesliga. Bournemouth are paying bigger wages than most of Serie A. Ligue 1 made a £250m profit in this window, the Premier League a £1.4bn loss and this will always be seen as victory, even if it doesn’t in reality reflect an endless hoarding of superstar talent.For all the money circulating through its books this summer the Premier League clubs signed only two players from last year’s Ballon d’Or top 25, Florian Wirtz and Viktor Gyökeres, and none from the top 10.Hugo Ekitiké, the third biggest transfer feeof the greatest transfer window in history, is a very good player. But he is yet to win a senior France cap. Alexander Isak, jewel of the window, a footballing Helen of Troy, is also, we are repeatedly told, the best centre‑forward in Europe. Is he, though? Europe doesn’t think so. Europe thinks this is Ousmane Dembélé, Kylian Mbappé, Erling Haaland, Harry Kane or even Robert Lewandowski (37 years old, 44 goals last season).View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace’s decision to cancel Marc Guéhi’s move to Liverpool was deadline day’s big story.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesAgain, it doesn’t really matter. What matters is the hard commercial activity. If there is hysteria here, that hysteria is a key tool in the Premier League’s self-fuelling supremacy. For the first time this summer there is sense the window has been properly weaponised as a part of the product, club rivalries, social media dominance, global interest channelled through its endless drama. Anecdotally, the Premier League transfer window has generated greater online reach than either the men’s Club World Cup or the women’s Euros, both of which are actual football competitions.Everyone is dragged into this now, from the new superstar-owner dynamic and the dilution of managerial authority, down to broadcasters and journalists whose reputations now fall or rise on predictions over player sales, something that is particularly odd because often this isn’t really journalism at all; not triple-sourcing or the highlighting of inconvenient facts, but access in return for repeating what you’re told, a channel-for-hire in the negotiating process.In the middle of all this daily subplots and narrative devices have flared up. Tantrum Transfers? Is this a thing now? Not really. We definitely have a lot more public access to tantrums. But hanging on to a player who wants to leave for a record fee seems more novel as behaviours go, something only a bottomlessly wealthy sovereign wealth fund would entertain to this degree.Player power? Is this now the scourge of the game? The boundless arrogance of the modern superstar? Not really, either. Players have always moved, and asked to move, and been duly traded in for other men. Money doesn’t just talk loudest, it’s the only conversation in the end, as it always has been.Which is all very well. But who won the window? The obvious answer is Liverpool, because they signed the most eye-catching players while balancing the books expertly, and also triumphed in the weird arm wrestle with Newcastle’s ownership. Will this translate into footballing success? Have they overstacked some parts of the team? A reassuringly human drama must now play out. Isak hasn’t kicked a ball for four months, and must do so under a bizarrely overheated wall of noise. It will at the very least be fascinating viewing. Again, the product wins.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tottenham have recruited well.Xavi Simons could be a great signingwith a fair wind. Newcastle have a balanced team now, and a useful looking sense of shared rage. Fulham and Crystal Palace will be cast as window-losers. Both will probably be OK. Manchester United, who exist in their own self‑contained sphere of quirkiness, who are basically Phoebe in Friends now, havesigned a 23-year-old goalkeeper, which is pretty close to an act of sporting sadism.But in the end it is tempting to conclude the real winners of the greatest window are Chelsea, who haven’t just won the window but the entire summer. Chelsea made£90m from the Club World Cup. They sold more than £300m in unwanted footballers, a sign that having a wheeler-dealer in charge might actually be quite handy when you wheel as well as deal.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze made his Arsenal debut against Liverpool on Sunday after his big money move from Crystal Palace.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesMainly Chelsea won it because they have become the norm now, have turned everyone else into Chelsea, have turned out to have been operating ahead of the curve. It seems financial rules really are there to be disrupted. Win that new US-facing jolly. Sell a building. Sell the women’s team. Employ a manager who will gleefully wield the cleaver. Mainly Chelsea seem to have understood before everyone else one key structural driver behind the summer’s hyper‑commerce, the fact PSR rules are malleable, that the way to make them work for you is to just keep trading, keep shifting money around.And in this respect football is once again telling us things. There is a fascinating parallel to be drawn between the luminous global financial success of the Premier League and the concurrent financial contraction, the social failure of the nation that houses it. Why has one of these things had a 20‑year boom, the other a 20‑year slump? Perhaps the best way to see the football bubble is as a version of the London housing market, which has been about to burst for 30 years now, but which won’t burst because it isn’t really about actual supply and demand or rational economic rules. It is instead a place to rest money, to invest and make profit. Its units, player sales or house sales, are really just a stake to enter the game, exchangeable for other vouchers, a self-funding set of casino chips.Predictions of doom will always swirl. There are vast amounts of outstanding transfer fees in the works, some say more than £3bn in money on tick. What if someone goes bust? What about the domino effect? But money is too big now. It feels self-supporting at this level of income. The Premier League spent £1bn on its own players this window. What does it matter what price it puts on their heads? This is internal circulation, a global-scale sporting economy.There is an echo here of what one of the Premier League’s US owners once said privately about buying major assets in a time of quantitative easing. That money has to go somewhere. Just keep moving it on and nobody actually loses. This may or may not turn out to be voodoo economics, pre‑crash talk while others race towards a cliff. But for now at least we are all Chelsea, all passengers inside that same self-inflating bubble.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowcommentShareReuse this content"

Up a game point in his opening service game, the Spaniard skipped around the ball from far behind the baseline in his backhand corner and attempted the riskiest shot possible, unleashing a remarkable forehand winner.This would not be the last time that the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd collectively gasped at Alcaraz’s greatness as he continued to radiate confidence and calm in New York, moving effortlessly into the semi‑finals with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 win against Jiri Lehecka.Jessica Pegula sweeps past Barbora Krejcikova and into US Open semi-finalsRead more“Today I played [an] almost perfect match,” Alcaraz said. “Playing in a quarter-final of a grand slam, I’m feeling like: ‘OK, just two more steps and let’s see what happens.’ I’m feeling great and hungry to make it.”This tournament has further underscored the ease and confidence surrounding Alcaraz’s tennis. Having reached the finals of his past seven tournaments while leading the tour with 59 match wins and six titles, this is the most consistent stretch of the 22-year-old’s career and he has played with total freedom over the past 10 days. He has now reached a grand slam semi-final without dropping a set for the first time in his career.Still, Alcaraz began the match fully conscious of the fact that Lehecka represented his toughest opponent so far and things could be different. The talented 23-year-old has been on the verge of breaking through for some time. He is armed with a powerful first serve and a destructive forehand. At the Qatar Open in February, the Czech toppled Alcaraz in three sets.This time, Alcaraz set the tone immediately by breaking Lehecka’s serve in the opening game. Across nearly two hours, he never let up. Alcaraz served spectacularly well, marching through his service games, his variety of shot contrasted starkly with Lehecka’s one-note attack. His defence made the court seem so narrow for his challenger.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz serves to Jiri Lehecka in front of a large Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd.Photograph: Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter two convincing sets, where Alcaraz broke in the opening service game and never looked back, the third set particularly demonstrated his growth. Lehecka played his best set of the match, moving through his own service games and putting pressure on Alcaraz.In the past, Alcaraz may have lost focus. On this occasion, the moment Lehecka began to show nerves, he pounced. At 4-4, instead of searching for a highlight-reel winner, Alcaraz locked down his game, making deep returns and offering up no free errors. He broke Lehecka’s serve with a spectacular defensive effort, celebrating with a roar.Alcaraz’s greater consistency has also been a result of improvements to his serve. He had opted to significantly change his service motion during his pre-season and over the course of this year it has become increasingly dependable. Against Lehecka, he landed 63% of his first serves, won 84% of first serve points and 41% of his serves went unreturned, an extremely healthy serving day that ended with him not facing a single break point in the match.Quick GuideDraper out of Davis Cup tie against PolandShowJack Draper will miss Great Britain's Davis Cup tie against Poland next weekend through injury.The world No 5 pulled out of the US Open ahead of his scheduled second-round match because of a flare-up of the bone bruising in his left arm that had kept him sidelined since Wimbledon.The Davis Cup World Group match in Gdynia on 12-13 September comes too soon for Draper, with questions marks over when he will be able to return.Davis Cup captain Leon Smith said: \"It goes without saying that obviously it's a real shame that we can't call upon Jack Draper to be in the team with his injury and of course we wish him the best with his recovery and for the rest of the season.\"In Draper's absence, Cameron Norrie will lead Britain's team alongside Jacob Fearnley, while there are three debutants named in Wimbledon doubles champions Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool plus Arthur Fery.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I’ve been improving a lot, and just every practice, every match I’ve been trying to feel more comfortable with the movement, with hitting good serves, and the percentage as well, it’s really important,” Alcaraz said.“Tennis, it’s really hard sometimes, because one day you can serve really, really well, and the next match you can feel completely different and really bad. I’m trying to maintain focus on the serve, trying to do everything the same and getting the good feeling.”Even for Alcaraz, who continues to pile up big titles at a faster rate than anyone else in the world, his recent efficiency has been striking. He has always been prone to dramatic moments of self-sabotage. The next step in Alcaraz’s career was learning how to perform more consistently, allowing him to preserve his mental and physical energy for his biggest rivals. As he moves closer to a potential sixth grand slam title, his progress is undeniable.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Carlos AlcarazUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

A private jet had also been lined up to take Guéhi to Merseyside that evening. There is no suggestion that he will not play for Palace again, although one source close to Guéhi has said that he is considering whether to continue as captain.In stark comparison to Alexander Isak – who in effect went on strike to force throughhis move to Anfield– the former Chelsea player is said to feel that he acted correctly during all the transfer speculation by continuing to play for Palace. Other members of the squad are also believed to be upset that Guéhi was denied his move.Liverpool could attempt to sign Guéhi again in the January transfer window, although he will also be able to sign a pre-contract agreement for an overseas club. Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus are believed to have expressed an interest.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceLiverpoolTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

The four-time Tour de France winner also sustained a pericardial rupture, a tear to the sac that surrounds the heart, in the crash.“It was obviously a lot more serious than some broken bones,” his wife, Michelle Froome,told the Times. “He’s fine, but it’s going to be a long recovery process. He won’t be riding a bike for a while.”Jay Vine takes Vuelta stage nine as Juan Ayuso attacks UAE team ‘dictatorship’Read moreFroome was airlifted to the Sainte‑Anne military hospital, in the Var, the highest‑level trauma centre in that part of France. His team, Israel-Premier Tech, had stated initially that the 40-year-old had sustained a collapsed lung, five broken ribs and a lumbar vertebrae fracture.Last spring, Froome was reluctant to speculate on his retirement date. “I haven’t 100% decided that I’ll be retiring at the end of this year,” he said. “Chances are, yes, I’ll be calling it a day, but I’m just keeping the door open.”However, the gravity of the injuries he suffered in the crash has now increased speculation that he may soon announce his retirement from racing.Meanwhile, the Dutch sprinter Olav Kooij, teammate of Jonas Vingegaard at Visma-Lease a Bike, overhauled Norway’s Tord Gudmestad to win the opening stage of the 2025 men’sTour of Britainin Southwold.View image in fullscreenOlav Kooij (left) edges out Tord Gudmestad on the line in Southwold.Photograph: Stephen Pond/Getty ImagesKooij, who took four stage wins in the 2023 edition of the race, picked up where he left off on the Suffolk coast, but only after overhauling a violent acceleration from the Decathlon‑AG2R La Mondiale rider.“It was a lot of headwind after the last corner and a little rise as well,” Kooij said. “It was a bit of a waiting game, to make the last push in the final few metres. Gudmestad was really strong, but he was pushing into the wind and I had some slipstream from him. I had enough in the legs to get past him.”Kooij has already set his sights on adding to his British win tally. “I don’t think I’ll beat getting four wins like I did a few years ago,” he said.Geraint Thomas, riding his final professional race, almost missed the start to his own farewell party after his flight to Stansted airport, late on Monday evening, was delayed.“I wasn’t sure if I was going to get here yesterday, with the flights and stuff,” he said before the stage. “Flights were being cancelled all over the place.”In the end, Thomas arrived at his race hotel in the early hours of the morning and got only a few hours sleep.“The main thing is enjoying it, really making the most of it. I’m not really in the shape to win myself, but we’ve got some good guys here to perform,” he said of his Ineos Grenadiers team. The 39-year-old finished 25sec behind the leaders on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsCyclingChris FroomeTour of BritainnewsShareReuse this content"

The US international, sitting relaxed on the 3G pitch at Chelsea’s Cobham training ground, bits of the rubber crumb being squeezed between her fingers, does not hesitate before answering.“We feel like we have another level we can get to,” she says. “It’s not about how we maintain this level but how we continue evolving and keep getting better. Having that mentality is always better than focusing on making sure no one catches us.Women’s Super League 2025-26 previews No 4: ChelseaRead more“If you ask any one of us, we feel like last year we could have played better, we could have had better performances so continuing to evolve as a team and continuing to get better is what we’re going to prioritise.”Chelsea did not only win the league, they went through the wholedomestic campaign unbeaten and won the FA Cup and League Cuptoo. True they did not have the best of performances at times, but they still won, and won, and won, powered by a mentality not dissimilar to that seen in the US women’s national team. “That’s what I was gonna say,” says Girma when that is put to her. “That’s my favourite type of way to be, to play: never say die, ’til the final minute keep pushing, never give up.“That is the mentality I have been raised with and try to bring to a team. So, whenever you’re around a group that believes that and is trying to put that into every single game, every single session, that just brings out the best in you and the group. It’s one of my favourite parts of this club.”View image in fullscreenNaomi Girma and compatriot Catarina Macario pose with Chelsea’s 2024-25 trophy haul.Photograph: Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesGirma arrived from San Diego Wave in January with a record-breaking price tag and a stellar reputation that set expectations high. In the middle of the NWSL off-season, her final league match played in October 2024, hitting the ground running was always going to be tough. “It’s definitely awkward timing, coming in in the off-season,” she says.“No one will ever expect more from me than I do for myself. All of those expectations from other people were there, but I wanted myself to come in and make an impact as much as I can, more than anyone else. I got injured, that’s soccer, and it was about having perspective. I didn’t come here to play for six months, I’m here for four years now so, while it’s hard in the moment, this was a long-term decision and a place where I see myself playing and getting better for a while.”Leaving California, where she was born, grew up, studied and played, for Chelsea, felt right. “The decision to try something new and leave was just me wanting to challenge myself, to push myself out of my comfort zone,” says the 25-year-old defender. “It felt like the right time in my career to take that jump, post-Olympics felt like a good time to transfer and get settled somewhere new, and then Chelsea specifically just always stood out to me as a club.”Two US internationals at Chelsea, Mia Fishel – now at Seattle Reign – and Cat Macario, helped sell the club to Girma. “I obviously knew so many of the players who play here,” says Girma. “Some I knew personally, some I just had played against, and just the culture, the environment, being in London, it all just felt right to me, so that’s why I chose to come.”There were pros and cons to arriving in January, on the one hand you enter midway through a campaign, but on the other hand it provides a distraction. “Moving is always difficult,” says Girma. “It’s always going to be a step out of your comfort zone, but coming in in January you’re kind of thrown into things right away and you just have to figure everything out immediately. You don’t have time to think about it.“You’re just like: I’m here. We have games. I need to be ready. Now, I have a full off-season too and getting to build through pre-season has been really nice. I already know the staff and the players going into a pre-season and it feels like you know, I’ve been on the team for a while. So, there’s advantages.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s great if I’m doing it but the more players we have the better, so hopefully working towards hubs throughout the US will mean getting to work with more players,” she says.TV viewing figures for the NWSL are down: is there cause for concern?Read moreBack in the present, at Chelsea, on the pitch it didn’t take long for things to flow and relationships to feel normal. “I actually felt comfortable pretty quickly playing with them,” says Girma. “I feel like towards the end of last season it felt normal. That’s a testament to them, the communication style and the way we kind of mesh together.”Working with a manager, in Sonia Bompastor, who played in defence herself is a bonus. “I really wanted to develop as a player where I was moving to. To have a manager who played in defence always helps in terms of working on the littlest of things and tweaking certain things that just make us that little percentage better.”The rest of the WSL – and Europe – have been warned.Explore more on these topicsChelsea WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Several squad members, with two selected for this series opener, were engaged in that competition’s final as recently as 48 hours earlier and in their absence the team’s first training session on Sunday was attended by just a handful of players, their second had less than two-thirds of the squad present, and the outcome was a powder‑puff display against match-honed and whip‑smart opponents.Harry Brook described talk of his team’s poor build-up as “an excuse” and insisted: “We’re not a team that makes excuses. We’re a team that tries to play our best cricket as much as possible. We’ve just got to crack on now and put that performance behind us.”Until they lost two wickets in two balls with the scores tied and the die cast the tourists’ performance had been as blemish‑free as England’s was error‑strewn. The home side’s collapse was hastened by some excellent fielding, with outstanding catches from Corbin Bosch to dismiss Jamie Smith – who later produced a superb grab of his own to end Markram’s rampage on 86 – and from Markram himself, diving to his left at slip, to account for Jofra Archer, as well as an excellent throw from Tristan Stubbs to facilitate Brook’s run-out.View image in fullscreenAiden Markram drives on his way to a rapid 86 during South Africa’s victory against England.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThe ICC’s rankings make Keshav Maharaj officially the best bowler in the world in this format and the spinner bewitched England across 33 deliveries that brought four wickets and the home side to their knees. On a pitch that offered no demons and an outfield that gave no encouragement to chasing fielders a superficially strong side folded feebly, losing their last seven wickets for just 29 runs. Maharaj said his side did not believe England’s half-baked preparations indicated they had been underestimated, but notably put their good performance down to “the guys putting in a lot of work, not just prior to this series but prior to Australia as well”.England’s efforts started badly, with Ben Duckett caught behind in the third over for just five, and improved only moderately from there before nosediving theatrically once Maharaj was introduced. Only four players reached double figures and Smith alone, with a score of 54, managed more than 15. But it was the opener who precipitated the collapse when, having reached his half-century from 46 balls, carefully laying the groundwork for a potentially match-defining contribution, he got out almost immediately.That took England’s score to 102 for four and their partnerships from there contributed five, 10, two, nothing, 12 and nothing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was pressure he struggled to handle and his first four overs duly went for 56, with Markram alone scoring 45 of them, though he improved in returning for three more after a change of ends.“He got a bit of tap at the start but the way he kept cracking on and digging deep was awesome to see and that’s exactly what we ask of every bowler,” Brook said. “He might have missed his execution the odd time but Markram played some unbelievably good shots as well, so hat’s off to him.”England might have shifted the momentum had the ball not bounced inches in front of Joe Root’s hands after Archer found Ryan Rickelton’s edge with the opener yet to score, or if they had reviewed an on-field not‑out decision when Archer trapped him lbw with his next ball. On a day of many failures, that one got lost in the deluge.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamSouth Africa cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

The West Ham forward’s legal team have also made written submissions to the commission and may contest the level of any fine imposed by the commission.Paquetá was cleared of spot-fixing following a two-yearinvestigation by the FAthat cost him an £85m move to Manchester City in August 2023. The 28-year-old continued to play for West Ham throughout the process, and expressed his gratitude to the club by kissing the badge and miming throwing away a mobile phone after scoring last weekend in the3-0 win at Nottingham Forest.Aston Villa made an attempt to sign Paquetá on loan last week, while Tottenham also made a tentative inquiry beforesigning Xavi Simonsfrom RB Leipzig, but neither proposed transfer came close to being finalised with the player happy to stay at the London Stadium.The publication of the independent commission’s full decision is also expected to include a recommendation on which party covers the costs of the case. West Ham were unhappy that Paquetá was charged on the basis of what they regarded as flimsy evidence, but have opted against taking legal action against the FA.After he was cleared of spot fixing, Paquetá said in a statement: “Since the first day of this investigation, I have maintained my innocence against these extremely serious accusations. I can’t say anything more at this time, but I would like to express how grateful I am to God and how eager I am to return to playing football with a smile on my face.“To my wife who never let go of my hand, to West Ham, to the fans who always cheered me on, and to my family, friends and the legal team who have supported me – thank you for everything.”The FA declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedThe FAnewsShareReuse this content"

We’re seeing greater accessibility and more personality creates more stars.”Players have been posing for selfies, signing autographs and, in the case of Japan, even bowing to the crowd to show their support. Gilpin insisted that it was making a huge difference to the vibe of the tournament with 90% of fans – many of whom had never been to a rugby game before – saying they would return.“I’ve been involved in a lot of Rugby World Cups,” said Gilpin. “I don’t think I’ve been involved in one with an atmosphere quite like this.”“Whether it’s the dancing between the teams after a match, the interaction with fans after the final whistle or their engagement individually on social media, it is a genie you can’t put back very easily in the bottle.“I hope that we continue to see that in the women’s game. And I hope that in the men’s game there’s some lessons or observations made of that. That it doesn’t have to be a performance inhibitor. If something is engaging fans, and creating joy for the players, maybe it’s something that can actually be a performance enablement.“When we get to the end of the tournament we’ll have some great content, some great facts and stats to really share as we look forward to the men’s edition in Australia in 2027.”World Rugby also confirmed that four of the final group games this weekend were expected to be sold out, but conceded that the attention the tournament has received had led to some players being trolled on social media.One of those affected, the Wales No 8 Georgia Evans, insisted that the abuse would not lead to her changing appearance, which includes wearing ribbons in her hair and make-up during matches.“In an old-school, man’s game, I’m bringing a bit of Barbie to the party,” she said in an Instagram post. “To those who don’t like it, that’s OK. To those who’ve shown love and support – thank you. Don’t worry, I won’t be changing.View image in fullscreenWales’ No 8 Georgia Evans warms up ahead of the match against Canada last weekend.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images“The bows in my hair, the tape on my arm, the eyelashes and full face of make-up I choose to wear – none of that affects my ability, passion, or fight for this game.”Yvonne Nolan, the competition director for the Women’s Rugby World Cup, said that they were using the AI service from Signify to weed out abuse and highlight the worst cases. “Unfortunately this is a societal issue, and unprecedented attention unfortunately brings some negatives with it,” she added. “We don’t accept it, we don’t tolerate it, and we will take action where we can.”Meanwhile Nicky Ponsford, director of high performance at World Rugby, said that the statistics showed that the women’s game was improving, with more action and less errors in the 2025 tournament compared to three years ago.“Bear in mind, we’ve increased from 12 to 16 teams. But we’re still seeing significant increases in performance. We’re seeing 22 more passes per match, so the quality of handling is improving, with three fewer knock-ons. There have also been 11 more rucks per match, three more kicks and three more tries per match.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025World RugbyWomen's rugby unionRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Important historically, geographically and politically. One of the city’s most famous sons, Arsène Wenger, as a boy, was so embedded that his first language was Low Alemannic German, not French. To use a word Wenger brought to the English football vernacular – footballistically – Strasbourg was never too much of a hub. The club reformed after liquidation as recently as 2011, having won just one French title back in 1979 when Wenger was a fringe player already embedded in coaching. In defence was the future France coach Raymond Domenech, thekeen astrologist in chargewhen a very Gallic bust-up ravagedLes Bleusat the 2010 World Cup.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreUntil now, though it is more correct to sayStrasbourghas become a football trading hub. As the summer transfer window SLAMMED SHUT on Monday, Racing Club de Strasbourg Alsace became a rather regular destination. In 2023, RC fell into the hands of BlueCo. Name familiar? The same US-based company had bought Chelsea from a sanctioned Roman Abramovich the previous year, beginning one of those multi-club arrangements causing untold trouble this summer. Like Girona with Manchester City, there is something of a familiar look to Strasbourg’s squad, pretty large for a club in the Conference League.Within the squad are Kendry Páez, an Ecuadorian teenager; Mamadou Sarr, French defender; Mike Penders, Belgian keeper. All are young players loaned byChelsea. Diego Moreira, a young Belgian wing-back, signed from Chelsea last year. Mathis Amougou, a young French midfielder signed from Chelsea this summer. Ishé Samuels-Smith, a young English defender signed from Chelsea in the summer, was sold back and then joined Swansea on loan. On Monday, Ben Chilwell, a not-so young English full-back, arrived from Chelsea for a two-year deal. Raheem Sterling is presumed to have refused to become a Eurostar loyalty card member.Thus, RC have become a repository for talent either too young or not good enough to play for Chelsea. Fans of the actual football club, rather than a warehousing facility, are unhappy and protesting. Until BlueCo swanned in, RC had enjoyed a fan-centric culture under the former West Ham player Marc Keller, chief executive since 2001 and a local hero who took the club from fourth tier to Ligue 1. After selling to BlueCo, Keller is now portrayed among some militant fans as the traitor to the collective. Last season saw goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic and winger Andrey Santos come to Strasbourg and go back to Chelsea. Similar traffic has followed, footballers reimagined as commodities bought and sold like pork bellies and frozen orange juice. Modern football is rubbish.QUOTE OF THE DAYWe’re all captivated by the journey of Wrexham. It’s been amazing for Welsh football and hopefully now in a number of years we’ll see young players coming through … There isn’t similarities to how I play to how Wrexham play. It’s different ways, no right or wrong way for this” – Craig Bellamy, the Wales manager, praises Wrexham’s rise under the co-ownership of Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.

The £850m estimate did not include legal costs or compensation claims, and doubts were raised by the NAO about the “completeness and accuracy” of the base figure.The NAO said: “The MoD estimates that, as of July 2025, the government had spent around £400m on resettling people through the ARR and that it would spend around a further £450m on the scheme.“The MoD estimated the costs to the whole of government to be £128,000 per resettled individual, of which an estimated £53,000 would be met by the MoD. At the time of publication, the MoD had not provided us with sufficient evidence to give us confidence regarding the completeness and accuracy of these estimates.”The spreadsheet accidentally shared by the MoD comprised 33,345 lines of data containing the names and contact details of applicants and, in some instances, information relating to the applicants’ family members.The NAO said the MoD did not record exactly how much it had spent on resettling people through the ARR scheme because it did not separately identify these costs in its accounting system.The government said it did this to maintain the secrecy of the ARR scheme whilea superinjunction was in placepreventing disclosure of both the data breach and the existence of the injunction itself.After the discovery of the data breach on 25 August 2023, the MoD had applied to the high court for an injunction to prevent the data loss becoming public. Seven days later, the court granted a superinjunction – which also prevented disclosure of the existence of the injunction itself, when a judge accepted the MoD’s assessment of risk to the safety and lives of many individuals and their families.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The defence secretary, John Healey, closed the ARR and the injunction on reporting was dropped in July.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the chair of the cross-party public accounts committee, said: “After the high court superinjunction was lifted earlier this year, confusion still remains over the reported £850m historic and future costs relating to the breach, with the MoD unable to provide sufficient assurance over their numbers.“This figure does not include all legal costs or compensation claims, which currently remain unknown.

The Israeli military has sought to displace people from the city before its offensive and has promised that southern Gaza would be able to accommodate them, despite experts disagreeing with the suggestion.“We wish to remind you that in al-Mawasi, enhanced services will be provided with an emphasis on access to medical care, water and food,” the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X on Tuesday afternoon.Israel continued to push ahead with its operation and began the mobilisation of tens of thousands of reservists on Tuesday.At least 60,000 reservists will be called up, with the service of an additional 20,000 to be extended as the Israeli military slowly ramps up its military activity inGazaCity, which it has described as the last stronghold of Hamas.Israel has said that the operation, known as Gideon’s Chariots II, to take over Gaza City will involve five divisions from the country’s standing army and could extend into next year.Already Israel has pushed into the western parts of Gaza City, levelling the once prosperous neighbourhood of Zeitoun and declaring the entire city a “dangerous combat zone” last week. It has intensified its strikes, claiming to have killed the spokesperson of Hamas’s armed wing, Abu Obeida, in a strike on an apartment building in Gaza City on Saturday.The Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 76 people across the Gaza Strip in the last 24 hours, Gaza health authorities said.On Monday, the world’s leading association of genocide scholars said Israel’s actions in Gazameet the legal definition of the crime. Aid groups have warned that an invasion of Gaza City and the forced displacement of about 1 million people could have devastating humanitarian consequences. The population of the city has swelled over the course of the last 23 months as it became a refuge for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced from the near 80% of Gaza that is under evacuation order.The city is already gripped by famine created by Israeli restrictions on aid entering Gaza, which experts say will worsen even in the absence of a military operation. Thirteen people, including three children, died from malnutrition on Tuesday, bringing the total number of people who have starved to death over the last 23 months to 361 – the majority of whom have died since July.Israel is seeking to forcibly displace Gaza City’s residents before its operation and has tried to entice Palestinians to southern Gaza, which already is packed with other displaced people.The head of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, said on Saturday that there is no safe way to conduct a mass evacuation of Gaza City and that no other part of Gaza had the capacity to absorb such mass displacement. Earlier in August, the UN human rights office spokesperson Thameen al-Kheetan said that Palestinians in al-Mawasi had “little or no access to essential services and supplies, including food, water, electricity and tents”.Many residents of Gaza City have refused to leave, suspicious of what awaits them in southern Gaza after Israel has attacked so-called humanitarian zones in the past.The Gaza City operation, pushed forward by the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from far-right members of his ruling coalition, faces stiff opposition at home. Tens of thousands of Israelis have marched across the country in protest against the war, which they say is aimless and endangers the lives of the remaining hostages in Gaza.Israeli media has reported internal opposition between the country’s cabinet and the military chief of staff. According to Israeli media’s retelling of a security cabinet meeting on Sunday, the Israeli military chief urged the government to take a ceasefire deal instead of pressing on with the Gaza City operation, which he said could harm the lives of hostages in Gaza.Hamas had accepted a ceasefire proposal two weeks prior that resembled an earlier US draft which Israel had approved in prior rounds of negotiations. Israel has yet to respond to the proposal, baffling mediators.Israel’s planned military operation in Gaza City as well as its continued systematic starving of the territory’s population has prompted a wave of global condemnation.Please don’t succumb to hopelessness over Palestine. Your voice can still make a difference | Arwa MahdawiRead moreOn Tuesday, Belgium announced it would join a growing list of European countries in recognising Palestine as a state. It also announced it would ban goods from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and designate Hamas leaders, violent Israeli settlers and two far-right Israeli ministers as persona non grata.“This is not about sanctioning the Israeli people but about ensuring that their government respects international and humanitarian law and taking action to try to change the situation on the ground,” the Belgian foreign minister, Maxime Prévot, said in a post on X. He added that the EU should suspend its trade pact with Israel to further pressure it.The move further increases the growing international isolation of Israel as its war in Gaza and subsequent famine grinds on.At least 63,633 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza over the last 23 months. Israel launched the war in Gaza afterHamas-led militants killed about 1,200 peopleand took 251 hostages on 7 October 2023.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

Ramsay and Chowns, who were standing as a co-leadership team, are two of the Greens’ four MPs.Polanski took nearly 85% of the votes on a turnout of just over 37%, notably higher than the 22% seen when the post was last contested in 2021.Greens take step into unknown with election of Zack Polanski as leaderRead moreSpeaking to a cheering crowd in London, the new leader promised to take on Reform and Labour, saying the Greens’ moment had come.“This is the Green party’s time. People in this country are exhausted. They are tired, they are sick of working long hours, and never feeling secure,” he said.“We know this political space has been ripe for charlatans like Nigel Farage and Reform millionaires who are pretending to serve working-class communities but are actually backed by the same billionaires who are destroying our democracies, our communities and our planet. So it is an absolute moral responsibility in this moment for the Green party to step up with the bold politics.”On Starmer, he said: “My message to Labour is very clear: we are not here to be disappointed by you. We are not here to be concerned by you. We are here to replace you.”Saying he wanted the Greens to aim for more than 30 seats at the next election, Polanski said he would not prop up a new Starmer government, adding: “I cannot imagine any scenario in which I would want to work with Keir Starmer.”While a Polanski winhad been increasingly expectedby party insiders, the result – with Ramsay and Chowns winning only 5% of the possible votes from an electorate of just over 64,500 – was particularly emphatic.Graph showing candidates’ vote shareIt heralds what could be a markedly new chapter for the party, abandoning its longstanding focus on building up councillor and MP numbers in favour of a more radical, media-focused approach.While Polanski has said he will still concentrate on electoral gains, his hope is to accelerate Green advances by adopting a more visible and sometimes combative tone in media appearances, with the hope of mimicking Reform’s rapid advances under Nigel Farage.Answering media questions after his victory speech, Polanski said the success of Farage in getting his message across to voters was “throwing down the gauntlet” to other parties: “It’s time to be really ambitious, and to be visionary … Let’s raise our communications game. Let’s raise the boldness of our messaging.”Ramsay and Chownspreviously saidwhile they acknowledged Polanski’s communication skills – he is a former actor – they were concerned his more overtly leftwing approach could put off moderate voters, especially in the sort of rural seats they represent in parliament.Asked whether he would cooperate with the new leftwing party being launched by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, Polanski said it was too early to talk about alliances, and also a matter for the wider party. It was better, he said, to think of “intellectual coalitions”.He said he had talked to Corbyn about an inquiry into the situation in Gaza proposed by the former Labour leader: “We don’t need to be in the same party for me to support that. We don’t even need to be ‘allies’ for me to support that. What I see is a politician who is doing strong, principled work that aligns with the things I care about and the party cares about, and I think that’s different.”Corbyn congratulated Polanski in apost on X, saying: “I look forward to working with you to create a fairer, kinder world.”Ellie Reeves, the Labour chair, also congratulated him but said the new Green leader “must level with the British people” about whether he backed continued Nato membership, after hesaid during the campaignthat Donald Trump’s approach made this unfeasible.After a sometimes bruising campaign, Polanski paid tribute to all the party’s MPs, particularly Ramsay, who was first elected as a councillor two decades ago.He ended his speech with an appeal for voters enthused by his message to sign up: “If you’re feeling hopeless, if you’re feeling in despair, if you’re feeling politically homeless, there is a political home for you.“I promise you nothing will make you feel more inspired, more ready to get out there, and more like we can turn our country around than joining the Green party. So join the Green party today.”Explore more on these topicsGreen partyAdrian RamsayEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a shallow earthquake, taking place just six miles beneath the Earth’s surface, which is known to have a particularly destructive impact.On Tuesday, a second earthquake, of magnitude 5.5, also at a shallow depth of six miles, shook south-eastern Afghanistan, prompting fears of further damage and destruction.‘The walls collapsed around me’: Afghans describe quake devastationRead moreBefore the second quake the death toll had passed 1,411 with more than 3,000 people injured, Zabihullah Mujahid, aTalibangovernment spokesperson, said on Tuesday.Authorities said they expected casualties to rise further once rescue teams reached more isolated locations, many which were still inaccessible more than 24 hours after the first earthquake struck.Aseel, a humanitarian tech platform with networks around Afghanistan that has sent teams to the affected areas, said more people had been injured in the second quake, which was expected to push the death toll higher.View image in fullscreenPeople bury earthquake victims in Kunar, Afghanistan. The death toll is expected to rise.Photograph: Samiullah Popal/EPASharafat Zaman, a spokesperson for the health ministry in Kabul, called for international aid to tackle the devastation. “We need it because here lots of people lost their lives and houses,” he said.Afghanistan had already been suffering from a severe economic crisis and a crippling withdrawal of international aid after thetakeover of the country by the Taliban in 2021. Hardline Taliban policies, such as aban on female educationand employment, have resulted in a sharp drop in international aid funding and humanitarian assistance to the country.The disaster will further stretch the resources of the war-torn nation’s Taliban administration, which is also grappling with the return of hundreds of thousands ofAfghans deported by Iran and Pakistanin recent weeks.The Sunday quake razed three villages in Kunar and caused substantial damage in many others, authorities said. At least 610 people were killed in Kunar and there were 12 dead in Nangarhar, they added.View image in fullscreenPeople bury earthquake victims in Kunar, Afghanistan. Rescuers were still battling to reach some remote locations on Tuesday.Photograph: Samiullah Popal/EPAGhazi Abad village, in the Nurgal district of Kunar, was a scene of devastation, the entire village destroyed. Homes had been reduced to rubble and many residents remained trapped under the debris.Some villagers sat weeping amid the piled ruins of their homes. Others began laboriously clearing the debris by hand, or carried out the injured on makeshift stretchers.“There is not a single standing room visible in this village,” said one resident, Abdullah. “The aftermath of the disaster suggests that life here was ended in mere seconds.”Abdullah said adjoining villages had also suffered similar fates, completely levelled as the earthquake reduced every home to ruins. “The full extent of the earthquake’s impact will become clearer in the coming days as recovery efforts continue and many are still trapped,” he said.“The losses are huge, people have no food and safe drinking water. While rescue operations are lacking, people are banding together to search for survivors and recover bodies all day and night. In one household there is no one left, everyone died here and their cattle are left alone.”Another survivor said: “We need ambulances, we need doctors, we need everything to rescue the injured and recover the dead.”In Kunar, the dead, some of them children, were wrapped in white shrouds by villagers who prayed over their bodies before burying them, while helicopters ferried the wounded to hospitals.Rescuers were battling to reach remote mountainous areas cut off from mobile networks along the Pakistani border but their efforts were impeded by heavy rain, which heightened the risk of landslides and left many roads impassable. Military rescue teams fanned out across the region, the defence ministry said, with 40 flights carrying away 420 wounded and dead.View image in fullscreenA man stands amid the rubble of a collapsed house. India, China and Britain are among the countries who have promised aid.Photograph: Sayed Hassib/ReutersExperts urged the international community to step in and provide support, emphasising that the country’s rescue and relief organisations were barely functional.“The funds of the Afghan government that have been frozen by the US and other countries should be disbursed to international organisations that are carrying out relief work in Afghanistan,” said Osama Malik, an expert in international law. “The Pakistani government should also halt Afghan deportations at such a critical time when Afghanistan will be unable to manage an influx.”On Monday, Britain set out emergency funding support for those affected by the recent earthquakes, saying it would ensure that the aid did not go to the Taliban administration by channelling it through its partners.The US state department posted its condolences on X on Monday for the loss of life but did not immediately respond when asked if the US would provide any assistance.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanEarthquakesSouth and central AsiaTalibannewsShareReuse this content"

The ruling, one of the most significant antitrust cases in decades, resulted in an additional hearing in April to determine what actions the government should take as a remedy.Mehta’s decision to allow Google to keep Chrome represents a more lenient outcome for the company thanwhat federal prosecutors requested: force the tech giant sell off its marquee search product and to ban it from entering the browser market for five years. In his 230-page ruling, Mehta stated that prosecutors “overreached in seeking forced divesture of these key assets”.AlthoughGoogleescaped the most serious consequences of its antitrust violations, Mehta’s ruling sided with prosecutors in barring the company from entering or maintaining exclusive contracts relating to the distribution of its products including Chrome, Google Assistant and the Gemini app. The ruling does not bar Google from making any payments to distributors, however, stating that a broad payment ban would create downstream harms.Google’s shares rose in after-hours trading following Mehta’s decision, a sign that investors believe the outcome favorable to Google.The ruling drew criticism from the American Economic Liberties project, a non-profit advocacy group, which called it a “complete failure”.“You don’t find someone guilty of robbing a bank and then sentence him to writing a thank you note for the loot,” said Nidhi Hegde, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project. “Similarly, you don’t find Google liable for monopolization and then write a remedy that lets it protect its monopoly.”Google argued in the antitrust case, which firstwent to trial in 2023, that its dominance over search was not related to anticompetitive behavior but simply the result of producing a better product.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That money should be spent fixing our broken water infrastructure, not trying to deny the scale of the problem.”Top of the list isThames Water, which incurred £7,528,266.40 in such legal fees over the past five years – £5,002,664.26 on enforcement of regulatory breaches by Ofwat, £2,451,177.47 contesting Environment Agency investigations and £74,424.67 contesting fines from the Drinking Water Inspectorate.The debt-ridden company is currentlypleading with the governmentto be let off fines and costs to prevent it falling into special administration. It chief executive, Chris Weston,recently toldthe Efra committee that overall regulatory liabilities could reach £1bn over the current price review period.Ofwat imposed a record £104m fineon Thames Water in May over environmental breaches involving sewage spills, after it failed to operate and manage its treatment works and wastewater networks effectively. A further £18.2m fine was levied for breaking dividend rules, the first penalty of its kind in the water industry. Ofwat said the company had paid out cash to investors despite having fallen short in its services to customers and its environmental record.Water companies have also spent money contesting claims from local people and campaigners. South WestWater, for example, spent £17,380 challenging five loss-of-amenity claims initiated by customers over the five-year period.Southern Water spent £2.6m on external legal fees relating to seven regulatory actions. In all of them, the company said it had pleaded guilty as “early as possible”. “In accordance with our obligations under the sentencing guidelines [we] have engaged external legal counsel to act on our behalf to provide the courts with information on culpability, harm, aggravating factors, mitigation and other relevant matters,” it said.It was announced in March that Yorkshire Water would pay a £40m fine after an Ofwat investigation found the company had discharged wastewater for an average of seven hours a day in 2023, with almost half of the sewage spills in breach of regulations that allow dumping only in exceptional circumstances such as extreme weather events.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The water is way too warm for it to maintain. It’s constantly melting,” he said.“I expect that to continue in the coming weeks, and expect it won’t be really identifiable within a few weeks.”A23a calved from the Antarctic shelf in 1986 but quickly grounded in the Weddell Sea, remaining stuck on the ocean floor for over 30 years.It finally escaped in 2020 and, like other giants before it, was carried along “iceberg alley” into the South Atlantic Ocean by the powerful Antarctic Circumpolar Current.Around March,it ran aground in shallow waters off distant South Georgia island, raising fears it could disrupt large colonies of adult penguins and seals there from feeding their young.But it dislodged in late May, and moved on.Swinging around the island and tracking north, in recent weeks the iceberg has picked up speed, sometimes travelling up to 20km in a single day, satellite images analysed by AFP showed.Exposed to increasingly warmer waters, and buffeted by huge waves, A23a has rapidly disintegrated.Scientists were “surprised” how long the iceberg had kept together, said Meijers.“Most icebergs don’t make it this far. This one’s really big so it has lasted longer and gone further than others.”But ultimately, icebergs are “doomed” once they leave the freezing protection of Antarctica, he added.Iceberg calving is a natural process. But scientists say the rate at which they were being lost from Antarctica is increasing, probably because of human induced climate change.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentAntarcticaClimate crisisIcenewsShareReuse this content"

At the comingCop30 summit in Belém, it hopes to gather support so it can launch negotiations for a new treaty next year. The group’s founder, Tzeporah Berman, explains why the Amazon rainforest and the global south are an ideal springboard for the movement.Why will you be campaigningfor afossilfuelnon-proliferationtreaty?We have to change the way people think about oil, gas and coal, which are responsible for 86% of the carbon dioxide emissions that are trapped in our atmosphere. The world ison track to produce 110% more oil, gas and coal by 2030than we can ever burn if we want to keep global warming below 2C [above preindustrial levels]. That’s because the market is distorted by trillions of dollars in fossil fuel subsidies.And it’s only getting worse because every country is trying to artificially keep alive their fossil fuel industries, even though they know the damage they cause. AtCop30, we will be working to expand the group of countries participating in the development of the treaty.What do you say to those who say a non-proliferation treaty is unfeasible anytime soon?Change starts that way. When we first talked about renewable energy, people literally laughed at us because it was so expensive. But we’ve seen a tremendous change in technology and in prices so that today we are powering whole countries with renewable energy. Every day, we see major breakthroughs. Last year, one in five cars sold on the planet was electric. We can change very quickly when we want to.Yes, the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty is a big new idea, but at this moment in history, with floods, fires and heatwaves sweeping the planet, we need big new ideas.View image in fullscreenTzeporah Berman is a Canadian environmental campaigner who founded the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty initiative in 2020.Photograph: Igor Kovalenko/EPAWhat progress have you made since thefossilfuelnon-proliferationtreatyinitiative was founded?The push to negotiate a treaty is endorsed by more than 4,000 civil society groups including all of the world’s major faith, health, women’s and climate organisations. More than 120 cities have passed motions to support the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty and they are increasingly being joined by subnational governments such as California. We also now have 101 Nobel laureates and over 3,000 scientists who have endorsed the treaty. This growing movement helps create the political space for more countries to join.So far 17 countries are participating in the development of the treaty. In addition, 10 countries have been attending senior officials meetings as observers and are showing significant interest and we hope there will be another string of announcements at and before Belém.But what are the prospects of achieving a critical mass?Treaties for landmines and chemical weapons started with a core group of just 20 to 30 countries who wanted ambitious, binding rules. That shifted the social norm so it became unacceptable to stockpile those weapons even for many nations who were not signatories to those treaties.Today, fossil fuels are our weapons of mass destruction. They kill more people on this planet every year than anything else. Even before we calculate the toll from climate change, air pollution alone kills 8 million people each year.Fossil fuelsare the greatest threat to human life.We expect to have enough countries next year to begin negotiations. Before and during Cop30 we will be hosting major meetings of senior officials and ministers mapping the pathway toward negotiations, including the key convenings and conferences that need to be held in that process in the months ahead and we hope there will be a significant announcement on progress at Belém, so look out.This goes beyond the traditional left-right divide, doesn’t it?For me, this all started with the conversations I had in Canada with the oil industry over the tar sands in Alberta. The Trudeau government back then would say: “We know we need to reduce emissions and the world is going to get off fossil fuels but our oil is ethical,” even though the tar sands produce some of the heaviest carbon in the world.I later realised that whether you’re in Norway or Ecuador or Argentina, it’s the same conversation. Every company wants to produce the last barrel sold. So every year we miss our emissions reduction targets and every year we drill for more oil, we frack for more gas and we dig up more coal. And then we wonder why the system isn’t changing, even though renewable energy is cheaper.As long as there is no supply side climate policy, then we are trying to cut with one half of the scissors by solely focusing on reducing demand. This is true even with supposedly progressive climate leaders in office, such as Trudeau in Canada, Biden in the US or Starmer in Britain. The system has been designed in such a way that, domestically, elected officials don’t feel responsible for constraining production. That means we are continuing to put our intellectual, financial and political capital towards expanding a system that we say we’re phasing out. And it is almost always the case that what we build today will be what we use tomorrow.Why do you think the Brazilian climate summit is the place to expand this dialogue?Indigenous nations in the heart of the Amazon campaigned to keep fossil fuels in the ground long before anywhere in the global north. It has now spread across the world from Standing Rock and the tar sands in the US to anti-coal campaigns in Australia and Europe.In the run-up to Belém, we’ve been working with indigenous nations and associations across the region to promote the idea of a fossil-free Amazon zone so it can be a model for other parts of the world. We have tremendous support from civil society and significant backing from countries. Colombia was the first to endorse a fossil-free Amazon – a commitment to no oil and gas exploration and extraction in the region – and a global fossil fuel treaty, and it is doing diplomatic outreach to other countries.How do you tackle climate justice issues?For the last several years, we’ve been commissioning studies looking at how to apply equity and finance principles to a negotiation on fossil fuel production: who gets to produce and for how long? This takes in historical responsibility, just transition, social justice and levels of fossil fuel dependency.Brazil – the biggest nation in the Amazon region – has just sold more than 100 oil and gas exploration blocks, including some offshore from the rainforest. How do you make it worthwhile for countriessuch as Brazil and leaderssuch as Lula to give up on fossil fuels?At this moment in history, leadership is important. What Gustavo Petro, the president of Colombia, said when he joined the fossil fuel treaty was that the science is clear: no new fossil fuel expansion fits in a world where we meet our climate targets. The InternationalEnergyAgency has said the same and so has the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The international court of justice has now suggested that is not only a scientific finding but a legal obligation.It’s absurd that there’s this constant drumbeat of pledges and speeches to protect the Amazon, to support Lula and other leaders in the Amazon while, at the same time, financing new oil drilling in the heart of the rainforest, in the mouth of the river, and then buying that oil. We need responsibility along the entire chain and we need more than press releases and empty pledges. We need support for Lula and other leaders to move forward with protecting the Amazon and stopping drilling.How do you make it worthwhile for countriessuch as Brazil to give up on drilling particular fields?We’ve formed a finance working group that has experts predominantly from the global south. They’re producing a series of papers on trade agreements, tax agreements, debt relief and market access that would provide countries who have joined the fossil fuel treaty with financial support and benefits, as well as looking at specific just transition funds from the private sector available only to countries participating in the development of the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty.A larger question is whether or not fossil fuel development in the global south can eliminate poverty. The plans for expansion in Latin America, south-east Asia and Africa show the fossil fuel industry using these regions as a gas station for the global north: Europe and North America. They are unlikely to provide significant economic revenue or products to the areas that they’re exploiting. There’s a tremendous amount of evidence from the last 50 years to show the legacy is more likely to be poisoned waterways and expensive spills. This has been the case for countries that have had fossil fuel development for decades such as Ecuador or Nigeria. The ecological devastation dramatically diminishes local communities’ abilities to support themselves.World on brink of climate breakthrough as fossil fuels ‘run out of road’, UN chief saysRead moreNew fossil fuel infrastructure has high costs and leads to ongoing dependency whereas renewable energy infrastructure creates independence and greater long-term health and economic benefits. But less than 2% of global finance for renewables was in the global south. It’s great that we have seen a commitment from governments in theUnited NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change to triple renewables, but we need those commitments to be coupled with commitments to decommission existing fossil fuel assets and to ensure money flows into the global south.Won’t the likely absence of theUS make it difficult to move forward?We don’t expect the US and other major producers to join at this point and that’s fine. That means the treaty being developed will be strong and built by those committed to ambitious action commensurate with the science calling for absolute decline of emissions and production.The far right is already on the offensive againstnetzero [emissions targets]. Won’t thefossilfuelnon-proliferationtreatyinitiative give them an even bigger target?Politicians can talk about the benefits and costs of fossil fuels and renewable energy all they want, but the real benefit for real people is that the sun doesn’t send you a bill at the end of the month. When we build renewable energy infrastructure, that means energy is free for life. Make no mistake about it, renewables are not just a different way of powering our cars and our homes; they’re about changing power in every sense of the word.Explore more on these topicsFossil fuelsClimate crisisFossil fuel divestmentEnergyUnited NationsCop30Justin TrudeaufeaturesShareReuse this content"

A petrel, flying east from the Indian Ocean at the end of the Austral winter, makes landfall at New Zealand’s southern Codfish Island/Whenua Hou. Tired from its long journey, the petrel seeks refuge in the burrow of a greenkākāpō: a critically endangered flightless species that is the world’s fattest parrot.If the seabird intrudes when the kākāpō is primed to breed, the male parrot may attempt to mate with the smaller petrel, accidentally smothering it in the process.In this case, there are two unwitting victims. The petrel harbours a deadly agent: H5 avian influenza. Soon after, bird flu begins to rip through the imperilled parrot population, pushing the waddling bird – which numbers fewer than 250 individuals – to extinction.It’s not if but when bird flu arrives in Australia. Now it is circulating in Antarctica, we are surroundedFiona FraserThis is the kind of scenario that New Zealand’s conservationists are considering before the arrival of the spring migration season – as they have done for the past two years since a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu known asH5N1began burning through global wildlife, spurring the largest sudden drop in the world’s bird population in decades.Tens ofmillions of wild birds have succumbedto H5 worldwide, but so far Oceania has managed to keep the virus out – buying time for New Zealand to add another weapon to its arsenal before thousands of birds arrive from distant shores.In August, the country’s Department ofConservationannounced the completion of a world-first research trial showing that some of its rarest birds could be successfully and safely vaccinated against bird flu.The effort is the latest in a global push to protect wildlife – not just farmed poultry – from the virus, which has also inflicted dramatic mass deaths amongelephant seal, fur seal andseabirdpopulations across the world. For those species already teetering on the brink of extinction, vaccination could be a gamechanger.View image in fullscreenA kakī (black stilt) bird, only found in New Zealand, is vaccinated.Photograph: Carla Smit/DOCNew Zealand is home to nearly 100 bird species found nowhere else in the world. Over the past year, the department has vaccinated up to 10 captive birds from five critically endangered species that have 500 or fewer individuals left – the kākāpō, takahē, kakī (black stilt), tūturuatu (shore plover) and one type of kākāriki.The programme, using the H5N3 poultry vaccine, is the first to vaccinate so many species at the same time. After receiving two doses, a month apart, of the licensed poultry vaccine, scientists found that four species had built up a strong antibody response to the virus that lasted for at least six months.View image in fullscreenWestland petrels migrate to New Zealand every year to breed.Photograph: Peregrine/Alamy“These species are dependent on captive breeding,” says Kate McInnes, a wildlife veterinarian and the department’s senior science adviser. Vaccination, she says, could protect core breeding populations in aviaries used for restocking wild populations on the knife-edge of survival, as well as managed kākāpō populations on offshore islands.The next step is building a deployment strategy before spring migration, when travelling seabirds could introduce the virus. “You can’t just run around the forest and catch everything and jab it,” McInnes says. “You’ve got to have a really carefully planned programme in place.”Other countries are watching the attempt closely. Australia is in close contact with officials in New Zealand about the vaccine results, and is running its own trials using stand-in species – animals similar to the critically endangered species but not endangered themselves – according to Fiona Fraser, Australia’s commissioner for threatened species.“There is increasing concern now that the migratory bird season is just on our doorstep,” she says. Tens of millions of birds are expected to arrive in Australia in the coming weeks.View image in fullscreenResearchers investigate the spread of bird flu on Beak Island, Antarctica, in March last year.Photograph: Ben Wallis/ReutersThe Australian government last year announced it would allocate A$100m (£48m) to prepare for bird flu, including A$2.8m specifically to protect captive populations of threatened species.“Having that extra time for our region to understand what the overseas impacts have been, and to get better prepared for Australian species, has been enormously important,” says Fraser. “We expect it’s not a matter of if, but when bird flu arrives in Australia. Because now that it iscirculating in Antarctica, we are essentially surrounded.”View image in fullscreenA scientist testing seals on South Georgia last year. Avian flu has infected Antartica’s seals.Photograph: Dr Marco Falchieri/Apha/PAVaccination, she says, makes up only a small part of the strategy. The country is focused on planning for species considered particularly vulnerable to avian influenza, such as the native Australian sea lion and Tasmanian devil, an endangered scavenger that could feed on the carcasses of infected birds.Boosting the overall health of wild populations to help them withstand the eventual arrival of avian influenza is the priority, she says.“Vaccinations can be stressful for wild animals and it cannot be as feasible as taking other measures such as improving their habitat,” Fraser says.Australia’s policy on vaccination echoes the broader global view. Jabbing animals for conservation purposes is rare, although some programmes have been established to immunisekoalas against chlamydia; vaccinateEthiopian wolvesagainst canine distemper; and develop aWest Nile vaccineto protect endangered birds in Hawaii.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Capturing and recapturing wild animals for multiple doses is difficult and expensive, especially for species that have short lifespans.The sentiment was that a vaccinated bird will have better protection than an unvaccinated birdTodd KatznerNevertheless, when 21California condorsdied from H5 avian influenza in 2023, the US government raced to intervene. About $20m (£15m) in federal and state funding has been spent on conserving the critically endangered vulture to date, making it one of the most costly US conservation projects in history.Scientists first conducted trials of an H5N1 poultry vaccine on 20 black vultures and 20 captive condors. “We knew that this was going to have some international relevance – people were going to be watching it,” says Todd Katzner, a US Geological Survey wildlife biologist and research coordinator for the Condor Recovery Program. “It was the first controlled trial with a wild species.”View image in fullscreenCondors are vaccinated against avian influenza in California, US.Photograph: Richard Vogel/APAfter finding that the vaccine yielded asuccessful antibody response with no harmful effects, the government approved anemergency vaccination campaign. By October 2024, they had inoculated207 condors, including 134 “free-flying” birds.An additional challenge, Katzner says, is that the trial vaccine used to jab the condors was based on a 2014 strain of avian influenza. “When they build human vaccines, there’s a huge economic driver to encourage them to stay up to date,” he says. “There is not a similar driver for bird flu vaccines, so you end up with vaccines that are out of date.”Viruses evolve over time, meaning vaccines can be rendered less useful as the virus changes. Still, “the general sentiment was that a vaccinated bird will have better protection than an unvaccinated bird”, Katzner says.View image in fullscreenIbises and a spoonbill await vaccination in a zoo at Doué-la-Fontaine in western France in 2006.Photograph: Frank Perry/AFP/Getty ImagesSome scientists express reservations about jabbing wild animals. Viruses, they say, can quickly develop even more potent strains.Age of the panzootic: scientists warn of more devastating diseases jumping between speciesRead more“A big concern with wildlife is incomplete vaccination that would actually lead to more viral evolution,” says Schuler. “Especially for a lot of these birds, they might be exposed to multiple avian influenza viruses. So by inserting a vaccination process in there, does it actually have the potential to sort out the ones that are more pathogenic – the ones that could be worse?”New Zealand’s wildlife authorities plan to vaccinate its captive breeding populations of critically endangered bird species, as well as their offspring introduced to the wild, pending regulatory approval of emergency use of the vaccine. The timing of the programme depends on assessments of when the virus is likely to reach the country’s shores.“If we start too soon, we’re going to lose that antibody because it will start to disappear,” McInnes says. “But if we start too late, we might have missed the crucial moment.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentThe age of extinctionBird fluBirdsEndangered speciesWildlifeAnimalsConservationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She has been told she faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.Fears were first expressed for her safety when she went missing during a holiday in Thailand in May. She surfaced nearly 4,000 miles away in the Georgian capital, Tblisi, where she was arrested.She marked her 19th birthday in prison the following month, and during a court appearance in July it emerged she is expecting a baby boy. Her lawyer, Malkhaz Salakaia, had tried to secure her release pending a trial, telling Tbilisi city court: “I want her to feel this motherhood in freedom.” However, the judge decided no new evidence had been presented and ordered that Culley remain in prison.On Tuesday, the BBC reported Culley was back in court, where the judge, Giorgi Gelashvili, was told defence and prosecution teams had been negotiating the terms of a plea agreement that would result in Culley being freed in return for a sum of money with “many zeros”.It was reported the lawyers were referring to Georgian lari – £1 is worth ₾3.60.The prosecutor argued Culley posed a flight risk and could reoffend if allowed bail, the BBC reported. Gelashvili ruled that she must remain in custody until the next hearing, on 9 October, unless an agreement was reached sooner.The Foreign Office has previously said it is “supporting the family of a British woman who is detained in Georgia”.

Even once the 44 Tory hereditary peers are gone, they would still have about 30 more members of the Lords than the government, sources said, indicating No 10 could appoint enough new peers to balance the numbers.The departure of Lloyd, who was Tony Blair’s deputy chief of staff, was among a slew of changes announced on Monday asStarmer attempted to wrest back controlof economic policy from the Treasury by bolstering his team.With Downing Street grappling with a difficult economic backdrop before the budget, he created two new roles. The chancellor’s deputy, Darren Jones, was put in charge of day-to-day delivery and Minouche Shafik, a former Bank of England chief, appointed chief economic adviser.Government insiders have denied the reshuffle risks undermining Rachel Reeves’s position, with her allies insisting the chancellor had been discussing it with Starmer since the beginning of the recess, and was supportive of Downing Street having a stronger economic voice.However, senior No 10 figures cast doubt on the significance of the role the chancellor had played. One said work on the new structure had begun after the May local elections, and was designed to create an operation that worked for this prime minister, rather than relying on the system inherited from previous administrations.Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff, commissioned the Future Governance Forum to come up with proposals, and Vidhya Alakeson, the deputy chief of staff, then drew up a paper on which changes No 10 could adopt, which was presented to Starmer in May. By late June, the structure was settled, with the process concluded in early July.While several candidates were considered for the delivery role, Jones, who had impressed the prime minister during the spending review process, was the “standout” favourite, according to sources. No 10 decided to wait until after the summer to announce the changes.Lloyd’s departure from Downing Street just 10 months after being appointed came after internal tension over who was running the department. Stuart Ingham, another policy chief and Starmer’s most longstanding aide, also left the unit to work in a more political role in McSweeney’s team.A new political policy chief is expected to be appointed shortly, but in the meantime Alakeson will oversee day-to-day policy work.Explore more on these topicsLabourHouse of LordsKeir StarmerConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, the tribunal was thrown into chaos after a last-minute application from NHS Fife’s lawyers to amend their pleadings.The tribunal began in February and reconvened in July to hear further evidence. It has been followed closely across the UK to see howApril’s supreme court rulingthat “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act refer only to a biological woman and to biological sex should be applied in practice. It is likely to be used as a template for other legal actions.The application by NHS Fife could delay the outcome for months while Kemp considers it, along with any resulting appeals. Peggie’s lawyer said the nurse was “in tears” at the prospect of further hearings.The case centres around a disputed incident which took place in a changing room at Victoria hospital in Kirkcaldy on Christmas Eve 2023, after which Upton made an allegation of bullying and harassment, leading to Peggie’s suspension.In July, NHS Fife confirmed Peggie had beencleared of the separate gross misconduct allegationsafter an 18-month internal process.Summing up her case on Monday, Peggie’s lawyer Naomi Cunningham repeatedly referenced the supreme court case brought by the gender-critical campaign group For WomenScotland. She told the tribunal: “Trans women are men. That reality is enshrined in law.”But Jane Russell KC, representing Fife NHS board and Upton, argued that the ruling “says that service providers – it doesn’t cover employers – can, but do not have to, exclude [trans women from single-sex facilities] by making use of the exceptions in schedule 3 of the Equality Act.”She added: “There is no authority that says an employer must do this.”Cunningham, who chairs the board of trustees for the gender-critical group Sex Matters, told the tribunal that excluding Upton was “the inevitable consequence” of the For Women Scotland judgment.“Trans-identifying men who possess gender recognition certificates (GRCs) are for certain purposes deemed to be women. But without a GRC they are both legally and factually simply men,” she said.Upton had no GRC and therefore “must be excluded” from women-only spaces, Cunningham added.She described NHS Fife as being “in the grip of a delusion”, and said the board had “taken on gender identity belief as its institutional position”. It had then subjected the nurse to a “heresy hunt” when she challenged this, she said.Russell said Peggie had faced disciplinary action not because of her gender-critical beliefs, but because of the “objectionable and inappropriate” way she expressed them. During the Christmas Eve altercation, Russell said Peggie had “repeatedly” misgendered Upton and that her reference to the convicted rapist Isla Bryson was “an outrageously harmful hurtful and damaging slur”.“The claimant’s behaviour in confronting the young doctor in a professional setting in such a way and so unpleasantly is behaviour that ought not to be served protection of the Equality Act,” Russell argued.As a mark of the significance of the case, which has already cost NHS Fife nearly £220,500, a number of national groups were granted permission to intervene, including Sex Matters and the trans-led advocacy organisation TransLucent.Aspects of the case have played out in parallel on social media. Cunningham accused the board of seeking to “drive a wedge between [Peggie] and her lesbian daughter” after witnesses claimed she was uncomfortable with her daughter’s sexuality. Peggie’s daughter, Nicole, then went on social media to challenge this, stating that her mother had always been supportive.And on Monday Kemp ruled after some legal argument that Upton’s birth name should be redacted from published submissions, only for that name to end up trending on X later in the day.The Equality and Human Rights Commission has written to NHS Fife regarding access to single-sex facilities for staff on several occasions since the tribunal began, most recently in August, when it directed it to complete a equality impact assessment and apply the supreme court ruling “without delay”.Tuesday was the conclusion of final submissions, but Kemp warned that he would need time to consider NHS Fife’s amendment application first so it would be “very difficult to say” when his judgment would be ready and that it would not be before November.Explore more on these topicsUK newsHealthScotlandLGBTQ+ rightsTransgenderNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

Any request for asylum support will be assessed against destitution criteria. If you do not meet the criteria, you will not receive support. If you have no legal right to remain in the UK, you must leave. If you don’t, we will remove you.”The University and College Union general secretary Jo Grady said the campaign was an “attack on international students” that has “very little to do with visa overstays and everything to do with apeing Reform”.She added: “They should instead be making the case for a welcoming and economically strong Britain, of which international students and a world-leading higher education sector are an integral part.”Although the political and media focus this summer has been on people arriving on small boats, a similar number arrive legally with visas, then apply for asylum often when those visas run out.Many claims are legitimate, but ministers fear that too many international students are seeking asylum to stay in the country because their leave to remain has run out. Earlier this year, the Home Office announced it would cut the amount of time overseas graduates can stay in the UK after their studies from two years to 18 months.In the year to June 2025, 43,600 people seeking asylum arrived on a small boat – 39% of all asylum claims, according toHome Office data. Another 41,100 asylum claims came from people who entered legally with a visa, with the largest group among visa holders being students – 16,000 last year, nearly six times as many as in 2020.Since then, Home Office data shows there has been a drop of 10%, but ministers in the department want the figures to fall further.This week, the government has been under pressure from opposition parties including the Conservatives and Reform to declare “a national emergency” on migration and illegal immigration.On Tuesday morning, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, declined to guarantee that migrants would definitely be sent back across the Channel this month as part of a returns agreement with France, after telling the Commons on Monday that the first returns under the deal were expected in late September.When pressed, she replied: “We expect the first returns to take place this month. But I’ve always said from the very beginning on this, it’s a pilot scheme and it needs to build up over time.”She contrasted her “practical and sensible” approach with that of the previous Conservative government on Rwanda, which “spent £700m and sent four volunteers after running it for two years”.She also told Times Radio that ministers believe asylum hotels can be emptied earlier than the end of the current parliament, after Keir Starmer said on Monday that he wanted to move all asylum seekers out of hotel accommodation before his government’s deadline of the end of the parliament, which could last until 2029.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeStudentsInternational studentsShareReuse this content"

So far, all the lava from this eruption has been contained within the summit crater inside HawaiiVolcanoesnational park.Lava emerged from the north vent in Halemaʻumaʻu crater after midnight. The vent began shooting fountains of lava at 6.35am, the US Geological Survey said. By mid-morning, it was also erupting from the crater’s south vent and a third vent in between.A lower magma chamber under Halemaʻumaʻu crater is receiving magma directly from the earth’s interior about 5 cubic yards (3.8 cubic meters) per second, said Ken Hon, the scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. This blows the chamber up like a balloon and forces magma into an upper chamber. From there, it gets pushed above ground through cracks.‘A climate of unparalleled malevolence’: are we on our way to the sixth major mass extinction?Read moreMagma has been using the same pathway to rise to the surface since December, making the initial release and subsequent episodes all part of the same eruption, Hon said.Many have featured lava soaring into the air, in some cases more than 1,000 ft (300 meters). The fountains are generated in part because magma – which holds gasses that are released as it rises – has been traveling to the surface through narrow, pipe-like vents.The expanding magma supply is capped by heavier magma that had expelled its gas at the end of the prior episode. Eventually enough new magma accumulates to force the degassed magma off, and the magma shoots out like liquid out of a champagne bottle that was shaken before the cork was popped.Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. It’s located on Hawaii Island, the largest of the Hawaiian archipelago. It’s about 200 miles (320 km) south of the state’s largest city, Honolulu, which is on Oahu.This is the fourth time in 200 years that Kilauea has shot lava fountains into the air in repeated episodes. There were more episodes the last time Kilauea followed this pattern: the eruption that began in 1983 started with 44 sessions of shooting fountains. Those were spread out over three years, however. And the fountains emerged in a remote area so few got to watch.The other two occurred in 1959 and 1969.Scientists don’t know how the current eruption will end or how it may change. In 1983, magma built enough pressure that Kilauea opened a vent at a lower elevation and started continuously leaking lava from there rather than periodically shooting out of a higher elevation. The eruption continued in various forms for three decades and only ended in 2018.Something similar could happen again. Or the current eruption could instead stop at the summit if its magma supply peters out.Scientists can estimate a few days or even a week ahead of time when lava is likely to emerge with the help of sensors around the volcano that detect earthquakes and minuscule changes in the angle of the ground, which indicate when magma is inflating or deflating.“Our job is like being a bunch of ants crawling on an elephant trying to figure out how the elephant works,” Hon said.The lava fountains have been shorter lately. Steve Lundblad, a geology professor at University of Hawaii at Hilo, said the vent may have gotten wider, leaving molten rock less pressurized.“We’re still gonna have spectacular eruptions,” he said. “They’re just going to be wider and not as high.”Explore more on these topicsHawaiiVolcanoesWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Italy’s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, first floated this proposal several months ago when interference with satellite navigation started becoming increasingly common in airspace near Russia.In August, Latvia’s electronic communications office said it had identified at least three jamming hotspots along borders with Russia. In April 2024, a Finnish airline temporarily suspended flights to the Estonian city of Tartu after jamming, while in March that year a plane carrying the British defence secretary had its satellite signal jammed as it flew near Russian territory.A 2011 decree requires that information on Italian ministers’ movements, particularly flights, be published on the government website. Although the government would still be obliged to secure diplomatic clearance to fly over another country’s airspace, sources told the Guardian that Italy, “while respecting that protocol … could soon decide not to make such flights public”.In February, the Italian prime minister’s plane was removed from Flightradar, one of the most widely used apps to provide real-time data on aircraft movements, but it remains visible on equivalent sites. For security reasons, officials are now considering “shielding flights carrying the prime minister and cabinet ministers from all such platforms”, sources said.The Associated Press has plotted almost 80 incidents on a map, tracking a campaign of disruption acrossEuropeblamed on Russia – which the head of Britain’s foreign intelligence service described as staggeringly reckless.Russia has denied it was behind the failure of the navigation system on von der Leyen’s flight. “Your information is incorrect,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Monday.On Tuesday, Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, said he was taking the jamming of GPS signals “very seriously”. He said the alliance was working “day and night” to prevent jamming and ensure “they will not do it again”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

A trial date has not yet been set.In May a Paris court handed the 76-year-old an 18-month suspended sentence in a separate case in which he wasconvicted of sexually assaulting two womenon a Paris film set in 2021.Arnould, whose father was a friend of Depardieu, reported the actor to police in August 2018, days after the alleged attacks. Arnould was 22 at the time, and Depardieu was 70.In anopen letter to Le Figaroin October 2023, Depardieu denied the allegations, saying any encounter with Arnould had been consensual. “Never, ever, have I abused a woman,” he wrote.Carine Durrieu Diebolt, Arnould’s lawyer, said the judge had ordered a trial at Paris’s criminal court for sexual assault and rape by digital penetration on 7 and 13 August 2018. Durrieu Diebolt said she and Arnould were relieved and confident about the case.Le Monde reported that the state prosecutor’s recommendation for a trial had stated that Depardieu “constrained the victim to submit to his will to impose sexual acts on her that she did not have the capacity to oppose”.Arnould, 29, wrote on social media: “Seven years later, seven years of horror and hell … I think I’m having trouble realising how huge this is. I’m relieved”View image in fullscreenFrench actor Charlotte Arnould wrote on social media of being relieved after ‘seven years of horror and hell’.Photograph: Abdul Saboor/ReutersIn a separate trial earlier this year, Depardieu, who has made more than 200 films and TV series, was found guilty of sexually assaulting a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant director during the shooting of the feature film Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) in Paris in September 2021. The judge ruled that his name must be added to the sex offender register in France.Depardieu’s conviction in May was seen asa turning point for the #MeToo movementin France. He became the biggest figure in the French film industry to be convicted of sexual assault after years of France being accused of being slow to take women’s claims of abuse seriously. Depardieu denied the charges and his lawyer said he would appeal against his conviction.In December 2023, when Depardieu was under formal investigation for rape and sexual assault in the Arnould case and also facing scrutiny over sexist comments revealed in a TV documentary, the French president, Emmanuel Macron,defended him, saying “he makes France proud”. Asked at the time about stripping Depardieu of a state award, Macron said: “You will never see me participate in a manhunt … hate that type of thing.”Depardieu has denied all allegations of sexual assault. He told his sexual assault trial earlier this year that the media had used allegations against him to damage his reputation. He attacked the #MeToo movement as well as women who had held protest placards outside a concert tour he was on at the time of the allegations. “This movement is going to become a terror,” he said.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGérard DepardieuFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

Over the course of eight televised hearings held between 2 and 12 September, five supreme court judges will decide their fate.The judge presiding over the trial, Alexandre de Moraes, kicked off the hearing describing how an anti-democratic plot to impose “a veritable dictatorship” had been foiled thanks to the strength of Brazilian society and institutions. A failure to punish that crime “would mean encouraging new attempted coups d’etat,” Moraes told the court, adding: “History teaches us that impunity, omission and cowardice do not lead to pacification.”The prosecutor general, Paulo Gonet, told the court it was essential those behind the “frightening and shadowy” conspiracy be held to account.‘I’m holding his political wake’: the trumpeter waiting to mark Bolsonaro’s judgment dayRead moreBrazil has suffered more than a dozen attempted putsches and coups d’état since 1889, when it became a republic after its last emperor, Pedro II, was overthrown. The last successful power grab came in 1964, when US-backed generals deposed the then president, João Goulart, supposedly to thwart a communist threat and ushering in 21 years of brutal military rule.But the historian Danilo Araújo Marques said that never before had top military leaders or a former president been tried for attacking democracy. “This truly is unprecedented and historic,” said Marques, who is part of a research unit at the Federal University of Minas Gerais called Projeto República.“Whenever there was an attempted coup, and the coup didn’t succeed, there was always an amnesty – and now we’re seeing precisely the opposite,” Marques added, hailing the trial as tribute to the maturity of Brazil’s institutions and democracy, which was restored in 1985. “Our democracy is going through an acid test and it’s possible it will come out of this strengthened.”On the eve of the trial, the US president, Donald Trump, hasattempted to sabotage proceedingswith what analysts called an unprecedented pressure campaign that has thrown US-Brazil relations into disarray.View image in fullscreenMembers of the media outside the court in Brasilia, Brazil, on Tuesday.Photograph: Jorge Silva/ReutersClaiming Bolsonaro was the victim of a “witch-hunt”, Trump slapped 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports and sanctioned Alexandre de Moraes, the judge presiding over the case. Other supreme court justices and Lula officials have been stripped of their US visas. Bolsonaro’s congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, has moved to the US to lobby Trump officials to take up his father’s fight.“It’s a political intervention with an economic cudgel,” Thomas Shannon, a former US ambassador to Brazil, said of Trump’s tariffs campaign.Shannon believed Trump had a clear political objective: to scupper Bolsonaro’s prosecution, resuscitate the Brazilian populist’s flagging political career, and allow Bolsonaro – who is currently banned from seeking office – to challenge Lula in next year’s presidential election.But the ex-ambassador, who was based in Brasília from 2010 to 2013, believed the US president was mistaken if he believed he could help Bolsonaro escape punishment and “storm back into power” – just as Trump did last year.“It [shows] such a cartoon-like understanding of Brazil – and I think what the president is doing at the behest of the Bolsonaros is actually going to harm the Bolsonaros in a really significant way,” Shannon said, noting how polls showed support for the ex-president falling.‘A family of traitors’: Trump’s Brazil tariffs ultimatum backfires on BolsonaroRead moreIn contrast, support for Lula appears to be increasing, with Brazil’s president using Trump’s offensive to position himself as a flag-waving patriot defending Brazilian interests from a foreign onslaught. Lula has started wearing a blue, Maga-style cap emblazoned with the words: “Brazil belongs to the Brazilians.”Asked last week if he would be tuning into his rival’s coup trial, Lula shrugged: “I’ve got better things to do.”Those in the dock alongside Bolsonaro include some of the best-known figures in his administration: the former defence ministers Gen Walter Braga Netto and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira; the former minister for institutional security, Gen Augusto Heleno; the former navy commander, Adm Almir Garnier Santos; the former security minister, Anderson Torres; the former spy chief Alexandre Ramagem; and Bolsonaro’s former assistant, Lt Col Mauro Cid.The accusations against them relate toan alleged conspiracy to launch a pro-Bolsonaro coupin the months between the October 2022 election and thefar-right uprising in Brasíliaon 8 January 2023 – a week after Lula took power.Bolsonaro denies plotting a coup but has admitted seeking “alternative” ways to stop Lula taking office. All of the other defendants also maintain their innocence, apart from Cid. He has collaborated with investigators as part of a plea deal and hopes to receive a reduced sentence.Inan editorialmarking the start of the trial, the O Globo newspaper said 2 September would go down in history as the day Brazil finally broke its “humiliating tradition” of failing to prosecute coup-mongering presidents and generals.​The judgment wascelebratedas a “huge civilizatory leap forward” by the conservative O Estado de São Paulo​:“Perhaps this is why Trump is using the enormous power of the US to attack the supreme court and save Bolsonaro from his penal fate. Not out of friendship [for the Bolsonaros], but to stop an example of democratic resistance flourishing in Latin America’s biggest nation, that reinforces the contrast with the genuflection of American institutions to Trumpism.”Bolsonaro has been under house arrest since early August after the supreme court ruled he had violated a court order banning him from social networks. Police have been stationed outside his mansion amid fears he could flee to the nearby US embassy. Earlier this month policeclaimedthey had found a document on a phone seized from the ex-president indicating he had planned to abscond to Argentina and seek asylum from its rightwing president, Javier Milei.On Sunday – Brazil’s independence day – Bolsonaro’s supporters are expected to stage a show of force, rallying in major cities to demand he be absolved. Security has been stepped up around the supreme court, presidential palace and congress to avoid a repeat of the 8 January uprising, when all three buildings were ransacked by Bolsonaro supporters.Marques predicted there were likely to be lively days ahead as Brazil’s 40-year-old democracy notched up another landmark moment. “This is an important cycle that is closing,” he said of the decade-long rise and fall of Bolsonaro, a once obscure politician whoshot to prominenceduring the 2016 impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff, was elected in 2018, and now faces political annihilation.“But the future is full of surprises,” Marques added. Even if Bolsonaro was convicted and jailed, “new chapters” could still be written, such as congress approving an amnesty, or a future rightwing president granting Bolsonaro a pardon. “Let’s see what the future has in store for us.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

A new documentary charts the extraordinary rise, fall – and rise again – of France’s ‘most wanted’ creativeCath SlessorTue 2 Sep 2025 10.33 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 12.18 EDTShareVariously described as an “architect, painter, novelist, communist and convicted fraudster”, Fernand Pouillon’s life was punctuated by abrupt reversals of fortune that might have sprung from the pages of Dickens or Dumas. Throughout an eventful career, he ricocheted from intoxicating success, to financial scandal, prison, exile and eventual rehabilitation.In 1985, when Pouillon was in his early 70s, he was awarded the Légion d’Honneur by President François Mitterrand. Yet just over 20 years earlier, Pouillon found himself in custody awaiting trial on charges of corruption. As a prolific architect-developer who had designed gargantuan housing schemes inFranceand Algeria, he was accused of funding irregularities and violating laws contrived to keep the processes of design and construction separate.View image in fullscreenA more nuanced alternative to ‘brave new world’ modernism … Old Port, Marseille, postwar development by Pouillon.Photograph: suppliedStaging a hunger strike, he was moved to a prison infirmary, from which he escaped by shinning down a rope smuggled in by his brother. On the run for eight months, he was dubbed “France’s most wanted architect”, before, with exquisite sangfroid, he turned up by taxi to the Parisian courthouse on the day his trial was due to begin. Sentenced to four years in jail, he passed the time by writing Les Pierres Sauvages (The Wild Stones), a bestselling novel about the construction of the medieval Cistercian abbey at Le Thoronet in Provence. The protagonist is a master builder who overcomes exacting working conditions and sceptical peers by dint of sheer willpower.Known as “Pouillon le manifique”, Pouillon was an iconoclast who relished the trappings of success. At one point he reportedly owned a Bentley, an Alfa Romeo, two chateaux, townhouses in Algiers and Paris, and a yacht. Photographs of the time show a suave, sharply suited man, with a luxuriant quiff of jet black hair, like a Gallic Bryan Ferry.His rise and fall is the subject of Fernand Pouillon: France’s Most Wanted Architect, a 2023 film by French documentary film-maker Jean-Marie Montangerand. “His personality and his antics overshadowed his work,” says Montangerand. “But his system was to build better, cheaper and faster than others so that everyone could live decently. He thought that beauty should not just be the privilege of the most well-off.” Showing for the first time in the UK, it examines Pouillon’s life and exploits, with current and historic footage of his housing in Paris, Marseille and Algiers.View image in fullscreenA modern architect but not a modernist … children in the central concourse of the Climat de France housing scheme, Algiers.Photograph: suppliedPouillon remains a divisive figure. But in spite of his entanglements, his architecture has endured, its qualities becoming more appreciated over time by users and critics. Attuned to the historic form and dynamics of cities, his buildings have come to be seen as a more nuanced alternative to the “brave new world” ethos of modernism.His quartet of 1950s housing developments in Paris imitate the historic grain and texture of the city, with courtyards, loggias, gardens and promenades. And in the postwar heyday of concrete, he unfashionably favoured stone as a building material. “I hated the ugliness of render, the colour of concrete,” he declared in his 1968 autobiography. “For me, the century of reinforced concrete posed problems of appearance, of surface, of the skin of the building.” He favoured the creamy limestone of Provence, in its hefty, traditional, load-bearing form, as opposed to thin sheets clipped to a steel or concrete frame that constitute most of today’s “stone” buildings.“Pouillon was a modern architect but he was not a modernist,” argue Adam Caruso and Helen Thomas, who compiled one of the first English language monographs on Pouillon, nearly 30 years after his death in 1986. “He was modern in the sense that Édouard Manet was a supremely modern painter: attentive to the history of art and to the inevitable and necessary continuity of culture, while at the same time being fascinated and enmeshed in the appearances and social mores of contemporary life that played out around him.”What emerges from Montangerand’s film is a man driven by ambition, building at dizzying speed and volume in the often chaotic ferment of France’s postwar economic boom. As Pouillon himself put it, “200 housing units built in 200 days for 200 million francs”. Yet he disdained the rabbit-hutch mentality of modernist mass housing – thegrands ensemblesthat were springing up in and around French cities. “Imagine the sadness of all the people who, after working all day, leave their offices to sit in their rooms as if they’re being punished,” he wrote.Unlike Le Corbusier, the imperator of modernism, and a contemporary (though the two never met), Pouillon recoiled from theory and abstraction. For him, architecture was about building well and building efficiently, like the speculative developers of the Georgian and Victorian eras, optimising managerial processes and construction techniques to address specific economic and social needs. He understood the city as a network of public spaces, each with a different character to be experienced on the ground. “I build for the pedestrian, not the airplane captain,” he asserted.View image in fullscreenConstruction using faster, more efficient building techniques … on site at one of Pouillon’s Algerian projects.Photograph: suppliedHis career first took off when commissioned to rebuild large tracts of Marseille, razed by wartime bombing and Nazi destruction. In January 1943 about 30,000 people were forcibly evicted from the historic Panier (“basket”) quarter housing immigrants and refugees, with 2,000 dwellings demolished by explosives.Pouillon’s reconstruction respects and reinstates the area’s scale and street pattern. New housing blocks feature workshops at ground level and humanising details, such as balconies enclosed by timber lattices. Down by the Old Port, a series of long, stone volumes resembling 19th-century dockside warehouses extend along the Marseille waterfront, now the haunt of tourists and flâneurs who might never notice the small plaque placed on one of the walls denoting Pouillon as the architect.Pouillon’s design skill and his ability to navigate between the competing interests of politicians, planners and bureaucrats caught the eye of the mayor of Algiers, Jacques Chevallier, who enlisted him to provide dwellings for the city’s expanding population, as opposition to France’s colonial rule intensified. Between 1953 and 1959, Pouillon oversaw the construction of three major residential projects, among themClimat de France, the largest housing project in north Africa at the time, with 3,500 dwellings designed to accommodate over 30,000 inhabitants structured around an expansive central square or maidan.While Pouillon publicly disavowed colonialism, his buildings were nonetheless part of an impetus to subjugate the Algerian Muslim population. Ultimately, however, they were co-opted by the very people they were meant to control. Ringed by 200 three-storey high limestone columns, the monumental maidan at the heart of Climat de France became a familiar backdrop to political protest, from the Algerian war of independence to more recent confrontations during the Arab spring.View image in fullscreenA haven … Belcastel, Aveyron, France, the 11th century castle (and village) restored by Pouillon up to his death.Photograph: Hemis/Alamy“People have gradually taken ownership of these spaces, transforming and repurposing them,” says Montangerand. “The children of Climat de France now proudly declare themselves to live in ‘the Pouillon city’.Architectureshould be judged by the amount of life it allows to develop, which is why Pouillon’s work still resonates.”Eventually released from prison in 1965, but shunned by the French establishment, Pouillon returned to Algeria, where he found a more receptive milieu in the country’s post-independence era, designing housing, universities, hotels and tourist infrastructure. In 1971 he received an official government pardon, a tacit acknowledgment that his downfall may have been politically as well as professionally motivated.Aided by Algerian craftsmen, Pouillon’s final years were spent painstakingly restoring an ninth-century chateau in Belcastel in the south of France, not unlike his master builder protagonist in Les Pierres Sauvages.When Le Corbusier died, his coffin was reverentially paraded through the courtyard of the Louvre accompanied by torch-bearers in military uniform. Conversely, Pouillon was not one for posthumous pomp. Today, he lies buried in Belcastel cemetery, in an unmarked grave. His many monuments are elsewhere.Fernand Pouillon: France’s Most Wanted Architect is atthe Barbican, London, on 4 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsArchitectureFranceDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To celebrate, the people of Helsinki dressed up for the world’s weirdest runDavey BrettTue 2 Sep 2025 11.27 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 13.19 EDTShareIt’s 3.45pm on a Sunday in Helsinki’s Kaivopuisto park and I’m warming-up near a man dressed as the city’s cathedral. A headdress of neoclassical domes sets the outfit off, but it’s the Senate Square cathedral steps that have won him the best outfit award at the inauguralDarude Sandstorm Run. For Daniel Erickson, who has travelled from New York especially, it’s well-deserved.The Darude Sandstorm Run is a suitably silly marker of 25 years of both Finnish DJ Darude’s career and the release of the music video for Sandstorm. First released inFinlandin 1999, the track is a trance earworm notable for itsdu-du-du-du-duriff, as if being emitted from some futuristic pan pipes. It went global the following year, along with a semi-iconic music video shot in Helsinki, viewed 306m times on YouTube. I, Erickson and 825 others are now gearing up to run the route documented in its cops-and-robbers storyline.Sandstorm remains a staple of sporting events, is loved by sports stars – swimmer Michael Phelps used to listen to it before winning Olympic gold medals, citing the energy it gave him – and has found a constantly evolving place in internet culture, making it a platinum-seller in the UK and the US. Whethersomebody is playing it on a potatoor it’sbeing used as the sound for a sandstorm alarm in the Gobi Desert, it’s one of Finland’s most recognisable pop culture exports.The track has taken Darude, real name Toni-Ville Henrik Virtanen, around the world, playing live in over 80 countries including recent stops in Japan and Guyana. Speaking from Chicago a week prior to the run, he looks back fondly at the support Sandstorm received in the UK from DJs Pete Tong and Judge Jules. It then went to No 3 in the charts.But, he says, “my last five or 10 years of relevancy I definitely owe to gaming and the meme culture that revolves around that.” The track is particularly popular with players of online multiplayer battle arena game League of Legends; “Darude – Sandstorm” is now a stock response to anyone requesting a track ID on gaming streams.Beyond the track’s infernal catchiness, it’s not clear why Sandstorm took off as a soundtrack of choice among Call of Duty streamers in the late 00s, but its use snowballed as internet culture developed and the US EDM boom hit. YouTube putting a Darude button on its player for April Fools’ Day in 2015, which added a second of Sandstorm to any video on its site, cemented its meme legacy. I get the sense Darude is conflicted by his song’s strange legacy: “My crowd has gotten younger, which is obviously key to my ongoing career,” he says pragmatically. “But also, I’ve met people in their 40s or 50s at my shows with their 18-year-old kids. It’s really cool when someone young comes over and says: ‘I was five or six when my mom and dad played your stuff in the car. Now I’m here.’”Back in Helsinki, people from 17 countries have amassed for our 6.7km run. We are encouraged to take pictures matching images from a free locations booklet along the way and Darude has curated a special playlist for the event on Spotify (spoiler: it’s Sandstorm on repeat). Some runners are clad in gilets and carrying silver briefcases in honour of the video.There is a brief moment 30 seconds after the start where I think I could possibly win, but then the downhill past the Kaivopuisto fence makes way for the slightest of climbs and my pace drops to a painful crawl across the city’s cobbled streets. I try to picture a young Darude along the way, clad inthosewraparound glasses, doingthatcrouched pose.View image in fullscreenNo escaping it … runners pose in costume.Photograph: Tom Little/Reuters“I had very little to do with the music video, but it was an awesome experience,” Darude tells me, adding that director Juuso Syrjä would go on to direct various Nordic noir shows, including Netflix’s Border Town. “There were so many cool people that pulled together for the video and the follow-up ones, and so many of us had actual careers come out of it.”He has the air of a man who’d quite like to be known for more than one hit, but who has also made his peace with the fact that he probably won’t be. “Sandstorm has life of its own, and it’s bigger than me,” he says. “But if people know Sandstorm, I just hope they come and see me live somewhere. I can show them what I do. I’m there partying with them – that’s when I’m at my happiest.”Back at the park I arrive very much not in first place at a rapturous finish line, soundtracked by Darude himself on the decks, selflessly lifting, dropping and remixing the track for an entire hour so that everyone can experience their own unique piece of Sandstorm history. A queue forms for merch signing and one by one Darude politely signs everything given to him. “Let’s have a break from thedududus,” he says to the crowd, thanking them for coming before playing some music that isn’t Sandstorm.Darude plays a 25th anniversary concert atKattilahalli, Helsinki, 6 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsDance musicPop and rockFinlandEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Apart from anything else, it is a reminder that in that post-Kennedy, post-Watergate age, plenty of lawless and febrile things happened that would now be considered phenomena purely attributable to social media.In 1977, an Indianapolis businessman named Tony Kiritsis, with many acquaintances in the police department,kidnapped a mortgage broker named Richard Hall, and tied Hall’s neck with a “dead man’s wire” to his shotgun, which would therefore go off if police sharpshooters tried to kill him. Kiritsis even paraded his victim like this on TV while he read out his demands, a grotesque display in which national TV networks were blandly complicit. Van Sant’s recreation of this extraordinary moment calls to mind the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby in front of police and press.Kiritsis had mortgaged himself to buy land he thought could be developed as a shopping mall, but fell behind with the loan repayments and became convinced – perhaps not without reason – that Hall and his fellow mortgage broker father were manipulating and exploiting the situation with secret designs on his land. Bill Skarsgård, as tense and pop-eyed as a character in The Simpsons, plays the paranoid and rage-filled Kiritsis; Dacre Montgomery is the unhappy Hall imprisoned in Kiritsis’s apartment with the wire-noose around his throat and the shotgun barrel jammed to his neck for 72 hours straight. Al Pacino has an uproarious cameo in the “southern gentleman” voice that he has adopted these days, as Hall’s high-handed father who refuses to give Kiritsis the apology he wants over the phone and even jeers at his son for having “Stockholm syndrome”.Myha’la(from TV’s Industry) plays fictionalised TV reporter Linda Page determined not to be cheated of her scoop, and Colman Domingo has a richly enjoyable role as imperturbably laid-back radio DJ and phone-in host Fred Temple, based on the real life Indianapolis radio star Fred Heckman, whom Kiritsis actually did call up to broadcast his grievances on the air.What is extraordinary about this drama is that, played another way, Hall’s unspeakable ordeal – for that is surely what it was – would be material for something deeply and almost unthinkably shocking. But Hall’s mental health and what would presumably be lifelong PTSD is given scant attention here, mimicking the media and the courts at the time who were instead infatuated by the issue of whether Kiritsis was insane and if he was therefore entitled to an insanity plea. (By contrast,the US’s other great kidnapping case of the time, the 1974 abduction of Jack Teich, was the subject ofTaffy Brodesser-Akner’s novel Long Island Compromise, which explored the idea of generational PTSD that went down to the victim’s children.)The personae and performances of Pacino, Domingo and Myha’la complicate the psychopathic nastiness of the affair, and create something surreal and bizarre and often hilarious: a display of, not heartlessness, exactly, but a shrewd professional sense that pity and fear were emotions that could only benefit the kidnapper. It’s a gripping picture with excellent performances.Dead Man’s Wire screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalGus Van SantCrime filmsPeriod and historical filmsAl PacinoFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the subject which tests narrative forms and thinkability levels.Maybe this is why we prefer to see it as something for absurdism and satire – a way of not staring into the sun – to remember Kubrick’s (brilliant) black comedyDr Strangelove, with no fighting in the war room etc, rather than Lumet’s deadly serious Fail Safe.Bigelow, with screenwriter Noah Oppenheim, broaches one of the most frightening thoughts of all: that a nuclear war could or rather will start with no one knowing who started it or who ended it. I watched this film with translucently white knuckles but also that strange climbing nausea that only this topic can create.View image in fullscreenKyle Allen as Capt Jon Zimmer in A House of DynamitePhotograph: Eros Hoagland/NetflixThe drama is recounted in one 18-minute segment, repeated from various standpoints and various locations: 18 minutes being the time estimated to elapse between military observers reporting the out-of-the-blue launch of a nuke from the Pacific and its projected arrival in Chicago.The action plays out in a series of situation rooms and command-and-control suites with acronyms like PEOC (Presidential Emergency Operations Center) featuring military and civilian personnel in banks of desks, generally in a shallow horseshoe shape facing a very big screen flashing up the threat level from Defcon 2 to Defcon 1 and also showing a large map displaying the missile’s current position, which is occasionally replaced with what amounts to a Zoom mosaic of tense faces belonging to high-ranking officials with no idea what to do, dialling in chaotically from their smartphones.Rebecca Ferguson plays intelligence analyst Capt Olivia Walker, Tracy Letts is the gung ho military chief Gen Anthony Brady – this drama’s equivalent of the cold war’s Gen Curtis LeMay – who advocates an immediate pre-emptive counterstrike before the incoming missile arrives, Jared Harris is the defense secretary Reid Baker who realises that his estranged daughter is in Chicago, Gabriel Basso plays the brilliant and flustered young NSA adviser Jake Baerington who, if this was an Aaron Sorkin script, could be relied on to save the day.View image in fullscreenGabriel Basso as Jake Baerington in A House of Dynamite.Photograph: Eros Hoagland/NetflixJonah Hauer-King plays the thin-faced, priestly naval officer Lt Cmdr Robert Reeves who accompanies the president at all times with a ring-bound folder with the nuclear strike options and authorisation codes.Idris Elbaplays the president himself, who, like George W Bush finding out about 9/11 at an infants’ school, gets the news about the missile while cheerfully demonstrating basketball shots in front of high-schoolers.Frantically, the White House staff try to intercept the missile, and in the event of failure, must decide if they should not respond in kind, effectively sacrifice an American city with millions of lives and risk appeasing the aggressor or launch a retaliation and risk world war three – or even gamble that the missile will not detonate. And they can’t decide if this is a rogue launch from the North Koreans or another nuclear power, born of a fanatical desperation that no one has guessed at. This unknowing, this chaos, operating outside the long understood tradition of mutually assured destruction between two sides is what the film suggests will be the origin of a new war.Bigelow’s movie has the classic personae from what might be called the nuclear apocalypse film: the careworn, grey-haired officials who always guessed it might come to this; the smart, hard-working younger staff doing their loyal, patriotic best, the utterly unreflective young bomber pilots entrusted with delivering the final blow. And all with the sculpted or painted faces of Ike and Lincoln in the White House looking impassively down.View image in fullscreenA House of Dynamite.Photograph: Eros Hoagland/NetflixWhat the film shrewdly shows is the horribly ironic transitional moments: along with the heart-stopping intel about the missile, the screens are, at first, still showing ordinary news – headlines such as “Rental demand driving up prices”, now remnants of a lost world.There are times when A House of Dynamite might seem melodramatic or stagey and yet maybe that is how it may well feel in the highest reaches of power – with everyone looking and feeling like actors in elaborate costumes whose roles had only one purpose: to deter aggression, a purpose which is now obsolete. It is a big chill.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalKathryn BigelowIdris ElbaNuclear weaponsFestivalsUS politicsreviewsShareReuse this content"

With Row, a smattering of startling jump cuts showing blood splashed around a boat and flashbacks of the protagonist Megan (Bella Dayne, very impressive) screaming, but the viewer needs to wait out a somewhat unreasonably long running time to find out if the antagonists here are biting fish or knife-wielding killers.All we know at first is that Megan is the only survivor of an attempt to break the record for rowing across the Atlantic from Newfoundland to the UK with four crew members, two men and two women. Having washed up on the Orkneyisland of Hoy, Megan spends most of the film’s present tense in bed recovering when she’s not telling DCI MacKelly (Tam Dean Burn) what happened after she, her best friend Lexi (a sparky Sophie Skelton), captain Daniel (Akshay Khanna) and mystery man Mike (Nick Skaugen), a last-minute replacement for Lexi’s boyfriend Adam (Mark Strepan), set off on their voyage. But how reliable is Megan as a narrator?Writer-director Matthew Losasso, making his feature debut with this, dispenses the reveals with skill, although there are a few stumbles in the motivational logic and a somewhat murky final five minutes of twistiness, which maybe torques the narrative a half turn too much. Nevertheless, for a film with such a small, mostly unknown cast and presumably a limited budget, the effects are very impressive, especially when the boat is storm tossed on waves the size of whales. Like the film itself, the little vessel has a surprisingly large arsenal of tech at its disposal, but of course bad things happen, sometimes by accident and sometimes by cruel design. Despite the aforementioned limitations, Row pulls together surprisingly well, thanks in part to the ensemble’s intense chemistry, striking cinematography and especially fine use of sound and score.Row is in UK cinemas from 5 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsThrillersScotlandRowingreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are some bold and ambitious images here, and some interesting split-screen work. Maybe there’s an issue about the style and substance ratio and perhaps the running time is indulgent, but this is a strong piece of work.Twins Elliott and Luke Tittensor play two soldiers of equal rank in opposing armies, called Pte Warne and Pte Arthur. They represent two nations of fictional Ruritanian weirdness, formerly at war but who have evidently concluded a tensely unstable peace treaty. Warne has a resplendent white uniform and, like the rest of his country, shaves his head, while Arthur has shaggy hair and a looser uniform. These two men have been chosen by their respective countries to be the sole guards at the border in the middle of a vast and featureless desert. They face off every day, notionally co-operating and sharing a station straddling the border, but suspicious, carrying out their various patriotic rituals to reassert their identity.It could be that Hudson was inspired by theelaborate Attari-Wagah border ceremonyof India and Pakistan, a military ballet of mutual resentment that has recently become more acrimonious because of the issue of who gets to have the bigger flag. The peace process means that these two border guards must carry out their daily ceremonies with no one else to witness them, their commanding officers and civilian populations being many miles away. They are supplied with food and a large amount of live pigeons, a handful of which have to be released every day to symbolise peace.But when Arthur presumes to release a daily pigeon-batch on his own – they’re supposed to do it jointly – and moreover messes with the boiled eggs that Warne is cooking for his supper, relations between them become strained. They are in existential confrontation in the burning sun, they lose their bearings and a sense of what side of the border they’re on, and they are furthermore traumatised by the appearance of an Indigenous shepherd (played by Neil Maskell). He shows up like Pozzo without Lucky in Beckett’s Godot and the result of this encounter tips them into mutual breakdown. Which of them is which? They do, after all, have a great deal in common: chiefly an overbearing military father figure whose memory haunts each man.This is a boisterous, lively picture: I can imagine Richard Lester having directed it in 1968. Hudson will certainly have more to show us.Straight Circle screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalDrama filmsWar filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Lifting weights, he explained, not only builds stronger muscles, it also boosts the immune system, maintains a healthy heart and improves brain function. Best of all, it can be done in your kitchen, using ordinary domestic items: pints of milk in place of dumbbells, say, or squats wearing a backpack full of books.Anyone intending to use Robert Galbraith’s Strike novels for this purpose would be advised to seek the advice of a GP. The Hallmarked Man may not be the heftiest of the eight so far – it does not even make it into the top three – but it still clocks in at a cool 912 pages. Galbraith’s tendency to whopperdom has in the past elicited a fair amount of griping from critics, me among them, who argued that judicious pruning would better serve her plots and her charismatic private detective duo, the sweary one-legged army veteran Cormoran Strike and his brave, decent business partner Robin Ellacott. Not that it changed anything. The books remained resolutely huge (as did sales – by 2024, a staggering 20 million books had been sold in over 50 countries). Galbraith, otherwise known asJK Rowling, has never been one to bow to her detractors.My arms may plead otherwise, but this time she may have a point. The Hallmarked Man gets off to a spankingly brisk start and from then on seldom lets up. A grotesquely butchered corpse is found in the vault of a silver shop in the City of London. The police claim the body is that of armed robber Jason Knowles, but not everyone accepts their conclusions, including Decima Mullins, who, convinced that the dead man is instead the vanished father of her newborn child, approaches Strike to help her prove it.With so much going on, it is occasionally a challenge to keep track of who has done what and why, but it hardly mattersSceptical, Strike and Ellacott reluctantly take on the case, but, as they study the evidence, the plot only thickens. The silver shop, located next to Freemasons’ Hall, specialises in masonic artefacts: among his other mutilations, the dead man’s body has been cut with a masonic hallmark. There are other missing men whose descriptions could match that of the corpse. Before long, Strike and Ellacott find themselves puzzling over not just one potential murder but four.As always with Galbraith, the personal lives of the detectives play as pivotal a role in the story as the increasingly labyrinthine mystery. Strike’s endless and endlessly tantalising will they/won’t they two-step with Ellacott is jeopardised by her deepening relationship with CID officer Ryan Murphy, himself caught up in a difficult case. Talented but manipulative ex-Metropolitan police officer Kim Cochran has joined the agency and seems set on stirring things up. And if all that was not enough to be getting along with, Mullins turns out to have close family connections with Charlotte Campbell-Ross, Strike’s dead former fiancee.The result is a terrific and tightly plotted romp with none of the longueurs that padded previous volumes. With an apparent effortlessness that speaks of great discipline and skill, Galbraith keeps the plates of all four possible murder inquiries spinning, each one replete with its own satisfyingly unexpected feints and twists. With so much going on, it is occasionally a challenge to keep track of who exactly has done what and why, but Galbraith’s sure-footedness is such that it hardly matters: the desire to leaf back and check a point feels considerably less urgent than the compulsion to find out what will happen next.The propulsive drive of the story is matched by the sheer enjoyment of the ride. Previous Strike novels have proved something of a battleground for the often toxic cultural and political wars that Galbraith/Rowling has engaged in on the public stage – transphobia and online mob justice inThe Ink Black Heart, cult indoctrination inThe Running Grave. But, despite the appearance of a gloriously awful ex-Tory MP who sprinkles his conversation with Latin tags and goes on political quiz shows, The Hallmarked Man is not a novel with a manifesto. For all its fiendish cat’s cradle of a plot, it foregrounds the personal, reminding us yet again what thoroughly good company Strike and Ellacott are. It is no small feat to keep readers invested in a relationship that has been on the breathless brink of almost consummation for seven (giant) books. But Galbraith pulls it off with aplomb, deepening our affection for this engaging, exasperating should-be couple as Strike promises himself (and us) that this time he will finally tell Ellacott how he feels …Some of Galbraith’s more irritating quirks do surface, most distractingly the insistence on clumsy phonetic dialogue of the “I fink ’e said … didn’ ’e say ’e knew” variety. And little is gained by detailing every drink order in every pub. But these are quibbles. The Hallmarked Man is a triumph of storytelling. Sheer weight aside, I’m pretty sure it improved my cognitive function. It also touched my heart.The Hallmarked Man by Robert Galbraith is published by Sphere (£30).

Three and a half decades on, I still sometimes meditate on what a school friend of mine said in a here’s-a-profound-thought tone of voice: “I’d rather be stupid than happy”.In this clever book, Stuart Jeffries starts out at a double disadvantage, though. First: he has an excellently snappy title but it’s open to question whether stupidity can be said to have a history in any meaningful sense. The quality of stupidity is just, sort of,there;and there’s lots of it. Could you write a history of happiness, or bad luck, or knees? You’d be on firmer ground, as he recognises, historicising the concept of stupidity: a short history, in other words, of “stupidity” – how successive societies and thinkers have defined and responded to reason’s derr-brained secret sharer. As an intellectual historian who has written smart and chewy popular books about the Frankfurt School (Grand Hotel Abyss) and postmodernism (Everything, All the Time, Everywhere), he certainly has the chops for it.But then there’s the second problem: definitions. Is stupidity the same thing as ignorance? As foolishness? As the unwillingness to learn (AKA obtuseness, or what the Greeks called amathia)? As the inability to draw the right conclusions from what you have learned? Is it a quality of person or a quality of action? On and off, in ordinary usage, it’s all of these. It’s a know-it-when-you-see-it (except in yourself) thing.It’s only with the Enlightenment that stupidity started to be seen as a cognitive rather than a moral failingPerhaps inescapably, therefore, Jeffries makes a number of nice philosophical distinctions about the meaning of the term – and then goes back to using it in the know-it-when-you-see-it sense, so his discussion wanders through whole fields of its meanings without ever quite erecting a boundary fence. In a way, you could see this book not as a history of stupidity but as a slant history of its various opposites. It’s an amiable and rambling tour through the history of philosophy, looking at the idea of rationality and its limitations.If it’s stupid not to seek the truth, is it not even more stupid to suppose there’s a truth to be sought? The western ancients were in the first camp; and their special distinction – thank you, Socrates – was to see reason and virtue as being directly connected. It’s only with the Enlightenment that stupidity started to be seen as a cognitive rather than a moral failing. (Though when we later meet Hannah Arendt’s reflections on Eichmann, on the banality of mind that made Nazi evil possible, we perhaps return to the older view.)There’s an interesting early chapter on the eastern traditions. Daoism and Confucianism and Buddhism see wisdom and virtue as linked, too; though wisdom in these cases is associated less with deductive rationality than with a submission to the natural order of things. Daoist “wu-wei”, or “effortless action” (going with the flow) is the key. Western individualism, according to a scholar Jeffries quotes, leaves us with selves resembling “a kind of avocado” with a nub of ego at its centre, whereas in the mysterious east there are to be found “flexi-selves” of the sort you can’t buy in the grocery aisle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Jeffries gives us affectionate readings of Don Quixote and Flaubert’s Bouvard and Pécuchet, dips into Shakespeare’s fools and the rich menu of stupidities available in King Lear,as well as making the odd excursus into cognitive science. And the abstract question of whether rationalism is the greatest stupidity of all is given concrete force in Jeffries’s chapters about IQ tests (their inventor, we discover, would have been horrified by the stupid way they came to be used), eugenics, the “mass stupidity” of totalitarianism and the “structural stupidity” of life under late capitalism. Adorno and Horkheimer’s Dialectic of Enlightenment – which draws a line from utopian rationalism to the camps – is the touchstone here, but the whole rationalism-skeptic crew, from Foucault and Derrida to John Gray, get a look-in. Less high-mindedly, Donald Trump and Boris Johnson also get it in the neck. This is a learned and often exhilarating book, and it’s a bit all over the place – but, given the subject matter, it’d be stupid to expect otherwise.A Short History of Stupidity by Stuart Jeffries is published by John Wiley & Sons (£25).

Damian Barr takes on this challenge, and he’s found a historic couple who make the ideal source material. Working-class Scottish artists Bobby MacBryde and Robert Colquhoun were rarely apart after they met in 1933. They lived and worked together, became famous together and then declined into desperate squalor together – even poorer than when they began.Barr knows what it’s like to conquer Glasgow from a small, working-class town on its outskirts; he knows what it’s like to find yourself feted for your portraits of the place you’ve left irrevocably behind. His memoir,Maggie and Me, was a hard-hitting yet rambunctious tale of growing up gay near Motherwell under Thatcher, uneasily aware that the woman who pushed his parents deeper into poverty also taught him that the ruthless exercise of his talents offered his escape. He expanded his exploration of how brutality can take hold in his novelYou Will Be Safe Here, set in South Africa. Now he returns to Scotland in this moving meditation on art, love and home.In Barr’s telling, the two Roberts meet on their first day at the Glasgow School of Art – scholarship boys drawn together, reluctantly on Robert’s part and enthusiastically on Bobby’s. They move into the attic of the wealthy socialist Mrs Cranston (“Politics is everyone’s thing, whether we like it or not,” she reprimands their tutor) and live on Bobby’s stews and a love that moves rapidly from seeming impossible to feeling predestined, driven by Bobby’s courage in seeking out other homosexual friends and allies on the fringes of Glasgow life. They’re divided by war, when Robert fights and the asthmatic Bobby doesn’t, and then become celebrated figures in bohemian London, exhibiting at the Lefevre gallery and mingling in Soho with Francis Bacon and Peter Watson (Barr has Robert driving an ambulance, just about plausibly, with Bacon).Over the years, it’s common for couples to divide not just household tasks but talents and traits between them, so that each grows into their differences from the other. Barr is very astute on the ways that the two Roberts deplete as well as enhance each other. There’s charm in their differences: Bobby’s face is a sun, Robert’s a half moon; Bobby cries easily while Robert holds his feelings in. But more disturbingly, they divide their art too, so that Bobby paints still lifes while Robert paints people, and Bobby comes to feel that he would betray his lover if he changed this. “What started out as a joke is becoming a contract that Bobby doesn’t remember signing.” It’s not surprising that Robert, with his more fragile ego and his more ruthless commitment to work, becomes the more successful one, and that Bobby declines as Robert flourishes, until Robert, dependent always on Bobby’s resourcefulness and bonhomie, begins to decline as well. Barr’s memoir all too vividly described his mother’s drunken fights with her boyfriend. These memories must power the lurid incandescence of the brawls between the men as they drink away income and talent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Barr moves from the intense, intimate storytelling of the opening chapters to a travelogue that skates across place and time, and then narrates their final years by impressively imagining the letters that Bobby sends to old acquaintances begging for cash. There are moments when all this becomes unwieldy. I’d hope that a novelist with such considerable skill could do better than introducing lengthy backstory with “as the strap settles, he remembers what it took to get here, to this moment”. There are also sections where Robert remains shadowy compared with the livelier and more introspective Bobby – but it’s true of many couples in life that one is less knowable than the other. And it was remarkable how much I did care about the men’s relationship throughout, finding the prospect of their splitting up as unthinkable as they do, however unlivable their life together becomes. Barr’s care for the two Roberts is palpable. The narrator is drawn into their erotic force field, almost as if there are three people in this couple (as it happens, actual threesomes are frequent occurrences).“Never forget where you come fae,” Bobby’s Aunt Maggie tells him as she sends him out to conquer the world. Barr dramatises the double-edged complexity of this. Insofar as it’s Barr’s own return home, this novel is a kind of love letter to Scotland – from the Ayrshire hills where the men lie “painting together, curled like commas, naked in the nest they’ve rolled in the high golden grass”, to Glasgow’s Mackintosh building, with its huge panes of glass that “bounce the north light like sails catching a wind”. But it’s a love letter that encodes diagnosis and disaster. Both Roberts flourish in London as Scottish artists, with Scottish subjects and Scottish party pieces. Yet they’re unwelcome when they make a catastrophic trip home. Barr mingles comedy and tragedy with wonderful fluidity, showing that it’s their inability to forget where they’re from and truly find a home elsewhere that destroys them, in the end.Lara Feigel is the author ofLook!

Oversleeping and missing lectures, forgetting where your study group is meeting, mislaying your books – a lot of your time is spent looking for things.It is these small mysteries that concern Little Problems, a cute detective game, in which the protagonist, Mary, must use her sleuthing abilities to make it through each day as a new student . Created by Indonesian designer Melisa, who has chosen to go by her first name only, the idea comes from her love of detective stories, but also her wish to take violence out of the genre.“I read detective comic books, novels and manga, and have been playing detective games since I was a kid. I like horror as well, so I originally thought it would be a great idea to develop a detective game with a horror aesthetic. But after a few weeks of consuming murder and horror stories 24/7, I began to feel depressed, like the world was such a dark place. I wanted to make a story about good people who grow up and make mistakes. This game is all about that nice fuzzy feeling you get from solving small life mysteries.”View image in fullscreenRelatable … Little Problems.Photograph: Posh Cat StudioIn short, there is no criminal activity here. Sometimes, it is just about Mary trying to find a favourite earring, a friend in the crowd – or her mischievous cat. Each scene works like a hidden object puzzle game; you search a location for clues, which may be photos, notes or schedules, and then deduce what has happened. Who broke your favourite mug? You need to check what was in it, then use information about what your housemates like to drink and if they were around at the right time to find the culprit. Surely this is the most relatable crime ever investigated in a video game.The wholesome, low-stakes feel is accentuated by an art style that draws inspiration from soft manga and anime such as Doraemon, Chibi Maruko-chan and Kobo-chan. As with similarly domestic titles such as Unpacking and A Little to the Left, there is a lot of subtle storytelling going on in the background around friendships and family, giving weight to the simple premise. Melisa started the project as a quick prototype for a Twitch game jam, but ended up spending two years on it, bringing two other staff onboard and setting up her studio, Posh Cat. It has been something of a passion project. “I would love to play more cosy detective games, so I made one,” she says. “Here’s to more cosy games in 2025 and beyond!”Little Problems is released onPCon 9 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPCIndie gamesPuzzle gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Into a stack of welded steel boxes resembling an apartment block in a city that could be anywhere, Hatoum has melted or blasted holes imitating drone or missile strikes. Parts of interior walls and floors have been shorn away to look like apartments with their fronts blown off. This is the shell of what was once a home to many, emptied out by war, like the buildings you saw on the news last night.Hatoum created Bourj, which means “tower” in Arabic, for an exhibition in Beirut, the city where she was born into a Palestinian family in 1952. Since 1975 she has been based in London but her art knows no peace. Home and family are perforated by violence. A steel cot resembling a prison cell has cheese wire in place of a soft mattress. A kitchen with small chairs for the kids, alongside larger ones for mum and dad, has been incinerated, and the carbonised fragments of wooden furniture painstakingly reassembled inside wire mesh replicas of what they looked like before the disaster.In a work made this year, a baby’s disembodied arm lies on the ground. Cast from glass it could almost be cute, like a little handprint on a kitchen wall. Except you know it’s not. It filters a horror too terrible to look at or even think about directly: the reality of what happens when you bomb children.View image in fullscreenCarbonised fragments … a detail from Hatoum’s  Remains of the Day, 2016-2018.Photograph: White Cube/Kitmin Lee/© Mona HatoumWhat, you may wonder, has all this to do with Alberto Giacometti, the Swiss modern sculptor who died in 1966? A lot, it turns out. This is the second in a series of exhibitions that juxtapose Giacometti with contemporary artists.In the first, he was made to look old and safe by the wildly creative Huma Bhabha, but this is a more complex, reciprocal conversation – between Hatoum and an artist she loves, or at least finds common cause with against a terrifying world. Her cheese wire prison cot, Incommunicado, stands next to Giacometti’s most brutal work, his 1932 bronze Woman with Her Throat Cut: a sprawled body on the ground, opened up like an anatomical model, resembling a giant praying mantis with a long, exposed oesophagus and a head that is a tiny screaming mask.Giacometti was part of the surrealist movement when he created this splayed frenzy. Does it wallow in the macabre? Hatoum suggests you have to do that to capture the violence of reality in art. Close by she places her piece A Bigger Splash: six giant, blood-red splashes that she cast in glass in a workshop in Murano. Most artists working in Venice would be inspired by sunsets or canals but for Hatoum it’s always blood. She –unlike David Hockney, whom she mocks with her title – can’t forget the world’s anguish. And she sees a fellow spirit in Giacometti.View image in fullscreenA cartoon kitty on the prowl … Giacometti’s The Cat, 1951.Photograph: Fondation GiacomettiThat empathy with an artist who died when she was 14 takes an extraordinary twist when they create a joint work. Giacometti’s The Nose, made in 1947, looks like the grinning skull of a commedia dell’ arte clown, out of which sprouts a thin spear of a nose. Here, it is displayed inside Hatoum’s prison-cell-like Cube, a steel cage just big enough for a person. Their “joint” artwork is an unholy installation of nihilistic despair. Giacometti’s carnivalesque death mask – he said it grew out of watching people die, their noses appearing to enlarge as their cheeks sank – is a prisoner in Hatoum’s image of authority, abuse, oppression.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She is today’s Picasso’Read moreWhat the two share is a seriousness about life, a refusal to shy away from the modern world’s pain. But Hatoum’s eye for Giacometti’s black humour also leads her to include his delightful 1954 sculpture Cat, a long, slender cartoon kitty on a permanent prowl. It’s the feline equivalent of his walking human figures, and while they resemble Etruscan funeral statuettes, this puss looks like an Egyptian mummified feline. Archaeology is for both these artists a bedrock of the human. Near Giacometti’s cat, Hatoum shows her Terracotta Tile, a red tile with a dog’s paw-print in it – her homage to ancient Roman tiles that still preserve the prints of pooches who died 2,000 years ago.Sculpture has changed a lot since Giacometti’s death but this series proves what magnificent power it has in our century. Hatoum shares Giacometti’s grief, terror and compassion even though their attitude to media is very different. Back in 1985 she walked doggedly through Brixton, barefoot, with Doctor Marten boots tied to her ankles. The video of this performance is shown here close to a Giacometti striding statuette. She pounds the streets, watched by puzzled passers by, dragging the weight of those empty boots – the weight of the world.Mona Hatoum Encounters: Giacometti is atthe Barbican, London, from 3 September to 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsSculptureArtAlberto GiacomettiPalestinian territoriesExhibitionsBarbicanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Never mind trigger warnings: these are the narrative pillars ofShostakovich’s Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, theopera decried by Stalin as “muddle instead of music”. Stalin’s sudden condemnation was thoroughly political, of course – but British music critics were similarly taken aback after the first UK performance in 1936. “Some of it is clever parody, but much of it is crude,” sniffed the Daily Mail. Almost 90 years later, the opera remains unequivocally grim.Like its UK premiere, thisPromsouting was a concert performance in English translation. Without the trappings of a full staging or the linguistic buffer of the original Russian libretto, the nastiness of this tale of a rape that starts an affair that leads to two murders seemed even more inescapable than usual. Ruth Knight’s semi-staging involved minimal paraphernalia – an iron bed, a small table, a wooden witness box – but used lighting to melodramatic effect. Harsh spotlights isolated characters. The digital screens behind the performers switched several times to blinding white, transforming the Chorus of English National Opera into a mob in silhouette. The entire stage was bathed periodically in red.View image in fullscreenShostakovich’s Lady Macbeth at the BBC Proms.Photograph: Andy ParadiseNo wonder the audience giggled as Nicky Spence’s Sergey muttered “Now we’re really in the shit,” as the betrayed husband approached the lovers’ bedroom: light relief was in distinctly short supply. For all that Shostakovich called the piece a “tragic satire” and included numerous lively musical parodies – of ballroom dances and operetta, circus music and brass-band oompah – conductor John Storgårds kept the BBC Philharmonic deadly serious. There were rude bassoons (grittily flatulent in their lowest register) and even ruder, detumescent trombones, strings that waltzed and woodwind that fidgeted. But Storgårds allowed no levity. Long stretches of the score function as mid-century modern wallpaper, the orchestra ticking over in the background, as restless as the heroine. Occasionally, Storgårds coaxed quiet passages of stunning tenderness; but climaxes crashed relentlessly in vast waves of blaring brass and vicious timpani strokes.That the solo voices struggled at times to compete only added to the performance’s increasingly acute claustrophobia. Brindley Sherratt was on rich-voiced, characterful form as Boris, the piece’s appalling patriarch. As his son and the heroine’s husband, John Findon had both the vocal power and imposing stage presence to resist any suspicion that the character is purely a pushover. There were impressive contributions from Ava Dodd and Niamh O’Sullivan as alternative lust-objects. But nothing was more striking or disturbing than the interaction between Spence’s Sergey and Amanda Majeski’s Katerina: the former heroically clarion even while dramatically faithless, the latter a terrifyingly lyrical portrait of a woman “so bored I could hang myself” – or, as it turns out, commit murder.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

One was a volume of poems by Alexander Pushkin.But Turina – a voracious reader, never without a couple of books in his backpack – had no plans to pick it up again.The 19th-century Russian has acquired a troubling resonance in Ukraine since the 2022 full-scale invasion of the country. He is frequently used by the invaders as a symbol of Russianness:huge postersdepicting the writer were for example erected in the southern city of Kherson during its occupation.View image in fullscreenA statue of Alexander Pushkin in Kyiv shortly before its dismantling.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesFor many in Ukraine, it shows Pushkin is being co-opted as a cultural weapon in Russia’s war. Some would also argue that Pushkin’s poetry reinforced, and even helped form, Russia’s imperial ideology. Numerous statues of the writer have been dismantled since 2022 while many streets named after him (there were at least594in 2018) have reverted to their former names, or been given new ones.Turina knew he could not sell the book. “You couldn’t give it to a friend, you couldn’t give it to a library,” he said. So in his garden, Turina gently, experimentally, placed his volume of Pushkin on the bonfire.Feeding Pushkin to the flames was not some grandiose gesture of hate. It was an artist’s private and exploratory act, he said.“I’m afraid to burn books, to destroy them,” he said. “For me it’s symbolic of being barbarian.” He said his purpose was quite different. He wanted find out how he would feel. Would there be any catharsis? Grief? Anger?“I didn’t feel anything. I felt nothing good, nothing bad,” he said.The second book in Turina’s hand was a volume of poetry by the contemporary Russian writer Dmitry Vodennikov.For him, this represented a very different literary relationship.While a student in the western city of Lviv in the early 2000s, Turina saw Vodennikov perform his work. It was a revelation.“It was something new, a new voice. I understood he was gay: it was between the lines. It was so tender. It was very cool,” he said. “I started to be his fan.”He told his parents he needed extra money for sports shoes. Then he spent what amounted to more than half his monthly student stipend on a single copy of poems by Vodennikov.“In time, I knew all his poetry,” said Turina. “He was part of my way of thinking, my vision of my work.”But then, after 2022, Turina decided to check out Vodennikov’s position on the war – “and now,” he said, “I find he is a pro-war poet.” Turina decided to leave his former hero’s book in his garden – to decay.AcrossUkraine, readers are facing decisions about what to do with their Russian-language books. Many people – and especially those in the creative and cultural community – have switched to using Ukrainian in their everyday lives.How best to “decolonise” from centuries of Russian and Soviet cultural influence is a frequent point of discussion.In many cases, Russian missiles have taken decisions out of individuals’ hands. On the morning of 23 June, for example – after a barrage of Shahed drones and cruise missiles – books in Russian, some apparently stained with blood, were part of the wreckage of an apartment block in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv. Ten people, including an 11-year-old, were killed in the attack.View image in fullscreenBooks in the wreckage of an apartment block in Kyiv’s Shevchenkivskyi district after a Russian airstrike.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianWhen Kateryna Iakovlenko’s apartment in Irpin just outside Kyiv took a direct hit in March 2022, all of the writer and curator’s books, including those in Russian, the language in which she was raised, were destroyed. So were all her other possessions.Three years on, she owns just two books in Russian, both translations from other languages, neither available in Ukrainian, and both gifts from their authors.Oleksandr Mykhed faced a similar situation when his house in Hostomel, near Kyiv, was hit in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion. In his book The Language of War, the writer, now a member of the armed forces, recounts visiting its ruins and finding his Dostoevskys and Nabokovs among the wreckage.The experience of losing his home has transformed his relationship to his possessions – including his books.“Once you have become a refugee, you are always thinking like a refugee,” he said. “Better not to feel sentimental about books. These are just kilos that you might have to think about what to do with, if you need to leave.” There are no Russian-language books, even translations of foreign literature, in his new library.View image in fullscreenOleksandr Mykhed, a Ukrainian writer and soldier, posing for a portrait at Kyiv’s Knyzhkovy Lev bookshop.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianThis June, Mariana Matveichuk, a freelance journalist, took 90kg of Russian books to a recycling centre near her home town in western Ukraine.She was raised in a Ukrainian-speaking area, and attended a Ukrainian-speaking university in Kyiv in the early 2000s. Nevertheless at that point most inhabitants of the city, and many of her fellow students, were Russian-speaking.Many authors she was studying – the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Jacques Rancière, for example – were also available in translation in Russian, but not Ukrainian.She said she had “a book fetish” and would frequent Kyiv’s sprawling secondhand book market at Pochaina. When she graduated, she hauled her stash of books back to western Ukraine by train.These are the volumes that she has now recycled – sparing Anton Chekhov’s letters and diaries. “I have personal respect for him. Chekhov is funny, I like his sense of humour,” she said. “And they are also hidden at my mum’s, so no one will see Russian books on my shelves.”She considered trying to sell her books back to dealers at the Pochaina book market, but “I thought no, I don’t want to give them a second life.”View image in fullscreenPeople browsing the books at Kyiv’s Pochaina market.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianLooking back at the number of academic texts she had read in Russian as a student – despite being a Ukrainian-speaker at a Ukrainian-language university – she had reflected, she said, on the “subtle Russification” of the culture that had surrounded her.Clearing out her Russian books (“I got rid of Tolstoy, of Dostoevsky, of 12 tomes by [poet and playwright Vladimir] Mayakovsky”) was also, she said, a way of “saying goodbye to some of my perceptions when I was 20. I am saying goodbye to what I thought was important.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are those who have decided to keep them because they are part of a family story – perhaps reflecting parents’ or grandparents’ struggle to acquire them under the Soviet Union.There are those who have come to hate the Russian language, associating it with the thought-world and media bubble of the invading country, but have still held on to a book – a treasured Russian translation of Haruki Murakami, say – because it represents a part of their own past.In Kharkiv, for decades a principally Russian-speaking city, the artist Pavlo Makov uses Ukrainian in day-to-day life.But he does not intend to get rid of his Russian books.View image in fullscreenA bookshelf at Pavlo Makov’s art studio in Kharkiv.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianMany foreign-language titles still lack good Ukrainian translations, he said – a reflection of the relative dominance of Russia and Russian, compared with Ukraine and Ukrainian, in the post-Soviet global publishing market.And he was doubtful about the wisdom of destroying or recycling Russian-language books, since it can create associations with the actions of authoritarian regimes. “I think that for the image of Ukraine, it’s not a good idea to do things like that. OK, you hate the Russian language. I understand it. But a book is a source of information.”In fact, studying Russian books and literature was important, he said, “because this country is our enemy, and this is enemy is very close. We should examine, we should research it.”In Pochaina, the enormous secondhand book market in Kyiv, business is not very brisk. It is certainly the place to go if you want to buy books in Russian – although maybe not if you want to sell them.In one corner, there is what one secondhand bookseller, Dmytro Drobin, called “an Egyptian pyramid” of books that no one can sell – mainly Russian-language, Soviet editions of everything from Tolstoy and Chekhov to popular fiction and Stendhal translations.Another bookseller, who preferred not to give her name, sells secondhand and antiquarian books in Ukrainian and Russian. She said the choice of language was largely determined by generation. “Young people mostly want to read in Ukrainian,” she said.When people offer her Russian books to buy, she rarely takes them: demand is down.View image in fullscreenHundreds of discarded books, mostly Russian-language, at Pochaina flea market.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianOccasionally, she said, customers ask for “new books published in Russia. There are very, very few of these people.” From 2016, importing books from Russia has been restricted, requiring a permit, and since 2023 it has been outlawed.Dmytro Drobin, a bookseller surrounded in his shop by thousands of Russian-language books, said he believed his government is pursuing “forced Ukrainianisation”. He compared the climate to the situation under the Tsarist empire, when publishing books in Ukrainian was severely restricted.Russian-language books by Ukrainian authors may be published, but, since 2023, are ineligible for state grants. Since 2023, books by Russian citizens may not be published. Ukrainian is the sole official language of the country, but Russian remains widely spoken; minority languages include Crimean Tatar.Business was slow, said Drobin. He attributed that to the millions of Ukrainians who have left the country, to the numbers in the army, and the hard economic times caused by the war. “The very nature of reading has collapsed,” he said.In a Ukrainian-language bookshop in a southern suburb of Kyiv, on the city’s left bank, the mood was more upbeat. Alpaca, a world away from thenew hipster bookshopsof central Kyiv, sells mostly children’s books.View image in fullscreenMaryna Medvedeva, the manager of Alpaca family bookshop.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianIt has been offering customers a deal: if they bring in unwanted Russian books, they can get discounts of 20-30% on new books to buy from the shop. Any extra funds gleaned by the shop from selling the Russian titles for recycling are donated to the Ukrainian armed forces.“I wanted to give people the opportunity to get rid of their stocks of old books that are just lying around. You can’t give them away, you can’t sell them, it’s a shame that they are just lying there,” said the store’s manager, Maryna Medvedeva.She and her colleagues had brought their own Russian books to the scheme. “I’m not sorry. I was going to keep [some Russian books], but then I opened one, I thought I’d read it – but no, I can’t, it’s just a feeling of repulsion.”Yulliia Kavun was shopping in the store with her young son, Myron. Her family was displaced from the city of Kostiantynivka in the eastern Donetsk region after the Russian-backed takeover of parts of the region in 2014. The bulk of their home library – in Russian, the family language – was definitively destroyed along with their house on 26 February this year.View image in fullscreenYulliia and Myron Kavun bookshopping in Alpaca.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianNow she was contemplating taking advantage of Alpaca’s scheme to help buy the books needed for Myron’s education.For Kavun, choices about books reflect a necessary accommodation to her unenviable circumstances as a refugee.She planned, she said, to go to Poland, where her graduate daughter is already living – but that will require yet another linguistic and literary shift.“We are nobody here, and in Poland we are nobody either. So what’s the difference? We might as well just go there. So we’ll have to buy Polish books, once we are there.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineUkraine in depthEuropeRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tucked away, just off the bustle of London’s Uxbridge Road, the building’s muted colours, simple sign and arched doorway give little away. Step inside, though, and you’ll soon be enticed by what is the UK’s first permanent exhibition and cultural space dedicated to Somali heritage.Officially opened last May, Culture House features a collection of over 150 artefacts, a rotating exhibition, poetry workshops and a digital archive.It has quickly developed a reputation as a hub for the UK’s Somali community, while drawing in curious visitors from outside the diaspora too. Non-profit group theAnti-Tribalism Movement, who lead the project, say the aim is to “celebrate, preserve and connect” Somali culture and communities.“We want the space to feel very open for people – be they Somali or non-Somali,” says Intisar Yusuf, the project’s operations director. “Culture House is about British-Somali identity – what did we bring over with us? What is meaningful to us?”Visitors can explore artefacts grouped into three themes: Spiritual Echoes, Threads of Daily Life and Crafting for the Individual. Items on display include hand-carved combs, wooden headrests, camel bells and incense burners, each labelled with its place of origin and details of how it might be used in nomadic communities. The main room features a striking exhibition of portraits of Somali locals with their favourite cultural objects, captured by Nimbles Archive. Other rooms are dedicated to temporary exhibitions, which the team plan to use as a platform for emerging local creatives.View image in fullscreenThreads of Memory, an exhibition of portraits of Somali locals with their favourite cultural objects, captured by Nimbles Archive.Photograph: Lyndon DouglasThe permanent collection emerged organically from over 15 years of community donations. “They were just sitting in boxes and suitcases in people’s homes,” Intisar recalls. “Many people in the community realised that if we don’t preserve these objects now, we risk losing them altogether.”After a small trial exhibition at the International Somali awards in 2016, another project by ATM, the team saw the impact such items could have. “People were emotional when they saw an old photo or old spoon and had conversations about their memories,” says deputy director Abdirashid Fidow. “That’s when we realised how powerful this heritage is and how deeply people wanted to have a space where those stories could live.”With support from DrakonHeritageand Conservation, and Abira Hussein, a Somali curator and researcher, the team developed their collections policy and built curatorial skills, working towards museum standards.The building itself – once a fire station and later a storage unit – has been redesigned in collaboration with architecture studioFreehaus, known for theAfrica Centrein Southwark. Traditional Somali design elements were integrated throughout – including geometric wall ventilation features inspired by Somali architecture and lampshades modelled after hand-woven baskets found in homes across the Horn.“We wanted people to feel like they were stepping into a Somali cultural space, as if you’re stepping back home,” says Intisar. “We don’t want to be visible in a textbook, but in a place that people can visit and connect with.”The team say that the community response has been “overwhelmingly positive”, with visitors asking for “a bigger space, more artefacts, and more events”.“With our capacity, it has proven to be difficult. But it’s a good problem to have – it just shows how needed a space like Culture House is,” says learning officer Abeer Ali.View image in fullscreenMama Asha, a respected elder in the local Somali community who donated several artefacts to Culture House.Photograph: Mahamed Mahamud (aka Nimble)Among those moved by the space was Mama Asha, a respected elder in the local community and long-time visitor of ATM, who donated several artefacts. “She was emotional – not because of any single object,” says Fidow, “but because for the first time, she saw a cultural space that existed beyond her own house.” He recalls her saying: “I never thought I would see a Somali cultural object in London. I thought this would disappear in people’s memories – seeing this gives me hope.”The exhibition has also become a powerful educational space for younger generations. Many British Somalis, who feel disconnected from their roots, have found the space helpful in rebuilding that relationship.Intisar shares one mother’s experience: “She was in her 30s, and her kids were quite young. She told me, ‘Today we’re having a Somali day – I’m taking them to eat Somali food and visiting Culture House.’ They were dressed in traditional Somali clothes. She said she didn’t even know half the words herself, but the Culture House gave her a way to teach her kids – and learn alongside them.”Among the local artists featured in the first temporary exhibition is Najma Elmi, whose work Signs of Allah explores themes of Islam, travel and identity. For Elmi, having her debut exhibition in Culture House was especially meaningful. “It felt like the perfect fit,” she says. “To have my work shown in a space frequented by Somalis – young and old – was very special. My private opening night was the first time many of my aunties and uncles attended an exhibition – they were delighted to see our culture preserved in London.”The team is also building relationships with larger institutions like the British Museum and Powell-Cotton Museum , which hold collections and archives of Somali artefacts.“There are lots of collectors that brought back objects fromSomaliaduring the colonial period, so the wording and experiences of some of the objects is very colonial,” Intisar explains. “We want to build a bridge so that we can give the real stories and experiences behind how these objects were used. We want to choose how to present ourselves to a wider platform.”That wider platform includes plans for talks, open mics and book panels – for everyone, not just Somali artists. This September it will join the Open House festival, a city-wide event inviting the public to explore London’s architecture and community spaces. The team hopes it will draw in a wider, more diverse audience and not exist solely as a place for Somali people. The choice of the seemingly ambiguous name was intentional, they say: “We want the space to be open to all.”Explore more on these topicsArt and designHeritageMuseumsArchitectureExhibitionsSomaliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

That created the sense of the kunstkammer, the Renaissance idea in which wealthy people would bring together exotic items from around the world.”Among the highlights of the collection is a celestial globe commissioned in the 16th century by one of the earliest modern astronomers, Wilhelm IV of Hesse-Kassel.View image in fullscreenA celestial globe commissioned in the 16th century. ‘It’s like those apps of the night sky you get that tell you which stars you are looking at.’Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianWhen it was wound up, the globe turned to show the position of constellations. “It’s like those apps of the night sky you get that tell you which stars you are looking at,” Stephens said. “It was made in the 1570s. To have that level of precision and complexity and so many moving points is awesome.”The silver ship – the Schwarzenberg Nef – was created in about 1580. It is a ceremonial ewer – a pitcher or jug – that could be filled with drink through a hole in the deck with the spout concealed within the bow. “It’s miraculous,” said Stephens, pointing out details such as the rigging billowing out with the weight of a crew member and the hefty chicken on a plate in the captain’s cabin.It is not certain that Henry VIII handled the silver-gilt cup that appears in another cabinet, but the signs are that it was his – one of his inventories describes such a vessel weighing exactly the same as this one.Most of the objects were collected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They have been held at various homes and offices owned by members of the Schroder family.The only collection comparable to Bath’s new kunstkammer, Stephens said, wasthe Waddesdon Bequest in the British Museum, a collection of Renaissance treasures collected by Baron Ferdinand Rothschild. “What’s really exciting is to see all these objects brought together in one place. It’s extraordinary, really.”The Schroder Gallery opens to the public on 10 September 2025Explore more on these topicsMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

It being the 1990s, he doesn’t have the option of simply being creepy on social media; instead, he takes her hostage and attempts to marry her, as you do, in a period-comedy-horror-thriller that is entertaining enough moment-to-moment, but doesn’t add up anything very substantial overall. Standing in the way of Paul’s deranged scheme is bodyguard Bell (a grounded and nicely judged performance by Eric Dane), and rounding out the men in Sofia’s life is her NBA player boyfriend Rhodes (Jimmie Fails).Screenwriter Jimmy Warden knows a grabby real-life premise when he sees one. In 1985, a bear ate a massive amount of cocaine and fatally overdosed, leading, in 2023, to the release of the Warden-scripted movie Cocaine Bear. In 1996, Robert Dewey Hoskins was sentenced to 10 years in prison for stalking Madonna, providing the loose inspiration for this latest Warden script, which this time out he has also directed (casting his wife Weaving in the lead role). Warden is not a bad director of individual scenes, with several sequences playing out like miniature music videos, complete with big bold needle-drop choices on the soundtrack. The problem is the overall cohesion, or rather, lack of it – there are plenty of cool ideas, and a narrative that strings them together effectively enough, but it’s unclear what we’re meant to feel about any of it.Are we supposed to be ironically amused, in a Tarantino-esque emotionally detached way? Or are we supposed to be invested in Sofia as a horror heroine we hope will be able to defeat her captor? Is Paul an antihero in the Rupert Pupkin vein, or a straight-down-the-line killer, or some kind of nice guy underneath it all, with serious mental problems? The screenplay isn’t nuanced enough to switch between modes in a way that feels intentional and the result is the sense that there are a few different films jostling for attention.Still, it’s all pretty stylishly done, and if you’re thinking Nicholson is a dead ringer for a young Jack Nicholson, we can save you a Google: he’s his son, and doing a nice line in the kind of derangement his dad channelled so memorably in the The Shining.Borderline is on digital platforms from 8 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersComedy filmsHorror filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Is it because of his porn addiction?He struggles to maintain an erection and I feel worthless as his partner. I wonder whether there’s a way back for usPamela Stephenson ConnollyTue 2 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 03.02 EDTShareWhen we first met, 12 years ago, my husband and Ididn’t waste any time in starting the sexual part of our relationship. He warned me he was a sex addict, and I am enthusiastic about sex. On our first night together I was aware of some erectile dysfunction – he wasn’t entirely hard and benefited from holding himself when penetrating me–though this didn’t stop us reaching climax. We joked about how many times I would orgasm and neither of us seemed inhibited.Over time, my husband neededmore and more help with ejaculating and would often lose his erectionduring sex.He has shownless interest in any form of intimacy with me, while I have been trying to show my attraction to him in other ways, like hugging and holding hands.Aboutsix months into our relationship, I became aware he was using online pornography while I was out of the house. It seemed that it was porn he was addicted to, rather than the act of sex. It upset me, as I know people who have been exploited in the industry. We discussed this, and he seemed to understand, but his porn use became more entrenched, while our sex life has diminished.On the odd occasion when we try to have sex, he struggles to achieve an erection, whether it’s me or him initiating. When we do start,his erection fades away within moments. I try to reassure him, but I feel embarrassed and worthless as a partner, and I miss him terribly. It has beenmore than a year since we last tried to be intimate.Is there any way back?Compulsivity of thought or actions, no matter how it is expressed, is related to anxiety and other psychological issues. Your husband’s compulsivity – in relation to porn use and perhaps to other things as well – seems to have become so entrenched that it is now a problem for both of you, for which he probably needs treatment and you need support. But it is not necessarily the reason for your dwindling sex life. In fact, he may be using porn to try to achieve erections and prove that he is capable of them in a situation where he will not feel judged.A man’s relationship with his penis is complex. If it doesn’t work as well as he or his partner want it to, he experiences shame and anxiety and, the next time he tries to become erect, his anxiety can lead to repeat failure as a self-fulfilling prophecy. With continued failure, a man will often withdraw from sex with a partner (no matter how understanding they are) because he simply cannot face another failure.Erectile dysfunction is treatable, and it is important to find the cause. And repeated erectile failures need to be investigated because they can be a symptom of a serious medical condition. Try to persuade him to seek professional consultation.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

It is so relaxing.”View image in fullscreenWilliams’ ‘project room’ minus the balls.Photograph: Julie WilliamsonWilliams was inspired by Delevingne, who installed a ball pit in her former Los Angeles home,described by Architectural Digestas “St-Tropez meets Coney Island meets Cotswolds cottage meets Monte Carlo meets butch leather bar”.Delevingne said the house reflected her changing characters and moods: it had a costume room for dress-up parties, a poker tent, trampolines, a secret“vagina tunnel”, a party bunker with a mirrored ceiling, a David Bowie memorial bathroom and the ball pit. “If I’m having a bad day, I just hop in the ball pit,” she said. “You can’t really cry in a ball pit.”Williams said she had thought about creating a bathroom in what she called her “project room” – an odd first-floor vestibule off the master bedroom with its own small staircase.“My friend had seen a video on YouTube of Carla Delevingne where she says something along the lines of you can never be unhappy or sad in a ball pit.” So Williams went for it, buying 11,300 plastic balls in March 2024 and creating the ball pit herself.It was inaugurated with Williams and friends drinking half bottles of rosé champagne in it. “It’s great. This is the new relaxation method for mums and dads. Get a ball pit and hide away from the children.”Williams’ seven-bedroom house in leafy Birkdale village is on the market for £799,995, and if new buyers wanted to keep the pit, plus balls, then they could, Williams said.The house went viral after featuring on a social media account calledHousing Horrors, which shines a light on some of the weirder and more wonderful quirks of houses for sale or rent in the UK.Explore more on these topicsPropertyMerseysidenewsShareReuse this content"

But there’s an art to taking care of these implements so that they stay in good shape and last as long as possible.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Here are the dos and don’ts – from an array of experts – for keeping your wooden utensils in peak condition, so that they’re a part of your kitchen for years to come.How to care for wooden kitchen utensilsKnow your woodAlways choose a hard-wearing wood that will stand up to kitchen use.“Hardwoods are usually best for boards and utensils: beech, maple and walnut,” saysfurniture-maker Chris Holland. “They have got a tight grain, which means less moisture and dirt can get in, and they resist deep knife marks better. Olive wood is another good choice – it’s beautiful, naturally oily, and resistant to staining – but it’s quite hard, so it candull knivesquicker. Ash is tough and light, but has a more open grain, so it needs regular oiling to keep moisture out.”View image in fullscreenWalnut wood chopping boardFrom £39 at ProCookView image in fullscreenBeech wood chopping board£19.99 at LakelandView image in fullscreenMaple wood chopping board£69.99 at AmazonAvoid the dishwasherWhatever tree they come from, the first rule of looking after wooden kitchen items is probably the most frequently broken. “Don’t put them in the dishwasher,” says Holland. “It will strip off any protective treatment straight away.” The water temperature in a dishwasher rises to a point where it’s in effect steaming the wood. The result, Holland says, is that the wood expands, with any protective oils in the fibres washed away.To clean chopping boards, spoons, spatulas and so on, simply hand-wash in warm water with a gentle washing-up liquid. Avoid scrubbing too hard with a scourer and don’t use abrasive cleaning products. Dry off any excess water immediately with a tea towel.For an extra clean, says Jo Hadlow-Davies of Pembrokeshire-basedEdge Handcrafted Tables and Furniture: “Rub a slice of lemon over a chopping board that has been used for something with a strong flavour, such as onions, to get rid of those odours before washing.”Store wellLeave chopping boards on their long edge to avoid warping, and allow them to dry fully before you reuse. For utensils, stand them up in a pot to dry, and make sure there is no part left sitting in water.‘Hands down my favourite bit of kit’: 13 kitchen gadgets top chefs can’t live withoutRead moreNourish and protectWooden utensils can become tired and fluffy after a while, with the wood fibres catching on your tea towels, for example. When this happens – or, preferably, before it does – use a treatment to nourish and protect it.Anything you put on the wood must be food-safe, and you don’t want it to alter the flavour of your food. “You can use olive oil [now and then], but you should only do this with items that you use and wash every day,” says Hadlow-Davies. If not, you could end up with a board that starts to go rancid.For less frequently used items, a longer-lasting treatment is better. All the treatments below are suitable for all woods (though you may want to test on a small area to check if it will affect the colour). You can repeat whenever necessary – once a month should be sufficient, but if you use items often or they start to look a little dry, you can always increase the frequency.“Whatever [treatment] you use, washing will wear it away over time, so the only way to keep the wood properly protected is to reapply it,” says Holland. “A light sand and re-oil every so often will keep it looking good and lasting longer.”View image in fullscreenAssorted sandpaper sheets£5.99 for 10 at AmazonPure oilsLinseed oil is a natural, non-toxic treatment tha’s good on any wood, says Mark Finney, ofFinney’s Wood Finishesin Chesterfield. Tung oil is often recommended for oak but, again, can be used on any wood. Both are frequently used on kitchen worktops. They’re applied with a brush or lint-free cloth to chopping boards, spoons and spatulas, wooden knife handles, and any other utensils that need protecting.View image in fullscreenLint-free cloths£4.99 for five at AmazonView image in fullscreenSynthetic mix bristle flat brush£6.99 at B&QThese pure oils tend to be slow drying, though – linseed can take two to four days and tung oil at least four. Finney says purpose-made products, while retaining the qualities of the pure raw oils, can be easier to use.Danish oil is a good alternative, he says: use a clean, lint-free soft cloth or brush to coat the wood liberally with the oil, then wipe off the excess after a few minutes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Apply the oil directly to the wood with a clean cloth or brush and leave to dry between coats – it should take about two hours. The manufacturers recommend up to three coats, but you should stop applications when the oil no longer soaks into the surface, as this means it has absorbed as much as it can. Wipe off any surplus with a clean cloth.Finney recommends German wood-finish company Osmo’s range of oils for chopping boards, surfaces and utensils. It suits all woods and can even be used on children’s toys. Apply thinly using a brush or lint-free cloth – this one will dry overnight, in eight to 10 hours.View image in fullscreenOsmo top oil£22.40 for 500ml at Wood Finishes Direct£22.99 for 500ml at BrewersView image in fullscreenChestnut food-safe oil£12.18 for 500ml at AmazonView image in fullscreenFood-safe wood oil£11 for 250ml at John LewisWaxesInstead of food-grade mineral oil, which is a byproduct of the petrol industry, there are plenty of natural alternatives, such as beeswax and oils sourced in the UK.

The same goes if it’s warped or feels like it might break in use.”Sandra Haurant is a journalist who has been writing for the Guardian for more than two decades.

What else can we make with cress?Sophie, via emailThis is also a pressing matter for Rosie Birkett, author of theA Lot on her Plate Substack, because her daughter recently returned home from nursery with a yoghurt tub containing cress: “It might be tiny, but cress is mighty – peppery punchy, and full of character, almost like a mini rocket leaf.” And if eggs are off the menu, Birkett’s first port of call would be to harness the young seedlings’ ability to accessorise: “Do your usual mashed avocado with a little lemon and olive oil, spread that over bread or toast, then top with a scattering of cress. It will add brilliant bite, freshness and pepperiness.”The same goes for bruschetta, or toasts with hummus, olive oil and gentle spices such as cumin, says Anna Jones, author ofEasy Wins. She’s no stranger to growing cress, either: “I did it with my own kids, and it’s a really good lesson in seeing and feeling where food comes from.” She also recommends using the stuff where you might watercress, rocket, salad leaves or fresh, summery herbs (think chives). “I would love a cream cheese sandwich with a bit of salt, a bit of cucumber andlotsof cress,” she says. “On a hot day, that would feel quite fun and afternoon tea-ish.” In a similar vein, Birkett might stir cress through cream cheese or ricotta for a “super-simple spread” to spoon on to sandwiches or jacket potatoes, or for spreading on crackers. Otherwise, simply stir cress into hummus or, if there’s yoghurt in the fridge, another slam-dunk dip would be “thick strained yoghurt, a squeeze of lemon, maybe some grated garlic and finely chopped cress”, which would be perfect for scooping up with cucumber sticks or pitta chips.Cress is also a good gateway to greens, says Georgia Levy, author ofThe Lunch Box Substack: “It’s a very good way to get children familiar with seeing flecks of green in their food,” she says. “Try stirring some through a bowl of macaroni cheese or their favourite pasta dish, and then, in future, that can be replaced by spinach or herbs.” Well, that’s the hope, anyway. If, however, your children are already au fait with herbs, Jones would be inclined to throw her cress into a salad: “I often make a herb salad with basil, mint, a bit of parsley and cress.” But be sure to dress it with something slightly sweet, she adds: “A bit of honey, say, or maybe maple syrup.”Finally, mix cress into spuds, Birkett says: “Scatter homegrown cress on a buttery potato or sweet potato mash to add a lovely freshness and a touch of grown-up flavour that little palates might just surprise you by loving.” In theory at least, children should be more open to trying new foods if they’ve had a hand in growing them, Birkett says: “That sprinkle of cress will feel like a proud moment for them, as well as a sweet garnish.”Got a culinary dilemma?

At home, we usually just eat them by the handful, fresh and cold, so when I started cooking with them, my family looked at me as if I’d gone mad. But they always end up saying yes after the first spoonful. This chilled cherry and tempranillo soup is one of those dishes: a bit unexpected, but it always gets a smile.Chilled cherry and tempranillo soup, orsopa fría de cerezaFresh cherries are one of the joys of late summer, but this soup can also be made using frozen cherries at any time of year.Prep25 minChill3 hr+Serves6500g ripe cherries, pitted, plus a few extra to garnish400ml tempranillo50g caster sugar, or to taste1 tsp vanilla beanpaste½ tsp ground cardamomA squeeze of lemon juice, or to tasteSoured cream, or creme fraiche, to servePut the cherries, wine, sugar and 150ml cold water in a blender and blitz smooth.

While the rest of us were stringing out guy ropes on tents as glamorous as giant cagoules, she arrived with a bell tent, duvets instead of sleeping bags, sheepskin rugs and vintage folding chairs. For all the talk of breathability, practicality and “high performance” gear, it was Becky’s tent we all wanted to sleep in. In the years since, I have never quite achieved her level of camping chic – until this summer, when I discovered the innovative Spanish camping brand Kampaoh.It all began back in 2016, when Kampaoh CEO Salvador Lora and his partner were backpacking in the Dominican Republic. One night they came across a campsite with pre-erected tents within which were mattresses and blankets. “We were in the middle of nature, surrounded by peace, and lacked nothing,” he tells me.Back home in Spain, Salvador wondered if something like that could work there – and decided to experiment setting up a handful of tents in Tarifa. Today the company has 90 sites across Europe, most of them in Spain, but also in Portugal and Italy. Coming across the brand by chance when looking for somewhere to stay in Andalucía, I booked intoCamping Los Villares, one of its showcase sites, in the hills above Córdoba.Arriving in the golden hour, after travelling overland by train, Los Villares looks like a dreamy backdrop to a Sofia Coppola film. From the entrance, the land drops gently away to reveal avenues of cream-coloured canvas tents, the sun filtering through tall Aleppo pines.View image in fullscreenThe writer stayed in one of the campsite’s Anza tentsLos Villares has a wide range of accommodation, from bell tents to vast, safari-style Bali tents, cute triangular Buka tents (with private, rustic-chic washrooms outside), Tiny Love cabins (with private baths with views), and Tiny Play family cabins (with a slide from their mezzanine bunks down to the living areas). My mid-range Anza is a lofty, triangular tent with a shower and toilet tucked behind the sleeping area and a raised, decked porch. The site is open year-round and the tents have air-conditioning and a small heater. There’s space for basic tent campers and a small campervan area, too.We wanted to bring back the magic of connecting with nature and outdoor adventures without giving up comfort or styleSalvador Lora, CEO, KampaohOutside the school holidays, with the campsite’s restaurant closed midweek, dinner that first night is sliced tomatoes, olives and tortilla foraged from a nearby village shop. As I eat on the terrace, all is deeply peaceful – the wind twisting through pines, blue-tailed Iberian magpies resting on branches overhead.Inside, my white, cream and wood tent is decorated with fairy lights and faux pot plants; the low platform bed (with proper mattress and pillows!) made up with white bedlinen. Plates, cups and cutlery are provided – and if I’d brought a pet, a mini version of the tent would provide a shady dog bed. An information sheet encourages me to tag @kampaoh on social media; arrival details had been sent via WhatsApp.It’s perfectly designed to appeal to gen Z travellers, the experience-seeking, social media-canny cohort that are becoming the dominant demographic in travel. While aesthetics are important, blingy, performative luxury is not; conscious of overtourism and the need to prioritise wellbeing, they look for off-the-beaten-track outdoor stays where they can run, swim, surf and cycle, as well as social connection. If Kampaoh’s campsites ticked any more of the demographic’s boxes it would break TikTok.View image in fullscreenInterior of an Anza tent“We wanted to bring back the magic of connecting with nature and outdoor adventures without giving up comfort or style,” says Lora. “The new generation love experiences like camping but they also have high expectations for design, comfort and aesthetics. Visual appeal isn’t superficial; it’s part of how we live and share our experiences.”Kampaoh isn’t the only camping brand tapping into this market. In France, the Parisian hotel brand Touriste recently launched three stylishly revamped holiday parks under itsCampings Libertébrand, whileHuttopia, which began in 2000 with a small, nature-based campsite in the French Alps and a devotion to wood and canvas structures, now offers 152 sites in eight countries. Unlike other glamping providers, the aim is not to add on hotel-style frills, but to increase basic comfort. Setting themselves apart from big, pre-erected tent and cabin operators such as Eurocamp, operators like Kampaoh keep sites relatively small and, crucially, stylish.As I sit on the restaurant’s terrace sipping coffee the next morning, shielded by fig trees, I watch a steady trickle of campers heading out for the day in hiking or cycling gear. It was 37C in Córdoba when I collected my hire car, but up here it’s a pleasant 26C. With the smell of hot pine needles in the air, I follow them out to explore.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The GR48 long-distance footpath goes through it, and a network of cycling routes around it. After hiking up to a viewpoint behind the park’s visitor centre to get my bearings, I drive to the small town ofSanta María de Trassierrato walk the 20-minute path to theBaños de Popea.Remote and jungly, this river pool was a favourite spot with Córdoba’s Cántico group of poets and artists in the late 1940s. The tumble of small waterfalls and pools – full from unusual spring rain – form a magical spot, reached through glades of bear’s breech (Acanthus mollis), and paths edged with beams of gorse-like French broom.I could easily spend all day here, but there’s still Córdoba to see, with its parks of orange trees, the shady gardens of the Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos and the famous mosque-cathedral ofMezquita.View image in fullscreenThe gardens of the Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos in Cordoba, Andalucía.Photograph: AlamyThe highlight, for me, however, is theMedina Azaharaarchaeological site, just out of town. Its construction was started in 936 by the first caliph of Al-Andalus, Abd al-Rahman III. This palace-city saw service for only 70 years but its evocative ruins and richly decorated archways are a powerful reminder of its opulence. Walking the Medina’s ancient stones as grasshoppers hop and jasmine scents the hot air, it’s easy to see the appeal of this strategic location, between the mountains and the Guadalquivir River.Driving into the campsite afterwards, off a road flushed with hot pink oleanders, the landscape is washed in pale gold. Momentarily distracted by the view, I double-take as four hoopoes suddenly appear in front of me, their black and white stripes backlit by the sun. I probably ought to have taken a photo and posted it with the hashtag #kampaohvibes. Instead, I keep very still and watch.

The plants we brought with us aren’t thriving. What houseplants can cope with low light levels?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.DiagnosisMany popular houseplants, especially those that need bright, indirect light, will struggle in dimly lit spaces. Symptoms like yellowing leaves, leggy growth and overall decline are common when plants aren’t getting enough light to photosynthesise properly. But all is not lost. Several houseplants are far more tolerant of low light and can thrive in shadier spots. The key is selecting species that originate from environments where filtered light is the norm.PrescriptionFor rooms with very low light, opt for things like snake plants (Sansevieria), ZZ plants (Zamioculcas zamiifolia), cast iron plants (Aspidistra elatior), pothos (Epipremnum aureum) and peace lilies (Spathiphyllum wallisii). These are all very resilient. Shade-tolerant plants usually have a higher concentration of chlorophyll, allowing them to tolerate lower light levels without showing immediate stress.PreventionEven low-light-tolerant plants need some light to survive. Rotate them regularly to encourage even growth, and consider supplementing with a small grow light if natural light is minimal. Water little, as low light levels slow down a plant’s water usage, increasing the risk of root rot.Explore more on these topicsHouseplantsHouseplant clinicGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But according to Andrew Greg, a committee member and longstanding plot-holder at NVG, there are about 300 people on the waiting list and just three to four will get a space every year.One would-be plot-holder is Ralph Bennett-Richards, who joined the council’s allotment waiting list two years ago after moving into his central Glasgow flat. He is among the two-thirds of the city’s population living in flats, as opposed to houses, meaning few people in the city have gardens. “I’d be happy with any allotment that I can cycle to from my flat,” says Bennett-Richards.Unfortunately for him and many others, the issue is not one of distance, but a lack of available plots. Often located in built-up areas, it can be hard, if not impossible, to expand existing sites.With little public money available to create new allotments, one different approach to expanding provision is being taken by Roots, a Bath-based company that recently opened its 14th site of privately owned allotment provision in England, and is looking for its first location north of the border in the Glasgow area.View image in fullscreenGreyfriars, a community garden in the Merchant City district of Glasgow.Photograph: Kay Roxby/AlamyTwo of Roots’ co-founders, Ed Morrison and Will Gay, describe how they use a combination of modern and traditional methods to identify sites, with more than 1,000 people (full disclosure – including me) already on their Glasgow waiting list. “When we think about launching in a new location, we’ll set up digital ads to see who wants to sign up. And we got the most amount of clicks for the least amount of money spent in Glasgow. So that shows there’s a huge demand for us there,” Morrison said.Plots at Roots sites range from £10 to £50 a month, depending on plot size, contrasting with £17 to £60 a year for a Glasgow city council plot, although these prices are set to triple in the next five years. However, in return Roots says it offers members much more support, including ready-to-plant plots, communal tools, free seeds, plug plants and workshops throughout the year. Its founders say they see it as complementing rather than competing with traditional sites: 70% of members had never grown food before joining Roots and 60% had never been on a waiting list for another allotment.A flexible membership model allows people to see if they cancommit the timethat is required to look after a plot. As Lindsey Duncan, who shares a plot on a council-owned allotment site in the south-west of the city, points out, many people underestimatehow much time an allotment can take up. In Glasgow a “full-size” allotment is 125 sq metres, about the size of half a tennis court. Smaller plot sizes could help, she suggests, an approach that some allotment associations in Glasgow are trying.A smaller plot was ideal for Jane, who started with a “micro-plot” of six sq metres at Croftburn allotments in the south-east of Glasgow. “I put my name on every allotment waiting list I could find,” says Jane, who moved to Glasgow two and a half years ago. After a year on the micro-plot, which helped her to build confidence and get to know other plot-holders, she has just graduated to a larger plot, freeing up the micro-plot for someone else on the waiting list.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Sighthill had become a byword for the failures of post-second world war urban planning, which resulted in swathes of the city being bulldozed to make way for concrete tower blocks and dual carriageways.The same building boom that brought Sighthill into the world also contributed to the demise of many of Glasgow’s allotments, which had helped to feed the city during two world wars – there was 1 sq metre of allotment space per resident in the cityin 1950compared with 0.6 sq metres today. The 20 new plots will barely make a dent in the city’s allotment waiting list, but the turning over of land that was previously concreted to a new generation of growers brings hope of further progress.Explore more on these topicsAllotmentsGlasgowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has not yet understood that the floods completely swept away his house in Dogoro Basha village in Shigar,Pakistan.His confusion is part of the devastating aftermath oflong months of rain and floodsthat have devastated thousands of families in the country’s northern provinces and left more than 860 people dead so far.For Muhammad Shareef, 19, a university student living away from home in Islamabad, the distance does not help. His home in Dogoro Basha was also destroyed, and his family is now displaced. “My house and land are gone. My mother is now living in a tent. The only thing I have left standing is my father’s grave [marker],” he says.The school has been destroyed. The only dispensary was swept away. Our children’s future is at stakeSajjad Ali KhanSince the end of June, and throughout July and August, torrential rains and flash floods have battered Pakistan, mostly the regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan. According to the country’sNational Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), more than 800 people have died and more than 1,100 have been injured.More than half of the deaths happened when people were caught by flash floods, with others crushed by collapsing houses.“This is not only a physical disaster but a mental health crisis,” says Shan-e-Zainab, a Karachi-based clinical psychologist and mental health trainer. “After a flood, people frequently suffer acute stress reactions, helplessness, shock and terror.“Many develop survivor’s guilt, sleep problems, intrusive memories or overwhelming sadness after losing homes, jobs or loved ones,” she says. “Without proper support, these reactions often deepen into depression, prolonged grief or post-traumatic stress disorder.”View image in fullscreenNasir Khan, 81, sits in the remains of his village after flooding in Buner, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Photograph: Akhtar Soomro/ReutersThe destruction has been immense. The NDMA reports that across the country more than 9,000 houses have been damaged and more than 2,000 completely destroyed. Displacement is widespread: at least 25,927 people are living in 308 relief camps across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and 3,140 people are sheltering in 11 camps in Gilgit-Baltistan.“Many people died because of the thunderstorm,” says Sher Nawab, 38, a farmer from Buner in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Those who were outside tried to save their lives, but the people inside their houses could not survive.”For him, survival is now shadowed by a sense of dread. “We lost our corn crops and livestock,” he says. “But what haunts us is the fear, God forbid, if it rains again.“Our high school is two hours away; one of the students was swept away by the flood on his way there. The schools are closed now; children are sitting idle at home, and some have lost their books in the water,” Nawab says.Sajjad Ali Khan, a village elder in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Kunduz valley, describes a similar reality. “In my village, there were about 150 houses. More than half have been affected by the floods,” he says. “People are not able to live in the village. They have left and gone to tents.”People were cut off for weeks, like islands in a vast lake, with no food … that is collective psychological tortureYasir DaryaLife in displacement, he adds, is marked by uncertainty. “The children’s school has also been destroyed. The only dispensary in our area was swept away. Our children’s future is at stake.”In videos shown to the Guardian by a villager from Gilgit-Baltistan, boys explain how the floods have disrupted their lives. “Our schools are closed; we can’t go to class any more,” says one. Another says: “We don’t have clean drinking water.” A third adds simply: “We are living in tents now.”Emergency officials witness this misery first-hand. “Fear and panic are always the first reaction,” says Muhammad Sohail, a media coordinator for Rescue 1122, a government disaster emergency service in Buner.“Many victims are in shock, unable to comprehend what has happened. Those who have lost family members go through intense grief; others show helplessness, especially when they have lost their homes or means of livelihood,” he says.View image in fullscreenRescue workers in Buner prepare antibiotics and other medications for people displaced by the floods.Photograph: Arshad Arbab/EPAHe adds that rescue workers also carry invisible scars. “Rescuers are human. We see death, destruction and grieving families constantly. The emotional burden of not being able to save everyone is very heavy.”For climate experts, the floods are not anomalies but warnings. “This is not just climate change, it is a climate emergency,” says Yasir Darya, founder of the Climate Action Centre in Karachi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Earth’s systems are permanently damaged,” Darya says.He points to thecatastrophic floods in 2022, which killed at least 1,700 people,as a turning point. According to theWorld Bank’s post-disaster assessment, they displaced more than 8 million people and led to economic losses of $30bn (£26bn), making it the most devastating disaster in Pakistan’s recorded history.“Families lost their homes, land, livestock and everything they had worked for,” says Darya. “In many valleys, people were cut off for weeks, like islands in a vast lake, with no food or medicine reaching them. That is collective psychological torture.”View image in fullscreenPeople look at the damage after flash floods in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Photograph: Bilawal Arbab/EPAZainab says trauma manifests itself differently in different age groups. “Adults often show increased anxiety, anger, insomnia and withdrawal, while children may struggle in school, have recurring nightmares, or revert to earlier behaviours such as bed-wetting or clinginess.”Where mental health support is lacking, she says, trauma becomes chronic. “It can lead to substance abuse, long-term anxiety or depression in adults, and serious emotional regulation problems in children. Trauma can even be passed from generation to generation.”Repeated exposure to disasters magnifies the impact. “The disturbance of safety and healing brings an ongoing sense of powerlessness and hypervigilance,” Zainab says. “The risk of developing PTSD, depression and learned helplessness, where people feel unable to cope with ongoing crises, rises with every new flood.View image in fullscreenA man stands in his damaged home in Pishoreen village, Buner.Photograph: M Sajjad/AP“The most important is psychological first aid, ensuring safety, meeting basic needs, offering emotional support without pressuring survivors to relive details, providing clear information, and helping people reconnect with family and community,” she says. “Early interventions like these significantly reduce the likelihood of chronic psychiatric problems.”Fewer than 500 psychiatrists serve 240 million people in Pakistan, however, and most of them are based in the major cities.‘The water left nothing’: Pakistan’s Punjab province reels from deadly floodsRead more“Our mental health system lacks the tools to address climate-linked trauma,” says Zainab. “There are too few professionals, not enough community-based services, and stigma remains strong.“What we need are disaster-response policies that integrate mental health, training for volunteers and health workers in psychological support, mobile mental health services in vulnerable areas, and nationwide awareness campaigns to fight stigma.”In the northern provinces, survivors are all too aware that the floods will return and things may never go back to normal. “We can rebuild homes,” says Nawab, “but fear stays in the heart.”For Shareef, in Islamabad, worry is now a constant companion when he travels to his village. “We might survive the day,” he says, “During the day, I might feel safe.

The village “has now been completely levelled to the ground”, the statement said.Women and girls ‘not safe anywhere’ as Darfur suffers surge in sexual violenceRead moreFootage shared by the Marra Mountains news outlet showed a flattened area between mountain ranges and a group of people searching the area.Luca Renda, the UN humanitarian coordinator in Sudan,saidhe was “deeply saddened” by the reported landslide, adding that local sources indicated that “between 300 and 1,000 people may have lost their lives”. He said the UN and its partners were mobilising to support the affected communities.Al-Amin Abdallah Abbas, a farmer from Ammo, a cluster of villages that includes Tarasin, said the area had experienced weeks of heavy rainfall. He told the Associated Press that tribal and community leaders in nearby areas had mobilised efforts to recover and bury the victims. “The village and its people disappeared,” he said. “It’s an unprecedented tragedy.”Sunday’s landslide was one of the deadliest natural disasters in the recent history of Sudan, where hundreds of people die every year as a result of seasonal rainfall between July and October.Sudan’scivil war, now in its third year, has plunged the country intoone of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with famine declared in parts of Darfur.Fighting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has escalated in Darfur, especially in El Fasher, since thearmy took control of the capital, Khartoum, in March.MapThe Marra mountains area has turned into a hub for displaced families fleeing fighting in and around El Fasher. The SLM has mostly stayed out of the fighting but controls parts of Sudan’s tallest mountain range.Darfur’s army-aligned governor, Minni Minnawi, called the landslide a “humanitarian tragedy that goes beyond the borders of the region”.“We appeal to international humanitarian organisations to urgently intervene and provide support and assistance at this critical moment, for the tragedy is greater than what our people can bear alone,” he said in a statement.Much of Darfur – including the area where the landslide occurred – remainslargely inaccessible to international aid organisationsbecause of the continuing fighting, severely limiting the delivery of urgent humanitarian assistance.Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, the chair of the African Union Commission,called onthe warring parties “to silence the guns and unite in facilitating the swift and effective delivery of emergency humanitarian assistance”.The fighting in Sudan has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions, including about 4 million from the capital alone.Hundreds have beenreported killed in recent months, and civilians in El Fasher say the paramilitaries are now waging their fiercest ever assault on the North Darfur state capital.The war has been marked by atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the UN and rights groups.

We have a lot of drugs pouring into our country,” the US president added.Later, Trump used his social media platform, Truth Social, to offer further details of the operation, which he said had taken place on Tuesday morning.“The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in international waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United ​States,” he wrote, alongsidefootageof the attack.“The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No US Forces were harmed in this strike … Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!”Trump’s Venezuela gunboat diplomacy: sabre-rattling or prelude to invasion?Read moreThe development will add to fears over a possible military clash between Venezuelan and US troops after the US sent war ships and marines into the Caribbean last month as part of what Trump allies touted as an attempt to force Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, from power.Officially, Trump’s naval buildup is part of US efforts to combat Latin American drug traffickers, including a Venezuelan group called the Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns) which Trump officials accuse Maduro of leading.In August the USannounced a $50m reward for Maduro’s capture– twice the bounty once offered for Osama bin Laden. In July, Trump signeda secret directivegreenlighting military force against Latin American cartels considered terrorist organizations, including the Venezuelan group.Republican party hawks and Trump allies have celebrated those moves as proof the White House is determined to end Maduro’s 12-year rule. “Your days are seriously numbered,” Trump’s former national security adviserMichael Flynn, declared recently, encouraging Maduro to flee to Moscow.Maduro’s allies have also claimed that a regime-change operation is afoot, with Maduro himself this week warning that White House hardliners were seeking to lead Trump into “a terrible war” that would harm the entire region.“Mr President Donald Trump, you need to take care becauseMarco Rubiowants to stain your hands with blood – with South American, Caribbean blood [and] Venezuelan blood. They want to lead you into a bloodbath … with a massacre against the people of Venezuela,” Maduro said.But many experts are skeptical the US is planning a military intervention. “The idea of there being an invasion, I don’t believe to be true,” James Story, the US’s top diplomat for Venezuela from 2018 to 2023, said last week. He said Trump generally opposed “meddling militarily in the affairs of other countries”.Ramsey agreed. ”This is not a deployment focused on regime change. This may be an attempt to signal to disaffected elements of the military in Venezuela that now is the time to rise up against Maduro. But we’ve seen that approach be tried and ​fail repeatedly over ​the last 25 years.”Ramsey said the tough talk belied the fact that Trump had actually relaxed its stance towards Venezuela. Sanctions had been softened in recent weeks. TheTrump administrationwas “actively coordinating with ​the Maduro regime on deportation flights”, about two of which are landing at Venezuela’s main international airport each week.​Ramsey believed that the military mobilization was partly an attempt “to throw some red meat to a part of Trump’s base that has been dissatisfied with the reality of sanctions relief” and what it perceived as his soft policy towards Maduro.Ramsey described the region where the vessel was attacked as “a target-rich environment” when it came to drug traffickers. “There are plenty of go-fast boats transporting cocaine through the southern Caribbean, and I think ultimately Washington is more interested in signalling than in actually engaging in any kind of military action inside Venezuela territory.” Trump said those killed in Tuesday’s operation were members of the Tren de Aragua, Venezuela’s most notorious crime group.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyTrump administrationVenezuelaMarco RubioDonald TrumpDrugs tradeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Thecontroversial decisionto remove books purportedly containing “explicit sexual content” has seen numerous works of literature swept up in the dragnet, including Atwood’s dystopian workThe Handmaid’s Tale.In a social media post, Atwood wrote that since her famed work was no longer permissible in Alberta schools, she had written a “suitable” short work for teens, adding the work was necessary because the province’s minister of education thought students were “stupid babies”.The extremely brief story traces the lives of John and Mary, two “very, very good” children.Rightwing ‘parents’ rights’ groups gain ground in Canada as Alberta book bans target LGBTQ+ titlesRead more“They never picked their noses or had bowel movements or zits,” she wrote in the opening lines, adding they were ardent Christians who “paid no attention to what Jesus actually said about the poor” and instead “practised selfish rapacious capitalism” in the vein of the conservative literary hero Ayn Rand.“Oh, and they never died, because who wants to dwell on, you know, death and corpses and yuk?”Atwood writes that while the pair “lived happily ever”, the ominous warnings in her 1985 novel The Handmaid’s Tale – which describes a totalitarian fundamentalist regime in which enslaved women are forced to bear children – “came true came true and [Alberta premier] Danielle Smith found herself with a nice new blue dress but no job” – a reference to the novel’s elite wives who have power but are not permitted to work.“The end.”The Alberta ban emerged as a product of intense lobbying by socially conservative “parents’ rights” groups in the province and mirrors a trend in the United States.Action4Canada and Parents for Choice in Education (PCE) have taken credit for the book ban and the latter sent an email to supporters after the ban was announced thanking them for their efforts in contacting government officials about “graphic” books.The Alberta government defines “explicit sexual content”in its policyas “content containing a detailed and clear depiction of a sexual act”. Students from kindergarten to grade 12 cannot access any “content” in a school library that meets this definition.Alberta’s public schools have until October to comply with the order, but some schools have already released their lists of banned books. The Edmonton school board said it would remove 200 books from school libraries, including The Handmaid’s Tale.Banned! The 20 books they didn’t want you to readRead moreOther books to be pulled from shelves include George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, which officials say contains passages that discuss sexual intercourse and rape; Maya Angelou’s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.Last week, Smith criticised officials for drawing up such a wide-ranging list of books to be removed, describing the move as “vicious compliance”.Smith showed reporters excerpts from graphic novels – including Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe – that prompted the new rules in the first place for the explicit illustrations of sexual acts they contain. The book is a globally acclaimed coming-of-age story about teenage life and young adulthood. Critics of the ban say increasingly powerful lobby groups are targeting books that affirm LGBTQ+ identities.Ahead of the ban, Atwoodalso posted on social mediawarning against reading The Handmaid’s Tale because “your hair will catch on fire!”“Get one now before they have public book burnings of it.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaMargaret AtwoodShort storiesAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Over the course of eight televised hearings held between 2 and 12 September, five supreme court judges will decide their fate.The judge presiding over the trial, Alexandre de Moraes, kicked off the hearing describing how an anti-democratic plot to impose “a veritable dictatorship” had been foiled thanks to the strength of Brazilian society and institutions. A failure to punish that crime “would mean encouraging new attempted coups d’etat,” Moraes told the court, adding: “History teaches us that impunity, omission and cowardice do not lead to pacification.”The prosecutor general, Paulo Gonet, told the court it was essential those behind the “frightening and shadowy” conspiracy be held to account.‘I’m holding his political wake’: the trumpeter waiting to mark Bolsonaro’s judgment dayRead moreBrazil has suffered more than a dozen attempted putsches and coups d’état since 1889, when it became a republic after its last emperor, Pedro II, was overthrown. The last successful power grab came in 1964, when US-backed generals deposed the then president, João Goulart, supposedly to thwart a communist threat and ushering in 21 years of brutal military rule.But the historian Danilo Araújo Marques said that never before had top military leaders or a former president been tried for attacking democracy. “This truly is unprecedented and historic,” said Marques, who is part of a research unit at the Federal University of Minas Gerais called Projeto República.“Whenever there was an attempted coup, and the coup didn’t succeed, there was always an amnesty – and now we’re seeing precisely the opposite,” Marques added, hailing the trial as tribute to the maturity of Brazil’s institutions and democracy, which was restored in 1985. “Our democracy is going through an acid test and it’s possible it will come out of this strengthened.”On the eve of the trial, the US president, Donald Trump, hasattempted to sabotage proceedingswith what analysts called an unprecedented pressure campaign that has thrown US-Brazil relations into disarray.View image in fullscreenMembers of the media outside the court in Brasilia, Brazil, on Tuesday.Photograph: Jorge Silva/ReutersClaiming Bolsonaro was the victim of a “witch-hunt”, Trump slapped 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports and sanctioned Alexandre de Moraes, the judge presiding over the case. Other supreme court justices and Lula officials have been stripped of their US visas. Bolsonaro’s congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, has moved to the US to lobby Trump officials to take up his father’s fight.“It’s a political intervention with an economic cudgel,” Thomas Shannon, a former US ambassador to Brazil, said of Trump’s tariffs campaign.Shannon believed Trump had a clear political objective: to scupper Bolsonaro’s prosecution, resuscitate the Brazilian populist’s flagging political career, and allow Bolsonaro – who is currently banned from seeking office – to challenge Lula in next year’s presidential election.But the ex-ambassador, who was based in Brasília from 2010 to 2013, believed the US president was mistaken if he believed he could help Bolsonaro escape punishment and “storm back into power” – just as Trump did last year.“It [shows] such a cartoon-like understanding of Brazil – and I think what the president is doing at the behest of the Bolsonaros is actually going to harm the Bolsonaros in a really significant way,” Shannon said, noting how polls showed support for the ex-president falling.‘A family of traitors’: Trump’s Brazil tariffs ultimatum backfires on BolsonaroRead moreIn contrast, support for Lula appears to be increasing, with Brazil’s president using Trump’s offensive to position himself as a flag-waving patriot defending Brazilian interests from a foreign onslaught. Lula has started wearing a blue, Maga-style cap emblazoned with the words: “Brazil belongs to the Brazilians.”Asked last week if he would be tuning into his rival’s coup trial, Lula shrugged: “I’ve got better things to do.”Those in the dock alongside Bolsonaro include some of the best-known figures in his administration: the former defence ministers Gen Walter Braga Netto and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira; the former minister for institutional security, Gen Augusto Heleno; the former navy commander, Adm Almir Garnier Santos; the former security minister, Anderson Torres; the former spy chief Alexandre Ramagem; and Bolsonaro’s former assistant, Lt Col Mauro Cid.The accusations against them relate toan alleged conspiracy to launch a pro-Bolsonaro coupin the months between the October 2022 election and thefar-right uprising in Brasíliaon 8 January 2023 – a week after Lula took power.Bolsonaro denies plotting a coup but has admitted seeking “alternative” ways to stop Lula taking office. All of the other defendants also maintain their innocence, apart from Cid. He has collaborated with investigators as part of a plea deal and hopes to receive a reduced sentence.Inan editorialmarking the start of the trial, the O Globo newspaper said 2 September would go down in history as the day Brazil finally broke its “humiliating tradition” of failing to prosecute coup-mongering presidents and generals.​The judgment wascelebratedas a “huge civilizatory leap forward” by the conservative O Estado de São Paulo​:“Perhaps this is why Trump is using the enormous power of the US to attack the supreme court and save Bolsonaro from his penal fate. Not out of friendship [for the Bolsonaros], but to stop an example of democratic resistance flourishing in Latin America’s biggest nation, that reinforces the contrast with the genuflection of American institutions to Trumpism.”Bolsonaro has been under house arrest since early August after the supreme court ruled he had violated a court order banning him from social networks. Police have been stationed outside his mansion amid fears he could flee to the nearby US embassy. Earlier this month policeclaimedthey had found a document on a phone seized from the ex-president indicating he had planned to abscond to Argentina and seek asylum from its rightwing president, Javier Milei.On Sunday – Brazil’s independence day – Bolsonaro’s supporters are expected to stage a show of force, rallying in major cities to demand he be absolved. Security has been stepped up around the supreme court, presidential palace and congress to avoid a repeat of the 8 January uprising, when all three buildings were ransacked by Bolsonaro supporters.Marques predicted there were likely to be lively days ahead as Brazil’s 40-year-old democracy notched up another landmark moment. “This is an important cycle that is closing,” he said of the decade-long rise and fall of Bolsonaro, a once obscure politician whoshot to prominenceduring the 2016 impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff, was elected in 2018, and now faces political annihilation.“But the future is full of surprises,” Marques added. Even if Bolsonaro was convicted and jailed, “new chapters” could still be written, such as congress approving an amnesty, or a future rightwing president granting Bolsonaro a pardon. “Let’s see what the future has in store for us.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It is covered with high-relief friezes and features designs painted in blue, yellow, red and black.The sophisticated and stylistic imagery sheds new light on the beliefs and social structures of early civilisations in the formative period (2000-1000BC) in Peru. Archaeologists consider pre-Hispanic Peru to be one of the birthplaces of civilisation in the Americas, with an estimated 100,000 archaeological sites, including famous tourist attractions such asMachu Picchuand theNazca Lines.View image in fullscreenThe double-sided mural is part of the interior decoration of a courtyard within a temple.Photograph: Pontifical Catholic University of PeruAna Cecilia Mauricio, the lead archaeologist at the Huaca Yolanda excavation site in the Tanguche valley, in Peru’s La Libertad region, said the discovery spoke of “the emergence of social hierarchy inPeruas societies get more complex and become civilisations”.The double-sided mural is part of the interior decoration of a courtyard within a temple. The 3D designs – which also include stylised fish, fishing nets, mythological beings and stars – give a fascinating insight into the cosmovision of these formative coastal civilisations.“These were people who lived from agriculture and from the sea but they already show the first signs of social hierarchy,” said Mauricio, an associate professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, speaking by phone from the dig where the discovery was made.Long-lost ancient mural rediscovered in northern Peru after more than a centuryRead moreThe most influential and powerful people would have been shamans, male and female, or priests or priestesses, Mauricio explained. “They possessed important knowledge about medicinal plants and also about astronomy; they could predict the weather conditions through observation of the stars and the sun,” she said.“They acquired knowledge and began to perfect it. They were, in a sense, scientists as well as spiritual and religious leaders,” she added.One of the carvings depicts three humanoid figures which appear to show a transformation from a human into a bird, Mauricio explained. She said it could represent the figurative transformation of a shaman into a psychoactive state, known as a “rite of passage”, after consuming a substance like San Pedro cactus, a traditional South American hallucinogen.Mauricio said the Huaca Yolanda site probably predated Chavín de Huántar, one of the most studied pre-Hispanic ceremonial sites in the Andes. Both belong to the formative period timeframe which marks the beginning of early civilisations. John Rick, the US archaeologist leading investigations at Chavín de Huántar has documented theceremonial use of hallucinogensinside tunnels in the 2,500-year-old temple complex.View image in fullscreenArchaeologists in Peru have discovered a multicoloured three-dimensional mural that could date back 4,000 years.Photograph: Pontifical Catholic University of PeruThe Huaca Yolanda site faces more prosaic threats from advancing agriculture, urban development and looting, which has already destroyed surrounding ruins, says Mauricio.She said the site – which she has been exploring since 2012 as part of research into early ecodynamics in the Chao and Santa Valleys – did not yet have full protection from Peru’s culture ministry and regional authorities.“People in the past had a relationship with their environmental and climatic surroundings that can be valuable to us in the present,” said Mauricio of the early civilisation which managed to live alongside theEl Niño weather phenomenonthat regularly causes devastation through flooding and landslides in modern Peru. “Can this knowledge help us understand how to deal with climatic phenomena now?”Explore more on these topicsPeruArchaeologyAmericasArtnewsShareReuse this content"

Fico has repeatedly criticised Kyiv and stalled European Union sanctions against Moscow, arguing they put Slovakia’s energy security at risk. Putin suggested that Bratislava cut off gas supplies to Ukraine. “Ukraine receives a significant volume of energy resources through its neighbours in eastern Europe. Shut off gas supplies that go in reverse,” he told Fico.On Ukraine, Putin said he had never opposed Ukraine’s potential membership of the European Union. “As for Ukraine’s membership of the EU, we have never objected to this … As for Nato, this is another issue.” The Russian president also said he had no intention of attacking Europe.Putin’s comments on the Russia-China relationship came as the two countries signed a deal that will sharply increase Beijing’s imports of Russian gas over the next 30 years. Putin and Xi agreed to build the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, which will allow the transit of 50bn cubic metres of gas to China each year.China’s purchases of Russian energy and the booming bilateral trade between the two countries have been an economic lifeline for Moscow since the start of the war in Ukraine.View image in fullscreenXi Jinping, fourth from left, speaks with the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, fourth from right, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Tuesday.Photograph: Parker Song/APThe pipeline will travel through Mongolia.

China also announced it would extend visa-free travel privileges to Russian passport holders, starting from 15 September.India’s prime minister,Narendra Modi, also attended the SCO summit, in a sign that China-India relations are thawing after the imposition of heavy US tariffs on Indian exports.Kim arrived in Beijing for the parade on a specially armoured train, in his first visit to China since 2019. It is also the first time since 1959 that a North Korean leader has attended an international event of this scale.Kim’s trip comes after a period in which ties between Russia and North Korea have deepened, with Pyongyang sending tens of thousands of troops to fight for Russia in the war in Ukraine.About 600 North Korean soldiers have been killed fighting for Russia in the Kursk region, according to South Korea’s intelligence agency, which believes Pyongyang is planning another deployment.Xi, speaking at the SCO summit on Monday, proposed a “global governance initiative”, the latest in a slew of Chinese “global initiatives” to reshape the world order according to principles favoured by Beijing.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificVladimir PutinRussiaKim Jong-unXi JinpingIndianewsShareReuse this content"

Their presence inside Taiwan’s EEZ have not been previously reported.China’s maritime militia: the shadowy armada whose existence Beijing rarely acknowledgesRead moreExperts said the activity fit the pattern ofBeijing’s “greyzone”strategies for seizing disputed territory. Beijing claims the entirety of the South China Sea, despite The Hague ruling the claim unlawful in 2016. Beijing also claims Taiwan is a province of China, and in preparation to forcibly annexe it has ramped up a campaign of “salami slicing” Taiwan’s territory,forcibly shrinkingthe space that Taipei can control and defend.“China’s greyzone aggression routinely leverages commercial activity for expansionist goals,” said Ray Powell, director of SeaLight, a maritime transparency project at Stanford University.The presence of Chinese vessels and structures in the EEZwas first identified in research published on Tuesdayby US thinktank the Jamestown Foundation, which said they were owned by the state-run China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).However, there is no sign of the Taiwan government having responded to it, despite frequently enforcing its EEZ elsewhere.The apparent lack of response has surprised analysts. “Failure to protest today risks normalising sovereignty shaving and encourages further encroachment,” the Jamestown report warned.The assets are large – including at least one vessel measuring more than 240m long with decks equivalent to 1.5 football fields, and two of the largest wellhead platforms in Asia. The report found some had been there for at least five years, with one coming within a kilometre of the Pratas restricted-waters border in 2024.The Guardian has independently located most of the assets using civilian maritime tracking websites.View image in fullscreenAt least 12 Chinese owned oil and gas exploration structures have been detected inside Taiwan’s exclusive economic zone, including this permanent deep water drilling platform, believed to be one of the biggest in Asia, captured by radar imagery in August 2025.Photograph: UmbraChallenging the oil and gas activity in Taiwan’s EEZ would be difficult. Taiwan’s political status meant it is not party to the UN convention on the law of the sea (Unclos) or its arbitration mechanisms. Domestic law about which parts of the EEZ border Taiwan enforces is unclear and it does not have the maritime strength to challenge such activity.“My guess is that Taipei lacked capabilities to respond, and that explains why they didn’t,” said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific program at the US-based German Marshall Fund.“Perhaps they underestimated how extensive it would be.”CNOOC describes itself as “one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the world”. It engages in numerous joint ventures with foreign firms, including with Taiwan’s CPC, although Taiwan’s ministry said there are currently no active contracts.But as a state-owned firm, it also works in the interests of Beijing’s political ambitions. In 2012, CNOOC’s chair, Wang Yilin, said in a speech: “Large-scale deep-water rigs are our mobile national territory and a strategic weapon,” according to the Wall Street Journal.CNOOC was approached for comment.Prof Zhu Feng, from the Tsinghua University’s centre for international security and strategy, said China’s oil and gas exploration was “primarily driven by its current energy needs” and was not intended to further escalate territorial disputes.“Rather it reflects China’s strong stance in safeguarding its claimed rights and interests in the region,” Zhu told the Guardian.Such activity has previously drawn the ire of other governments.This week Japan’s government accused Beijing of positioning 21 drilling rigs inside the Japanese EEZ, in an alleged “unilateral” effort to develop gas fields in disputed waters of the East China Sea and potentially extract gas from the Japanese side.The Jamestown report warned that structures like the jackets also had potential for dual use by China’s military, and “could facilitate a full range of coercion, blockade, bombardment and/or invasion scenarios against Pratas or Taiwan more generally”.In the five years since these assets were first moved into the EEZ, Beijing has ramped up a campaign to weaken Taiwan’s control over its territorial space, with military drills and incursions, and coast guard patrols in the restricted watersaround Taiwan’s offshore islands.“China has been steadily overwhelming Taiwan’s defences with aggressions much nearer their shores, which may make this something they’d simply rather not have to deal with,” Powell said.“Often governments don’t publicly respond to aggressions if they think making such complaints would beg the question of what else they can do about it.”The Guardian contacted Taiwan’s national security council for comment. It also contacted the ministry of economic affairs, which referred most questions to Taiwan’s ocean affairs council. The council declined to comment. Taiwan’s coast guard said it “maintains continuous monitoring of maritime targets within its surveillance area” but that oil drilling exploration and cooperations were outside its remit.China’s ministry of foreign affairs did not respond to a faxed request for comment.Additional research by Lillian Yang and Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaTaiwanOilAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He flew to his2018 summit in Singapore with Donald Trumpand to a meeting with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping,the same year in the Chinese city of Dalian.But the train, which includes bedrooms and a meeting room fitted out with wall-mounted lighting and reddish-pink leather armchairs, appears to be Kim’s preferred mode of transport.

But two sources described the donation as “substantial” and one alleged it was worth “six figures”. Minderoo did not disclose the value of its support.Former UN climate chief urges Australia to set ‘prosperity’ target of cutting emissions by 75% by 2035Read moreIt is unclear when the donation was made, and there is no suggestion it influenced the institute’s conduct. Nor is there any suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of the institute or Minderoo in respect of the donation.The institute’s public campaigns on emissions reduction are closely aligned to those run by the mining magnate’s charity and his company,Fortescue, which has publicly lobbied the Albanese government.The Australia Institute, Minderoo and Fortescue have all criticised the use of carbon offsets to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and have instead championed a “real zero” strategy, which calls for total decarbonisation.Minderoo, which was founded by Forrest and his partner Nicola in 2001, lists the promotion of the real zero strategy as a key focus. Its website carries quotes from Forrest including hiscriticism of net zeroas a “meaningless mantra that just buys companies and governments time while they continue to burn fossil fuels”.Forrest was Minderoo’s co-chair until September 2024, when he became a non-executive director. When announcing the change, Forrest said it would enable him to “focus on driving the global adoption of real zero”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailFortescue, which was founded by Forrest in 2003, has committed to achieving real zero emissions in its own operations by 2030 and hascampaigned for other companies to follow.In February,Fortescue organised an open lettercalling on the government to introduce a real zero policy, which waswelcomed by the Australia Institute. In the same month, Fortescue’s chief climate scientistoutlined the real zero approachat a summit organised by the institute.In recent months, the institute has praised Forrest’s commitment to real zero and called on the rest of industry to “get on the same path”.An Australia Institute spokesperson said its research was independent and that “protecting the privacy of our donors is important”.“Unfortunately, in Australia, some donors to other charities have been targeted, rather than praised, by powerful voices for their generous support for work designed to highlight the problems of rising inequity and greenhouse gas emissions,” the spokesperson said.Similar reasons for withholding the names of donors have been used by the conservative thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA). In 2012 the IPA said it did not reveal donors as they hadpreviously been “intimidated” by political opponents.Other research groups do disclose donors. The Grattan Institute lists all financial supporters, including individuals, who provide more than $1,000. The Centre for Public Integrity lists key funders on the second page of research reports.John Daley, who was the founding chief executive of the Grattan Institute from 2009 to 2020, said thinktanks “had a status in public debate” and their donors should be disclosed as a matter of transparency.Speaking generally, not in relation to the Australia Institute, Daley said he was not convinced of the need to keep donors secret.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If it comes to the crunch, we will see them in court.”The group surveyed inside the area earmarked for the firebreak in July and discovered more than 40 of the plants growing. McKinnon said the group had been told by a regional fire officer that the work was planned for this month.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterA 2021 Victorian government assessment of the species estimated only about 150 mature plants remained across 15 populations.The assessment warned most known populations were in roadside strips, and these were threatened by “road maintenance works and associated fire management and suppression activities including the construction and regular slashing of fire breaks”.The planned firebreak includes a long stretch along a road.View image in fullscreenA round-leaf pomaderris in flower.Photograph: John PatykowskiIrene Proebsting, the conservation coordinator at Latrobe Valley Field Naturalists, said the pomaderris had been “pushed to the edge” of existence.“After extensive surveys in the area, it’s been found only along roadsides and tracks,” she said. “Now this roadside population is to suffer the very treatment that the government defines as a threat, despite there being no evidence that these cleared strips will do anything to make us safer from fire.”Dr John Patykowski researched the shrub a decade ago while at Victoria’s Deakin University.“It’s a beautiful small shrub with these clusters of cream-coloured flowers with glossy little leaves.

But it is critical that all people have a fair chance to be heard, particularly in decisions about matters of life and death,” she said.Jana Favero, ASRC’s deputy chief executive, said the government had been “blatantly misleading the public” about the bill’s reach, as well as its power to prevent appeals and to be tweaked without parliamentary approval.“By removing the most basic legal protections from these decisions, Labor is setting Australia on a dangerous and slippery slope,” she said.On Tuesday, teal and Greens MPs spoke against the bill, warning they were only given a 10-minute briefing last week about the proposed changes.The Law Council of Australia has also raised concerns about the bill’s timing and lack of scrutiny, its removal of natural justice and its retrospectivity to visa decisions prior to the NZYQ ruling, which it said appeared to be “contrary to the rule of law”.“The Law Council is concerned by the lack of advance public consultation on this bill. To our knowledge, it has been introduced to parliament without any prior consultation with any interested party,” the council’s president, Juliana Warner, said.“Even if legislation is considered necessary, it should be prospective and not retrospective in nature.”The Immigration Advice and Rights Centre boss, Joshua Strutt, said the changes set a “dangerous precedent” and should concern all Australians.Burkeannounced in FebruaryNauru had agreed to offer 30-year resettlement visas for three men within the NZYQ cohort prompting their deportation. The three men still remain in Australia havinglodged a series of appealsagainst their removal.The high court is expected to rule on Wednesday whether the government’s decision to cancel one of the men’s protection visas was made unlawfully.Explore more on these topicsTony BurkeAustralian immigration and asylumLabor partyAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In response, its committee chair, the historian Lars Trägårdh, said that Sweden needs to embrace “democratic nationalism”, telling Swedish television last week that since the second world war Swedish culture had been characterised by modernism, internationalism and multiculturalism. “They have turned their gaze away from Swedish culture and the Swedish nation,” he told SVT’s 30 Minutes.The ‘big church move’: Swedish town begins to roll historic building 5kmRead moreThe list is divided into 11 categories, including poems, music, economy, religion and inventions, and encompasses places, laws and even concepts.It features Lilla Hyttnäs, the cottage in Darlarna that belonged to artists Karin and Carl Larsson; Hilma af Klint’s Målningar till templet (Paintings for the temple); Stockholm city hall, designed by Ragnar Östberg; and two songs by Gothenburg troubadour Evert Taube.It also takes in cross-country ski race Vasaloppet, Systema naturae by naturalist Carl von Linné, Kakelungnen (a popular 18thcentury heating stove) and Lappkodicillen, the 1751 agreement that recognised that Sámi people have the right to move freely between Sweden and Norway.With the exception of one of Sweden’s first synagogues, Marstrand, the religion category is dominated by Christian entries, despite Sweden’s Muslim population. It does, however, include Nattvardsgästerna (Winter Light), Bergman’s 1963 film about a priest in existential crisis, and the Swedish church’s 1958 decision to allow women to be priests.The Swedish Arabic news site Alkompis noted that the list did not include any Islamic landmarks. “Sweden’s first mosque, Nasir Mosque, was built in Gothenburg in 1976, 49 years ago,” it said.The decision to create a Swedish cultural canon was part of the coalition agreement for the Moderates-led government, which depends on the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats. The project has been the subject of heated debate ever since the investigation was commissioned in 2023, and has been criticised by the Swedish Academy, the Swedish Writers’ Association and members of Sweden’s national minorities, a group which includes Indigenous Sámi people.Additionally, the committee invited the public to create an online “people’s canon” which received about 10,000 submissions, including rapper Silvana Imam, whose music includes songs protesting against racism and the far-right Sweden Democrats, and the kebab pizza, one of Sweden’s favourite dishes. Neither features in the official canon.Former Swedish security adviser on trial for allegedly mislaying classified papersRead moreTrägårdh said at a press conference at Uppsala University on Tuesday that Sweden’s canon should be a “moving object” to be regularly updated and “something that creates rich possibilities for all to be successful people in modern Swedish society.”Marlen Eskander, the founder of the Reading Promotion Institute, who left the committee last year, described the canon as “very exclusionary”.“Setting a 50-year limit is deliberately excluding contemporary experiences,” she told news outlet Svenska Dagbladet, adding that Sweden had undergone huge changes since 1975.Anita Kitok, head of language and culture for Sametinget, Sweden’s Sámi parliament, said: “Sametinget has not been involved in the cultural canon so I do not have any comments about the result or the process.”The canon announcement comes at a time of heightened identity politics in Sweden that have seen the far-right flourish amid an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment, in part through nostalgic messaging and by connecting immigration and criminality, which has since become a mainstream narrative.The Swedish culture minister, Parisa Liljestrand, rejected criticism of the project, saying: “The canon project has been attributed with intentions that never existed anywhere else except possibly in the critics’ imagination.”She denied that the canon marked a victory for the Sweden Democrats’ culture politics. “That is the absolutely worst way to see this. This is a project that is about inclusion,” she said.One critic said the outcome was “laughable”. “You can’t get away from the thought that AI could have suggested it,” wrote Björn Wiman in Dagens Nyheter.Explore more on these topicsSwedenEuropeAbbaIngmar BergmanAugust StrindbergnewsShareReuse this content"

Italy’s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, first floated this proposal several months ago when interference with satellite navigation started becoming increasingly common in airspace near Russia.In August, Latvia’s electronic communications office said it had identified at least three jamming hotspots along borders with Russia. In April 2024, a Finnish airline temporarily suspended flights to the Estonian city of Tartu after jamming, while in March that year a plane carrying the British defence secretary had its satellite signal jammed as it flew near Russian territory.A 2011 decree requires that information on Italian ministers’ movements, particularly flights, be published on the government website. Although the government would still be obliged to secure diplomatic clearance to fly over another country’s airspace, sources told the Guardian that Italy, “while respecting that protocol … could soon decide not to make such flights public”.In February, the Italian prime minister’s plane was removed from Flightradar, one of the most widely used apps to provide real-time data on aircraft movements, but it remains visible on equivalent sites. For security reasons, officials are now considering “shielding flights carrying the prime minister and cabinet ministers from all such platforms”, sources said.The Associated Press has plotted almost 80 incidents on a map, tracking a campaign of disruption acrossEuropeblamed on Russia – which the head of Britain’s foreign intelligence service described as staggeringly reckless.Russia has denied it was behind the failure of the navigation system on von der Leyen’s flight. “Your information is incorrect,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Monday.On Tuesday, Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, said he was taking the jamming of GPS signals “very seriously”. He said the alliance was working “day and night” to prevent jamming and ensure “they will not do it again”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Belgium’s foreign minister,Maxime Prévot, has said his country will recognise a Palestinian state at the UN general assembly later this month, adding to international pressure on Israel after similar moves by Australia, Britain, Canada and France.The decision comes “in light of the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Palestine, particularly in Gaza, and in response to the violence perpetrated byIsraelin violation of international law,” Prévot said in a post to social media.Israel has become increasingly isolated on the international stage as it faces credible accusations of genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and the collective punishment of the civilian population ofGaza.Israel’s assault has flattened large parts ofGaza, killing more than 63,000 people, mostly civilians, forcing nearly all of Gaza’s more than 2 million people from their homes and causing what the UN-backed hunger monitor, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), described last month as a “man-made famine” in and around Gaza City. Israel is still obstructing aid into the territory, despite widespread starvation.In a lengthy post on Xdescribing the Belgium government’s new position, Prévotwrote:In light of the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Palestine, particularly in Gaza, and in response to the violence perpetrated by Israel in violation of international law, given its international obligations, including the duty to prevent any risk of genocide, Belgium had to take strong decisions to increase pressure on the Israeli government and Hamas terrorists.This is not about sanctioning the Israeli people but about ensuring that their government respects international and humanitarian law and taking action to try to change the situation on the ground.Maxime Prévot said Belgium took the decision to step up pressure on the Israeli government and Hamas.Photograph: ShutterstockThe recognition of Palestine would only be formalised if Hamas releases all remaining Israeli hostages kidnapped in the Hamas-led 7 October attack on southern Israel in 2023 and the militant group “no longer has any role in managing Palestine,” Prévot added.Prévot saidBelgium, a member of the European Union, would levy 12 “firm” sanctions on Israel, such as a ban on importing products from its settlements and a review of public procurement policies with Israeli companies. It will also declare Hamas leaders persona non grata in Belgium.The minister also said two “extremist” Israeli ministers and several “violent settlers” would be designated “persona non grata” in Belgium. While he didn’t name the ministers, they are likely to be Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far right security minister in Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government, and Bezalel Smotrich, the far right finance minister.Over the summer, the UK, alongside Australia, Canada, New Zealand and NorwaysanctionedBen-Gvir and Smotrich over “repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities” in the occupied West Bank.ShareUpdated at03.18 EDT"

The Israeli military has sought to displace people from the city before its offensive and has promised that southern Gaza would be able to accommodate them, despite experts disagreeing with the suggestion.“We wish to remind you that in al-Mawasi, enhanced services will be provided with an emphasis on access to medical care, water and food,” the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X on Tuesday afternoon.Israel continued to push ahead with its operation and began the mobilisation of tens of thousands of reservists on Tuesday.At least 60,000 reservists will be called up, with the service of an additional 20,000 to be extended as the Israeli military slowly ramps up its military activity inGazaCity, which it has described as the last stronghold of Hamas.Israel has said that the operation, known as Gideon’s Chariots II, to take over Gaza City will involve five divisions from the country’s standing army and could extend into next year.Already Israel has pushed into the western parts of Gaza City, levelling the once prosperous neighbourhood of Zeitoun and declaring the entire city a “dangerous combat zone” last week. It has intensified its strikes, claiming to have killed the spokesperson of Hamas’s armed wing, Abu Obeida, in a strike on an apartment building in Gaza City on Saturday.The Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 76 people across the Gaza Strip in the last 24 hours, Gaza health authorities said.On Monday, the world’s leading association of genocide scholars said Israel’s actions in Gazameet the legal definition of the crime. Aid groups have warned that an invasion of Gaza City and the forced displacement of about 1 million people could have devastating humanitarian consequences. The population of the city has swelled over the course of the last 23 months as it became a refuge for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced from the near 80% of Gaza that is under evacuation order.The city is already gripped by famine created by Israeli restrictions on aid entering Gaza, which experts say will worsen even in the absence of a military operation. Thirteen people, including three children, died from malnutrition on Tuesday, bringing the total number of people who have starved to death over the last 23 months to 361 – the majority of whom have died since July.Israel is seeking to forcibly displace Gaza City’s residents before its operation and has tried to entice Palestinians to southern Gaza, which already is packed with other displaced people.The head of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, said on Saturday that there is no safe way to conduct a mass evacuation of Gaza City and that no other part of Gaza had the capacity to absorb such mass displacement. Earlier in August, the UN human rights office spokesperson Thameen al-Kheetan said that Palestinians in al-Mawasi had “little or no access to essential services and supplies, including food, water, electricity and tents”.Many residents of Gaza City have refused to leave, suspicious of what awaits them in southern Gaza after Israel has attacked so-called humanitarian zones in the past.The Gaza City operation, pushed forward by the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from far-right members of his ruling coalition, faces stiff opposition at home. Tens of thousands of Israelis have marched across the country in protest against the war, which they say is aimless and endangers the lives of the remaining hostages in Gaza.Israeli media has reported internal opposition between the country’s cabinet and the military chief of staff. According to Israeli media’s retelling of a security cabinet meeting on Sunday, the Israeli military chief urged the government to take a ceasefire deal instead of pressing on with the Gaza City operation, which he said could harm the lives of hostages in Gaza.Hamas had accepted a ceasefire proposal two weeks prior that resembled an earlier US draft which Israel had approved in prior rounds of negotiations. Israel has yet to respond to the proposal, baffling mediators.Israel’s planned military operation in Gaza City as well as its continued systematic starving of the territory’s population has prompted a wave of global condemnation.Please don’t succumb to hopelessness over Palestine. Your voice can still make a difference | Arwa MahdawiRead moreOn Tuesday, Belgium announced it would join a growing list of European countries in recognising Palestine as a state. It also announced it would ban goods from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and designate Hamas leaders, violent Israeli settlers and two far-right Israeli ministers as persona non grata.“This is not about sanctioning the Israeli people but about ensuring that their government respects international and humanitarian law and taking action to try to change the situation on the ground,” the Belgian foreign minister, Maxime Prévot, said in a post on X. He added that the EU should suspend its trade pact with Israel to further pressure it.The move further increases the growing international isolation of Israel as its war in Gaza and subsequent famine grinds on.At least 63,633 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza over the last 23 months.

The title of Hundred Year Hunger was inspired by a new book of the same name by E Mark Windle about the history of chronic malnutrition and deprivation in Gaza and will raise money for the Amos Trust’s Gaza Appeal.Writing on Instagram, the British protest singer said that the song “looks at the current famine that Israel has created inGazathrough the lens of a century of enforced food insecurity and malnutrition imposed on the Palestinian people, firstly by British imperialism, then as a weapon of mass displacement by the state of Israel”.The song was released to coincide with a newhumanitarian aid flotilla – with Greta Thunberg among their number – setting sail from Barcelonato try to “break the illegal siege of Gaza”, organisers said. The intention is to open a humanitarian corridor and deliver aid to an area gripped by famine. It is expected to arrive in mid-September. Israel previously blocked two attempts by activists to deliver aid by ship to Gaza.Last week, an Israel military spokesperson said it would no longer pause fighting to allow aid deliveries in Gaza city, a decision likely to intensify the famine in the northern part of the territory.“Now my children ask me why the watching world is standing by / While Israel creates famine as a weapon in their war,” Bragg sings in the track.The chorus of the song is in Arabic. Bragg explained that “sumud” translates as “steadfastness or perseverance. It is used by Palestinians to describe their nonviolent everyday resistance against Israel’s occupation. Sumud emphasises the commitment of the Palestinian people to remain on their land despite hardship and oppression, elevating their everyday existence into a form of resistance.”A second term, “lan narhal”, Bragg wrote, “translates as ‘we will not leave’. Together ‘Sumud! Sumud! Lan narhal’ conveys the determination of the Palestinian people to refuse to be displaced.”On 20 September, Bragg is hosting a Palestine benefit gig, Days Like These, at London’s O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire, featuring acts including Jamie Webster, Billy Nomates, Antony Szmierek, Reverend and the Makers and Big Special, to support the Amos Trust’s Gaza Appeal. He previously expressed his support for the Irish rap trio Kneecap, charged with allegedly displaying a flag supporting the proscribed terrorist organisation Hezbollah last year.Bragg said in May: “The charging of Kneecap’s Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh with a terrorism offence by the Metropolitan Police is the latest development of a disturbing and broader trend over the past few years during which the state has sought to criminalise creative expression.”Bragg released his last album, The Million Things That Never Happened, in 2021.Explore more on these topicsBilly BraggGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaGreta ThunbergnewsShareReuse this content"

Except this was no ordinary gathering of three men, but a meeting of three of the most powerful non-western leaders:Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi.The overt displays of intimacy were widely regarded by observers as a telling message of defiance aimed at their western counterparts, in particular Donald Trump, who just a few days earlier had slapped Indiawith 50% import tariffs, among the harshest of the US president’s trade penalties.“India likes other great powers to know that New Delhi has options,” said Christopher Clary, an associate professor of political science at University at Albany, State University of New York. “One advantage of being in lots of clubs is you can make high-profile entrances to those clubs if you’re upset with how things are going in other relationships.”This was Modi’s first visit to China in seven years and the hostilities that had come to define the countries’ relationship in recent years were nowhere to be seen. Instead, as the Indian prime minister arrived in China forthe Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, he received a far more effusive welcome from the Chinese premier than most guests were granted.Xi welcomes Putin and other world leaders to China – in picturesRead moreThe leaders’brotherly encounter in the city of Tianjindid not go unnoticed in the Oval Office. Hours after the meeting, Trump went on another tirade against India, calling trade with the country a “one-sided disaster”, while his trade adviser Peter Navarro said in a social media post: “It is a shame to see Modi getting in bed with Xi Jinping and Putin. I’m not sure what he’s thinking.”View image in fullscreenThe meeting of Putin, Modi and Xi was interpreted as a message of defiance to their western counterparts.Photograph: Getty ImagesEven a year ago, such a scene between Modi and Xi was difficult to imagine. The two countries had remained in a hostile military standoff since 2020 after China’s rapid encroachments and troop incursions along its mountainous Himalayan border with India led to a violent clash between soldiers on the two sides.It was followed by a mammoth mobilisation of military personnel, infrastructure and weapons along both sides of the border. Anti-China sentiment ran rampant in India, with hundreds of Chinese apps – including TikTok – banned and Chinese companies prevented from investing in India.The US had seized upon the tensions to cultivate its close ties with India further, viewing the country as a critical counterweight to China’s rise.Yet Trump’s own foreign policy position has accelerated something of a geopolitical repositioning. The US, once seen as an unshakable ally to India, is now viewed in New Delhi as a turbulent, even hostile adversary.The double tariffs on India, which Trump announced without warning, appear to be a punishment after falling out with Modi, who refused to credit the US president withhalting possible nuclear war between India and Pakistanin May. Particular umbrage was taken in New Delhi at Trump’s attempts to use tariffs to shape India’s policies.Meanwhile, China has observed the alienation of New Delhi and Washington with overt glee and made it clear its priority now is acomplete normalisation of Indo-Chinese ties. During Modi’s China visit, he and Xi agreed to friendlier relations, which include stabilising their border and reopening their economies to each other. Speaking on Sunday, Xi said it was “vital to be friends, a good neighbour, and the dragon and the elephant to come together”.As analysts emphasised, the beginning of a rapprochement between India and China pre-dated Trump’s second term. Nonetheless, the prospect of a second unpredictable Trump term had been seen by many as a driver for China’s sudden willingness to discuss disengagement with India.“This meeting was a partial response to Trump’s tariff tantrum,” said Clary. “The core reality for India is that it does not have enough military capability to be confident of how an India-China fight would go. In this Trumpian world, India may not be able to find an outside ally that it can depend on and so it needs to make sure the India-China relationship is calm.”Before the 2020 clashes, Modi had been seen as gung-ho in strengthening the India-China relationship, hosting Xi in India just a few months after being elected prime minister in 2014. Harsh V Pant, a professor of international relations at King’s College London’s India Institute, said it was likely the two leaders would try to revert the relationship to how it had been five years ago, despite the border remaining a challenge.Even with the risk of infuriating its western allies, analysts emphasised India had a lot to gain from bettering ties with China. Much of India’s manufacturing, which Modi is trying to boost, is reliant on materials and rare earths from China. China, meanwhile, stands to gain economically if it regains access to India’s market.However, Pant emphasised that there were still significant limitations on the India-China relationship beyond the border tensions. China remains a major backer and supplier of weapons to Pakistan – widely seen as a way to keep India’s regional power in check – and it was Chinese jets and weaponry that were used against India during the India-Pakistan hostilities in May.“It would be a mistake to view this as some kind of a grand rapprochement between India and China,” he said. “In India, the trust deficit with China is still very, very high and there are enough pressure points that will keep the relationship a bit tenuous.”Explore more on these topicsNarendra ModiXi JinpingVladimir PutinRussiaChinaIndiaTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a shallow earthquake, taking place just six miles beneath the Earth’s surface, which is known to have a particularly destructive impact.On Tuesday, a second earthquake, of magnitude 5.5, also at a shallow depth of six miles, shook south-eastern Afghanistan, prompting fears of further damage and destruction.‘The walls collapsed around me’: Afghans describe quake devastationRead moreBefore the second quake the death toll had passed 1,411 with more than 3,000 people injured, Zabihullah Mujahid, aTalibangovernment spokesperson, said on Tuesday.Authorities said they expected casualties to rise further once rescue teams reached more isolated locations, many which were still inaccessible more than 24 hours after the first earthquake struck.Aseel, a humanitarian tech platform with networks around Afghanistan that has sent teams to the affected areas, said more people had been injured in the second quake, which was expected to push the death toll higher.View image in fullscreenPeople bury earthquake victims in Kunar, Afghanistan.

Hardline Taliban policies, such as aban on female educationand employment, have resulted in a sharp drop in international aid funding and humanitarian assistance to the country.The disaster will further stretch the resources of the war-torn nation’s Taliban administration, which is also grappling with the return of hundreds of thousands ofAfghans deported by Iran and Pakistanin recent weeks.The Sunday quake razed three villages in Kunar and caused substantial damage in many others, authorities said. At least 610 people were killed in Kunar and there were 12 dead in Nangarhar, they added.View image in fullscreenPeople bury earthquake victims in Kunar, Afghanistan. Rescuers were still battling to reach some remote locations on Tuesday.Photograph: Samiullah Popal/EPAGhazi Abad village, in the Nurgal district of Kunar, was a scene of devastation, the entire village destroyed. Homes had been reduced to rubble and many residents remained trapped under the debris.Some villagers sat weeping amid the piled ruins of their homes. Others began laboriously clearing the debris by hand, or carried out the injured on makeshift stretchers.“There is not a single standing room visible in this village,” said one resident, Abdullah. “The aftermath of the disaster suggests that life here was ended in mere seconds.”Abdullah said adjoining villages had also suffered similar fates, completely levelled as the earthquake reduced every home to ruins. “The full extent of the earthquake’s impact will become clearer in the coming days as recovery efforts continue and many are still trapped,” he said.“The losses are huge, people have no food and safe drinking water. While rescue operations are lacking, people are banding together to search for survivors and recover bodies all day and night. In one household there is no one left, everyone died here and their cattle are left alone.”Another survivor said: “We need ambulances, we need doctors, we need everything to rescue the injured and recover the dead.”In Kunar, the dead, some of them children, were wrapped in white shrouds by villagers who prayed over their bodies before burying them, while helicopters ferried the wounded to hospitals.Rescuers were battling to reach remote mountainous areas cut off from mobile networks along the Pakistani border but their efforts were impeded by heavy rain, which heightened the risk of landslides and left many roads impassable. Military rescue teams fanned out across the region, the defence ministry said, with 40 flights carrying away 420 wounded and dead.View image in fullscreenA man stands amid the rubble of a collapsed house.

The £850m estimate did not include legal costs or compensation claims, and doubts were raised by the NAO about the “completeness and accuracy” of the base figure.The NAO said: “The MoD estimates that, as of July 2025, the government had spent around £400m on resettling people through the ARR and that it would spend around a further £450m on the scheme.“The MoD estimated the costs to the whole of government to be £128,000 per resettled individual, of which an estimated £53,000 would be met by the MoD. At the time of publication, the MoD had not provided us with sufficient evidence to give us confidence regarding the completeness and accuracy of these estimates.”The spreadsheet accidentally shared by the MoD comprised 33,345 lines of data containing the names and contact details of applicants and, in some instances, information relating to the applicants’ family members.The NAO said the MoD did not record exactly how much it had spent on resettling people through the ARR scheme because it did not separately identify these costs in its accounting system.The government said it did this to maintain the secrecy of the ARR scheme whilea superinjunction was in placepreventing disclosure of both the data breach and the existence of the injunction itself.After the discovery of the data breach on 25 August 2023, the MoD had applied to the high court for an injunction to prevent the data loss becoming public. Seven days later, the court granted a superinjunction – which also prevented disclosure of the existence of the injunction itself, when a judge accepted the MoD’s assessment of risk to the safety and lives of many individuals and their families.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The defence secretary, John Healey, closed the ARR and the injunction on reporting was dropped in July.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the chair of the cross-party public accounts committee, said: “After the high court superinjunction was lifted earlier this year, confusion still remains over the reported £850m historic and future costs relating to the breach, with the MoD unable to provide sufficient assurance over their numbers.“This figure does not include all legal costs or compensation claims, which currently remain unknown. The PAC will be examining these issues in our inquiry next week and I will be following developments closely as the NAO conducts further work to provide transparency on the figures in their upcoming report on Afghan resettlement schemes, with many of those needing relocation yet to arrive in the UK.”Explore more on these topicsMinistry of DefenceAfghanistanSuperinjunctionsData protectionnewsShareReuse this content"

It fulfils a pledgeLabour included in its manifestofor last year’s general election.“How can we expect children to do well at school if they have the equivalent of a double espresso in their system on a daily basis?”, saidWes Streeting, the health secretary.“Energy drinks might seem harmless but the sleep, concentration and wellbeing of today’s kids are all being impacted, while high sugar versions damage their teeth and contribute to obesity.”Shops, cafes, restaurants and websites will be prohibited from selling energy drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to anyone under 16. That will affect drinks such as Red Bull, Monster, Relentless and Prime Energy and force their makers to reformulate their products.For example, a 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine, the same as one espresso or two cans of cola. Tea, coffee and soft drinks containing lower amounts of caffeine will be unaffected.It is unclear when sales to under-16s – including from vending machines – will become illegal. The ban will be done using secondary legislation under the Food Safety Act 1990.Supermarkets voluntarily stopped selling the drinks to under-16s in 2018. But some smaller convenience stores still allow under-16s to buy them. Drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre already carry warning labels that they are “not suitable for children”.“High-caffeine energy drinks have no place in children’s hands. This is a common sense, evidence-based step to protect children’s physical, mental and dental health”, said Katharine Jenner, the director of theObesity Health Alliance.The success of preventing young people buying alcohol and cigarettes showed that age-based restrictions work, Jenner added. “Age-of-sale policies like this have a proven record of reducing access to products that are not suitable for children.”Teachers have voiced concern about how energy drinks have left young children “bouncing off the walls in lesson time” after consuming them on their way to school.Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said the move would help tackle the “scourge of poor classroom behaviour”, which is caused in part by “the harmful effects of caffeine-loaded drinks”.Research by the NASUWT unionfound 71% of teachers worry about pupils misusing energy drinks at school and 70% while elsewhere.“The drinks create a situation in which pupils can’t focus, can’t sit still and just think it’s cool to drink them”, one teacher said. Another said: “Energy drinks make it very difficult for students to focus and engage with learning and seem to make students noisier and agitated.”Matt Wrack, the union’s general secretary, said under-16s will still be able to get the drinks from parents or other adults, despite the ban.Dentists urged the government to go further. The ban should be extended to include zero and low-sugar energy drinks to help tackle tooth decay, the British Dental Association said.“Products that are habit-forming, highly acidic and can contain over 20 teaspoons of sugar have no place on the menu for children”, said Eddie Crouch, the association’s chair.Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition and head of research and impact at Action on Sugar, said trading standards officers would have to enforce the ban to ensure it worked.Gavin Partington, the director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said firms do not market or promote the drinks to under-16s.He added: “Our members have led the way in self-regulation through our longstanding energy drinks code of practice.“Our members do not market or promote the sale of energy drinks to under-16s and label all high-caffeine beverages as ‘not recommended for children’, in line with and in the spirit of this code.“As with all government policy, it’s essential that any forthcoming regulation is based on a rigorous assessment of the evidence that’s available.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryYoung peopleHealthObesityWes StreetingHealth & wellbeingNutritionnewsShareReuse this content"

But she has since put the constituency home into a trust before declaring the flat in Hove,East Sussex, as her sole dwelling at the time of purchase.Experts now say that tax officials could demand the higher rate of stamp duty if they decided Rayner was wrong when she declared the Hove flat as her only residence. If they deemed her south-coast property was an additional dwelling, they could demand she pay the higher stamp duty rate of £70,000, rather than the £30,000 she paid when she bought it.Sean Randall, a tax adviser who specialises in stamp duty, said: “Rayner disposed of the Ashton house into a trust before midnight of the day of completion. But she would be regarded as still owning it if she or her children are a beneficiary under the trust and entitled to occupy the dwelling for life. The key question is whether she or her children are so entitled.”He added that while Rayner would have declared her Hove flat as her only house, officials at HMRC would have until next spring to challenge that designation. “HMRC has the opportunity, but not the obligation, to check later,” he said. “An inquiry normally starts eight months after completion.”Henry Pryor, a property agent, said: “The test for stamp duty is not whether you own another property, but whether you have an interest in another property, which is your main one.”A spokesperson for Rayner did not respond to a request to comment, though her allies insist she has not broken any tax rules and she is not under investigation by the prime minister’s adviser on ministerial standards.Rayner’s complex property arrangements have attracted criticism from her political opponents, who accuse her of hypocritically minimising her tax liabilities while advocating for higher wealth taxes on others.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And what are the political risks?Yvette Cooper has announced several tough policies after a summer dominated by Farage and Reform UKAletha AduPolitical correspondentTue 2 Sep 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShareAfter a summer recess dominated by headlines aboutReform UK’s hardline immigration proposalsandprotests outside hotels housing asylum seekers, the home secretary returned to parliament seeking to wrest back control of the narrative.Yvette Cooper has announced a flurry of tough asylum measures includingsuspending refugee family reunion applications, and even floated the idea that refugees could bemoved out of hotels and into warehouses instead.She promised MPs that ministers were doing their bit to help those fleeing persecution, in “the British way”. But will ministers be caught between its promises of compassion and tough talk of migration?What has happened to the refugee family reunion process?The government has temporarily suspended new refugee family reunion applications as ministers want to prove that refugees will be covered by the same family migration rules and conditions “as everyone else”.People who have had their asylum claims accepted will now have to apply through the standard family scheme that applies to UK citizens, who are required to show that they have a joint income of at least £29,000 a year before they are allowed to bring a partner to the UK.Cooper said changes will be made to the family reunion routes process, and will eventually become law in spring.Campaigners have warned this is one of the only safe, legal routes available for refugees fleeing persecution or war to be reunited with their partner or child. Some MPs have highlighted remarks Cooper made four years ago, when she said: “If there are not safe, legal routes for family reunion we end up with more people driven into the hands of dangerous criminal gangs.”Will there be an end to hotel accommodation for asylum seekers?The government has vowed to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029. At least 32,000 asylum seekers currently occupy them at a huge cost to the taxpayer. Ministers say they will need to be closed “as swiftly as possible” but in “an orderly and sustainable manner”. Government insiders say they expect five more hotels housing asylum seekers to close by the end of the year, with more to follow in the new year.As of Monday, single adults who are granted asylum will be given 28 days to move out of their temporary housing. Ministers have reduced the existing 56-day timeframe to help reduce the number of people staying in hotels. But it could push more asylum seekers on to the streets.Cooper went further on Tuesday after her measures dominated the front pages. She suggested asylum seekers could be housed in warehouses. The prime minister’s spokesperson said the government was indeed looking at “using modular buildings on industrial sites, ex-military sites”. A timeline has not been outlined for this.How has the asylum appeals system changed?Judges will no longer have power to hear appeals made by asylum seekers. Instead, the government has set up a new independent body “staffed by professionally trained adjudicators” to ensure high standards. It is hoped that this will operate in a similar way to the magistrates system, with trained members of the public hearing cases under the supervision of legal experts. Ministers hope this will speed up the process of asylum appeals.Will asylum seekers be returned to France?Ministers have been referring to theUK-France agreementas a great example of how the government is taking action to “smash the gangs” by returning a small number of asylum seekers who arrive via small boats to France.Cooper said the first returns would begin “later this month”, as the first detentions of asylum seekers on small boats took place the day after thedeal was ratified in August. Although this is a pilot scheme, ministers hope they can continue to develop and expand it.Why is there a crackdown on foreign students?Tens of thousands of foreign students have been contacted by the Home Office to saythey will be deported if they overstay their visas. The government launched the campaign in hope of cutting the numbers of students making asylum claims. In the year to June 2025, 431,725 visas were granted to foreign students who had come to the UK to study.What are the political risks?The government wants to press ahead with these tough measures to take on Reform UK. Starmer told his cabinet ministers that migration is a “central issue” to his government and he understands the “frustration people feel at the level of illegal crossings and the sight of asylum hotels in their communities”.Despite ministers’ tough talk, the Conservatives immediately said Starmer “doesn’t have the stomach” to take stronger action. Farage did not directly respond to the measures, but the fact that the prime minister had to spend a lot of his media round on Monday attacking Farage spoke volumes.Labour MPs and refugee charities have swiftly criticised the measures, particuarly the suspension of the refugee family reunion process. The government has been accused of pushing children “into the arms of people smugglers”.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumYvette CooperLabourReform UKexplainersShareReuse this content"

Treasury officials pointed to similar increases in yields on Tuesday in Germany, the US and France.But with the government already spending more than £100bn a year in interest on the UK’s debts, the latest jump highlighted the extent to which the government feels constrained by the bond markets.The 10-year gilt yield, which the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) uses to forecast future government borrowing costs, also rose on Tuesday, hitting its highest level since January.Meanwhile the pound weakened, falling by more than 1.5 cents against the US dollar to $1.3390, its worst day since early April, when Donald Trump launched his global trade war.Fall in value of the poundThese latest market jitters followeda shake-up of key figures inside No 10that was widely read at Westminster as an attempt by Keir Starmer to get a firmer grip on economic policy.This included poaching Reeves’s deputy, Darren Jones, to a new role as Starmer’s “chief secretary” and appointing a heavyweight new economic adviser, the former Bank of England deputy governor Minouche Shafik.How can the UK avoid trouble in the gilts market? | Sushil WadhwaniRead moreConcern that the chancellor is being “managed out” is weighing on UK government bonds, suggested Kathleen Brooks, the research director at XTB.“The last time there was a threat to Reeves’s position, back in early July, bond yields jumped as the market worried that she could be replaced by a more left-leaning member of theLabourparty,” Brooks said.The chancellor was filmed in tears in the House of Commons chamber in July, briefly prompting bond yields to rise as investors speculated she could be replaced with a more spendthrift alternative.Brooks confirmed that the UK was “not an outlier” in bond markets for the moment, but added: “As we lead up to the budget, the chancellor’s options are narrowing, and we could see more frequent bursts of bond market volatility. While we are not quite at Liz Truss levels of stress in the UK bond market, the ‘Starmer moment’ for markets could be coming down the line.”Reeves has argued that her fiscal rules, which some Labour MPs feel unnecessarily limit the government’s scope for action, reflect real-world limits on investors’ appetite for the UK’s debt.The rules, which apply in five years’ time, require her to balance day-to-day spending with tax receipts and reduce debt as a share of GDP.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This has likely facilitated a move higher in yields in the UK, notwithstanding the global move in long-end yields,” Jennings said.The Treasury is keen to damp down some of this speculation.Bank shares fell sharply last Fridayafter suggestions of a tax on the highly profitable sector. Ministers are also believed to beexamining options for taxing property more heavily.Officials insist that tax changes will be focused on boosting economic efficiency, while Reeves’s central focus will remain improving the UK’s lacklustre productivity.It is a downgrade of the OBR’s forecasts for future productivity – the amount UK workers can produce in an hour, and a key determinant of economic growth – that is expected to weigh on its budget projections.The institution’s expectations for productivity are more optimistic than those of many other forecasters, and have repeatedly been disappointed in the recent past.Any shortfall against Reeves’s fiscal rule appears unlikely to be closed through significant spending cuts, after a backbench rebellion forced Downing Street to abandon plans for £5bn of disability cuts earlier this year.While bond prices fell on Tuesday, traders piled in to precious metals in a flight to safety. This pushedthe gold price up to a new record highof $3,508 (£2,607) an ounce on Tuesday, while silver rose over $40 an ounce for the first time since 2011.Anxiety over fiscal sustainability is another factor hitting the bond market, withDonald Trump’s recent tax cuts and spending billexpected to add trillions of dollars to the US national debt. Trump’s recent attacks on the independence of the central bank, the Federal Reserve, have also rattled investors.Explore more on these topicsGiltsBondsGovernment borrowingRachel ReevesEconomic policyEconomicsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

So far, all the lava from this eruption has been contained within the summit crater inside HawaiiVolcanoesnational park.Lava emerged from the north vent in Halemaʻumaʻu crater after midnight. The vent began shooting fountains of lava at 6.35am, the US Geological Survey said. By mid-morning, it was also erupting from the crater’s south vent and a third vent in between.A lower magma chamber under Halemaʻumaʻu crater is receiving magma directly from the earth’s interior about 5 cubic yards (3.8 cubic meters) per second, said Ken Hon, the scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. This blows the chamber up like a balloon and forces magma into an upper chamber. From there, it gets pushed above ground through cracks.‘A climate of unparalleled malevolence’: are we on our way to the sixth major mass extinction?Read moreMagma has been using the same pathway to rise to the surface since December, making the initial release and subsequent episodes all part of the same eruption, Hon said.Many have featured lava soaring into the air, in some cases more than 1,000 ft (300 meters). The fountains are generated in part because magma – which holds gasses that are released as it rises – has been traveling to the surface through narrow, pipe-like vents.The expanding magma supply is capped by heavier magma that had expelled its gas at the end of the prior episode. Eventually enough new magma accumulates to force the degassed magma off, and the magma shoots out like liquid out of a champagne bottle that was shaken before the cork was popped.Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. It’s located on Hawaii Island, the largest of the Hawaiian archipelago. It’s about 200 miles (320 km) south of the state’s largest city, Honolulu, which is on Oahu.This is the fourth time in 200 years that Kilauea has shot lava fountains into the air in repeated episodes. There were more episodes the last time Kilauea followed this pattern: the eruption that began in 1983 started with 44 sessions of shooting fountains. Those were spread out over three years, however. And the fountains emerged in a remote area so few got to watch.The other two occurred in 1959 and 1969.Scientists don’t know how the current eruption will end or how it may change. In 1983, magma built enough pressure that Kilauea opened a vent at a lower elevation and started continuously leaking lava from there rather than periodically shooting out of a higher elevation. The eruption continued in various forms for three decades and only ended in 2018.Something similar could happen again. Or the current eruption could instead stop at the summit if its magma supply peters out.Scientists can estimate a few days or even a week ahead of time when lava is likely to emerge with the help of sensors around the volcano that detect earthquakes and minuscule changes in the angle of the ground, which indicate when magma is inflating or deflating.“Our job is like being a bunch of ants crawling on an elephant trying to figure out how the elephant works,” Hon said.The lava fountains have been shorter lately. Steve Lundblad, a geology professor at University of Hawaii at Hilo, said the vent may have gotten wider, leaving molten rock less pressurized.“We’re still gonna have spectacular eruptions,” he said. “They’re just going to be wider and not as high.”Explore more on these topicsHawaiiVolcanoesWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Offit has alsowarnedthat Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, is attempting to sow doubt and confusion about vaccines in particular in order to drive down vaccination rates across the country.Beginning in 2017, Offit served two four-year terms on the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biologics Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). He said he was offered a third term, set to expire in 2027, by FDA officials.Offit filled out the necessary paperwork, and was put on the list of voting VRBPAC members through 2027.But as of Tuesday, his name is no longer on therosterof independent advisers.About a week and a half ago, he said, his contact at the FDA told him that they still wanted him on the committee and that his forms had been cleared by the FDA, “but they’re being held up at HHS”.Soon after that, Offit said he received an email thanking him for his service on the committee. He was not given a reason for his dismissal.“What I know to be a fact is that it got held up at HHS. I also know that, according to the person who talked to me, the FDA wanted me to be on that committee,” Offit said.The news was firstreportedby Pink Sheet.“I understand that it’s likely I didn’t get through HHS because Robert F Kennedy Jr may not like me as much as I’d hoped,” Offit said. “I have been critical of the administration. But that’s OK, because it’s OK to have debate about things, it’s OK to question, and then if you think I’m wrong, tell me where I’m wrong.”Offit appears to be the only member of the committee to be dismissed. Other members are serving terms until 2026 or later.The health department did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about whether Offit was removed because of his criticisms of Kennedy, or whether other members of the committee would be dismissed.Kennedy shocked the health community when he abruptly fired all 17 members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in June. He replaced the advisers with individuals who have little experience with vaccines or who have taken anti-vaccine stances.The dismissal of Offit sounded similar to other shake-ups at US health agencies, said Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine.“It’s consistent with what the secretary of HHS did with ACIP, remove those who are qualified and vaccine experts and replace them with unqualified ideologues or those who promote pseudoscience,” Hotez said.Typically, the ACIP releases recommendations on vaccines for the CDC to adopt.“The FDA has sort of taken over that position in many ways, by becoming both a licensing and recommending body at the same time,” Offit observed.Last week, Kennedy announced on X that Covid vaccines would be limited to those with health conditions that make them more vulnerable to severe illness. He also revoked the emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s Covid vaccine for children under the age of five.As the ACIP has not yet convened to make recommendations on the new Covid boosters, some states are waiting to roll out the updated shots, even as Covid casescontinue increasingthroughout the US.Sixteen states prohibit pharmacists from administering shots that have not been recommended by the ACIP.“That’s the law for them,” Offit said. “The pharmacists will only give ACIP-recommended vaccines, and we haven’t heard from them yet.”He believes the ACIP was targeted in part because the committee’s recommendations form the basis of vaccine mandates for school attendance.“I think that’s part of it, I do. Because I think the goal is to make it so that vaccines aren’t mandated any more, period. And the way to do that is to do what they did with Covid vaccine – just make it shared clinical decision-making. And I think they’d like to do that for every vaccine,” Offit said.Although Kennedy pledged not to take away vaccines, he already has, Offit said. In May, Kennedy said the Covid vaccines were no longer recommended for pregnant people, making it much more difficult for pregnant people to access the shots.But because the VRBPAC plays a different role, Offit believes its fate may be different from the ACIP.Marty Makary, the head of the FDA, was “trying to protect” VRBPAC, Offit said.And as long as experienced members remain on the committee, “unlike the ACIP, you’re still going to be getting great advice from the FDA vaccine advisory committee”, he said.Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationUS politicsUS healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

It has nearly doubled in value since early 2023. The rally comes as the US dollar has weakened and some central banks add to their gold holdings, ditching US government bonds, known as US treasuries.At the same time, long-term borrowing costsrose to multi-year highs in the UK, France and Germany.Pressure rises on Reeves as government borrowing costs hit 27-year highRead moreUK 30-year government bond yields hit a 27-year peak on Tuesday, intensifying pressure on Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, before her autumn budget. Yields measure the interest rate an investor receives for holding a bond, and rise when the price of a bond falls.The pound fell by 1.2% against the dollar to $1.338, putting it on track for the biggest daily fall since 7 April, in the market mayhem afterDonald Trump announced new tariffsagainst US trading partners.The UK stock market declined along with indices across Europe, and Wall Street joined the sell-off when US markets reopened after Labor Day. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies had fallen by 64 points – or 0.7% – to 9,131 points on Tuesday afternoon, receding from the record intraday high of 9,357 points set last month.France’s 30-year government bond yields jumped to their highest levels in more than 16 years on Tuesday, as investors rushed to sell French debt. Germany’s 30-year government bond yield has risen to a 14-year peak, in line with higher US treasury yields, while Italy’s 30-year yield reached its highest level since April.Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said heightened political and geopolitical risks underline the appeal of gold, which tends to benefit from uncertainty. He predicted gold could reach $3,700 an ounce by next June, but did not rule out a rise to $4,000 an ounce if geopolitical or economic conditions deteriorate.The dollar clawed back some ground, rising by 0.5% against a basket of leading currencies, after hitting a five-week low on Monday, before US traders return from the Labor Day holiday.The US currency has been under selling pressure as expectations of an interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s September meeting have increased, with markets seeing a 90% probability of a quarter-point reduction. There is also growing alarm over the US central bank’s independence, with Donald Trump’s repeated criticism of Fed chair Jerome Powell andhis moves to sack Fed governor Lisa Cook.“September has always been a cruel month for markets, but this one carries more than seasonality,” said Stephen Innes, a managing partner at SPI Asset Management. “It carries the question of whether the Fed bends or breaks.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Central banks’ gold allocations even surpassed their US treasury holdings this year.”Indian pension funds are seeking approval to invest in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), hinting at strong demand despite the record price, she said.Silver has also risen, hitting its highest level since 2011. “Both metals have further room to run,” Ozkardeskaya said. “Yet, with the gold-silver ratio still above its long-term range of 60-80, silver may have greater upside potential.”Explore more on these topicsGoldCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Her role is effective immediately.“Fashion and media are both evolving at breakneck speed, and I am so thrilled, and awed, to be part of that,” said Malle in a statement. “I also feel incredibly fortunate to still have Anna just down the hall as my mentor.”One of the most powerful roles in the fashion industry, her appointment marks not just a new chapter for the magazine but for Wintour herself, who will stay on in her role as chief content officer for Condé Nast and global editorial director for the magazine, allowing her to retain control of the magazine, while no longer being involved in the day to day. Wintour was present at the July couture shows and it’s likely that both she and Malle will be present for next week’s New York fashion week, oversee the Met Gala andVogueWorld events. But in a first for the most famous magazine in the world, Vogue no longer has an editor-in-chief.“At a moment of change both within fashion and outside it, Vogue must continue to be both the standard-bearer and the boundary-pushing leader,” said Wintour. “Chloe has proven often that she can find the balance between American Vogue’s long, singular history and its future on the front lines of the new. I am so excited to continue working with her, as her mentor but also as her student, while she leads us and our audiences where we’ve never been before.”Malle was editor of Vogue.com and co-host of the podcast The Run-Through with Vogue, and is a longtime Wintour insider, having been at the magazine since 2011. Responsible for editor-led newsletters, and successful annual “witty” tentpoles such as Dogue (a dog fashion magazine), she is more of a broad stroke journalist than a fashion insider. In 2014, she told Into the Gloss that she was “hesitant when I was interviewing, because fashion is not one of my main interests in life, and I wanted to be a writer more than an editor, but I was so seduced by the Vogue machine that I couldn’t resist”.Still, a frontrunner since Wintour’s announcement, Malle’s appointment will come as no surprise to anyone tracking Condé Nast’s revolving door. The former editor-in-chief is known for rewarding close deputies with international roles – Mark Guiducci, Wintour’s Vogue’s creative editorial director, was recently helicoptered into the top job at Vanity Fair.The gig was arguably up once Malle covered the high stakes and much-discussed Jeff Bezos-Lauren Sanchez wedding in Venice earlier this year. Given access to the bride before the ceremony and tasked with gathering additional details in the run-up to the wedding, the cover story followed her 2023 interview with the couple, and both are seen as proof of her mettle when juggling high profile celebrities with consumer interest.A graduate of Brown University, Malle grew up in Los Angeles and began her career writing about property for the New York Observer. She has since written for the New York Times, Marie Claire, the Wall Street Journal and Architectural Digest. She joined Vogue in the features department 15 years ago, and has worked across various sections and platforms at the title.Malle is also the daughter of American actor Candice Bergen, known for her wry humour and icy Nordic characters both on and off the stage, and the late film director Louis Malle, who lived in France because he “didn’t like living or working in Hollywood”, according to a 2015 interview with Bergen inDallas News.In another curious play between life and art, Bergen had a long-running cameo as the lovelorn editor of US Vogue in Sex and the City. Malle is also one of the few names to have had her birth reported on by People magazine.It’s been almost two months since Condé Nast first advertised the job on LinkedIn, but that hasn’t stopped the list of possible successors to jumping from pillar to post. According to insiders, Wintour told interview candidates that she was after a journalist who was able to oversee live content while travelling and mentoring regional editors abroad.Among the names mooted for the plum role by William Hill bookies were the Duchess of Sussex, Kim Kardashian and Victoria Beckham. More sensible names included Malle’s British counterpart, Chioma Nnadi, the Financial Times’s HTSI editor, Jo Ellison, and – in a plot ripped straight from The Devil Wears Prada – even a man. Will Welch, the 45-year-old editor of GQ, who is credited with turning the men’s magazine from a general interest man’s publication into one focused on fashion and style, was in the top 10 favourites.While Wintour’s team have been in pains to confirm that is she not stepping back, rather up, speculation surrounding her retirement have been a hot topic at a time of intense upheaval for the industry, which is grappling with declining sales. Wintour has kept a steady monthly circulation of over 1m over the last decade, while overseeing a global “digital-first” strategy that has seen content shared between global editions. It’s thought the mass restructuring sparked internal upset over the loss of editorial autonomy between each magazine.Malle is well-liked both inside and outside the industry, and in hiring from within the company, Wintour will still be able to shape the magazine she will one day leave behind when she does finally exit the company. Condé Nast have insisted that nothing is really going to change. But for the most prominent glossy magazine on the shelf, Malle’s hire and Wintour’s move marks an end to a very particular era for glossy magazines.Explore more on these topicsVogueCondé NastMagazinesUS press and publishingConsumer magazinesNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Kraft Heinz is looking for a chief executive for this new business.The other, now known as North American Grocery Co and led by the Kraft Heinz chief executive, Carlos Abrams-Rivera, will concentrate on grocery staples such as Oscar Mayer meats, Lunchables boxed meals and Kraft Singles processed cheese, and will have annual sales of more than $10bn.Miguel Patricio, the executive chair of Kraft Heinz, said: “Kraft Heinz’s brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritise initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas.”Heinz was founded by by Henry J Heinz in Pittsburgh in 1869 to specialise in sauces and condiments. Kraft grew out of a wholesale cheese delivery business set up in Chicago by James L Kraft in 1903. Three years before the merger, Kraft span off its snack division, which was renamed Mondelez International.Buffett later admitted that he had been“wrong in a couple of ways on Kraft Heinz”, saying he had “overpaid for Kraft”.The breakup is expected to be completed in the second half of next year. It comes after other big US companies broke themselves up this decade, including Kellogg Company, Warner Bros Discovery, Honeywell and General Electric.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their presence inside Taiwan’s EEZ have not been previously reported.China’s maritime militia: the shadowy armada whose existence Beijing rarely acknowledgesRead moreExperts said the activity fit the pattern ofBeijing’s “greyzone”strategies for seizing disputed territory. Beijing claims the entirety of the South China Sea, despite The Hague ruling the claim unlawful in 2016. Beijing also claims Taiwan is a province of China, and in preparation to forcibly annexe it has ramped up a campaign of “salami slicing” Taiwan’s territory,forcibly shrinkingthe space that Taipei can control and defend.“China’s greyzone aggression routinely leverages commercial activity for expansionist goals,” said Ray Powell, director of SeaLight, a maritime transparency project at Stanford University.The presence of Chinese vessels and structures in the EEZwas first identified in research published on Tuesdayby US thinktank the Jamestown Foundation, which said they were owned by the state-run China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).However, there is no sign of the Taiwan government having responded to it, despite frequently enforcing its EEZ elsewhere.The apparent lack of response has surprised analysts. “Failure to protest today risks normalising sovereignty shaving and encourages further encroachment,” the Jamestown report warned.The assets are large – including at least one vessel measuring more than 240m long with decks equivalent to 1.5 football fields, and two of the largest wellhead platforms in Asia. The report found some had been there for at least five years, with one coming within a kilometre of the Pratas restricted-waters border in 2024.The Guardian has independently located most of the assets using civilian maritime tracking websites.View image in fullscreenAt least 12 Chinese owned oil and gas exploration structures have been detected inside Taiwan’s exclusive economic zone, including this permanent deep water drilling platform, believed to be one of the biggest in Asia, captured by radar imagery in August 2025.Photograph: UmbraChallenging the oil and gas activity in Taiwan’s EEZ would be difficult. Taiwan’s political status meant it is not party to the UN convention on the law of the sea (Unclos) or its arbitration mechanisms. Domestic law about which parts of the EEZ border Taiwan enforces is unclear and it does not have the maritime strength to challenge such activity.“My guess is that Taipei lacked capabilities to respond, and that explains why they didn’t,” said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific program at the US-based German Marshall Fund.“Perhaps they underestimated how extensive it would be.”CNOOC describes itself as “one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the world”. It engages in numerous joint ventures with foreign firms, including with Taiwan’s CPC, although Taiwan’s ministry said there are currently no active contracts.But as a state-owned firm, it also works in the interests of Beijing’s political ambitions. In 2012, CNOOC’s chair, Wang Yilin, said in a speech: “Large-scale deep-water rigs are our mobile national territory and a strategic weapon,” according to the Wall Street Journal.CNOOC was approached for comment.Prof Zhu Feng, from the Tsinghua University’s centre for international security and strategy, said China’s oil and gas exploration was “primarily driven by its current energy needs” and was not intended to further escalate territorial disputes.“Rather it reflects China’s strong stance in safeguarding its claimed rights and interests in the region,” Zhu told the Guardian.Such activity has previously drawn the ire of other governments.This week Japan’s government accused Beijing of positioning 21 drilling rigs inside the Japanese EEZ, in an alleged “unilateral” effort to develop gas fields in disputed waters of the East China Sea and potentially extract gas from the Japanese side.The Jamestown report warned that structures like the jackets also had potential for dual use by China’s military, and “could facilitate a full range of coercion, blockade, bombardment and/or invasion scenarios against Pratas or Taiwan more generally”.In the five years since these assets were first moved into the EEZ, Beijing has ramped up a campaign to weaken Taiwan’s control over its territorial space, with military drills and incursions, and coast guard patrols in the restricted watersaround Taiwan’s offshore islands.“China has been steadily overwhelming Taiwan’s defences with aggressions much nearer their shores, which may make this something they’d simply rather not have to deal with,” Powell said.“Often governments don’t publicly respond to aggressions if they think making such complaints would beg the question of what else they can do about it.”The Guardian contacted Taiwan’s national security council for comment. It also contacted the ministry of economic affairs, which referred most questions to Taiwan’s ocean affairs council. The council declined to comment. Taiwan’s coast guard said it “maintains continuous monitoring of maritime targets within its surveillance area” but that oil drilling exploration and cooperations were outside its remit.China’s ministry of foreign affairs did not respond to a faxed request for comment.Additional research by Lillian Yang and Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaTaiwanOilAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The executive, who has not commented publicly on the allegations, reportedly offered to resign after returning from an overseas trip on Monday.Media reports said police had searched his luxury apartment in Tokyo last month, adding that a urine sample had been taken. No illegal substances were found, they said.The broadcaster Nippon TV, citing unnamed sources, said Niinami was suspected of importing products containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, from the US. While CBD products are legal in Japan, they must be free of THC. Possession of cannabis can be punishable by up to seven years in prison.Niinami, who has denied any wrongdoing, told the company he had bought the supplements in the belief that they were legal, Suntory’s president, Nobuhiro Torii, said on Tuesday.“The entire company will work together to regain trust,” Torii said. Suntory had concluded that Niinami’s actions “inevitably fall short of the qualities required” of a chief executive, he said, adding that executives felt there was no need to wait until the end of the police investigation before accepting his resignation.View image in fullscreenSuntory president Nobuhiro Torii and vice-president Kenji Yamada bow during a press conference announcing the resignation of Niinami.Photograph: APNiinami’s departure will raise questions over the future of his strategy, launched when he became chief executive more than a decade ago, to raise Suntory’s global profile to address slowing consumption at home and counter intense international competition.As chair of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, the country’s second-biggest business lobby group, the Harvard-educated executive has used his regular media appearances to criticise traditional business practices. Internationally, he was seen as an antidote to Japan’s risk-averse corporate culture.He is also a member of prime minister Shigeru Ishiba’s Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 31-year-old American swept into the last four of the US Open on Tuesday with a 6-3, 6-3 dismissal of Barbora Krejcikova, becoming the first woman to reach back-to-back semi-finals here without dropping a set since Serena Williams strung together four straight runs between 2011 and 2014.It was a performance of cool authority, built less on fireworks than on persistence and precision. She needed only 86 minutes to subdue her opponent, whose serve collapsed under pressure with seven double faults and a first-serve percentage barely above 40%. Where Krejcikova unravelled, Pegula stayed the course, drawing energy from a nearly full Arthur Ashe Stadium that sensed they were watching a home contender gather momentum.“I started really hot and kind of was able to keep the momentum … making her move a lot and just kind of pressuring her serve as well,” she said. “I did a good job of playing the score really well, recognizing those moments, the momentum shifts.”The match began with Krejcikova missing an overhead and donating her first double fault to drop serve at love. Pegula extended her lead to 4-2 but stumbled when she missed too many first serves, allowing Krejcikova to break back. The reprieve was fleeting. Another double fault from the Czech in the following game opened the door and Pegula kicked it down, breaking immediately and consolidating to pocket the opening set in 38 minutes. Time and again Krejcikova’s erratic toss left her scrambling, while Pegula punished the second delivery with crisp, flat returns.View image in fullscreenBarbora Krejcikova collapsed under pressure from Jessica Pegula.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APThe Czech’s troubles redoubled in the second set. She was broken at love to open, mixing in consecutive double faults, as Pegula stamped her authority once more. The fourth seed was not flawless – she double-faulted twice in a single game at 2-1 and faced a break point – but she steadied herself with a searing backhand passing winner before holding for 3-1.When Krejcikova sprayed a forehand wide in the next game to drop serve again, Pegula had the insurance break she needed. Though she briefly relinquished one of them, the American’s control was never in real doubt. Serving for the match at 5-3, she closed it out on her second match point when Krejcikova’s forehand sailed past the baseline.The contrast with her summer form was striking. Pegula had suffered early exits in Montreal and Cincinnati after a first-round setback at Wimbledon, cutting short one practice session in New York the week before the tournament and leaving the grounds in frustration. “Wimbledon wasn’t great,” she said. “I was playing good tennis and it just did not translate at all for that first round … I was trying a different string. I was doing, I think, too much.” The solution was to strip things back. “After Cincinnati, our goal was just to get back on track and simplify things … to get me back playing my game, and I feel like we’ve been able to do that.”View image in fullscreenJessica Pegula looks to the crowd on Arthur Ashe Stadium after her win.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesShe later credited a reset – “I went and did an escape room with my friends and had two drinks” – for helping shed the tension. The shift shows now. “This week I’ve really just tried to get back to competing and enjoying competing,” she said. “It’s not fun to go out there and stress yourself out … I think I always catch myself just in time.”Long defined by her major quarter-final frustrations – she came up short in her first six appearances at that stage – Pegula has now reached consecutive semi-finals in New York, proof that last year’s breakthrough was no outlier. “To even make the second week, then quarters, semis, is a huge accomplishment,” she said. “This was my biggest accomplishment last year … now I can say I’ve done it twice.”The 29-year-old Krejcikova, ranked No 62 but a perennial danger, departs with credit after a run that included a three-set win over Emma Navarro and an extraordinary escape against Taylor Townsend, where she saved eight match points. But those exertions caught up with her. She had spent more than eight hours on court before Tuesday and lacked the legs to sustain rallies against Pegula’s metronomic efficiency. For a player who has lifted major championships at Roland Garros and Wimbledon – in addition to 10 doubles titles – it was a reminder that pedigree alone cannot paper over a failing serve.Quick GuideDraper out of Davis Cup tie against PolandShowJack Draper will miss Great Britain's Davis Cup tie against Poland next weekend through injury.The world No 5 pulled out of the US Open ahead of his scheduled second-round match because of a flare-up of the bone bruising in his left arm that had kept him sidelined since Wimbledon.The Davis Cup World Group match in Gdynia on 12-13 September comes too soon for Draper, with questions marks over when he will be able to return.Davis Cup captain Leon Smith said: \"It goes without saying that obviously it's a real shame that we can't call upon Jack Draper to be in the team with his injury and of course we wish him the best with his recovery and for the rest of the season.\"In Draper's absence, Cameron Norrie will lead Britain's team alongside Jacob Fearnley, while there are three debutants named in Wimbledon doubles champions Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool plus Arthur Fery.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Pegula, by contrast, is finding her stride in what is shaping into one of her finest seasons. She has already claimed three titles across three surfaces, joining Aryna Sabalenka as the only players to do so, and her 38 victories this year place her alongside Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina as the tour’s most prolific winners. The statistics and the poise suggest she is ready to test herself once more at the business end of a major.Next Pegula will face the world No 1 Sabalenka after Marketa Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, withdrew before the quarter-final due to a knee injury.There’s history to process against Sabalenka. “It would be cool to be able to get revenge,” Pegula admitted, reflecting onlast year’s final. “This year I’ve come back with a different perspective … enjoy the crowd a little bit more and enjoy the fact that I’m in this position again to possibly be in another final and I’m playing the best player in the world.”Above all, she’s leaning into experience. “I’m pretty confident with who I am, and I think I’ll always back myself and figure things out in the end,” Pegula said. “I can tap into a lot of the experience that I have … and I’m just happy I’ve been able to work my way to this point, considering where I was a few weeks ago.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

His first game exposed flaws that will be very difficult to fixOliver ConnollyTue 2 Sep 2025 07.47 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 12.18 EDTShareHalf a century of unprecedented success, six Super Bowl rings as a head coach, the NFL’s greatest defensive mind; all undone by 19-year-olds sprinting past missed tackles. Bill Belichick arrived at North Carolina promising to bend college football to his will, to build the “33rd NFL Program” in Chapel Hill, and prove he still had his fastball. College football laughed.As debut flops go,North Carolina’s 48-14 beatdownat the hands of TCU is as bad as it gets. Belichick’s side didn’t just lose; they were humiliated. UNC looked unprepared, undisciplined and were overmatched against a veteran team.This was supposed to be Belichick’s coronation. That the greatest coach in modern NFL historyhad deigned to grace the college gametriggered Belichick Fever. Michael Jordan, Lawrence Taylor and Mia Hamm patrolled the Carolina sideline on Monday night. ESPN sent its A-Team and treated the opener like a stand-in for Monday Night Football. Kenan Stadium had been sold out for months. UNC invested in new suites for the big-dollar donor who forked out over $10m to land the greatest to ever do it. By half-time, His Airness had left the building. So had half the stadium.For a moment, there was promise. The Tar Heels struck first, putting together a seven-play, 83-yard touchdown drive. Then everything collapsed. TCU settled down and scored 41 unanswered points as Belichick’s team dissolved and the coach stood stoically on the sideline.From the beginning, Belichick looked out of place amid college football’s pageantry. This is a sport of goofy traditions, rabid student sections and grown men putting their mortgages in the hands of teenagers. Even Nick Saban, chief curmudgeon, would bow down to college football and its lunacy, flashing a smile during pre-game interviews, knowing that every moment on camera was a chance to pull in another recruit. Belichick, standing in his vintage cut-off hoodie, was unwilling to play the game, sticking to the say-nothing persona that characterized his time in the pros.Bill Belichick is in regular season form during his pregame interview with Holly Rowepic.twitter.com/FnnRBQJ5lX— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing)September 1, 2025Maybe he had nothing to say. Maybe Belichick knew, with this roster, a humiliation was on the way.And make no mistake: this was a humbling loss. In 511NFLgames, Belichick’s defenses never conceded 48 points. It took just one game in college for his defense to fall apart. He was spared the indignity of conceding 50 points thanks only to TCU kneeling the ball on a goal-to-go situation rather than running up the score.This is how college goes. There is no warmup, preseason, exhibition games or long training camp. It’s straight to primetime, and Belichick and his roster were not ready for the lights.Bill Belichick’s relationship with Jordon Hudson is one narrative he can’t controlRead more“They just outplayed us, they outcoached us and they were better than we were. That’s all there is to it,” Belichick said after the game. “They did a lot more things right than we did. Give them credit for being the better team.”Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. North Carolina turned the ball over three times. They gave up 542 total yards. They missed more tackles than the stat trackers could count in real-time. They couldn’t run the ball, convert on third downs, or hold TCU’s explosive offense at bay. Kirk Herbstreit had toshoehorn his dog on to the broadcastto keep America engaged.“We all felt a little disrespect coming in,” TCU head coach Sonny Dykes said. “There was a lot of conversation, and none of it was about us.” Dykes’s team spent four hours taking it out on Belichick.The signs of what was to come were there pre-game. Belichick refused to put out a depth chart, leaving even ESPN scrambling to figure out who was playing. It felt pure Belichick: guarding personnel moves like the KGB, revealing nothing, trying to pinch an advantage. Instead, after a handful of drives, it felt like a move to hide the obvious: his team lack talent.The gap between TCU and UNC was jarring. UNC didn’t just look undermanned; they looked like one of the least talented squads in the Power Four – the elite conferences of college football – particularly along the line of scrimmage. They couldn’t stymie TCU’s run game or generate any push up front on offense, averaging a lowly two yards a carry.That falls on Belichick. This is a team of his creation, built in his image. He didn’t inherit a downtrodden program but rather a school that had stagnated. Belichick, along with Mike Lombardi, Belichick’s close confidante, a former NFL GM and the new personnel czar at North Carolina, oversaw an unparalleled overhaul this offseason, bringing in 70 new players. That’s more than an NFL franchise can turn over in three years, crammed into a single summer.Roster construction was supposed to be one of Belichick’s strengths. He would chuck his Super Bowl rings on the table, promise recruits he would get them ready for the pros and the nation’s best would flock to Chapel Hill. Monday was a painful reminder that,despite the advent of NIL, college football is a different world from the NFL.In the NFL, parity is legislated. No matter how barren your roster, there’s always a path to recovery baked into the rules. In college, there is no salary cap or draft. Free agency is year-round. You cannot plug roster holes during the season or swing a meaningful trade. Want to upgrade your roster? You have to recruit players. That means decades-long relationships with high school coaches, building a pipeline,dancing on TikTokwith 17-year-olds and having the funds to get the deal over the line while other schools circle.One game will not define Belichick’s college career. But the manner of defeat should set off all the alarm bells. Belichick has always been the ultimate problem solver. But at 73, in a sport where problems begin in living rooms and on high school fields, he’s still figuring out what the issues are.“We just keep working and keep grinding away,” Belichick said. “We’re better than what we were tonight, but we have to go out and prove it. Nobody’s going to do it for us.”Forwhatever reason Belichick took the UNC job– money, ego, thumbing his nose at the NFL,setting his sons up with jobs– Monday provided him a chance to erase the memories of his final few, unsuccessful years in New England. But it was such a debacle that you could only feel schadenfreude or sadness.Is this really what you want to be doing in your 70s? Why not go sit on your boat in Nantucket?“Big moments are won by winning all the small moments that come before them,” Belichick wrote in his recent book.In the run-up to his debut, the small moments have been enveloped in chaos. For a man obsessed with control, Belichick’s time in college has been defined by turmoil. There has been the roster churn, the strange CBS Morning interview, a media firestorm about hisromance with the much younger Jordon Hudson, reports that Hudson was banned from UNC’s facilities, theHard Knocks debacle, and worries from the school faculty and program boosters about hislevel of engagement.Sure, digging into Belichick’s private life felt like a TMZ-ification of the sport. But Monday showed why the off-field drama mattered. It was indicative of a coach who had lost his way. Belichick spent more than two decades as an NFL head coach preaching about distractions, and then spent the first six months at UNC dragging his program into the tabloids. His time in college has been about everything except his football team. On Monday, we found out why.“It’s a little like the Deion [Sanders] thing at Colorado,” ACC commissioner Jim Phillips said at the conference’s media day. “He grabs your attention. It’s made for television.”There are a lot ofJon Sumralls out there. That’s not to dismiss Sumrall’s skills or the insta-rebuild job he has done at Tulane. Sumrall has done fantastically in college, in part because he has prepared for it – the bounty of an adult life spent grinding through college football’s lower ranks, scouting high schoolers, recruiting, clapping the marching band, shaking hands with school booster, working with his school president, the wider faculty and surrounding himself with people who model the stamina and skills needed to succeed in college football.There are plenty of those coaches, and they cost considerably less than the $10m a year that Belichick earns. But none of those coaches is Bill Belichick. With Belichick, UNC looked past college lifers and chased the starry name; the big fish could boost interest for a program that has stagnated. They wanted some ofthe Deion Sanders Effect.Plenty of schools will chase the Deion sugar high (don’t check Colorado’s record this season), but will ignore a pivotal point: there is only one Deion. Sanders worked his way up the college ranks, starting as a high school coach, then moving up to college before he jumped to a Power Four school. Sanders also brought with himthe best player in the countryand an NFL-caliber quarterback. Belichick did not rock up at UNC with Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders. He’s a 73-year-old coach overseeing a multi-year rebuild – time is not on his side.It’s not going to get easier this year. North Carolina were supposed to have a favorable schedule this year. But based on Monday, they will be one of the weaker teams in their conference. Clemson and Cal will inflict serious punishment, while Wake Forest, Duke and NC State will now be firm favorites to beat them.Belichick’swinning trait in the NFL was his adaptability. Season-to-season, opponent-to-opponent, he would shapeshift to fit what was needed. He had the vision to see what would work, and the expertise to install and run it. In the pros, with the game’s best talent, that worked. Adapting that to the college game, with a left tackle sprinting between football practice and calculus, is an enormous task.Belichick’s move to college, right as the sport moved closer to the professional ranks, was full of intrigue. Could the greatest coach in the modern history of the NFL turn a college program bursting with potential into a powerhouse in the twilight of his career? After one game, UNC’s gambit looks like a disaster. After Monday, the bar for Belichick’s first season has been set spectacularly low: win four games and keep his job.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsNFLfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The six-figure gamble pays $507,000 if Sinner captures his fifth major championship and second at the US Open.‘Not like us’: Argentina take shot at Drake after rapper loses $300,000 bet against themRead moreThe so-calledDrakeCurse has been blamed for several losses over the past few years, including $210,000 on American Taylor Fritz to beat Sinner in the 2024 US Open final. According to a website tracking Drake’s announced bets and the curse, he is down $115,000 on tennis after cutting his losses by successfully picking Sinner to win the Australian Open final in January.Drake’s wagering history isn’t limited to tennis.

The US international, sitting relaxed on the 3G pitch at Chelsea’s Cobham training ground, bits of the rubber crumb being squeezed between her fingers, does not hesitate before answering.“We feel like we have another level we can get to,” she says. “It’s not about how we maintain this level but how we continue evolving and keep getting better. Having that mentality is always better than focusing on making sure no one catches us.Women’s Super League 2025-26 previews No 4: ChelseaRead more“If you ask any one of us, we feel like last year we could have played better, we could have had better performances so continuing to evolve as a team and continuing to get better is what we’re going to prioritise.”Chelsea did not only win the league, they went through the wholedomestic campaign unbeaten and won the FA Cup and League Cuptoo. True they did not have the best of performances at times, but they still won, and won, and won, powered by a mentality not dissimilar to that seen in the US women’s national team. “That’s what I was gonna say,” says Girma when that is put to her. “That’s my favourite type of way to be, to play: never say die, ’til the final minute keep pushing, never give up.“That is the mentality I have been raised with and try to bring to a team. So, whenever you’re around a group that believes that and is trying to put that into every single game, every single session, that just brings out the best in you and the group. It’s one of my favourite parts of this club.”View image in fullscreenNaomi Girma and compatriot Catarina Macario pose with Chelsea’s 2024-25 trophy haul.Photograph: Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesGirma arrived from San Diego Wave in January with a record-breaking price tag and a stellar reputation that set expectations high. In the middle of the NWSL off-season, her final league match played in October 2024, hitting the ground running was always going to be tough. “It’s definitely awkward timing, coming in in the off-season,” she says.“No one will ever expect more from me than I do for myself. All of those expectations from other people were there, but I wanted myself to come in and make an impact as much as I can, more than anyone else. I got injured, that’s soccer, and it was about having perspective. I didn’t come here to play for six months, I’m here for four years now so, while it’s hard in the moment, this was a long-term decision and a place where I see myself playing and getting better for a while.”Leaving California, where she was born, grew up, studied and played, for Chelsea, felt right. “The decision to try something new and leave was just me wanting to challenge myself, to push myself out of my comfort zone,” says the 25-year-old defender. “It felt like the right time in my career to take that jump, post-Olympics felt like a good time to transfer and get settled somewhere new, and then Chelsea specifically just always stood out to me as a club.”Two US internationals at Chelsea, Mia Fishel – now at Seattle Reign – and Cat Macario, helped sell the club to Girma. “I obviously knew so many of the players who play here,” says Girma. “Some I knew personally, some I just had played against, and just the culture, the environment, being in London, it all just felt right to me, so that’s why I chose to come.”There were pros and cons to arriving in January, on the one hand you enter midway through a campaign, but on the other hand it provides a distraction. “Moving is always difficult,” says Girma. “It’s always going to be a step out of your comfort zone, but coming in in January you’re kind of thrown into things right away and you just have to figure everything out immediately. You don’t have time to think about it.“You’re just like: I’m here. We have games. I need to be ready. Now, I have a full off-season too and getting to build through pre-season has been really nice. I already know the staff and the players going into a pre-season and it feels like you know, I’ve been on the team for a while. So, there’s advantages.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s great if I’m doing it but the more players we have the better, so hopefully working towards hubs throughout the US will mean getting to work with more players,” she says.TV viewing figures for the NWSL are down: is there cause for concern?Read moreBack in the present, at Chelsea, on the pitch it didn’t take long for things to flow and relationships to feel normal. “I actually felt comfortable pretty quickly playing with them,” says Girma. “I feel like towards the end of last season it felt normal. That’s a testament to them, the communication style and the way we kind of mesh together.”Working with a manager, in Sonia Bompastor, who played in defence herself is a bonus. “I really wanted to develop as a player where I was moving to. To have a manager who played in defence always helps in terms of working on the littlest of things and tweaking certain things that just make us that little percentage better.”The rest of the WSL – and Europe – have been warned.Explore more on these topicsChelsea WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The four-time Tour de France winner also sustained a pericardial rupture, a tear to the sac that surrounds the heart, in the crash.“It was obviously a lot more serious than some broken bones,” his wife, Michelle Froome,told the Times. “He’s fine, but it’s going to be a long recovery process. He won’t be riding a bike for a while.”Jay Vine takes Vuelta stage nine as Juan Ayuso attacks UAE team ‘dictatorship’Read moreFroome was airlifted to the Sainte‑Anne military hospital, in the Var, the highest‑level trauma centre in that part of France. His team, Israel-Premier Tech, had stated initially that the 40-year-old had sustained a collapsed lung, five broken ribs and a lumbar vertebrae fracture.Last spring, Froome was reluctant to speculate on his retirement date. “I haven’t 100% decided that I’ll be retiring at the end of this year,” he said. “Chances are, yes, I’ll be calling it a day, but I’m just keeping the door open.”However, the gravity of the injuries he suffered in the crash has now increased speculation that he may soon announce his retirement from racing.Meanwhile, the Dutch sprinter Olav Kooij, teammate of Jonas Vingegaard at Visma-Lease a Bike, overhauled Norway’s Tord Gudmestad to win the opening stage of the 2025 men’sTour of Britainin Southwold.View image in fullscreenOlav Kooij (left) edges out Tord Gudmestad on the line in Southwold.Photograph: Stephen Pond/Getty ImagesKooij, who took four stage wins in the 2023 edition of the race, picked up where he left off on the Suffolk coast, but only after overhauling a violent acceleration from the Decathlon‑AG2R La Mondiale rider.“It was a lot of headwind after the last corner and a little rise as well,” Kooij said. “It was a bit of a waiting game, to make the last push in the final few metres. Gudmestad was really strong, but he was pushing into the wind and I had some slipstream from him. I had enough in the legs to get past him.”Kooij has already set his sights on adding to his British win tally. “I don’t think I’ll beat getting four wins like I did a few years ago,” he said.Geraint Thomas, riding his final professional race, almost missed the start to his own farewell party after his flight to Stansted airport, late on Monday evening, was delayed.“I wasn’t sure if I was going to get here yesterday, with the flights and stuff,” he said before the stage. “Flights were being cancelled all over the place.”In the end, Thomas arrived at his race hotel in the early hours of the morning and got only a few hours sleep.“The main thing is enjoying it, really making the most of it. I’m not really in the shape to win myself, but we’ve got some good guys here to perform,” he said of his Ineos Grenadiers team. The 39-year-old finished 25sec behind the leaders on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsCyclingChris FroomeTour of BritainnewsShareReuse this content"

Eberechi Eze.Randal Kolo Muani. We’re hearing that Coventry has fallen. In the bottom corner of the screen a picture of Marc Guéhi would flash up now and then reproachfully, Guéhi wearing a strange, lost smile as though he has in fact died. And below it all the countdown clock replaced with the simple end‑of‑days message: WINDOW CLOSED.‘Forever grateful’: Isak makes belated attempt to rebuild bridges at NewcastleRead moreBut the man behind the desk was also right. Name a more sensational window. Or at least a more all-encompassing window, a sustained emotional, strategic, plot-driven entertainment product, all wrapped up in a single epic three-month tracking shot. So much so that the fact we now have to play an actual football season feels like being told you’ve got to go for a walk on Christmas morning after opening all your presents by 8.30am, already crashing through the floor on chocolate orange segments.We must recite the numbers now, because the Premier League’s numbers are, as ever, boom‑time numbers. A record £3.1bn spent! A record £1.4bn trading loss! The Premier League’s top five spent more, gross, on players than all the big five leagues combined. Reeling this off is like striding the floor of some wild early noughties boiler room trading room. Ring the bell. Unleash the cocaine leopards. Cue the champagne-spraying montage, the rueful voiceover about FBI investigations.At this point it is also necessary to answer two key questions. First, who won the window? Because the window can and will be won. Goals, pots, balance sheets will tell us this. And second, what does it mean? Is it real? Is this rising balloon territory, all dangling guy ropes and ever-thinning air? Are we in fact heading for the fall? The second of these is easier to answer, because essentially it doesn’t matter. This is all real because the Premier League says it’s real. There has been a sense of collective hysteria around the window, fans, players, owners, the media losing their minds in concert. But this is also a design feature. The Premier League is an entertainment exchange, its income related directly to the level of reach, grab, eyeballs.The excitement is in itself exciting, the conversation a self‑fuelling resource, the endless outraged inventory-taking of player-grabs and commercial wins oddly reminiscent of the online claustrophobia of Covid times. Kneel before my tinned tomato armoury. Behold how much toilet roll I now have.Does hard value actually matter in this environment? The Premier League has once again triumphantly asset-stripped the Bundesliga. Bournemouth are paying bigger wages than most of Serie A. Ligue 1 made a £250m profit in this window, the Premier League a £1.4bn loss and this will always be seen as victory, even if it doesn’t in reality reflect an endless hoarding of superstar talent.For all the money circulating through its books this summer the Premier League clubs signed only two players from last year’s Ballon d’Or top 25, Florian Wirtz and Viktor Gyökeres, and none from the top 10.Hugo Ekitiké, the third biggest transfer feeof the greatest transfer window in history, is a very good player. But he is yet to win a senior France cap. Alexander Isak, jewel of the window, a footballing Helen of Troy, is also, we are repeatedly told, the best centre‑forward in Europe. Is he, though? Europe doesn’t think so. Europe thinks this is Ousmane Dembélé, Kylian Mbappé, Erling Haaland, Harry Kane or even Robert Lewandowski (37 years old, 44 goals last season).View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace’s decision to cancel Marc Guéhi’s move to Liverpool was deadline day’s big story.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesAgain, it doesn’t really matter. What matters is the hard commercial activity. If there is hysteria here, that hysteria is a key tool in the Premier League’s self-fuelling supremacy. For the first time this summer there is sense the window has been properly weaponised as a part of the product, club rivalries, social media dominance, global interest channelled through its endless drama. Anecdotally, the Premier League transfer window has generated greater online reach than either the men’s Club World Cup or the women’s Euros, both of which are actual football competitions.Everyone is dragged into this now, from the new superstar-owner dynamic and the dilution of managerial authority, down to broadcasters and journalists whose reputations now fall or rise on predictions over player sales, something that is particularly odd because often this isn’t really journalism at all; not triple-sourcing or the highlighting of inconvenient facts, but access in return for repeating what you’re told, a channel-for-hire in the negotiating process.In the middle of all this daily subplots and narrative devices have flared up. Tantrum Transfers? Is this a thing now? Not really. We definitely have a lot more public access to tantrums. But hanging on to a player who wants to leave for a record fee seems more novel as behaviours go, something only a bottomlessly wealthy sovereign wealth fund would entertain to this degree.Player power? Is this now the scourge of the game? The boundless arrogance of the modern superstar? Not really, either. Players have always moved, and asked to move, and been duly traded in for other men. Money doesn’t just talk loudest, it’s the only conversation in the end, as it always has been.Which is all very well. But who won the window? The obvious answer is Liverpool, because they signed the most eye-catching players while balancing the books expertly, and also triumphed in the weird arm wrestle with Newcastle’s ownership. Will this translate into footballing success? Have they overstacked some parts of the team? A reassuringly human drama must now play out. Isak hasn’t kicked a ball for four months, and must do so under a bizarrely overheated wall of noise. It will at the very least be fascinating viewing.

Tottenham have recruited well.Xavi Simons could be a great signingwith a fair wind. Newcastle have a balanced team now, and a useful looking sense of shared rage. Fulham and Crystal Palace will be cast as window-losers. Both will probably be OK. Manchester United, who exist in their own self‑contained sphere of quirkiness, who are basically Phoebe in Friends now, havesigned a 23-year-old goalkeeper, which is pretty close to an act of sporting sadism.But in the end it is tempting to conclude the real winners of the greatest window are Chelsea, who haven’t just won the window but the entire summer. Chelsea made£90m from the Club World Cup. They sold more than £300m in unwanted footballers, a sign that having a wheeler-dealer in charge might actually be quite handy when you wheel as well as deal.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze made his Arsenal debut against Liverpool on Sunday after his big money move from Crystal Palace.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesMainly Chelsea won it because they have become the norm now, have turned everyone else into Chelsea, have turned out to have been operating ahead of the curve. It seems financial rules really are there to be disrupted. Win that new US-facing jolly. Sell a building. Sell the women’s team. Employ a manager who will gleefully wield the cleaver. Mainly Chelsea seem to have understood before everyone else one key structural driver behind the summer’s hyper‑commerce, the fact PSR rules are malleable, that the way to make them work for you is to just keep trading, keep shifting money around.And in this respect football is once again telling us things. There is a fascinating parallel to be drawn between the luminous global financial success of the Premier League and the concurrent financial contraction, the social failure of the nation that houses it. Why has one of these things had a 20‑year boom, the other a 20‑year slump? Perhaps the best way to see the football bubble is as a version of the London housing market, which has been about to burst for 30 years now, but which won’t burst because it isn’t really about actual supply and demand or rational economic rules. It is instead a place to rest money, to invest and make profit. Its units, player sales or house sales, are really just a stake to enter the game, exchangeable for other vouchers, a self-funding set of casino chips.Predictions of doom will always swirl. There are vast amounts of outstanding transfer fees in the works, some say more than £3bn in money on tick. What if someone goes bust? What about the domino effect? But money is too big now. It feels self-supporting at this level of income. The Premier League spent £1bn on its own players this window. What does it matter what price it puts on their heads? This is internal circulation, a global-scale sporting economy.There is an echo here of what one of the Premier League’s US owners once said privately about buying major assets in a time of quantitative easing. That money has to go somewhere. Just keep moving it on and nobody actually loses. This may or may not turn out to be voodoo economics, pre‑crash talk while others race towards a cliff. But for now at least we are all Chelsea, all passengers inside that same self-inflating bubble.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowcommentShareReuse this content"

A private jet had also been lined up to take Guéhi to Merseyside that evening. There is no suggestion that he will not play for Palace again, although one source close to Guéhi has said that he is considering whether to continue as captain.In stark comparison to Alexander Isak – who in effect went on strike to force throughhis move to Anfield– the former Chelsea player is said to feel that he acted correctly during all the transfer speculation by continuing to play for Palace. Other members of the squad are also believed to be upset that Guéhi was denied his move.Liverpool could attempt to sign Guéhi again in the January transfer window, although he will also be able to sign a pre-contract agreement for an overseas club. Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus are believed to have expressed an interest.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceLiverpoolTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

It comes after the Dallas Cowboys’ former star receiver Michael Irvin is asked about the White House, the secret mansion where some players would unwind while winning three Super Bowls during the 1990s. “I was the president of the White House,” Irvin says with a cackle, his eyes lighting up. “It was a safe place for camaraderie.”But this, it turns out, was a very different style of team building than going down the pub.“We had five rooms and whatever you liked you were going to mingle with your like,” Irvin says. “In that room you may be smoking weed, in this room they may be doing ecstasy, coke, whatever. There’s a group of girls in each room and you just kind of bounced from room to room.”NFL records that could fall in 2025: a booming kicker, Burrow’s 500 club and bad news for RodgersRead moreAnother player says: “We played hard, then we played hard.” A third confesses to getting locked up “two or three times” and being let loose by cops “maybe 100 times”. Then the Cowboys’ fixer appears, to explain how he would clean things up.At this point two thoughts come to mind. This is a far grittier and, yes, better sports documentary than The Last Dance, the Michael Jordan hagiography that bewitched us during lockdown. In fact, I am not sure I have seen a more complete portrayal of the rise and fall of a sports dynasty, in all its glory and grubbiness. But also: can we have more of this, please?Imagine a Netflix epic on Manchester United that had Sir Alex Ferguson unloading on every topic under the sun, Rio Ferdinand on his missed drugs test, and the Glazers taking you into the heart of their takeover. This is, in essence, theNFLequivalent.Early in the documentary, we see old footage of the former Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson shouting at one of his players after he collapses during a running test. “You’re on the wrong field to have asthma,” Johnson tells him, before promptly cutting him. After a defeat by Washington, Johnson refuses to let his players eat on their flight home. “Jimmy was a complete asshole,” one player says. But this tough love, combined with drafting a team of future superstars, turned the Cowboys into back-to-back Super Bowl winners. But then Johnson left after feuding with Jerry Jones, the Cowboys’ owner and general manager, over who deserved the most credit for the team’s success and the two have been fighting over their legacy almost ever since.That dispute lies at the heart of the Gambler and his Cowboys. But it still finds fresh ways to reopen old wounds. Jones, for instance, reveals for the first time that he had cancer – a stage four melanoma that required multiple surgeries. But rather than dwell on his mortality, he then tells the story of how his doctor told him to make a list of 10 people who made his blood boil and to wish them success while meditating.“Number one, I wrote down the name Jimmy Johnson,” Jones says. “But then I went back to my doctor: ‘I can’t get past that first motherfucker.’”View image in fullscreenJerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, announces the appointment of Jimmy Johnson as coach in 1989.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveWhile the two men reconcile eventually, it is refreshing to hear such honesty, especially as so many sports documentaries are compromised. We all know there is usually a price to pay for access. Questions unasked. Thorny topics skirted over. But in a world where most documentaries feel as airbrushed as a Vogue cover shoot, the Gambler and his Cowboys bucks the trend.So why is that? Why were these people willing to unburden their souls and tell stories we haven’t heard before? Part of that is the skill of the documentary makers. They ask the tough questions. And they are so diligent they even get the prosecutor and judge in the case that led to Irvin being fined $10,000 for cocaine possession to talk about it.Want to know what it is like to be concussed? Well, the Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman explains the sensation better than anyone I have ever heard. At one point he also talks about blood coming from his ear. In another, he admits not remembering playing in an NFC Championship game. “I watched the game the next day and I played well,” he says. That is a skill, too.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Johnson and Jones are 82. They won’t be around for that much longer. The players also come from a time when media training wasn’t designed to strangle their personalities.It was also just a very different era. The Hall of Fame star Charles Haley, for instance, joined Dallas from the San Francisco 49ers after reportedly walking into the 49ers general manager’s office, pulling out his penis, urinating on his desk and said: “This is how bad I want out of here.” Players don’t do things like that any more.View image in fullscreenThe Dallas Cowboys’ coach, Jimmy Johnson, confers with defensive end Charles Haley during the NFC championship game against the San Francisco 49ers in 1994.Photograph: Linda Kaye/APWouldn’t it be great if we were able to watch something as unvarnished and raw about some of the great British teams? The Liverpool side of the 70s and 80s, perhaps, as well as United in the 90s? There is surely a great documentary also on the rise and fall of England’s Rugby World Cup winners, including the horrific concussion stories and the tabloid tales of dwarf-throwing contests?Certainly the Cowboy and his Gamblers lays down the template. Towards the end of it, Irvin talks about being left temporarily paralysed after hitting his neck on the ground and calling his wife from the ambulance to tell her. It leads to him having to retire. Yet he also admits that such was his bond with his teammates that, if Cowboys were still in their prime, he would have risked coming back.“We are all imperfect people,” Irvin says, with a sagacity of someone who has been there and done it all. “And each of us has at least two of us in all of us. That person you show everybody. And that person that you never show anybody.” The trick this documentary pulls off is to reveal those deeper truths.Explore more on these topicsNFLNetflixUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Ultimately that tactic succeeded in forcing the move to Anfield he had long craved but, along the way, a player who scored 27 times for Newcastle last season shredded his reputation there.How will Arne Slot change his Liverpool tactics to get best out of Alexander Isak? | Jonathan WilsonRead moreIn a conciliatory Instagram post that, perhaps tellingly, made no direct mention of Howe, Isak wrote: “I want to express my gratitude to my teammates, the staff and, above all, the city of Newcastle and the amazing supporters for the three unforgettable years we shared together.“Together we have written history and brought the club to the place where it truly belongs. It has been an honour to be part of the journey – from reaching the Champions League to winning the first trophy in over 70 years. Forever grateful. Thank you, Newcastle.”As the 25-year-old forward attempted to burnish his image, Isak’s representative, Vlado Lemic, was anything but on-message in a cryptic barb aimed quite clearly at Newcastle.“It’s nice when you have someone to be with,” the Serb said in a statement offered to Talksport, “but even nicer when you know who you’ll never be with again.” Newcastle blame Lemic for advising Isak to go on strike as he tried to engineer a route to Anfield.Isak was all smiles as he was pictured training with hisSwedenteammates on the outskirts of Stockholm at the start of the international break on Tuesday. He is scheduled to address the Swedish football media alongside his international manager, the former Newcastle striker Jon Dahl Tomasson, later this week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The West Ham forward’s legal team have also made written submissions to the commission and may contest the level of any fine imposed by the commission.Paquetá was cleared of spot-fixing following a two-yearinvestigation by the FAthat cost him an £85m move to Manchester City in August 2023. The 28-year-old continued to play for West Ham throughout the process, and expressed his gratitude to the club by kissing the badge and miming throwing away a mobile phone after scoring last weekend in the3-0 win at Nottingham Forest.Aston Villa made an attempt to sign Paquetá on loan last week, while Tottenham also made a tentative inquiry beforesigning Xavi Simonsfrom RB Leipzig, but neither proposed transfer came close to being finalised with the player happy to stay at the London Stadium.The publication of the independent commission’s full decision is also expected to include a recommendation on which party covers the costs of the case. West Ham were unhappy that Paquetá was charged on the basis of what they regarded as flimsy evidence, but have opted against taking legal action against the FA.After he was cleared of spot fixing, Paquetá said in a statement: “Since the first day of this investigation, I have maintained my innocence against these extremely serious accusations. I can’t say anything more at this time, but I would like to express how grateful I am to God and how eager I am to return to playing football with a smile on my face.“To my wife who never let go of my hand, to West Ham, to the fans who always cheered me on, and to my family, friends and the legal team who have supported me – thank you for everything.”The FA declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedThe FAnewsShareReuse this content"

The Derby midfielder is about to undergo a medical before joining the League One side on a season-long loan and there are questions that need to be answered.It is deadline day and Osborn has left his East Midlands home for the prospect of more regular playing time. He will be one of three arrivals at Edgeley Park before the window closes, the end of half a year of planning for Stockport. It looks like everything has gone smoothly when Osborn eventually signs the relevant paperwork at 6pm in the boardroom at the club’s training ground clad in official merchandise. Relief can be seen on the faces of the recruitment team. Their hard work has paid off.Walking through the training ground door at 10am, the message is loud and clear: “It is manic already.” Everton’s Tyler Onyango and Rochdale’s Corey Edwards have joined on loan. The announcements will come later, but unknowns are the enemy. Stockport have a plan but a bid for one of their key assets will change the course of the day without notice.In the de facto transfer boiler room, located on the first floor, phones do not stop pinging. The head of recruitment, Jonathan Smith, is filtering names from agents and clubs. “It wouldn’t be unusual to have about 150 players offered in a day,” says Smith. “Has he got a British passport?” Smith asks one caller. “I like him but we don’t need someone in that position,” is another response as he runs through candidates. Stockport’s chief executive, Simon Wilson, who was previously the club’s director of football, steps in for updates. There is no fax machine but the coffee machine keeps whirring to power the day, which mercifully finishes four hours earlier than in previous years.View image in fullscreenStockport’s head of recruitment, Jonathan Smith, hits the phones on deadline day.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianMeanwhile, the head of emerging talent, Vinil Joseph, sits in the corner trawling through TransferRoom, a marketplace for players. Clubs list the positions they are looking for and how much they are willing to pay. Behind Joseph is a list of every League One and Two club, detailing business they might want to do. “He could be too lightweight for League One,” someone says. The brief moments of peace are spent analysing the latest deals announced on Sky Sports News.This is the swan kicking its legs. Osborn is the focus, a central midfielder who can also operate as a left-wing back, solving two problems in one. A deadline of 10am is given to Derby to accept Stockport’s offer to cover a certain percentage of his wages. The WhatsApp message arrives 20 minutes later and the wheels are in motion, literally as Osborn drives almost two hours to the Manchester Institute of Health and Performance [MIHP]. Hargan is dispatched to join him, putting on his player liaison hat.Normally three to six months of research and planning goes into each signing Stockport make, but Osborn was a curveball that piqued interest. He was not on the club’s radar but they were made aware that he would fall into budget and was open to dropping down a division. These opportunities do not come along often and after doing their due diligence by reviewing the data that showed Osborn relentless running would fit well into manager Dave Challinor’s style, he was put at the top of the list. Other deals were more straightforward, but this was the one everyone wanted.The state-of-the-art MIHP facility in east Manchester attracts clubs from across the north looking for somewhere to carry out medicals. Seven set up camp there on deadline day, including Salford City and Manchester City. Stockport made their booking a few days in advance in anticipation of the rush. And they needed to given the site is alive with activity as the deadline approaches.View image in fullscreenBen Osborn is put through his paces in the gym.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianStockport’s head of medical, Jake Austin, and an independent doctor oversee the early stages of Osborn’s medical, Derby having sent over the 31-year-old’s records and with Austin having held conversations with his equivalent there. Osborn is asked for his family medical history before going through his injuries season-by-season. He knows his body better than anyone but Stockport cannot take chances and will focus their testing in the limited time available. Modern medicals can take up to six hours but that is not practical with the clock ticking.Back at the club’s Carrington base, the logistics of plans B, C and D are debated if anything untoward is found in Osborn’s medical. An offer is placed for a Premier League youngster and kept on the back-burner in case things change dramatically, while a player in the Championship is also sounded out. Stockport are known for their smart and methodical recruitment, instigated by Wilson, and want to improve on last season’s third-place finish. This summer they sold Isaac Olaofe to Charlton for 10 times what they paid for the striker two years ago, and have replaced him with Malik Mothersille from Peterborough, anticipating their new signing has a high ceiling and potentially a greater fee at the end of it.Smith is proud of the presentation that helped lure Stoke’s Nathan Lowe, a player wanted by almost every League One club, and Finland international Arttu Hoskonen, among others. Stockport have plenty of selling points, from their modern training ground to the stability of having had the same manager for almost four years, pitching themselves as English football’s most ambitious project outside the top two divisions. Osborn is impressed by the players’ room and is given a serviced apartment – one his dog can call home – in central Manchester for the length of his loan. Stockport had the answers before the questions were asked, therefore making a potentially tricky process altogether smooth. “It’s that human side, putting yourself in their shoes,” says Smith. “It’s a big change moving to a football club. It’s all those bits around it that I’d like to think we do really well.”View image in fullscreenOsborn signs his loan agreement at the club.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAt 2pm, Challinor joins Wilson, Smith and head of football operations, Alex Cowdy, in a meeting to run through how deals are progressing as well as debate other available options. A defender of interest earlier in the window is now available for nothing having previously been quoted at £750,000. Although tempting, the move is ruled out. “Calm heads are absolutely needed, because you’ve had some big decisions to make,” says Smith. “Preparation is integral; aligning everybody from the manager, director of football, chief executive … making sure we’re ready to go should something not go as well as what we wanted to happen.”Three players depart: Danny Andrew at the end of a one-month contract, while Jid Okeke and Jay Mingi head to League Two Walsall and Crewe respectively. Conversations take place regarding the exit of other fringe players but no concrete interest is shown in them, allowing the collective focus to squarely be put on Osborn.Stockport’s captain, Ollie Norwood, was at Sheffield United with Osborn for five seasons and the former teammates spoke on the phone for 40 minutes, with the former selling the club to the latter. Osborn had numerous offers, including from clubs in the Championship, but the words of Norwood and Challinor, who also spoke to the player on Sunday, were enough to convince him to make what is the first loan move of his career.Challinor comes down to meet Osborn for the first time and the manager’s smile shows how happy he is to be getting his man. Meanwhile, Wilson and Austin have a lengthy conversation to run through the results of the medical and where further to examine Osborn. Training kit is found and the sports scientists get to work on him. Osborn is forced to test his hamstrings and quads under supervision. “You always get nervous,” Smith says of medicals. “It’s part of the process.”Osborn’s tests are done and, soon, head of performance, Sam Holt, is heading up to club offices to gives the thumbs up to Wilson, Smith and Challinor. Plans B to G are disregarded at 5.30pm and Osborn comes in to meet everyone in a surprisingly calm manner given the whirlwind day he has endured. He woke a Derby resident but will go to bed in Manchester, calling Edgeley Park his second home despite having never been to the ground before.View image in fullscreenStockport’s media team take footage for the announcement of Osborn’s signing.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianOsborn and his agent, James Tunnicliffe, wander off to run through the necessary paperwork and ensure everything is above board. Cowdy is beckoned into the boardroom for the signing of the deal and everything is done by 6pm, with an hour to spare. Osborn is then told which group chats to join and Instagram accounts to follow. Hands are shaken and everyone is pleased with the outcome. Stockport have a player with Premier League experienceand he has the chance to play.On days like this it can feel like transfer activity takes place in the space of 24 hours but the truth is it takes months of work to put deals together. “We’ve already peeked into January,” reveals Smith. “We know when contracts are expiring. We have some targets that we like that we couldn’t get done this summer but perhaps as we move towards January, we can keep an eye on new players. We’ll always track new ones, too. It’s not like we’ll close the book on everything else.”The media department has been waiting in the wings, plotting how to unveil Osborn. Contact with previous clubs has been made to source footage and they debate what music would suit the reveal video. Norwood has provided the voiceover to explain what Stockport are getting and there are promotional photos with Osborn in the home, away and third shirts with “18 FIORINI” on the back because they are the right size, an indication that not all eventualities can be planned for at short notice. Nonetheless, it has been a relatively calm and well-ordered transfer window for Stockport. And while it may now have closed, the swan keeps kicking.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowStockportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The governing body opted to issue a pecuniary sanction rather than use their potential powers to either expel David Artell’s side or order the tie to be replayed.Clarke Oduor’s registration was submitted at 12.01pm last Tuesday, one minute and 59 seconds after the 12pm deadline demanded by this ­season’s EFL League Cup rules.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreOduor, a Kenya defender newly acquired on loan from League One Bradford, was introduced as a 73rd-minute substitute in atie won 12-11 on penalties by Grimsbyafter Manchester United recovered from falling 2-0 behind to force a shootout. Perhaps ironically Oduor, once of Leeds, was the only one of Artell’s players to miss a penalty. When he stepped off the bench for his debut, his team held a two-goal advantage.The EFL saidGrimsbyhad self-reported this breach of regulations once they discovered a mistake prompted by a computer malfunction the day after their triumph against Ruben Amorim’s side.It responded by imposing a £20,000 fine on the club but left £10,000 suspended. That sum will not need to be paid unless Grimsby field another ineligible player in any EFL competition this season.Manchester United could, in theory, appeal the EFL’s decision and have until Monday to lodge a demand for such a review. The Old Trafford club declined to comment on Tuesday.In a statement, accepting their punishment, Grimsby blamed that computer error on the delay in hitting the deadline and stressed it had been an honest mistake. “We accept the fine imposed and fully recognise the importance of adhering to competition rules and regulations,” read the statement. “This mistake was not deliberate, and the club acted transparently by self reporting the breach as soon as it came to light.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ilkay Gündogan’s departure for Galatasaray was also confirmed on Tuesday.Donnarumma has signed for an undisclosed fee, understood to be in the region of €35m (£30.4m), committing himself to a five-year contract. The Italy international will wear the No 99 shirt at City.“To have signed for Manchester City is such a special and proud moment for me,” said Donnarumma, who was a key part of the PSG team that won the Champions League last season. “I am joining a squad packed with world-class talent and a team led by one of the greatest managers in the history of football in Pep Guardiola. This is a club every player in world football would love to join.“Playing at the Etihad Stadium will be very, very special for me. I am very excited for what lies ahead and can promise that I will give absolutely everything to try and help the club achieve even more success.”Ederson hailed an “amazing” eight years after completing a move to Turkey. The 32-year-old helped City to claim 18 major honours, including six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, four League Cups and a Champions League. The Brazilian also won the Golden Glove award three times.View image in fullscreenEderson salutes Fenerbahce supporters after completing a move to the Turkish club following a glittering eight-year spell at Manchester City.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“I leave incredibly proud of what we have achieved together, and I am honoured to have worn the shirt so many times,” the Brazilian said. “Under Pep we have dominated the Premier League and conquered Europe. It has been amazing.“I arrived in Manchester eight years ago full of hope, but I could not have predicted such a beautiful time together. Playing for City has been the most special time of my life and I will always be a fan of this special club.”The German midfielder Gündogan has also left City for a second time, to join the Turkish champions Galatasaray, with the move subject to international clearance.Gündogan, 34, made 358 appearances across two spells with City, scoring 65 goals and winning 14 trophies, including the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League treble in 2023 when he captained the side.Gündogan initially joined City from Borussia Dortmund in 2016 before moving to Barcelona in 2023. He returned to Manchester for the 2024-25 campaign, scoring five goals and making eight assists from 54 games across all competitions.“I have no doubts Manchester City will enjoy much more success in the future and I will certainly be watching on from afar as I continue my career in Turkey, a country that means ever such a lot to me,” Gündogan, whose parents are Turkish, said.“Manchester City will always hold a special place in my heart. To win the Premier League and FA Cup trophies meant so much to me but to then be afforded the opportunity of lifting the Champions League trophy for this club for the first time, especially in Istanbul, will live with me forever.”City have also confirmed the exit of the Swiss defender Manuel Akanji to Inter on a season-long loan.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Several squad members, with two selected for this series opener, were engaged in that competition’s final as recently as 48 hours earlier and in their absence the team’s first training session on Sunday was attended by just a handful of players, their second had less than two-thirds of the squad present, and the outcome was a powder‑puff display against match-honed and whip‑smart opponents.Harry Brook described talk of his team’s poor build-up as “an excuse” and insisted: “We’re not a team that makes excuses. We’re a team that tries to play our best cricket as much as possible. We’ve just got to crack on now and put that performance behind us.”Until they lost two wickets in two balls with the scores tied and the die cast the tourists’ performance had been as blemish‑free as England’s was error‑strewn. The home side’s collapse was hastened by some excellent fielding, with outstanding catches from Corbin Bosch to dismiss Jamie Smith – who later produced a superb grab of his own to end Markram’s rampage on 86 – and from Markram himself, diving to his left at slip, to account for Jofra Archer, as well as an excellent throw from Tristan Stubbs to facilitate Brook’s run-out.View image in fullscreenAiden Markram drives on his way to a rapid 86 during South Africa’s victory against England.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThe ICC’s rankings make Keshav Maharaj officially the best bowler in the world in this format and the spinner bewitched England across 33 deliveries that brought four wickets and the home side to their knees. On a pitch that offered no demons and an outfield that gave no encouragement to chasing fielders a superficially strong side folded feebly, losing their last seven wickets for just 29 runs. Maharaj said his side did not believe England’s half-baked preparations indicated they had been underestimated, but notably put their good performance down to “the guys putting in a lot of work, not just prior to this series but prior to Australia as well”.England’s efforts started badly, with Ben Duckett caught behind in the third over for just five, and improved only moderately from there before nosediving theatrically once Maharaj was introduced. Only four players reached double figures and Smith alone, with a score of 54, managed more than 15. But it was the opener who precipitated the collapse when, having reached his half-century from 46 balls, carefully laying the groundwork for a potentially match-defining contribution, he got out almost immediately.That took England’s score to 102 for four and their partnerships from there contributed five, 10, two, nothing, 12 and nothing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was pressure he struggled to handle and his first four overs duly went for 56, with Markram alone scoring 45 of them, though he improved in returning for three more after a change of ends.“He got a bit of tap at the start but the way he kept cracking on and digging deep was awesome to see and that’s exactly what we ask of every bowler,” Brook said. “He might have missed his execution the odd time but Markram played some unbelievably good shots as well, so hat’s off to him.”England might have shifted the momentum had the ball not bounced inches in front of Joe Root’s hands after Archer found Ryan Rickelton’s edge with the opener yet to score, or if they had reviewed an on-field not‑out decision when Archer trapped him lbw with his next ball. On a day of many failures, that one got lost in the deluge.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamSouth Africa cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Up a game point in his opening service game, the Spaniard skipped around the ball from far behind the baseline in his backhand corner and attempted the riskiest shot possible, unleashing a remarkable forehand winner.This would not be the last time that the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd collectively gasped at Alcaraz’s greatness as he continued to radiate confidence and calm in New York, moving effortlessly into the semi‑finals with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 win against Jiri Lehecka.Jessica Pegula sweeps past Barbora Krejcikova and into US Open semi-finalsRead more“Today I played [an] almost perfect match,” Alcaraz said. “Playing in a quarter-final of a grand slam, I’m feeling like: ‘OK, just two more steps and let’s see what happens.’ I’m feeling great and hungry to make it.”This tournament has further underscored the ease and confidence surrounding Alcaraz’s tennis. Having reached the finals of his past seven tournaments while leading the tour with 59 match wins and six titles, this is the most consistent stretch of the 22-year-old’s career and he has played with total freedom over the past 10 days. He has now reached a grand slam semi-final without dropping a set for the first time in his career.Still, Alcaraz began the match fully conscious of the fact that Lehecka represented his toughest opponent so far and things could be different. The talented 23-year-old has been on the verge of breaking through for some time. He is armed with a powerful first serve and a destructive forehand. At the Qatar Open in February, the Czech toppled Alcaraz in three sets.This time, Alcaraz set the tone immediately by breaking Lehecka’s serve in the opening game. Across nearly two hours, he never let up. Alcaraz served spectacularly well, marching through his service games, his variety of shot contrasted starkly with Lehecka’s one-note attack. His defence made the court seem so narrow for his challenger.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz serves to Jiri Lehecka in front of a large Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd.Photograph: Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter two convincing sets, where Alcaraz broke in the opening service game and never looked back, the third set particularly demonstrated his growth. Lehecka played his best set of the match, moving through his own service games and putting pressure on Alcaraz.In the past, Alcaraz may have lost focus. On this occasion, the moment Lehecka began to show nerves, he pounced. At 4-4, instead of searching for a highlight-reel winner, Alcaraz locked down his game, making deep returns and offering up no free errors. He broke Lehecka’s serve with a spectacular defensive effort, celebrating with a roar.Alcaraz’s greater consistency has also been a result of improvements to his serve. He had opted to significantly change his service motion during his pre-season and over the course of this year it has become increasingly dependable. Against Lehecka, he landed 63% of his first serves, won 84% of first serve points and 41% of his serves went unreturned, an extremely healthy serving day that ended with him not facing a single break point in the match.Quick GuideDraper out of Davis Cup tie against PolandShowJack Draper will miss Great Britain's Davis Cup tie against Poland next weekend through injury.The world No 5 pulled out of the US Open ahead of his scheduled second-round match because of a flare-up of the bone bruising in his left arm that had kept him sidelined since Wimbledon.The Davis Cup World Group match in Gdynia on 12-13 September comes too soon for Draper, with questions marks over when he will be able to return.Davis Cup captain Leon Smith said: \"It goes without saying that obviously it's a real shame that we can't call upon Jack Draper to be in the team with his injury and of course we wish him the best with his recovery and for the rest of the season.\"In Draper's absence, Cameron Norrie will lead Britain's team alongside Jacob Fearnley, while there are three debutants named in Wimbledon doubles champions Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool plus Arthur Fery.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I’ve been improving a lot, and just every practice, every match I’ve been trying to feel more comfortable with the movement, with hitting good serves, and the percentage as well, it’s really important,” Alcaraz said.“Tennis, it’s really hard sometimes, because one day you can serve really, really well, and the next match you can feel completely different and really bad. I’m trying to maintain focus on the serve, trying to do everything the same and getting the good feeling.”Even for Alcaraz, who continues to pile up big titles at a faster rate than anyone else in the world, his recent efficiency has been striking. He has always been prone to dramatic moments of self-sabotage. The next step in Alcaraz’s career was learning how to perform more consistently, allowing him to preserve his mental and physical energy for his biggest rivals. As he moves closer to a potential sixth grand slam title, his progress is undeniable.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Carlos AlcarazUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

In its first year, the league saw a big uptick in viewing numbers as matches proliferated across a variety of outlets, reaching a wider audience.Women’s Super League 2025-26 previews No 9: Manchester CityRead moreAt the close of the 2024 season, Nielsen measured a five-fold increase in total viewership (18.7 million) across all platforms from the previous year. The championship match became the most-watched game in league history, peaking at 1.1 million viewers and averaging 967,000 on CBS. That match – in which a record-breaking Orlando Pride squad defeated the Washington Spirit, marking the Brazilian veteran Marta’s first NWSL championship on a field packed with recent Olympians – clocked an 18% increase in average viewers from 2023.A variety of factors may have been behind this year’s midseason dip, with the league pointing towards missing stars as one potential impact. As an example, all three members of the USWNT’s forward line, Sophia Wilson (née Smith), Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman – who combined for 10 goals last year at the Olympics – have been absent for most of the 2025 season as the first two are on maternity leave and Rodman in rehab for chronic back pain. Rodman has since returned to the field for the Spirit and there are hopes her star power may aid end-of-season momentum.View image in fullscreenThe Mexico forward Lizbeth Ovalle has joined Orlando Pride for a women’s world-record transfer fee.Photograph: Marcio José Sánchez/APNotably, NWSL in 2025 is a league with an exciting array of international stars who represented their countries in record numbers at a spate of international tournaments in July. Their return to the league after big performances at the Women’s European Championship, the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, and the Copa América Femenina may also help to boost interest.For example, ION’s numbers had been trending down in 2025 (as opposed to ESPN, which has trended up so far this season) but an early look at ION viewing numbers for August show a healthy increase, with an average of 162,750 viewers through the first four weekends of August. ION’s Saturday allotment of games features a weekly slate of back-to-back matchups, with the 16 August duo clocking an average audience of 188,000 – the highest of the first four weeks in that month. Among that evening’s games was a California confrontation between San Diego Wave and Bay FC, which featured newly returned international players on either side, including the Zambia forward Racheal Kundananji.San Diego Wave featured a few Euro 2025 quarter-finalists in the Sweden defender Hanna Lundkvist and the France forward Delphine Cascarino. With thhe Mexican forward Lizbeth Ovalle poised to join Orlando Pride for the latter half of the season after breaking the women’s transfer record yet again in 2025, and the Spanish striker Esther González (who finished top scorer at Euro 2025) going toe-to-toe each weekend with the Malawi forward Temwa Chawinga in a closely contested Golden Boot race, observers can expect exciting international stars outside of the USWNT to continue driving eyeballs the closer the league gets to the playoffs.View image in fullscreenFans fill Oracle Park, home of baseball’s San Francisco Giants, for a match between Bay FC and Washington Spirit.Photograph: Benjamin Fanjoy/APWith viewing numbers yet to be confirmed for all of August’s matches, there have still been a few curveballs affecting plans. That includes a more than three-hour weather delay to a highly touted televised match between Kansas City Current and Orlando Pride (which was eventually played amid scorching Missouri heat, with the Orlando Pride top scorer Barbra Banda departing the pitch with a season-ending injury). But the league has its eye on end-of-season games that seem likely to boost overall numbers for the 2025 season. Most immediately, that includes Alex Morgan’s retirement ceremony match airing this weekend on ESPN.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In his pre-match interview Bublik said his goal was not to lose his first service game, but he did just that and did not help himself with 13 double faults – including one featuring two underarm serves in the first set – as he dropped serve a further seven times. There were also far too many errors off the ground from Bublik, who at least raised his level in the third set only for Sinner to reply with interest.Is record-breaking Djokovic robust enough to keep rolling back years?Read moreBublik could do nothing but smile at some of the winners from the defending champion, although the fans who had paid hundreds of dollars for a ticket may not have felt quite so appreciative.Sinner cited Bublik’s long battle with Tommy Paul in the previous round in mitigation, saying: “He had a very tough match the last match. He didn’t serve as well as he usually does. I’m very happy. The first time this year I can play the night match here and it makes so, so big difference.”Sinner’s winning run at hard-court grand slams now stands at 25 matches – only two short of Novak Djokovic’s best – and he will take on Lorenzo Musetti in the last eight in the first all-Italian men’s quarter-final at a grand slam.“It’s great to see,” said the top seed. “Italian tennis is in great form now. Lorenzo is maybe one of the biggest talents we have in our sport. From an Italian point of view, it’s great to have one Italian player in the semis.”Tenth seed Musetti is having his best run at Flushing Meadows and was almost as dominant as Sinner, beating Spain’s Jaume Munar 6-3, 6-0, 6-1.Alex De Minaur hopes he can finally break through the grand slam quarter-final barrierafter setting up a last-eight clashwith Felix Auger-Aliassime earlier in the day. The Australian is through to this round for the fifth time in his last seven major tournaments and sixth time overall, but he has never been further.In the other men’s quarter-finals, Novak Djokovic will face home hope Taylor Fritz, while the 2022 champion, Carlos Alcaraz, plays Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic.Explore more on these topicsJannik SinnerUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Oversleeping and missing lectures, forgetting where your study group is meeting, mislaying your books – a lot of your time is spent looking for things.It is these small mysteries that concern Little Problems, a cute detective game, in which the protagonist, Mary, must use her sleuthing abilities to make it through each day as a new student . Created by Indonesian designer Melisa, who has chosen to go by her first name only, the idea comes from her love of detective stories, but also her wish to take violence out of the genre.“I read detective comic books, novels and manga, and have been playing detective games since I was a kid. I like horror as well, so I originally thought it would be a great idea to develop a detective game with a horror aesthetic. But after a few weeks of consuming murder and horror stories 24/7, I began to feel depressed, like the world was such a dark place. I wanted to make a story about good people who grow up and make mistakes. This game is all about that nice fuzzy feeling you get from solving small life mysteries.”View image in fullscreenRelatable … Little Problems.Photograph: Posh Cat StudioIn short, there is no criminal activity here. Sometimes, it is just about Mary trying to find a favourite earring, a friend in the crowd – or her mischievous cat. Each scene works like a hidden object puzzle game; you search a location for clues, which may be photos, notes or schedules, and then deduce what has happened. Who broke your favourite mug? You need to check what was in it, then use information about what your housemates like to drink and if they were around at the right time to find the culprit. Surely this is the most relatable crime ever investigated in a video game.The wholesome, low-stakes feel is accentuated by an art style that draws inspiration from soft manga and anime such as Doraemon, Chibi Maruko-chan and Kobo-chan. As with similarly domestic titles such as Unpacking and A Little to the Left, there is a lot of subtle storytelling going on in the background around friendships and family, giving weight to the simple premise. Melisa started the project as a quick prototype for a Twitch game jam, but ended up spending two years on it, bringing two other staff onboard and setting up her studio, Posh Cat. It has been something of a passion project. “I would love to play more cosy detective games, so I made one,” she says. “Here’s to more cosy games in 2025 and beyond!”Little Problems is released onPCon 9 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPCIndie gamesPuzzle gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The technology was “risky” and “could cause significant harm to the world”, Altman said, calling for the creation of a new regulatory agency to address AI safety.Altman and the AI industry are promoting a very different message today. The AI they once framed as an existential threat to humanity is now key to maintaining American prosperity and hegemony. Regulations that were once a necessity are now criticized as a hindrance that will weaken the US and embolden its adversaries.Whether or not the AI industry ever truly wanted government oversight is debatable, but what has become clear over the past year is that they are willing to spend exorbitant sums of money to make sure any regulation that does exist happens on their terms. There has been a surge in AI lobbying and political action committees from the industry, with areport last week from the Wall Street Journalthat Silicon Valley plans to pour $100m into a network of organizations opposing AI regulation ahead of next year’s midterm elections.One of the biggest efforts to sway candidates in favor of AI will be a Super Pac called Leading Our Future, which is backed byOpenAIpresident Greg Brockman and venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz. The group is planning bipartisan spending on candidates and running digital candidates in key states for AI policy including New York, Illinois and California, according to the Wall Street Journal.Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is alsoforming its own Super Pactargeted specifically at opposing AI regulation in its home state of California. The Meta California Pac will spend tens of millions on elections in the state, which is holding its governor’s race in 2026.The new Super Pacs are an escalation of the AI industry’s already hefty spending to influence government policy on the technology. Big AI firms have ramped up their lobbying – OpenAIspent roughly $620,000 on lobbyingin the second quarter of this year alone – in an effort to push back against calls for regulation. OpenAI rival Anthropic meanwhile spent $910,000 on lobbying in Q2,Politico reported, up from $150,000 during the same period last year.The spending blitz comes as the benefits promised by AI companies have yet to fully materialize and the harms associated with the technology are increasingly clear. A recent study from MIT showed that 95% of companies they studied receivedno return on investmentfrom their generative AI programs, while another study this month from Stanford researchers found AI wasseverely hurtingyoung workers’ job prospects. Meanwhile, the concern around AI’s impact on mental health was back in the spotlight this past week after the parents of a teenager who died by suicidefiled a lawsuit against OpenAIblaming the company’s chatbot for their son’s death.Despite the public safety, labor, and environmental concerns surrounding AI, the industry may not have to work too hard to find a sympathetic ear in Washington. The Trump administration, which already has extensive ties to the tech industry, has suggested that it is determined to become the world’s dominant AI power at any cost.“We can’t stop it. We can’t stop it with politics,” Trumpsaid last monthin a speech about winning the AI race. “We can’t stop it with foolish rules”.OpenAI faces its first wrongful death lawsuitView image in fullscreenThe parents of a teenager who died by suicide filed a lawsuit against OpenAI blaming the company’s chatbot for their son’s death.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersThe parents of 16-year-old Adam Raineare suing OpenAIin a wrongful death case after their son died by suicide. The lawsuit alleges that Raine talked extensively with ChatGPT about his suicidal ideations and even uploaded a picture of a noose, but the chatbot failed to deter the teenager or stop communicating with him.The family alleges this is not an edge-case but an inherent flaw in the way the system was designed.In a conversation with the Guardian, Jay Edelson, one of the attorneys representing the Raine family said that OpenAI’s response was acknowledgment that the company knew GPT-4o, the version of ChatGPT Raine was using, was broken. The family’s case hinges on the claim, based on previous media reporting, that OpenAI rushed the release of GPT-4o and sacrificed safety testing to meet that launch date. Without that safety testing, the company did not catch certain contradictions in the way the system was designed, the family’s lawsuit claims. So instead of terminating the conversation with the teenager once he started talking about harming himself, GPT-4o provided an empathetic ear, at one point discouraging him from talking to his family about his pain.The lawsuit is the first wrongful death case against OpenAI, which announced last week it would change the way its chatbot responds to users in mental distress. The company said ina statement to the New York Timesthat it was “deeply saddened” by Raine’s death and suggested that ChatGPT’s safeguards become less reliable over the course of long conversations.Concerns over suicide prevention and harmful relationships with chatbots have existed for years, but the widespread adoption of the technology has intensified calls from watchdog groups for better safety guardrails. In another case from this year, a cognitively impaired 76-year-old man from New Jerseydied after attempting to travel to New York Cityto meet a Meta chatbot persona called “Big sis Billie” that had been flirtatiously communicating with him. The chatbot had repeatedly told the man that it was a real woman and encouraged the trip.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Musk’s company is seeking to recover billions in damages, while throwing a wrench in the partnership that Apple and OpenAI announced last year to great fanfare.Musk’s lawsuit accuses the two companies of “a conspiracy to monopolize the markets for smartphones and generative AI chatbots” and follows legal threats he made earlier this month over accusation that Apple’s app store was favoring ChatGPT above other AI alternatives.OpenAI rejected Musk’s claims and characterized the suit as evidence of the billionaire’s malicious campaign against the company. “This latest filing is consistent with Mr Musk’s ongoing pattern of harassment,” an OpenAI spokesperson said.As the Guardian’s coverage of the case detailed, the legal drama is yet another chapter in the long, contentious relationship between Musk and Altman:The lawsuit is the latest front in the ongoing feud between Musk and Altman. The two tech billionaires founded OpenAI together in 2015, but have since had an increasingly public falling out which has frequently turned litigious.Musk left OpenAI after proposing to take over the company in 2018, and has since filed multiple lawsuits against the company over its plans to shift into a for-profit enterprise.

Now Bemi Orojuogun, 56, has urged her army of fans to share her appreciation for the hard-working bus drivers who keep the capital running.The mental health nurse has been overwhelmed by the response to the quirky, bite-size videos she began posting on social media last year. They feature clips of her standing at the roadside, sometimes at landmarks such as Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus, as buses drive past.“My love for London red buses started a long time ago, when I first came to this country in the early 90s,” said Orojuogun, who is from Nigeria. “There are four parts of London that I really, really love: red buses, red telephone booths, all the London bridges and Big Ben. But buses are main my love.”She showcased this enthusiasm last March, posting a video of a 241 bus driving past her in Plaistow, east London. For Orojuogun, there was nothing unusual about the video but it quickly racked up millions of views when it was shared worldwide.“I received a call from my daughter saying: ‘Mummy, you’re going viral’,” Orojuogun said. “I loved the way young people really liked the video, their comments and the way they were reposting it, and then I did more of it. Some of them love to guess where I’ll be going next and suggest where I should visit next, and that’s how it all started.”Orojuogun’s most popular video has amassed 48.1m views. The one-minute clip shows her standing in front of a bus stop in Greenwich as a series of buses drive past her to the soundtrack of Back for Good by Take That.“It’s still all a dream and a shock to me,” she said of the popularity of her videos. “A lot of celebrities have been in my DMs, congratulating me, telling me they’re proud of me. But not only that, I’m so glad the way social media has accepted me, the way they have come behind me and supported me.”Orojuogun rarely speaks in her videos, instead beaming into the camera with her distinctive glasses, colourful headscarves and dangly earrings. She often appears perilously close to the kerb, leading some viewers to fear she may be standing in the road. But she insists it is all in the camera angles and she is always on the pavement.Her popularity has landed her advertising deals withTransportfor London, Ikea and Burberry, which described her in a campaign last month as “our fare lady”. But her motivation for posting videos remains her love of the capital and its buses which she said allowed her to get to work during the pandemic.“I love those buses,” she said. “Since Covid, the buses have been my main means of travelling, from home to work, shopping, everywhere. London is a beautiful place to see from the top of the bus. That’s my belief. I love it. And those red buses, take it from me, they represent London. I just wish we loved them a bit more.

The data reflected some uncomfortable facts – in particular, the dampening of population growth in areas devastated by the 1933 famine – and so Stalin’s government suppressed the release of the survey results. Several high-level government statistical workers responsible for the census were subsequently imprisoned and apparently executed. Though the Soviet authorities would proudly trumpet national statistics that glorified the USSR’s achievements, any numbers that did not fit the preferred narrative were buried.A few weeks ago, following the release of “disappointing” jobs data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Donald Trumpfiredthe commissioner of labor statistics, Dr Erika McEntarfer, and claimed the numbers were “rigged”. He alsoannouncedhis intention to commission an unprecedented off-schedule census of the US population (these happen every 10 years and the next one should be in 2030) with an emphasis that this census “will not count illegal immigrants”. The real goal is presumably to deliver a set of population estimates that could be used to reapportion congressional seats and districts ahead of the 2026 mid-term elections and ensure conditions favorable to Republican control of Congress – though it is not clear there is sufficient time or support from Congress to make this happen. The administration is also reportedly “updating” the National Climate Assessments and various important sources of data on topics related toclimateandpublic healthhave disappeared. In addition to all this, Trump’s justice department launched aninvestigationinto the crime statistics of the DC Metropolitan police, alleging that the widely reported decline in 2024 DC violent crime rates – the lowest total number of recorded violent crimes city-wide in 30 years – are a distortion, fueled by falsified or manipulated statistics. One might say that the charge of “fake data” is just a close cousin of the “fake news” and all of this is par for the course for an administration that insists an alternate reality is the truth. But this pattern may also beget a specifically troubling (and quintessentially Soviet) state of affairs: the public belief that all “political” data are fake, that one generally cannot trust statistics. We must resist this paradigm shift, because it mainly serves to entrench authoritarianism.It was eventually a common sentiment in the Soviet Union that one could never trust “the official numbers” because they were largely manipulated to serve political interests. (At least, this is the sentiment reported by my parents, who grew up in the Soviet Baltic states during the 1960s and 1970s – I was an infant when we left in the late 80s so I cannot report much first-hand.) One upshot of this kind of collective belief, if it were to take hold, is that it can make one’s informational world quite small: if you can only trust what you can verify directly, namely what you experience yourself or hear from trusted friends and family, it is difficult to broaden your view to include experiences of people in circumstances very different from yours. This kind of parochial world with few shared reference points is bad for democracy and building solidarity across groups. It also makes it easier for an oppressive state to plant false and divisive “facts” to serve its goals; we’ll have a fake crime wave here and a booming economy there, and though maybe most people disbelieve this they do not quite believe the opposite either. No one can credibly claim or contest any socially relevant trends because all numbers are fake, so the activities of claiming and contesting things become pointless – just do what you can get away with.A political culture with no trust in data or statistics is also one that will rely more heavily on opaque decisions made by elites behind closed doors. In his influential historical study of the rise of quantitative bureaucracy, the historian Thomas Porter points out that basing policy decisions on calculated numerical costs and benefits reduces the role of “local” discretion and can have a homogenizing effect, which can strengthen centralized state control. The flip side of this coin is that it also divests people in power from part of their authority by enabling a degree of public transparency and scrutability: if a huge government project must be justified by reference to some cost-benefit calculations, these calculations can be cross-checked and challenged by various parties. If a government agency requires documentation of progress on initiatives, proof that public funds are being spent appropriately, and evidence on who benefits and by how much, there is substantially less room for plain corruption and mismanagement provided that independent parties have access to the relevant information. Without credible data that reflects the facts on the ground, how can the public push back against an invented “crisis” narrative, concocted to justify the invocation of emergency powers?Anyone who spends any time working with data is acutely aware that there are lots of choices to be made in the collection or processing of data – there are numerous “decision points” about what to include, how to precisely define or measure things, and so on. Indeed, insofar as data is used to tell stories about complex things such as the state of the economy or the health of a population, different data collection or analysis choices can to some extent lend support to different narratives, including predetermined narratives if an unscrupulous analyst is set on it. But it does not follow from this that “anything goes” or that statistics are meaningless. There are better and worse ways to collect and analyze data, both reasonable and preposterous ways to answer empirical questions such as “are crime rates in DC going up or going down?” Most importantly, when government statistics are managed by qualified and non-partisan officials and the relevant numbers can be challenged, debated and contested, then we have a democratic basis for guiding our institutions to better policy decisions. Data of public importance must be publicly accessible, not hidden from view.Trump’s assault on the integrity of data is not the worst of his ongoing abuses – the public should be more immediately outraged by the masked agents disappearing people on the streets and the national guard occupying city centers – but this pattern of actions vis-a-vis official statistics should be extremely alarming. It is a slow boil: if we reach the point where nobody trusts numbers because it’s all “fake data”, it will be too late to resist and too difficult to undo the damage. The opposition must block appointments of unqualified and clearly biased nominees to lead the BLS and other agencies responsible for data stewardship. We must resist undue interference in data gathering, whether that is at the level of the US census or at the level of city government. On the contrary, we should be investing in initiatives that strengthen public trust in and understanding of the social, economic and environmental data that can be used to guide decisions that affect our communities’ wellbeing.Daniel Malinsky is an assistant professor of biostatistics in the Mailman School of PublicHealthat Columbia UniversityExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionHealthClimate crisisUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

That’s what the prime minister promised as he announced yet another government reboot, insisted he would get all asylum hotels closed “as quickly as possible” and was filmed with the ubiquitous union flag in the background. (“Look, I’m the leader of the Labour party who put the union jack on our Labour party membership cards,” he boasted.)Let’s quote Keir Starmer’s deliverance speech in context: “We are now into phase two of the government, which is where we focus on delivery, delivery, delivery and start to show what a difference a Labour government really makes.” Which, of course, can be happily soundbited as “delivery, delivery, delivery”. That’s the thinking, anyway.But if there’s one thing that sums up why Starmer is a useless politician, it’s this mantra. You can see what the PM is trying to do. He’s echoing Tony Blair – again. “Education, education, education”. The same trick. One word repeated three times. Even the same number of syllables, so we can chant it from memory.There’s only one problem. “Delivery, delivery, delivery” (which he tried out in a practice run last December in Scotland) doesn’t mean anything. It’s vacuous nonsense. What’s more, “delivery” is almost impossible to remember as a word, let alone a slogan. Not even the Post Office could get away with it. (Nor the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for that matter). “Delivery, delivery, delivery” might just be the worst political slogan of all time.“Education, education, education” works because it’s real. We know what education is and think it’s important. Most of us don’t know what delivery means, and I reckon the few who do don’t actually want it delivered. Take the cuts to Pip by tightening eligibility rules or restricting the winter fuel allowance to the poorest pensioners. We didn’t want that delivered, so the government had to backtrack earlier this year.Or take the demonising of asylum seekers and thesuspension of family reunion applications. Most traditional Labour voters don’t want that delivered either because, as the great Labour peer Alf Dubs said yesterday, the government has to argue for morality, rather than try to out-Reform Reform on the bigotry front. Dubs’s life was almost certainly saved when he fled Prague on the Kindertransport in 1939 and was offered refuge in Britain. Nowthatkind of delivery was something we could be proud of.The sad thing is that Starmer is an able man, and was once an admirable lawyer who fought for the underdog. But as a politician he is clumsy, leaden-footed and pusillanimous. And as a creator of winning catchphrases, he is second to all. Remember “security, prosperity, respect”, “secure, protect, rebuild”, “a new leadership” or, possibly my favourite, “another future is possible”? No, I thought not.And let’s not forget, Starmer is the (staunchly anti-Brexit) fella who was convinced he could co-opt the Brexit slogan “take back control” andmake it his. Hard-right campaigners outside hotels “hosting” asylum seekers have shown who really owns that sentiment.Starmer should focus on delivering more hope in the decency of British people and embrace the many counter-arguments to the anti-migrant gutter rhetoric. Asylum seekers have escaped unimaginable horrors. And it is our duty to support refugees under the 1951 refugee convention. We know as well that migrants boost the economy (figures consistently show that overall they pay more tax than they receive in benefits), andthey fill posts in vital public services(about 20% of NHS employees in England are non-UK nationals). If the prime minister did this, there may still be time for him to win back some disillusioned Labour supporters.But even if he did decide to dedicate himself to delivering the moral argument, “delivery, delivery, delivery” would still be a rubbish catchphrase. As it is, when he’s applying it to lowest-common-denominator politics, it might ring more true sense as “populism, populism, populism” or “utterbollocks, utterbollocks, utterbollocks”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterComing soon: Guardian voices in conversation about a key debate of the week, every SaturdayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Experts say an all-animal diet carries risksRead more in theAntiviral seriesTue 2 Sep 2025 11.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 18.23 EDTShareEx-vegan turned carnivore Isabella Ma, better known to her nearly half a million followers on Instagram as @steakandbuttergal, has glowing skin and a flat stomach. She looks directly at the camera as shechomps down on an entire stick of butter. It’s part of her“high fat carnivore diet”to which she attributes a whole host of health benefits, not least of which is the claim she“literally never fart[s] any more” and has a single “scentless” bowel movement a week.A lot of gym bros also back the diet touted for helping people lose weight and build muscle, such as Antonio Angotti, whosays the fat in red meat“includes almost every nutrient humans need to thrive”and invokes religion as part of his dietary choices, saying he eats“just foods God will actually bless”. It’s also beenplatformed by Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson.But what do the experts have to say about one of the most viral health trends of the moment?What is the carnivore diet?It’s an all-meat or predominantly meat diet, often incorporating other animal-based products including eggs and dairy products – but very little or no plants or carbohydrates. Some people adhere to it by eating solely animal-based products, while others have variations that might include some fruits or vegetables.What do the experts think of it?There are two issues when it comes to diets relying on meat – what you’re missing out on, as well as the risk of what you could be consuming too much of, says Dr Eden Barrett, a public health nutrition researcher and dietitian at the George Institute for GlobalHealth.The chance of deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C and folate, is really high. You’re also virtually eating no fibre, a nutrient that evidence shows isprotective against heart disease,certain cancersand a lot ofchronic diseases, as well as crucial for digestive health, Barrett says. You could also be missing out on the variety ofbioactive compounds in food, such as antioxidants. Those aren’t essential nutrients – we don’t need them to survive – but they canhelp us live longer.There is also the risk of consuming too much animal meat. This can be high in saturated fat, which tends to raise levels of bad cholesterol – a known risk factor for heart disease, she says. Red meat and processed meat has also been shown to be associated with risk of cancers, while consuming too much protein can also put kidney function at risk, Barrett says.There isn’t a lot of scientific evidence for what the long-term effects of a carnivore diet are, as opposed to the benefits of a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, meat and meat alternatives, dairy, nuts and legumes on a daily basis, which is based on “years and years of accumulated evidence”, Barrett says.Social media’s gut feeling is all wrong: there is no fast track to a healthy microbiome | Natasha MayRead moreBut what about all the people who say it has helped them?“People say they feel better when they’re on the carnivore diet, and that’s not something that we should dismiss,” Dr Emma Beckett, an adjunct senior lecturer in nutrition at the University of New South Wales, says. They commonly mention less brain fog, more energy, improved sleep and better skin health.“But feeling better is only part of health, and we can’t feel things like our arteries getting clogged and … our blood pressure going up, so just feeling better doesn’t mean you’re necessarily doing yourself any favours in the long term,” Beckett says.UK-based nutritionist Dr Richie Kirwan has called the carnivore diet the world’s most hectic elimination diet – a kind of diet used in medicine to figure out which foods people are having adverse reactions to. “That explains why people feel better on it, because if you’re responding negatively to a food, cutting it out will make you feel better,” Beckett says.But with elimination diets, foods are gradually reintroduced – which is not happening with the carnivore diet. Instead, people continue eating a low-diversity diet.Is the carnivore diet dangerous?Some of the benefits influencers claim might actually be red flags, Beckett points out. She takes particular umbrage with Ma’s claim that she never farts and only poos once a week. “This is the weirdest brag ever, because we need to fart andwe need to poop, and if you are not farting, then there is something not right in your gastrointestinal tract.”Associate professor Emma Halmos, a research dietitian at Monash University, clinically sees a lot of patients who have followed the carnivore diet and similar variations (keto and paleo) who are not eating enough fibre and have subsequently developed gastrointestinal symptoms or gastrointestinal disease. As a dietitian who only sees people with gastrointestinal conditions, she acknowledges there is a bias.Often her clients have gone on the carnivore diet because they believe it is healthy and will help them lose weight. Because the carnivore diet is a zero carbohydrate diet, people can lose weight on it, but that doesn’t make it a healthy diet, Halmos says.People can only absorb about 30 grams of protein in a sitting, Halmos says. The body excretes the protein it doesn’t absorb. When there are very large amounts, it can have negative effects, particularly for the large intestine, which goes through a process called putrefaction. “What that means is that it suppresses good bacteria and it changes the pH of the bowel so that nasties can grow,” Halmos says. The theory is that too much excreted protein can lead to bowel disease but we don’t have the evidence to back that up, she says.How much meat is healthy?TheAustralian Guide to Healthy Eatingrecommends up to three serves of meat or meat alternatives a day. “Three serves is way, way, way less than what we think,” Halmos says. Having meat once a day for most people would actually tick their requirements, meaning a lot of us actually exceed our requirements for meat,” she says.The fact that some carnivores have turned to the diet after being vegan, Beckett says, “speaks to what are the real motivations for following the diet. Is it truly about health? Or is it about having a simple set of rules to follow … It creates a sense of community.”A lot of people have decision fatigue where there’s so many food choices to make, and these diets make life feel easier, Beckett says. She recommends if people feel overwhelmed they can consult a health practitioner such as a dietitian who can help them develop what’s known as “nutritional self-efficacy”: feeling that you have the skills and the confidence to be able to make food decisions in any given environment.Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporterAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

If that won’t save the world, what will?Tue 2 Sep 2025 08.24 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 21.31 EDTShare“If I hear one more of our people saying that deckchairs are being shuffled on the Titanic,” a government supporter of Keir Starmerconfided to the Daily Mail, “I will scream.” No need for shrieks. The prime minister’s No 10 hokey cokey on Monday wasn’t so much shuffling the deckchairs as restructuring the deck crew and announcing that some fresh faces will enable the team to work with new focus towards their ultimate goal of reshuffling. Expect the first strategy whiteboard to be broken out 370 miles off the coast of Newfoundland.For now, hold on to your aperitifs and continue to dress for dinner, because the erstwhile chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, becomes something called chief secretary to the prime minister. To Starmer, Darren is a Mr Fixit; to many of his cabinet colleagues, he is a Mr Fuxit. That’s not the official line Downing Steet is going with,preferring instead to claimthat yet another reset means Starmer is focused on “relentless delivery”. Delivery of what? They’ve barely passed any legislation. Hand on heart, meanwhile, I’m not sure the word “relentless” means what Starmer reckons it does. All he ever does is relent, on both staff and policy. The role of his comms chief, for example, is now essentially a gig economy job, while doing a monthly U-turn is the only thing he hasn’t U-turned on. We are watching a movie in which it’s not clear what the main character wants. Unsurprisingly, it has turned out to be box-office poison.But look, maybe it just needs a better tagline! Certainly, Monday found the Starmer administrationtoggling betweennew official and unofficial slogans. We have “delivering growth people can feel in their pockets”, which sounds suitably masturbatorial, and “just fucking do it”, which sounds suitably devoid of strategy. Both, however, are preferable to the way one member of Starmer’s inner circle characterised the latest reboot of the franchise,telling the Timesthat “this is about bringing the grownups in”. Oh no – not the dreaded grownups. Just as Batman reboots only ever promise to be even darker and even grittier, so Starmer reboots only ever promise tosend for more grownups. Starmer has been claiming the grownups are coming since 2017. Doing it again now suggests he spent the first 14 months of government running an administration staffed by kids.Then again, non-cinematic inspiration was available. “We’re not pitching you a new Netflix series,” explained the then shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds in the run-up to last year’s general election. “We’re not putting on politics as entertainment.” Finally, a pledge on which the government has delivered. Unfortunately,as I suggested at the time, it would have been much better if the government had emulated Netflix in one crucial regard. When the streamer greenlights a series, it tends to know how much it is going to cost, and precisely how it will all be paid for. Keir Starmer’s government remains “on a journey” on that front, and it is this more than anything else that is going to do for him. Or, if you prefer, has already done for him.It was barely nine months ago thatRachel Reeveswas defending last year’s budget to the CBI, declaring: “I’m really clear: I’m not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes. That is why at this budget, we did wipe the slate clean to put public finances and public services on a firm footing, and as a result, we won’t have to do a budget like this ever again.” Spoiler alert: they’re going to have to do a much worse one. Yes, in a development that was both clearly predictable and clearly predicted, the promise not to raise any of the three biggest taxes – but to give Britain a far better lifestyle than that to which it had become angrily accustomed – has not come off. In related news, Britain is now much angrier. And it’s going to be a whole lot angrier still come the budget. People will be quite within their rights to say they never voted for any of the things Reeves is going to have to do. It’s extremely difficult see how she survives that.During the last election campaign, Rishi Sunak’s claim thatLabourwould have to raise taxes was treated like some whopper for the ages, with Starmer calling it “absolute garbage” and hotly claiming that the then PM had broken the ministerial code by suggesting that a £2,000 tax hike per person across the parliament would be the way a Labour government would fill a £22bn hole. “He knew very well what he was doing,” sniffed Starmer. “He lied about our plans. And that is a true test of character. As we go to the polls it is important for voters to know about the character of the two individuals who want to be prime minister.”Well quite. And yet, it is genuinely difficult to suspend one’s disbelief enough to be able to believe that the current economic position can be a surprise to Starmer. He must have known that what he was promising in the run-up to the election – an election he was always going to win – didn’t add up. And if he didn’t, he and his chancellor are even more incompetent than they have so far come across. Their lofty promises amount to a form of populism almost as corrosive as the ones they say they disdain – indeed, it may end up the midwife to them.Evasions this big should simply be called lies. Unfortunately, every single political party’s manifesto majored on them last time round. During the Brexit years, the term cakeism was popularised to sum up the prevalent mood that everything could be acquired without cost. Boris Johnson famously announced that he was “pro having it and pro eating it” – yet despite seeing how that turned out for everyone from Theresa May to Johnson himself, Starmer and Reeves’s economic promises were cakeism of the first water. These days, so are Reform’s. Nigel Faragehas already promised£80bn of new spending with no remotely serious suggestion as to how it will be funded. Mister Honest is lying to the British people,just like he did in the run-up to the referendumon Britain’s EU membership, and if he does make it into No 10, we will yet again see where kicking the can down the road gets us.Except perhaps by then, we will have run out of road. Someone, at some point, is going to have to approach a position of honesty with the public – but the appetite for self-delusion suggests the time where that would be a winning position is some way off. Until then, we will become ever more stuck – trapped in a never-ending episode of The Great British Cakeism-Off.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourBudget 2025Tax and spendingRachel ReevesDarren JonesEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Not only is our economy in dire trouble, with the cost of basic goodsshooting upagain and again, but trust in those running the country is at a record low. These are the conditions in whichfar-right politics festers. With the help of his friends in some of the media, Nigel Farage is feeding off that anger.This is the Green party’s moment. We know Keir Starmershuffling the deckchairsthis week is not the real change we need. We are not here just to be concerned or disappointed with this Labour government. We are here to replace it.Things have to change, and it’s my job as the new leader of theGreen partyto work with communities, bring people together and turn anger into hope.Most people know one thing about the Greens: that we care about the environment. And this won’t change. But increasingly, and in every corner of this country, people are voting for us because we’re the only party talking about everyday solutions and pointing the finger at those who are causing the real problems we face.It’s actually fairly simple. For years now, the very richest in society have accumulated more and more wealth. While they sleep at night, the money pours in, not from work, but from assets such as stocks, shares and multiple properties. The wealthiest 1% of households in this country hold agreater proportionthan that held by the least wealthy 50%.And while that tiny proportion at the top gets richer, our NHS is buckling, disability benefits are under threat and the two-child benefit cap threatens to push hundreds of thousands of kids into poverty.The UK’s economy is on its knees. GDP growth, the scorecard on which this government wants to be marked, is crawling along at just 1.2% this year. For most of us, the squeeze is relentless. Tenants are handing over nearly half their wages in rent. The Trussell Trust says at least9.3 million peopleare going hungry, a third of whom are children. Food inflation is at an 18-month high. And all this is happening under a Labour government – and with little prospect of things getting better.It can’t go on like this. Under my leadership, the Green party is going to be relentless in our opposition to a politics that favours the super-wealthy over the rest of us. That’s why the first people I will meet as leader today will be trade unionists: cleaners, carers and hospital porters. That’s why whenever you hear from us, you’ll hear our calls for a wealth tax, our demand for public ownership of water companies and our pledge to make childcare universal and free.View image in fullscreenZack Polanski at a demonstration outside the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, London, 30 September 2023.Photograph: SOPA Images Limited/AlamyWe know that the ongoing climate crisis will be devastating for our communities, but we’re here to harness the imagination, the hope and the vision of what an alternative looks like: new jobs in public services, communities that people love and a council housing programme that makes sure no one is left sleeping rough.I disagree with Reform UK and Farage on almost everything. But they’re correct to point at our politics and say it has failed. What they refuse to admit is that it’s their wealthy backers, including fossil-fuel finance, who have fanned the flames of the crises we face now.In coming votes – whether local and assembly elections next year or the general election when it next comes – people in this country will face a stark choice. Do they stick with a tired, failed politics of a Labour party that has abandoned its principles one by one? Do they opt for Farage’s financiers? Or do they choose a Green party that has a plan to improve lives and turn this country around?At the last election, a record number of nearly 2 million people voted Green, leading to40 second-place finishes– our central mission is to turn them into new Green MPs. Along with our councillors across the country, that’s how we turn our country around.Right now, more than one in 10 people say they’d vote Green in a general election. And, yes, I am going to significantly build on that. But my politics is also about community; about grassroots movements. Millions of people are desperate for change and angry that those elected are not acting in their interests. I’m ready to build ideas with them and give them a political voice. I am here to offer bold leadership and to fight for a country where no one is left behind.Zack Polanski is the newly elected leader of the Green partyExplore more on these topicsGreen partyOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Latest Ipsos polling has the Tory party’snational vote share on just 15%. YouGov polling has the partyon 18%. The last time the Conservative partypolled 30% or morewas in September 2022.A party that gave people a choice at the ballot box has become a husk. It is, as a former MP colleague said to me recently, akin to an empty warehouse – the building is still there but the goods inside have all but disappeared.And now those who have built this most unpopular version of the Conservative party are beginning to implicitly acknowledge the truth, and are coming up with the next “doom loop” step for their party. Now it’s time to “unite the right”, they begin to chatter. The logic is that bringing the votes of the Conservative and Reform UK parties together adds up to a vote-share far greater than your opponents have. Surely then, they believe, we can win again.Yet those Conservativeswanting to“unite the right” should be careful what they wish for. For those many other Conservatives feeling queasy about that next step, they’re right. Here’s why.It’s simplistic to think you can just add up the Conservative vote and theReform UKvote and then it’s enough to win. For a start, it assumes the dwindling Tory vote is stable – it’s not. And in no sense is there a distinct Tory vote any more – voters have switched to Reform UK (in the north) or to the Liberal Democrats (in the south), or conventionally, to Labour.Importantly, the reality is that the more the Tories talk about uniting the right, the more they are essentially telling all voters the two parties are now so similar that there is no real difference between them. In effect, they are either validating a pro-Reform UK voter to switch to Reform or an anti-Reform voter to switch to a different party standing against Reform. So, on messaging alone, calling for “unite the right” could be the equivalent of the Conservative party self-administering a political cyanide pill from a bottle labelled “how to get rid of your remaining voters”.More practically, in our first-past-the-post electoral system, voters may anyhow consider that if they want to eject the Labour party from power at the next general election, they should vote for the party best able to beat it. It will be an uphill struggle for theConservativesto persuade voters that they have a chance of winning locally in constituencies if Reform UK continues to poll so far ahead nationally.View image in fullscreenKemi Badenoch chairing her first shadow cabinet meeting as Tory leader.Photograph: CCHQSenior Conservatives may remember that, in advance of the 2019 general election, there was asimilar clamour to bring togetherthe rightwing vote. Then, the rightwing press successfully put pressure on the smaller of the two rightwing parties, the Brexit party, to have its candidates step aside, rather than risk a Labour government. It worked hugely to the Conservatives’ advantage. But now the tables have turned, and it is the Brexit party’s new incarnation, Reform UK, that is the dominant political force. It’s wishful thinking in the extreme that Nigel Farage and the Reform UK party will give way again.Conversely, at the next election, it may well be the Conservative party being put under pressure by the rightwing press to withdraw its candidates, with Conservative constituency associations all over the country told: “Sorry, don’t bother selecting a candidate this time, Reform has a better chance in your patch.” That would be a sure-fire way to decimate any remaining grassroots support and Conservative party membership. Yet it’s hard to argue against that logic when there are those in the party making the argument of “unite the right”.Is there an alternative path ahead for the Conservatives, other than continuing to follow this political death-wish cult, taking the party further into the electoral abyss? Yes, but it’s a hard one. First, all those who want to “unite the right” should be told to do that – go and join Reform UK. If they don’t think they can beat them, they should join them. At least it would remove their negativity from the party and leave it to those who still believe the Conservative party could offer something distinctive and positive to Britain again.Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the biggest patriot of them all? It is I, Robert Jenrick | Marina HydeRead moreThose remaining could shift it to once more become a more centrist party capable of reaching a broader base of voters. But it’s a tall order. It would take time to move on from the disastrous state of the party in recent years. And there is the bigger question: if all the Conservatives who deep down prefer Reform UK joined Reform, how many would be left?What we do know is that the polls show beyond doubt that this current version of the Conservative party has run out of road. It can change the driver at the wheel (again), but it has been the political direction and strategy thathas been all wrong, not just the captain at the helm. The latest changing tack on North Sea oil and gas, with promisesto “maximise extraction”,is yet more Reform-lite messing that comes over to voters as the party being a follower not a leader.Until the Conservative party accepts this diagnosis it will continue to terminally decline. A fundamental reset is required. The party needs to reinvent and modernise, not merge. A message of “unite the right” is not what the Conservatives need, because that “unite the right” benefits only one party, and that party is Reform UK.Justine Greening is a former Conservative minister and was MP for Putney from 2005 to 2019Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Parliament returned this week if not exactly with a rush of back to school energy, then at least with the sense that the government is now back to fill what was becoming an increasingly dangerous August vacuum.When exhausted ministers retreated to lick their wounds over the summer, Nigel Farage saw his chance and took it, filling the slow news days with encouragement of protesters over asylum seeker accommodation. He was rewarded by polling showingvoters now seeimmigration – the terrain on which Reform UK is palpably desperate to fight an election, because it’s terrain on which Labour can never go far enough to please some supporters without horrifying half the rest – and not a broken economy as Britain’s biggest problem, an impression arguably only reinforced when the government’sfirst announcementon returning from recess was a crackdown on refugees bringing their families to Britain.Yet its second move, more hearteningly, was a reshuffle of economic policymaking that suggests Reform isn’t necessarily guaranteed to have everything its way this autumn.Having hiredthe former deputy governor of the Bank of England Minouche Shafik to advise him, Starmer has alsonow poachedRachel Reeves’s restless deputy Darren Jones to work for him on delivery. Both moves come ahead of an autumn budget marking what may be Labour’s last real chance to get out of its defensive crouch and move on to the attack.Do you blame migrants and the politicians who let them in for Britain’s problems, or wealthy elites plus the politicians who let them get away with too much? It’s a depressing question for anyone seeking something more inspiring than a choice of scapegoats to hate, and also arguably a trick one, given neither is obviously to blame for a small country’s struggles with low productivity plus the cumulative blows of a banking crisis, austerity, Brexit, Covid, and several years of lousy government. But it’s shaping up to be the question of the autumn anyway, for a country pulled one way by surging rightwing populism and the other by a nascent leftwing version,springing uparound the Green leadership contest and what may or may notturn out to bethe second coming of Jeremy Corbyn.A genuinely popular government could come straight through the middle, but an unpopular one risks being left for dead if its only answer to such a fundamental “whose side are you on?” question is to squeak that actually it’s more complicated than that. When forced to choose,research for the thinktank Persuasionfound 44% of Britons blame the rich for our national woes compared with 38% who blame migrants, though with some important nuances. (The over-60s are twice as likely as gen Z to blame migrants, while graduates are angrier than non-graduates at wealthy elites, despite being statistically more likely to join them.) But while Reform UK voters are unsurprisingly heavily anti-migrant, Labour voters who would consider voting Reform – the ones who stalk Downing Street’s nightmares – are still more inclined to blame the rich for their troubles.That may help explain why, when Persuasionranked imaginary Labour policiesearlier this yearby how likely they were to keep Labour 2024 voters loyal, a wealth tax on the top 1% was the second strongest contender, boosting Labour at the expense of both the GreensandReform. (Pledging to scrap human rights law and deport all asylum seekers, by contrast, actively helped the Greens recruit while cutting little ice with Reformers.) If immigration divides Labour’s big city liberal voters from their “red wall” cousins, the one thing on which they still agree is soaking the rich.None of this makes a specific levy on the 1% an intrinsically brilliant idea, popular as it is with the 99% of us who wouldn’t pay it. Any income stream reliant on a tiny handful of highly mobile multimillionaires with excellent accountants is too precarious a basis for funding public services, and even if it worked, it would be nowhere near covering the future needs of a country facing various existential challenges. But the broader principles of taxing the wealthy – that in a national crisis those with more should contribute more, and that assets get off relatively lightly compared with income under the British tax system – is one whose time has come.Rachel Reeves is under immense pressure. She must not waste her chance to ‘go big’ | Heather StewartRead moreIt’s still hugely risky territory for a chancellor with no electoral mandate for raising taxes, who promised after last year’s budget not to keep coming back for more.But a big fat political row over taxing the rich is arguably less dangerous forLabournow than getting trapped in the doom loop of arguing about immigration, and it would make life more uncomfortable for Reform, a party of the economically squeezed led by some very rich men.Over summer, the Treasury has let speculation run wild about budget tax raids on everything from inheritance to pensions, property and rental income. Many of the kites flown will ultimately come crashing to the ground, but the overall message is that the once unthinkable can at least now be considered. Whitehall has noted the rising profile of the junior Treasury minister Torsten Bell, a well-networked former adviser to chancellor Alistair Darling, among others, and a creative thinker whoargued for bold tax reformsin his recent book Great Britain? How We Get Our Future Back. (He also used to run the Resolution Foundation thinktank, which led aninquiry into the causesof economic stagnation chaired by Shafik; another Resolution employee turned MP, the economist Dan Tomlinson,joined the Treasuryin Monday’s mini-reshuffle).Last autumn’s painful budget measures were presented with much hand-wringing about how ministers really didn’t want to do this but had no choice, a strategy meant to pin blame on the last government which inadvertently left the new one sounding oddly unsure of itself. Listening to Bellarguing on airthis August with LBC’s Tom Swarbrick about Reeves’s plans to extend inheritance tax to pension pots was a reminder of what confidence sounds like. Why shouldn’t he pass unused retirement savings on to his children after his death, Swarbrick asked? Nonsense, Bell scoffed: pensions are for supporting people in old age, not avoiding inheritance tax. Like many a Treasury aide turned not remotely humble MP, he isn’t universally beloved by colleagues, but Bell knows how to put up a fight – a skill that will be in demand this autumn. For a government this far behind in the polls, everything is now going to be a battle. What matters now, as all good generals know, is picking the most favourable terrain on which to fight.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTax and spendingOpinionLabourBudgetImmigration and asylumcommentShareReuse this content"

So why is it spending billions a year subsidising business?Alexander HurstThe government is on the brink of collapse over planned austerity. Instead it must face up to the costs of its unnecessarily rigid labour marketTue 2 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTShareAs someone who has always been against austerity, I find France, with anational debt at 114% of GDPand a budget deficit of5.8% of GDP, a conundrum. Despite years of denunciation from his left and far-right opponents that Macron has engaged in “ultraneoliberalism”, there hasn’t been any. Not on a macro level, anyway, where both French government spending (57.3% of GDP)andtax receipts (51.4% of GDP) are amongthe highestin the world, including social spending, whichoutpacesany of its European neighbours.At the same time, it’s impossible to have spent the past decade in France without encountering thewidely shared perceptionand accusation that public services arein decline. Doctors and nurses denounce a labour shortage inpublic hospitals; people who live in rural areas denouncethe closingof rural train lines; students and academicsdenounce a lack of resourcesfor public universities, many of which are dealing with outdated infrastructure, and for research.Some of the responses to this aren’t strictly financial. Nearly every country in the world is dealing with a shortage of medical personnel, which in France has been exacerbated by caps on medical school admissions that werefinally liftedin 2020. And over the past 25 years, France has seen anincrease in urbanisation, from 76% to 82%. Maintaining the same level of transportation and other services to shrinking rural towns and villages would mean far higher spending per person than for those who live in cities, ultimately diverting resources fromsomething(whatever, and wherever, that is) and raising a fundamental question of fairness. The French, for their part, see the downside to the concentration of policymaking in Paris andoverwhelmingly wantmore decentralisation.Nevertheless, somehow in a country that spends a greater percentage of its budget than any other on all of these areas combined, there’s not enough money for anyone, and most are – unlike their Nordic peers – to some extent,dissatisfied. And the debt and deficit, of course, spiral into unsustainable levels. What, then, is going on?The far right blames immigration and promotes a spurious narrative that asylum seekers are to blame for the strain on social services and public resources. The centrist prime minister, François Bayrou, wants to nibble at the edges with cuts to everything, to find€44 billion a yearin savings, culminating in the absurd proposal to do away with two public holidays (aself-destructive political act so outlandish that I originally, and wrongly, I guess, assumed it was only suggested to be sacrificed in figure negotiations). The left, for its part, somewhat more reasonably argues for taxing wealth, while in practice potentially extending the proposedtax increaseeven to people making over €20,584 a year and remaining unmoved by the legitimate complaint that self-employed workers, entrepreneurs, small business owners and startups are slammed by paperwork and the administrative costs of expanding.In the midst of the disagreement over what to do about France’s finances – a debate that threatens to bring down the current French government when Bayrou holds a confidence vote on 8 September –almost nobody is having an honest conversation about the single largest component of the French government’s discretionary spending:the €211bnspent every year subsidising businesses to create jobs in a country where letting go of workers is difficult and costly, and where businesses are, as a result, hesitant to hire. France has created an unnecessarily rigid labour market (notice periods can reach up to two to three months), has ended up with an unemployment rate persistently higher thanthe EU averageand salaries that are not progressing fast enough to keep anyone content, and spends €211bn (that is, more thanon education) trying to compensate. If France instead pursuedDanish-style “flexicurity”, how much of that €211bn might otherwise be split between cutting the deficit and boosting health, education and green energy infrastructure?Let me get something on the record before I am inevitably misunderstood. Not every euro of this should be castigated: the French model of heavy state intervention in the economy is far from being misplaced. It’s one reason why, for all its problems, France maintains what may be Europe’s only “full spectrum” economy, from agriculture to AI. And if anything, it is proving to be more and more relevant as the order of the day; this has always been the way that China functioned, and it’s increasingly the way that the US is functioning.Capitalism needs direction. As just one example, in undirected capitalism, we end up with a confounding situation where different geographies race to the bottom to draw investment in datacentres that are inevitably powered by new gas turbines and drain local water resources, rather than seeing regulation and incentives direct all of them to Iceland, where they could be powered by its more-than-sufficientgeothermal energy(and the gains distributed).In the deeply imperfect past, some of this “direction” was provided by internationally agreed rules and treaties, which allowed small states to be nimble and dynamic. This has given way to a new world where nations – or a club of nations – of sufficient size can be protectionist externally and thus allow for nimble dynamism and innovation within their own internal rules. France’s problem is thus one of scale. It, like every other European nation, is too small to provide such protective external walls – a task that must fall to the EU. At least, should European leaders finally accept that the old world they cling to is not coming back.The EU cannot succeed in its current form in a world of power rather than rules, and where the US and China view geopolitics and economics holistically and don’t hesitate to throw their weight in one area behind their interests in another. The EU can, on the other hand, succeed if it adapts a classically French approach. It’s not just that France needs a wealth tax, it’s that the EU needs one; it’s not just that the French space agency needs more funding, it’s that the European Space Agency does; it’s not just that France should invest more in green energy, it’s that the EU as a whole needs energy independence through renewables.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s the subject which tests narrative forms and thinkability levels.Maybe this is why we prefer to see it as something for absurdism and satire – a way of not staring into the sun – to remember Kubrick’s (brilliant) black comedyDr Strangelove, with no fighting in the war room etc, rather than Lumet’s deadly serious Fail Safe.Bigelow, with screenwriter Noah Oppenheim, broaches one of the most frightening thoughts of all: that a nuclear war could or rather will start with no one knowing who started it or who ended it. I watched this film with translucently white knuckles but also that strange climbing nausea that only this topic can create.View image in fullscreenKyle Allen as Capt Jon Zimmer in A House of DynamitePhotograph: Eros Hoagland/NetflixThe drama is recounted in one 18-minute segment, repeated from various standpoints and various locations: 18 minutes being the time estimated to elapse between military observers reporting the out-of-the-blue launch of a nuke from the Pacific and its projected arrival in Chicago.The action plays out in a series of situation rooms and command-and-control suites with acronyms like PEOC (Presidential Emergency Operations Center) featuring military and civilian personnel in banks of desks, generally in a shallow horseshoe shape facing a very big screen flashing up the threat level from Defcon 2 to Defcon 1 and also showing a large map displaying the missile’s current position, which is occasionally replaced with what amounts to a Zoom mosaic of tense faces belonging to high-ranking officials with no idea what to do, dialling in chaotically from their smartphones.Rebecca Ferguson plays intelligence analyst Capt Olivia Walker, Tracy Letts is the gung ho military chief Gen Anthony Brady – this drama’s equivalent of the cold war’s Gen Curtis LeMay – who advocates an immediate pre-emptive counterstrike before the incoming missile arrives, Jared Harris is the defense secretary Reid Baker who realises that his estranged daughter is in Chicago, Gabriel Basso plays the brilliant and flustered young NSA adviser Jake Baerington who, if this was an Aaron Sorkin script, could be relied on to save the day.View image in fullscreenGabriel Basso as Jake Baerington in A House of Dynamite.Photograph: Eros Hoagland/NetflixJonah Hauer-King plays the thin-faced, priestly naval officer Lt Cmdr Robert Reeves who accompanies the president at all times with a ring-bound folder with the nuclear strike options and authorisation codes.Idris Elbaplays the president himself, who, like George W Bush finding out about 9/11 at an infants’ school, gets the news about the missile while cheerfully demonstrating basketball shots in front of high-schoolers.Frantically, the White House staff try to intercept the missile, and in the event of failure, must decide if they should not respond in kind, effectively sacrifice an American city with millions of lives and risk appeasing the aggressor or launch a retaliation and risk world war three – or even gamble that the missile will not detonate. And they can’t decide if this is a rogue launch from the North Koreans or another nuclear power, born of a fanatical desperation that no one has guessed at. This unknowing, this chaos, operating outside the long understood tradition of mutually assured destruction between two sides is what the film suggests will be the origin of a new war.Bigelow’s movie has the classic personae from what might be called the nuclear apocalypse film: the careworn, grey-haired officials who always guessed it might come to this; the smart, hard-working younger staff doing their loyal, patriotic best, the utterly unreflective young bomber pilots entrusted with delivering the final blow. And all with the sculpted or painted faces of Ike and Lincoln in the White House looking impassively down.View image in fullscreenA House of Dynamite.Photograph: Eros Hoagland/NetflixWhat the film shrewdly shows is the horribly ironic transitional moments: along with the heart-stopping intel about the missile, the screens are, at first, still showing ordinary news – headlines such as “Rental demand driving up prices”, now remnants of a lost world.There are times when A House of Dynamite might seem melodramatic or stagey and yet maybe that is how it may well feel in the highest reaches of power – with everyone looking and feeling like actors in elaborate costumes whose roles had only one purpose: to deter aggression, a purpose which is now obsolete. It is a big chill.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalKathryn BigelowIdris ElbaNuclear weaponsFestivalsUS politicsreviewsShareReuse this content"

To celebrate, the people of Helsinki dressed up for the world’s weirdest runDavey BrettTue 2 Sep 2025 11.27 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 13.19 EDTShareIt’s 3.45pm on a Sunday in Helsinki’s Kaivopuisto park and I’m warming-up near a man dressed as the city’s cathedral. A headdress of neoclassical domes sets the outfit off, but it’s the Senate Square cathedral steps that have won him the best outfit award at the inauguralDarude Sandstorm Run. For Daniel Erickson, who has travelled from New York especially, it’s well-deserved.The Darude Sandstorm Run is a suitably silly marker of 25 years of both Finnish DJ Darude’s career and the release of the music video for Sandstorm. First released inFinlandin 1999, the track is a trance earworm notable for itsdu-du-du-du-duriff, as if being emitted from some futuristic pan pipes. It went global the following year, along with a semi-iconic music video shot in Helsinki, viewed 306m times on YouTube. I, Erickson and 825 others are now gearing up to run the route documented in its cops-and-robbers storyline.Sandstorm remains a staple of sporting events, is loved by sports stars – swimmer Michael Phelps used to listen to it before winning Olympic gold medals, citing the energy it gave him – and has found a constantly evolving place in internet culture, making it a platinum-seller in the UK and the US. Whethersomebody is playing it on a potatoor it’sbeing used as the sound for a sandstorm alarm in the Gobi Desert, it’s one of Finland’s most recognisable pop culture exports.The track has taken Darude, real name Toni-Ville Henrik Virtanen, around the world, playing live in over 80 countries including recent stops in Japan and Guyana. Speaking from Chicago a week prior to the run, he looks back fondly at the support Sandstorm received in the UK from DJs Pete Tong and Judge Jules. It then went to No 3 in the charts.But, he says, “my last five or 10 years of relevancy I definitely owe to gaming and the meme culture that revolves around that.” The track is particularly popular with players of online multiplayer battle arena game League of Legends; “Darude – Sandstorm” is now a stock response to anyone requesting a track ID on gaming streams.Beyond the track’s infernal catchiness, it’s not clear why Sandstorm took off as a soundtrack of choice among Call of Duty streamers in the late 00s, but its use snowballed as internet culture developed and the US EDM boom hit. YouTube putting a Darude button on its player for April Fools’ Day in 2015, which added a second of Sandstorm to any video on its site, cemented its meme legacy. I get the sense Darude is conflicted by his song’s strange legacy: “My crowd has gotten younger, which is obviously key to my ongoing career,” he says pragmatically. “But also, I’ve met people in their 40s or 50s at my shows with their 18-year-old kids. It’s really cool when someone young comes over and says: ‘I was five or six when my mom and dad played your stuff in the car. Now I’m here.’”Back in Helsinki, people from 17 countries have amassed for our 6.7km run. We are encouraged to take pictures matching images from a free locations booklet along the way and Darude has curated a special playlist for the event on Spotify (spoiler: it’s Sandstorm on repeat). Some runners are clad in gilets and carrying silver briefcases in honour of the video.There is a brief moment 30 seconds after the start where I think I could possibly win, but then the downhill past the Kaivopuisto fence makes way for the slightest of climbs and my pace drops to a painful crawl across the city’s cobbled streets. I try to picture a young Darude along the way, clad inthosewraparound glasses, doingthatcrouched pose.View image in fullscreenNo escaping it … runners pose in costume.Photograph: Tom Little/Reuters“I had very little to do with the music video, but it was an awesome experience,” Darude tells me, adding that director Juuso Syrjä would go on to direct various Nordic noir shows, including Netflix’s Border Town. “There were so many cool people that pulled together for the video and the follow-up ones, and so many of us had actual careers come out of it.”He has the air of a man who’d quite like to be known for more than one hit, but who has also made his peace with the fact that he probably won’t be. “Sandstorm has life of its own, and it’s bigger than me,” he says. “But if people know Sandstorm, I just hope they come and see me live somewhere. I can show them what I do. I’m there partying with them – that’s when I’m at my happiest.”Back at the park I arrive very much not in first place at a rapturous finish line, soundtracked by Darude himself on the decks, selflessly lifting, dropping and remixing the track for an entire hour so that everyone can experience their own unique piece of Sandstorm history. A queue forms for merch signing and one by one Darude politely signs everything given to him. “Let’s have a break from thedududus,” he says to the crowd, thanking them for coming before playing some music that isn’t Sandstorm.Darude plays a 25th anniversary concert atKattilahalli, Helsinki, 6 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsDance musicPop and rockFinlandEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We brave the hot tents and random ravers to see what they’re likeIman AmraniTue 2 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 07.35 EDTShareAs a DJ plays MJ Cole’s UK garage classic Crazy Love, adults across London’s Cross the Tracks festival lift up little children in brightly coloured ear-defenders to dance. A smile spreads across my baby son’s face as he bounces his body, finding something that looks like rhythm. Later that day, my daughter snuggles into my chest in her carrier as I dance to songs by Ezra Collective that she has heard in the car many times.My mum took me to Reading festival when I was 16 and as I’ve grown up there have been new ones to match the seasons of my life. Then came motherhood: last year I became a single parent to a pair of delicious, curious, boisterous twin babies. But I don’t want to stop indulging my inner child alongside my actual children, and I’m determined to keep music festivals in my life.It’s not just me: Camp Bestival, already firmly family friendly, had an 155% rise in weekend camping tickets for two- to four-year-olds this year. A Ticketmaster study of 2,000 people last month found that 42% of parents see festivals as a genuine alternative to a traditional family holiday, and 73% said festivals were better than other family trips in terms of introducing kids to new cultural experiences. International travel is expensive and daunting, but a festival – while not without its own costs and potential stresses – seems to me to be an enhanced staycation.View image in fullscreenIman and kids get playing in the fields at Green Man festival.Photograph: Kirsty McLachlanSo, buoyed up by my one-day warmup at Cross the Tracks, I decided to embark on two weekend festivals in the countryside. Wilderness, in Oxfordshire, is often described as the poshest festival in Britain, which sounds awful, but the festival’s own promise of “wholesome hedonism” intrigues me. When I arrive, an impressive number of children are being carted around in trolleys filled with pillows and blankets, and lovingly decorated with fairy lights. The effect these kiddie chariots have on the landscape at night is mystical, alongside the light installations set up around the enormous trees.Eloise and Fernand, both in their 30s, have come from south London with their two-year-old son and are staying in the family camping area. Eloise praises the “massive sense of community” with parents posting on a Facebook group for the kid supplies they’re missing, and Fernard calls it “a utopia – it’s almost disarming because everyone’s so nice”.Call me the fairest of fair-weather campers, but I knew that if I was going to really enjoy these weekends and treat them as our holidays for the year, we’d have to be arriving at pre-erected accommodation. These options start at £623 while the furnished one I got hosted in would have set us back £1,600 – but regular family camping tickets cost £238 and kids under six go free.I also brought a pop-up playpen, which saved my life. Hoodies and hats that covered their ears were useful when the temperatures dropped at night and also provided some light protection when the ear defenders weren’t going on. My biggest fear was that the babies would escape the tent, so having their mobility restricted with cosy baby sleep bags was reassuring. The best thing you can bring with you to a festival with little ones, though, is the right attitude. You’ve got to just surrender and adapt to what’s going on; you’re probably not going to make all the sets you might want but that’s not the point any more.Clinical psychologist Dr Martha Deiros Collado is at the book tent on Sunday to speak about her bookHow to Be the Grown-Up. Like the rest of us, she’s let go of routine and nap times for the weekend. “Time is so restrictive of the choices that you make in day to day life,” she says. “But when you’re in a festival like this, responsibility kind of goes out of the window. Obviously you still have to keep an eye on your kids, but there is more freedom.”People ask: why would you go to a festival and dump your children? But it’s not like thatTanya Jelley, Mortimer NanniesParents at festivals are the first to get up, alongside their children: who needs a cockerel when you’ve got two small humans in a hot tent? Early risers at Wilderness head to theFamilyField, a thoughtful, sensory curation of performances, crafts, installations, and a soft play tent for the tiniest ones. It also hosts Mortimer Nannies, who work with Wilderness as well as Camp Bestival and others, and have their own dreamland nursery with fancy dress, crafts and more. “Most people don’t know that festival childcare exists,” says company founder Tanja Jelley. “Or when they do, they ask why you would go to a festival and dump your children. But it’s not like that: it’s two and a half hours where you can just go and breathe for a bit.”At £75 for the four-hour evening sessions, it’s not cheap, but it’s a staff ratio of one-to-one or one-to-two children. There’s also a premium service of private nannies who go out to individual tents or accommodation for £45 an hour looking after up to three children. The food scene is a big thing at Wilderness, and can be similarly expensive: as I’m on the press guest list we are invited to a chef’s table dinner from Andy Beynon of Michelin-starred Hackney restaurant Behind, which is normally £160 a seat. I never spent money like that on food even before I became a single mum, so we enjoy ourselves and no one bats an eyelid when I start breastfeeding.I didn’t want to like the very bougie Wilderness as much as I did – but it really had the wow factor. In future years I would rope in more people to help put tents up, as the best bits for me and the kids were included in the basic ticket: the twins were in awe of everything in the main areas, poking their heads out of the pushchair to get a better view.A few weekends later we head toGreen Manin Wales, where the setting in the valleys of Bannau Brycheiniog (formerly the Brecon Beacons) gives it the edge over every other festival that I’ve been to. The babies bliss out to the South African a cappella group the Joy as the sun shines down, and I take them to dip their little toes in a stream where lots of other kids are doing the same.View image in fullscreen‘A pop-up playpen saved my life!’ Iman and her children in front of the main stage at Green Man.Photograph: Kirsty McLachlanLittle Folk, their version of Wilderness’s Family Field, caters to babies and children up to 12 years old, and there’s a separate area for children above that age. An adult weekend ticket for Green Man is £275 but a week-long “settlement pass” ticket for £350 (with a range of sub-£50 children’s ticket prices depending on age) allows you to turn the festival into a longer family holiday. (Be quick when they go on sale: last year all 25,000 tickets sold out in an hour, 11 months before the event.)Fiona Stewart, the founder of Green Man and a single mother herself, says that across the British festival scene, potential brand partners “are keen on [sponsoring] children’s areas as they want to attract early adopters, and the children’s market is massive”. But Stewart says she dislikes “the way children are manipulated by the media. So Little Folk is a safe friendly space with play, performance, fun and discovery without any of those distractions” – like the whole festival, it’s free from heavy-handed corporate branding.Green Man festival review – Kneecap and CMAT lead the charge in a utopian Welsh idyllRead moreAt both Wilderness and Green Man, the adult world comes more alive as we’re heading to bed, but Stewart explains that striking the balance between families and those who come child-free is about “investing equally in areas for both”. There are corners that cater more directly to the needs of different age groups which helps things feel more cohesive in the shared main spaces. One of my favourite memories of Green Man will be when my twins tottered into the fringes of the Chai Wallahs tent to some soulful house, and a group of adults having a good time started hyping up their dance moves.I’m at an age where half of my peers are having kids and the other half are very much enjoying child-free lives, and it’s heartening to have festivals that don’t try to divide these groups. Someone told me this summer that being a mother is like being part-fairy, part-witch – and the most natural setting for a fairy-witch and her kids is always going to be somewhere we can suspend reality and enjoy the magic like this.Explore more on these topicsMusic festivalsFestivalsGreen ManChildrenParents and parentingFamilyChildcarefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A new documentary charts the extraordinary rise, fall – and rise again – of France’s ‘most wanted’ creativeCath SlessorTue 2 Sep 2025 10.33 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 12.18 EDTShareVariously described as an “architect, painter, novelist, communist and convicted fraudster”, Fernand Pouillon’s life was punctuated by abrupt reversals of fortune that might have sprung from the pages of Dickens or Dumas. Throughout an eventful career, he ricocheted from intoxicating success, to financial scandal, prison, exile and eventual rehabilitation.In 1985, when Pouillon was in his early 70s, he was awarded the Légion d’Honneur by President François Mitterrand. Yet just over 20 years earlier, Pouillon found himself in custody awaiting trial on charges of corruption. As a prolific architect-developer who had designed gargantuan housing schemes inFranceand Algeria, he was accused of funding irregularities and violating laws contrived to keep the processes of design and construction separate.View image in fullscreenA more nuanced alternative to ‘brave new world’ modernism … Old Port, Marseille, postwar development by Pouillon.Photograph: suppliedStaging a hunger strike, he was moved to a prison infirmary, from which he escaped by shinning down a rope smuggled in by his brother. On the run for eight months, he was dubbed “France’s most wanted architect”, before, with exquisite sangfroid, he turned up by taxi to the Parisian courthouse on the day his trial was due to begin. Sentenced to four years in jail, he passed the time by writing Les Pierres Sauvages (The Wild Stones), a bestselling novel about the construction of the medieval Cistercian abbey at Le Thoronet in Provence. The protagonist is a master builder who overcomes exacting working conditions and sceptical peers by dint of sheer willpower.Known as “Pouillon le manifique”, Pouillon was an iconoclast who relished the trappings of success. At one point he reportedly owned a Bentley, an Alfa Romeo, two chateaux, townhouses in Algiers and Paris, and a yacht. Photographs of the time show a suave, sharply suited man, with a luxuriant quiff of jet black hair, like a Gallic Bryan Ferry.His rise and fall is the subject of Fernand Pouillon: France’s Most Wanted Architect, a 2023 film by French documentary film-maker Jean-Marie Montangerand. “His personality and his antics overshadowed his work,” says Montangerand. “But his system was to build better, cheaper and faster than others so that everyone could live decently. He thought that beauty should not just be the privilege of the most well-off.” Showing for the first time in the UK, it examines Pouillon’s life and exploits, with current and historic footage of his housing in Paris, Marseille and Algiers.View image in fullscreenA modern architect but not a modernist … children in the central concourse of the Climat de France housing scheme, Algiers.Photograph: suppliedPouillon remains a divisive figure. But in spite of his entanglements, his architecture has endured, its qualities becoming more appreciated over time by users and critics. Attuned to the historic form and dynamics of cities, his buildings have come to be seen as a more nuanced alternative to the “brave new world” ethos of modernism.His quartet of 1950s housing developments in Paris imitate the historic grain and texture of the city, with courtyards, loggias, gardens and promenades. And in the postwar heyday of concrete, he unfashionably favoured stone as a building material. “I hated the ugliness of render, the colour of concrete,” he declared in his 1968 autobiography. “For me, the century of reinforced concrete posed problems of appearance, of surface, of the skin of the building.” He favoured the creamy limestone of Provence, in its hefty, traditional, load-bearing form, as opposed to thin sheets clipped to a steel or concrete frame that constitute most of today’s “stone” buildings.“Pouillon was a modern architect but he was not a modernist,” argue Adam Caruso and Helen Thomas, who compiled one of the first English language monographs on Pouillon, nearly 30 years after his death in 1986. “He was modern in the sense that Édouard Manet was a supremely modern painter: attentive to the history of art and to the inevitable and necessary continuity of culture, while at the same time being fascinated and enmeshed in the appearances and social mores of contemporary life that played out around him.”What emerges from Montangerand’s film is a man driven by ambition, building at dizzying speed and volume in the often chaotic ferment of France’s postwar economic boom. As Pouillon himself put it, “200 housing units built in 200 days for 200 million francs”. Yet he disdained the rabbit-hutch mentality of modernist mass housing – thegrands ensemblesthat were springing up in and around French cities. “Imagine the sadness of all the people who, after working all day, leave their offices to sit in their rooms as if they’re being punished,” he wrote.Unlike Le Corbusier, the imperator of modernism, and a contemporary (though the two never met), Pouillon recoiled from theory and abstraction. For him, architecture was about building well and building efficiently, like the speculative developers of the Georgian and Victorian eras, optimising managerial processes and construction techniques to address specific economic and social needs. He understood the city as a network of public spaces, each with a different character to be experienced on the ground. “I build for the pedestrian, not the airplane captain,” he asserted.View image in fullscreenConstruction using faster, more efficient building techniques … on site at one of Pouillon’s Algerian projects.Photograph: suppliedHis career first took off when commissioned to rebuild large tracts of Marseille, razed by wartime bombing and Nazi destruction. In January 1943 about 30,000 people were forcibly evicted from the historic Panier (“basket”) quarter housing immigrants and refugees, with 2,000 dwellings demolished by explosives.Pouillon’s reconstruction respects and reinstates the area’s scale and street pattern. New housing blocks feature workshops at ground level and humanising details, such as balconies enclosed by timber lattices. Down by the Old Port, a series of long, stone volumes resembling 19th-century dockside warehouses extend along the Marseille waterfront, now the haunt of tourists and flâneurs who might never notice the small plaque placed on one of the walls denoting Pouillon as the architect.Pouillon’s design skill and his ability to navigate between the competing interests of politicians, planners and bureaucrats caught the eye of the mayor of Algiers, Jacques Chevallier, who enlisted him to provide dwellings for the city’s expanding population, as opposition to France’s colonial rule intensified. Between 1953 and 1959, Pouillon oversaw the construction of three major residential projects, among themClimat de France, the largest housing project in north Africa at the time, with 3,500 dwellings designed to accommodate over 30,000 inhabitants structured around an expansive central square or maidan.While Pouillon publicly disavowed colonialism, his buildings were nonetheless part of an impetus to subjugate the Algerian Muslim population. Ultimately, however, they were co-opted by the very people they were meant to control. Ringed by 200 three-storey high limestone columns, the monumental maidan at the heart of Climat de France became a familiar backdrop to political protest, from the Algerian war of independence to more recent confrontations during the Arab spring.View image in fullscreenA haven … Belcastel, Aveyron, France, the 11th century castle (and village) restored by Pouillon up to his death.Photograph: Hemis/Alamy“People have gradually taken ownership of these spaces, transforming and repurposing them,” says Montangerand. “The children of Climat de France now proudly declare themselves to live in ‘the Pouillon city’.Architectureshould be judged by the amount of life it allows to develop, which is why Pouillon’s work still resonates.”Eventually released from prison in 1965, but shunned by the French establishment, Pouillon returned to Algeria, where he found a more receptive milieu in the country’s post-independence era, designing housing, universities, hotels and tourist infrastructure. In 1971 he received an official government pardon, a tacit acknowledgment that his downfall may have been politically as well as professionally motivated.Aided by Algerian craftsmen, Pouillon’s final years were spent painstakingly restoring an ninth-century chateau in Belcastel in the south of France, not unlike his master builder protagonist in Les Pierres Sauvages.When Le Corbusier died, his coffin was reverentially paraded through the courtyard of the Louvre accompanied by torch-bearers in military uniform. Conversely, Pouillon was not one for posthumous pomp. Today, he lies buried in Belcastel cemetery, in an unmarked grave. His many monuments are elsewhere.Fernand Pouillon: France’s Most Wanted Architect is atthe Barbican, London, on 4 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsArchitectureFranceDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Into a stack of welded steel boxes resembling an apartment block in a city that could be anywhere, Hatoum has melted or blasted holes imitating drone or missile strikes. Parts of interior walls and floors have been shorn away to look like apartments with their fronts blown off. This is the shell of what was once a home to many, emptied out by war, like the buildings you saw on the news last night.Hatoum created Bourj, which means “tower” in Arabic, for an exhibition in Beirut, the city where she was born into a Palestinian family in 1952. Since 1975 she has been based in London but her art knows no peace. Home and family are perforated by violence. A steel cot resembling a prison cell has cheese wire in place of a soft mattress. A kitchen with small chairs for the kids, alongside larger ones for mum and dad, has been incinerated, and the carbonised fragments of wooden furniture painstakingly reassembled inside wire mesh replicas of what they looked like before the disaster.In a work made this year, a baby’s disembodied arm lies on the ground. Cast from glass it could almost be cute, like a little handprint on a kitchen wall. Except you know it’s not. It filters a horror too terrible to look at or even think about directly: the reality of what happens when you bomb children.View image in fullscreenCarbonised fragments … a detail from Hatoum’s  Remains of the Day, 2016-2018.Photograph: White Cube/Kitmin Lee/© Mona HatoumWhat, you may wonder, has all this to do with Alberto Giacometti, the Swiss modern sculptor who died in 1966? A lot, it turns out. This is the second in a series of exhibitions that juxtapose Giacometti with contemporary artists.In the first, he was made to look old and safe by the wildly creative Huma Bhabha, but this is a more complex, reciprocal conversation – between Hatoum and an artist she loves, or at least finds common cause with against a terrifying world. Her cheese wire prison cot, Incommunicado, stands next to Giacometti’s most brutal work, his 1932 bronze Woman with Her Throat Cut: a sprawled body on the ground, opened up like an anatomical model, resembling a giant praying mantis with a long, exposed oesophagus and a head that is a tiny screaming mask.Giacometti was part of the surrealist movement when he created this splayed frenzy. Does it wallow in the macabre? Hatoum suggests you have to do that to capture the violence of reality in art. Close by she places her piece A Bigger Splash: six giant, blood-red splashes that she cast in glass in a workshop in Murano. Most artists working in Venice would be inspired by sunsets or canals but for Hatoum it’s always blood. She –unlike David Hockney, whom she mocks with her title – can’t forget the world’s anguish. And she sees a fellow spirit in Giacometti.View image in fullscreenA cartoon kitty on the prowl … Giacometti’s The Cat, 1951.Photograph: Fondation GiacomettiThat empathy with an artist who died when she was 14 takes an extraordinary twist when they create a joint work. Giacometti’s The Nose, made in 1947, looks like the grinning skull of a commedia dell’ arte clown, out of which sprouts a thin spear of a nose. Here, it is displayed inside Hatoum’s prison-cell-like Cube, a steel cage just big enough for a person. Their “joint” artwork is an unholy installation of nihilistic despair. Giacometti’s carnivalesque death mask – he said it grew out of watching people die, their noses appearing to enlarge as their cheeks sank – is a prisoner in Hatoum’s image of authority, abuse, oppression.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She is today’s Picasso’Read moreWhat the two share is a seriousness about life, a refusal to shy away from the modern world’s pain. But Hatoum’s eye for Giacometti’s black humour also leads her to include his delightful 1954 sculpture Cat, a long, slender cartoon kitty on a permanent prowl. It’s the feline equivalent of his walking human figures, and while they resemble Etruscan funeral statuettes, this puss looks like an Egyptian mummified feline. Archaeology is for both these artists a bedrock of the human. Near Giacometti’s cat, Hatoum shows her Terracotta Tile, a red tile with a dog’s paw-print in it – her homage to ancient Roman tiles that still preserve the prints of pooches who died 2,000 years ago.Sculpture has changed a lot since Giacometti’s death but this series proves what magnificent power it has in our century. Hatoum shares Giacometti’s grief, terror and compassion even though their attitude to media is very different. Back in 1985 she walked doggedly through Brixton, barefoot, with Doctor Marten boots tied to her ankles. The video of this performance is shown here close to a Giacometti striding statuette. She pounds the streets, watched by puzzled passers by, dragging the weight of those empty boots – the weight of the world.Mona Hatoum Encounters: Giacometti is atthe Barbican, London, from 3 September to 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsSculptureArtAlberto GiacomettiPalestinian territoriesExhibitionsBarbicanreviewsShareReuse this content"

But a new documentary premiering at Venice calls for its redemptionGeoffrey MacnabTue 2 Sep 2025 05.26 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 19.25 EDTShare‘Evokes not terror but laughter.” “A movie for morons, a total cheesy rip-off that makes not one minute of coherent sense.” “The stupidest major movie ever made.” These were some of the milder responses from reviewers to Exorcist II: The Heretic, one of the most notorious disasters in Hollywood history, on its release in 1977. Its director,John Boorman, says he felt utterly humiliated and close to despair. “I considered my choices. The first was to commit suicide. The second was to defect to Russia,” the chastened director told one interviewer. He asked another if he could atone for his film by “immolating myself on Hollywood Boulevard”.What was the problem? Audiences had, most likely, been looking for shock and horror, revolving heads and vomit, but Boorman gave them metaphysics and surrealism instead – and they weren’t standing for it. That’s why many jeered, laughed, hurled popcorn at the screen, and even – according to William Friedkin, director of the original Exorcist, who called the sequel a “horrible picture” – chasedstudio executives down the street. Viewers were nonplussed by a plot that had Linda Blair’s Regan, the traumatised girl from the first movie, now turned into an all-American tap dancing teenager. For some reason, she is undergoing a course of hypnotic therapy on a Bakelite “synchroniser” machine operated by a brusque, no-nonsense psychiatrist played by Louise Fletcher (Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest).The film broke box office records on its opening weekend – because the public was desperate to see the follow-up to the first film. Word of mouth was terrible and ticket sales quickly plummeted. A distraught Boorman re-cut the picture days after its release (just as Michael Cimino would do with his equally ill-fated western Heaven’s Gate a couple of years later).View image in fullscreenFletcher, Blair and Richard Burton on the set of Exorcist II: The Heretic.Photograph: Sunset Boulevard/Corbis/Getty ImagesThe story of one of the “biggest disasters in movie history” is told in David Kittredge’s new documentary Boorman and the Devil, which screens for the first time at theVenice film festivalthis week. Exorcist-loving British critic Mark Kermode may have called its follow up “clearly the worst film ever made by anyone ever”, but Kittredge’s entertaining and exhaustively researched documentary makes a strong case that it’s time to look at Boorman’s folly again. This was the English director at the peak of his powers. He was self-consciously making a big budget studio-based movie in the vein of Powell and Pressburger’s Black Narcissus (which famously recreated the Himalayas in Pinewood studios). Boorman shot almost the entire film, including the African scenes, on sound stages in Burbank, California. To its admirers, The Heretic is far richer, more humanistic and less misogynistic than the infinitely more successful Friedkin original, one of the highest-grossing movies ever made.Kittredge says he was a teenager when first saw the film on a Betamax video in the re-edited European version. He “didn’t love it” then but it still got under his skin. “I thought it was really, really fascinating,” he tells me. This was a Hollywood blockbuster made as if it was “an experimental art house picture”. Boorman himself later admitted some regrets. He desperately wanted his friend Jon Voight, with whom he worked on Deliverance, to star as Father Philip Lamont, the grizzled protagonist looking evil in the eye. Voight, who once wanted to train for the priesthood, was initially keen but, as Boorman explains in the documentary, turned the role down on the grounds that “at this particular time, he was thinking about becoming a Jew because his researches into Christianity led him to the belief that Christianity was a heresy of Judaism”. A youthful Christopher Walken was also up for the role but had a stomach bug and flunked his audition. That’s why Richard Burton, fresh from his Broadway success in Equus, landed the role.View image in fullscreenA fraught production … L to r, Linda Blair and director John Boorman on set, The Heretic, 1977.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIt was a fraught production which seemed dogged with misfortune from the outset, as if Pazuzu (the story’s trademark demon) had damned it in advance. One of the lead actors (Lee J Cobb) died of a heart attack before production began. Cast and crew fell ill; Linda Blair reminiscences in the documentary about how she almost fell off a skyscraper, while Boorman himself became dangerously sick with valley fever, causing the production to grind to a halt.Kittredge’s thesis is a familiar one: the failure of The Heretic and of all those other equally idiosyncratic and ambitious movies of the era – The Missouri Breaks, New York, New York, 1941, Sorcerer and Heaven’s Gate among them – changed the way the US studios operated. The bean counters all noticed that George Lucas’s Star Wars, released a few weeks before The Heretic, had grossed over $775m. This led to an immediate studio backlash against auteur film-making and a plunge instead into the world of juvenile galactic franchises.The Heretic was certainly an object lesson on how not to do a sequel – and that was the problem. Boorman regarded it as a “riposte” to Friedkin’s original, not a follow-up at all. He and several of the actors embarked on the film precisely because they didn’t like its predecessor, which they regarded as sadistic and exploitative. “Boorman told me he made the film to attack the first film. Max von Sydow [who played Father Merrin] felt the same way, and that the first one was exploitation and child abuse,” says film historian Joseph McBride, who was a journalist for Variety when The Heretic was being made.After the disastrous premiere, the producer Richard Lederer recommended Boorman talk with McBride, “if you need a friend”. McBride spoke with Boorman three or four times. By then, Boorman was desperately trying to re-edit the film and take out the moments that had left audiences tittering. McBride describes this as “a misguided mission … he was mutilating his own film which I think is a really great film. It’s a very serious, very moving and visually spectacular.”Ironically, the original version released in the US was protected from its director’s tinkering by Warner Bros itself because it was going to be too expensive to make new prints.View image in fullscreenFletcher in the film.Photograph: Cinetext/Warner Bros/AllstarAttempts to reclaim once-vilified movies as misunderstood masterpieces can seem like special pleading – or a cynical attempt to squeeze out a little extra revenue from a justly forgotten film. Even so, Kittredge makes a strong case for admitting The Heretic into the canon. There is astonishing Steadicam work from Garrett Brown (later to work on Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining); Ennio Morricone’s mesmerising score; Richard Macdonald’s stylised production design; buzzy mind-bending shots from a locust-eye point of view; a rip-roaring race back to Georgetown to confront the evil one; and, above all, the sheer, crazy ambition of Boorman’s storytelling.Boorman, now 92, rebuilt his career with successes such as Excalibur, The Emerald Forest and Hope and Glory, but, as he acknowledges to Kittredge, the “the old wound” opened by the failure of Heretic has never fully healed. He still clings to the belief that if the film had been released separately fromThe Exorcist, it would have been received far more warmly.Was there really a hex on the movie? Kittredge, who has spent seven years making his own documentary, isn’t sure, but admits that when a friend gave him a Pazuzu statue, he says he was far too afraid even to take it out of the box. Now, though, he hopes any curse is lifting and that audiences will realise that, at the very least, this is one of the 70s’ most unfairly neglected and misunderstood movies.Boorman and the Devil screens at the Venice film festival on 5 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmJohn BoormanThe ExorcistHorror filmsDocumentary filmsVenice film festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I could direct him now. If he would let me direct him now that he’s president, I think I could do wonders.”In Allen’s ensemble film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Trump has a fleeting scene in which he’s interviewed about his forthcoming projects by a TV reporter.In a rare – scripted – instance of irony and deprecation, Trump replies that he’s “working on buying St Patrick’s Cathedral. Maybe doing a little rip-down job and putting up a very, very tall and beautiful building.”Allen went on to say that Trump had a “charismatic quality” in front of the camera, was “pleasant, very professional, very polite” and that he was “surprised he wanted to go into politics”.He continued: “Politics is nothing but headaches and critical decisions and agony. This was a guy I used to see at the Knicks games, and he liked to play golf, and he liked to judge beauty contests and he liked to do things that were enjoyable and relaxing. Why anyone would want to suddenly have to deal with the issues of politics is beyond me.”Woody Allen rebuts Ukrainian condemnation over Moscow film festival appearanceRead moreAllen declared that he had personally voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. “I disagree with many, almost all, not all, but almost all of [Trump’s] politics, of his policies.”He concluded: “I would like to direct him now as president and let me make the decisions. But that’s not gonna happen.”Allen, whose films are often homages to Russian literature, recently attracted criticism for his virtual attendance at a Moscow film festival honouring the director.In astatement issued afterwards, Allen clarified that “when it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong”.Explore more on these topicsFilmWoody AllenDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The title of Hundred Year Hunger was inspired by a new book of the same name by E Mark Windle about the history of chronic malnutrition and deprivation in Gaza and will raise money for the Amos Trust’s Gaza Appeal.Writing on Instagram, the British protest singer said that the song “looks at the current famine that Israel has created inGazathrough the lens of a century of enforced food insecurity and malnutrition imposed on the Palestinian people, firstly by British imperialism, then as a weapon of mass displacement by the state of Israel”.The song was released to coincide with a newhumanitarian aid flotilla – with Greta Thunberg among their number – setting sail from Barcelonato try to “break the illegal siege of Gaza”, organisers said. The intention is to open a humanitarian corridor and deliver aid to an area gripped by famine. It is expected to arrive in mid-September. Israel previously blocked two attempts by activists to deliver aid by ship to Gaza.Last week, an Israel military spokesperson said it would no longer pause fighting to allow aid deliveries in Gaza city, a decision likely to intensify the famine in the northern part of the territory.“Now my children ask me why the watching world is standing by / While Israel creates famine as a weapon in their war,” Bragg sings in the track.The chorus of the song is in Arabic. Bragg explained that “sumud” translates as “steadfastness or perseverance. It is used by Palestinians to describe their nonviolent everyday resistance against Israel’s occupation. Sumud emphasises the commitment of the Palestinian people to remain on their land despite hardship and oppression, elevating their everyday existence into a form of resistance.”A second term, “lan narhal”, Bragg wrote, “translates as ‘we will not leave’. Together ‘Sumud! Sumud! Lan narhal’ conveys the determination of the Palestinian people to refuse to be displaced.”On 20 September, Bragg is hosting a Palestine benefit gig, Days Like These, at London’s O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire, featuring acts including Jamie Webster, Billy Nomates, Antony Szmierek, Reverend and the Makers and Big Special, to support the Amos Trust’s Gaza Appeal. He previously expressed his support for the Irish rap trio Kneecap, charged with allegedly displaying a flag supporting the proscribed terrorist organisation Hezbollah last year.Bragg said in May: “The charging of Kneecap’s Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh with a terrorism offence by the Metropolitan Police is the latest development of a disturbing and broader trend over the past few years during which the state has sought to criminalise creative expression.”Bragg released his last album, The Million Things That Never Happened, in 2021.Explore more on these topicsBilly BraggGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaGreta ThunbergnewsShareReuse this content"

I believe it was around 2009, when MasterChef Australia took off, with its explosions and tears and plate-throwing; of course we ruthlessly exported it, like the Hemsworths.Along the way, cooking went from being an act of service to an extreme sport. As a result, you can now watch people shout and cry as they decorate a mille-feuille on most of the streamers. Cooking is now a form of combat – there are Cake Wars, Cupcake Wars and Culinary Class Wars – and frequently, pure spectacle. You can make a cake that looks like a lifesize Superman (ahem,Super Mega Cakes) – but, as I said out loud while watching two contestants have a fight about time management, when is someone going tofucking eat something?Most new cooking shows are not really about food at all, but drama. In my mind, the best are made by people who don’t really want to be on TV – so out with wannabe reality types and, as much I believe both Jamie and Nigella genuinely love food, there is something gratingly artificial about his puppyish enthusiasm and her seductive verbosity, so out with them too. I much prefer the passionate, quiet, awkward types who get roped into doing telly: think Nigel Slater, Simon Hopkinson, Julia Child, Adam Liaw, Kylie Kwong or Nadiya Hussain.And – of course – The Cook and the Chef. It is a 20-year-old show that looks about 40. It was an ABC show, but these days it serves as punctuation for SBS Food to break up 300 episodes ofThe Cook Up. God, I love it. It helps that it was filmed on my native soil, in South Australia. It was a balm whenever I felt homesick 16,000km away in London – and it still is, 800km away in Melbourne. But mostly I just love it for being all about the pleasures of cooking.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningskip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(And verjuice, always verjuice.) Simon Bryant, the chef, ran a hotel kitchen in Adelaide and always dressed in blacks. He had more unconventional tastes: his chicken kiev, for instance, was stuffed with butter and marmalade, then wrapped in caul fat. And he wouldn’t just serve – he’dplate upan artful pile of greens, an elegant line of sauce and a tea towel slung over his shoulder to tidy it all up.I suspect they were initially paired in opposition to one another – the country cook versus the hardened pro – but perhaps due to their natural temperaments, they ended up as a lovingly odd couple. He was messy, she was messier. He drizzled, she glugged. He loved chilli; she couldn’t bear it. Neither of them liked making desserts. (“I hate following recipes,” Maggie said by way of explanation.) She frequently forgot to put things in the oven and always apologised for her presentation. “Nonsense, Maggie,” he’d always reply.The Cook and the Chef was made when most Anglo Australians didn’t know what freekeh or verjuice was, or how to handle an eggplant. Their dishes were indulgent but mostly unfussy; the ingredients seemed to come straight from sun-drenched vegetable gardens and orchards around Beer’s territory, the Barossa. (It is the best advertisement South Australia has ever had.) These two could convert a puritan to the earthly pleasures of a ripe fig, a tomato on the vine, a great balsamic. They were often giggly, giddy with happiness.‘A movie star turn of the highest calibre’: we were wrong about Mother! – and Jennifer LawrenceRead moreThe Cook and the Chef remains wonderfully instructional. It has taught me how to make good scrambled eggs (fold, don’t scramble – and leave them a lot runnier than you think); how to pick a passionfruit (wrinklier means sweeter); and to stop putting strawberries in the fridge (arrange them side by side on a flat dish so they don’t go mouldy). But it also serves as a delightful palate cleanser if you’ve had enough of people sweating and swearing over food, or celebrity chefs performing versions of themselves.Pleasingly, SBS’s scatter-gun late airings seem to havea following among the internet’s night owls.

Three and a half decades on, I still sometimes meditate on what a school friend of mine said in a here’s-a-profound-thought tone of voice: “I’d rather be stupid than happy”.In this clever book, Stuart Jeffries starts out at a double disadvantage, though. First: he has an excellently snappy title but it’s open to question whether stupidity can be said to have a history in any meaningful sense. The quality of stupidity is just, sort of,there;and there’s lots of it. Could you write a history of happiness, or bad luck, or knees? You’d be on firmer ground, as he recognises, historicising the concept of stupidity: a short history, in other words, of “stupidity” – how successive societies and thinkers have defined and responded to reason’s derr-brained secret sharer. As an intellectual historian who has written smart and chewy popular books about the Frankfurt School (Grand Hotel Abyss) and postmodernism (Everything, All the Time, Everywhere), he certainly has the chops for it.But then there’s the second problem: definitions. Is stupidity the same thing as ignorance? As foolishness? As the unwillingness to learn (AKA obtuseness, or what the Greeks called amathia)? As the inability to draw the right conclusions from what you have learned? Is it a quality of person or a quality of action? On and off, in ordinary usage, it’s all of these. It’s a know-it-when-you-see-it (except in yourself) thing.It’s only with the Enlightenment that stupidity started to be seen as a cognitive rather than a moral failingPerhaps inescapably, therefore, Jeffries makes a number of nice philosophical distinctions about the meaning of the term – and then goes back to using it in the know-it-when-you-see-it sense, so his discussion wanders through whole fields of its meanings without ever quite erecting a boundary fence. In a way, you could see this book not as a history of stupidity but as a slant history of its various opposites. It’s an amiable and rambling tour through the history of philosophy, looking at the idea of rationality and its limitations.If it’s stupid not to seek the truth, is it not even more stupid to suppose there’s a truth to be sought? The western ancients were in the first camp; and their special distinction – thank you, Socrates – was to see reason and virtue as being directly connected. It’s only with the Enlightenment that stupidity started to be seen as a cognitive rather than a moral failing. (Though when we later meet Hannah Arendt’s reflections on Eichmann, on the banality of mind that made Nazi evil possible, we perhaps return to the older view.)There’s an interesting early chapter on the eastern traditions. Daoism and Confucianism and Buddhism see wisdom and virtue as linked, too; though wisdom in these cases is associated less with deductive rationality than with a submission to the natural order of things. Daoist “wu-wei”, or “effortless action” (going with the flow) is the key. Western individualism, according to a scholar Jeffries quotes, leaves us with selves resembling “a kind of avocado” with a nub of ego at its centre, whereas in the mysterious east there are to be found “flexi-selves” of the sort you can’t buy in the grocery aisle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Jeffries gives us affectionate readings of Don Quixote and Flaubert’s Bouvard and Pécuchet, dips into Shakespeare’s fools and the rich menu of stupidities available in King Lear,as well as making the odd excursus into cognitive science. And the abstract question of whether rationalism is the greatest stupidity of all is given concrete force in Jeffries’s chapters about IQ tests (their inventor, we discover, would have been horrified by the stupid way they came to be used), eugenics, the “mass stupidity” of totalitarianism and the “structural stupidity” of life under late capitalism. Adorno and Horkheimer’s Dialectic of Enlightenment – which draws a line from utopian rationalism to the camps – is the touchstone here, but the whole rationalism-skeptic crew, from Foucault and Derrida to John Gray, get a look-in. Less high-mindedly, Donald Trump and Boris Johnson also get it in the neck. This is a learned and often exhilarating book, and it’s a bit all over the place – but, given the subject matter, it’d be stupid to expect otherwise.A Short History of Stupidity by Stuart Jeffries is published by John Wiley & Sons (£25).

Damian Barr takes on this challenge, and he’s found a historic couple who make the ideal source material. Working-class Scottish artists Bobby MacBryde and Robert Colquhoun were rarely apart after they met in 1933. They lived and worked together, became famous together and then declined into desperate squalor together – even poorer than when they began.Barr knows what it’s like to conquer Glasgow from a small, working-class town on its outskirts; he knows what it’s like to find yourself feted for your portraits of the place you’ve left irrevocably behind. His memoir,Maggie and Me, was a hard-hitting yet rambunctious tale of growing up gay near Motherwell under Thatcher, uneasily aware that the woman who pushed his parents deeper into poverty also taught him that the ruthless exercise of his talents offered his escape. He expanded his exploration of how brutality can take hold in his novelYou Will Be Safe Here, set in South Africa. Now he returns to Scotland in this moving meditation on art, love and home.In Barr’s telling, the two Roberts meet on their first day at the Glasgow School of Art – scholarship boys drawn together, reluctantly on Robert’s part and enthusiastically on Bobby’s. They move into the attic of the wealthy socialist Mrs Cranston (“Politics is everyone’s thing, whether we like it or not,” she reprimands their tutor) and live on Bobby’s stews and a love that moves rapidly from seeming impossible to feeling predestined, driven by Bobby’s courage in seeking out other homosexual friends and allies on the fringes of Glasgow life. They’re divided by war, when Robert fights and the asthmatic Bobby doesn’t, and then become celebrated figures in bohemian London, exhibiting at the Lefevre gallery and mingling in Soho with Francis Bacon and Peter Watson (Barr has Robert driving an ambulance, just about plausibly, with Bacon).Over the years, it’s common for couples to divide not just household tasks but talents and traits between them, so that each grows into their differences from the other. Barr is very astute on the ways that the two Roberts deplete as well as enhance each other. There’s charm in their differences: Bobby’s face is a sun, Robert’s a half moon; Bobby cries easily while Robert holds his feelings in. But more disturbingly, they divide their art too, so that Bobby paints still lifes while Robert paints people, and Bobby comes to feel that he would betray his lover if he changed this. “What started out as a joke is becoming a contract that Bobby doesn’t remember signing.” It’s not surprising that Robert, with his more fragile ego and his more ruthless commitment to work, becomes the more successful one, and that Bobby declines as Robert flourishes, until Robert, dependent always on Bobby’s resourcefulness and bonhomie, begins to decline as well. Barr’s memoir all too vividly described his mother’s drunken fights with her boyfriend. These memories must power the lurid incandescence of the brawls between the men as they drink away income and talent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Barr moves from the intense, intimate storytelling of the opening chapters to a travelogue that skates across place and time, and then narrates their final years by impressively imagining the letters that Bobby sends to old acquaintances begging for cash. There are moments when all this becomes unwieldy. I’d hope that a novelist with such considerable skill could do better than introducing lengthy backstory with “as the strap settles, he remembers what it took to get here, to this moment”. There are also sections where Robert remains shadowy compared with the livelier and more introspective Bobby – but it’s true of many couples in life that one is less knowable than the other. And it was remarkable how much I did care about the men’s relationship throughout, finding the prospect of their splitting up as unthinkable as they do, however unlivable their life together becomes. Barr’s care for the two Roberts is palpable. The narrator is drawn into their erotic force field, almost as if there are three people in this couple (as it happens, actual threesomes are frequent occurrences).“Never forget where you come fae,” Bobby’s Aunt Maggie tells him as she sends him out to conquer the world. Barr dramatises the double-edged complexity of this. Insofar as it’s Barr’s own return home, this novel is a kind of love letter to Scotland – from the Ayrshire hills where the men lie “painting together, curled like commas, naked in the nest they’ve rolled in the high golden grass”, to Glasgow’s Mackintosh building, with its huge panes of glass that “bounce the north light like sails catching a wind”. But it’s a love letter that encodes diagnosis and disaster. Both Roberts flourish in London as Scottish artists, with Scottish subjects and Scottish party pieces. Yet they’re unwelcome when they make a catastrophic trip home. Barr mingles comedy and tragedy with wonderful fluidity, showing that it’s their inability to forget where they’re from and truly find a home elsewhere that destroys them, in the end.Lara Feigel is the author ofLook!

Lifting weights, he explained, not only builds stronger muscles, it also boosts the immune system, maintains a healthy heart and improves brain function. Best of all, it can be done in your kitchen, using ordinary domestic items: pints of milk in place of dumbbells, say, or squats wearing a backpack full of books.Anyone intending to use Robert Galbraith’s Strike novels for this purpose would be advised to seek the advice of a GP. The Hallmarked Man may not be the heftiest of the eight so far – it does not even make it into the top three – but it still clocks in at a cool 912 pages. Galbraith’s tendency to whopperdom has in the past elicited a fair amount of griping from critics, me among them, who argued that judicious pruning would better serve her plots and her charismatic private detective duo, the sweary one-legged army veteran Cormoran Strike and his brave, decent business partner Robin Ellacott. Not that it changed anything. The books remained resolutely huge (as did sales – by 2024, a staggering 20 million books had been sold in over 50 countries). Galbraith, otherwise known asJK Rowling, has never been one to bow to her detractors.My arms may plead otherwise, but this time she may have a point. The Hallmarked Man gets off to a spankingly brisk start and from then on seldom lets up. A grotesquely butchered corpse is found in the vault of a silver shop in the City of London. The police claim the body is that of armed robber Jason Knowles, but not everyone accepts their conclusions, including Decima Mullins, who, convinced that the dead man is instead the vanished father of her newborn child, approaches Strike to help her prove it.With so much going on, it is occasionally a challenge to keep track of who has done what and why, but it hardly mattersSceptical, Strike and Ellacott reluctantly take on the case, but, as they study the evidence, the plot only thickens. The silver shop, located next to Freemasons’ Hall, specialises in masonic artefacts: among his other mutilations, the dead man’s body has been cut with a masonic hallmark. There are other missing men whose descriptions could match that of the corpse. Before long, Strike and Ellacott find themselves puzzling over not just one potential murder but four.As always with Galbraith, the personal lives of the detectives play as pivotal a role in the story as the increasingly labyrinthine mystery. Strike’s endless and endlessly tantalising will they/won’t they two-step with Ellacott is jeopardised by her deepening relationship with CID officer Ryan Murphy, himself caught up in a difficult case. Talented but manipulative ex-Metropolitan police officer Kim Cochran has joined the agency and seems set on stirring things up. And if all that was not enough to be getting along with, Mullins turns out to have close family connections with Charlotte Campbell-Ross, Strike’s dead former fiancee.The result is a terrific and tightly plotted romp with none of the longueurs that padded previous volumes. With an apparent effortlessness that speaks of great discipline and skill, Galbraith keeps the plates of all four possible murder inquiries spinning, each one replete with its own satisfyingly unexpected feints and twists. With so much going on, it is occasionally a challenge to keep track of who exactly has done what and why, but Galbraith’s sure-footedness is such that it hardly matters: the desire to leaf back and check a point feels considerably less urgent than the compulsion to find out what will happen next.The propulsive drive of the story is matched by the sheer enjoyment of the ride. Previous Strike novels have proved something of a battleground for the often toxic cultural and political wars that Galbraith/Rowling has engaged in on the public stage – transphobia and online mob justice inThe Ink Black Heart, cult indoctrination inThe Running Grave. But, despite the appearance of a gloriously awful ex-Tory MP who sprinkles his conversation with Latin tags and goes on political quiz shows, The Hallmarked Man is not a novel with a manifesto. For all its fiendish cat’s cradle of a plot, it foregrounds the personal, reminding us yet again what thoroughly good company Strike and Ellacott are. It is no small feat to keep readers invested in a relationship that has been on the breathless brink of almost consummation for seven (giant) books. But Galbraith pulls it off with aplomb, deepening our affection for this engaging, exasperating should-be couple as Strike promises himself (and us) that this time he will finally tell Ellacott how he feels …Some of Galbraith’s more irritating quirks do surface, most distractingly the insistence on clumsy phonetic dialogue of the “I fink ’e said … didn’ ’e say ’e knew” variety. And little is gained by detailing every drink order in every pub. But these are quibbles. The Hallmarked Man is a triumph of storytelling. Sheer weight aside, I’m pretty sure it improved my cognitive function. It also touched my heart.The Hallmarked Man by Robert Galbraith is published by Sphere (£30).

One was a volume of poems by Alexander Pushkin.But Turina – a voracious reader, never without a couple of books in his backpack – had no plans to pick it up again.The 19th-century Russian has acquired a troubling resonance in Ukraine since the 2022 full-scale invasion of the country. He is frequently used by the invaders as a symbol of Russianness:huge postersdepicting the writer were for example erected in the southern city of Kherson during its occupation.View image in fullscreenA statue of Alexander Pushkin in Kyiv shortly before its dismantling.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesFor many in Ukraine, it shows Pushkin is being co-opted as a cultural weapon in Russia’s war. Some would also argue that Pushkin’s poetry reinforced, and even helped form, Russia’s imperial ideology. Numerous statues of the writer have been dismantled since 2022 while many streets named after him (there were at least594in 2018) have reverted to their former names, or been given new ones.Turina knew he could not sell the book. “You couldn’t give it to a friend, you couldn’t give it to a library,” he said. So in his garden, Turina gently, experimentally, placed his volume of Pushkin on the bonfire.Feeding Pushkin to the flames was not some grandiose gesture of hate. It was an artist’s private and exploratory act, he said.“I’m afraid to burn books, to destroy them,” he said. “For me it’s symbolic of being barbarian.” He said his purpose was quite different. He wanted find out how he would feel. Would there be any catharsis? Grief? Anger?“I didn’t feel anything. I felt nothing good, nothing bad,” he said.The second book in Turina’s hand was a volume of poetry by the contemporary Russian writer Dmitry Vodennikov.For him, this represented a very different literary relationship.While a student in the western city of Lviv in the early 2000s, Turina saw Vodennikov perform his work. It was a revelation.“It was something new, a new voice. I understood he was gay: it was between the lines. It was so tender. It was very cool,” he said. “I started to be his fan.”He told his parents he needed extra money for sports shoes. Then he spent what amounted to more than half his monthly student stipend on a single copy of poems by Vodennikov.“In time, I knew all his poetry,” said Turina. “He was part of my way of thinking, my vision of my work.”But then, after 2022, Turina decided to check out Vodennikov’s position on the war – “and now,” he said, “I find he is a pro-war poet.” Turina decided to leave his former hero’s book in his garden – to decay.AcrossUkraine, readers are facing decisions about what to do with their Russian-language books. Many people – and especially those in the creative and cultural community – have switched to using Ukrainian in their everyday lives.How best to “decolonise” from centuries of Russian and Soviet cultural influence is a frequent point of discussion.In many cases, Russian missiles have taken decisions out of individuals’ hands. On the morning of 23 June, for example – after a barrage of Shahed drones and cruise missiles – books in Russian, some apparently stained with blood, were part of the wreckage of an apartment block in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv. Ten people, including an 11-year-old, were killed in the attack.View image in fullscreenBooks in the wreckage of an apartment block in Kyiv’s Shevchenkivskyi district after a Russian airstrike.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianWhen Kateryna Iakovlenko’s apartment in Irpin just outside Kyiv took a direct hit in March 2022, all of the writer and curator’s books, including those in Russian, the language in which she was raised, were destroyed. So were all her other possessions.Three years on, she owns just two books in Russian, both translations from other languages, neither available in Ukrainian, and both gifts from their authors.Oleksandr Mykhed faced a similar situation when his house in Hostomel, near Kyiv, was hit in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion. In his book The Language of War, the writer, now a member of the armed forces, recounts visiting its ruins and finding his Dostoevskys and Nabokovs among the wreckage.The experience of losing his home has transformed his relationship to his possessions – including his books.“Once you have become a refugee, you are always thinking like a refugee,” he said. “Better not to feel sentimental about books. These are just kilos that you might have to think about what to do with, if you need to leave.” There are no Russian-language books, even translations of foreign literature, in his new library.View image in fullscreenOleksandr Mykhed, a Ukrainian writer and soldier, posing for a portrait at Kyiv’s Knyzhkovy Lev bookshop.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianThis June, Mariana Matveichuk, a freelance journalist, took 90kg of Russian books to a recycling centre near her home town in western Ukraine.She was raised in a Ukrainian-speaking area, and attended a Ukrainian-speaking university in Kyiv in the early 2000s. Nevertheless at that point most inhabitants of the city, and many of her fellow students, were Russian-speaking.Many authors she was studying – the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Jacques Rancière, for example – were also available in translation in Russian, but not Ukrainian.She said she had “a book fetish” and would frequent Kyiv’s sprawling secondhand book market at Pochaina. When she graduated, she hauled her stash of books back to western Ukraine by train.These are the volumes that she has now recycled – sparing Anton Chekhov’s letters and diaries. “I have personal respect for him.

I am saying goodbye to what I thought was important.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are those who have decided to keep them because they are part of a family story – perhaps reflecting parents’ or grandparents’ struggle to acquire them under the Soviet Union.There are those who have come to hate the Russian language, associating it with the thought-world and media bubble of the invading country, but have still held on to a book – a treasured Russian translation of Haruki Murakami, say – because it represents a part of their own past.In Kharkiv, for decades a principally Russian-speaking city, the artist Pavlo Makov uses Ukrainian in day-to-day life.But he does not intend to get rid of his Russian books.View image in fullscreenA bookshelf at Pavlo Makov’s art studio in Kharkiv.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianMany foreign-language titles still lack good Ukrainian translations, he said – a reflection of the relative dominance of Russia and Russian, compared with Ukraine and Ukrainian, in the post-Soviet global publishing market.And he was doubtful about the wisdom of destroying or recycling Russian-language books, since it can create associations with the actions of authoritarian regimes. “I think that for the image of Ukraine, it’s not a good idea to do things like that. OK, you hate the Russian language. I understand it. But a book is a source of information.”In fact, studying Russian books and literature was important, he said, “because this country is our enemy, and this is enemy is very close. We should examine, we should research it.”In Pochaina, the enormous secondhand book market in Kyiv, business is not very brisk. It is certainly the place to go if you want to buy books in Russian – although maybe not if you want to sell them.In one corner, there is what one secondhand bookseller, Dmytro Drobin, called “an Egyptian pyramid” of books that no one can sell – mainly Russian-language, Soviet editions of everything from Tolstoy and Chekhov to popular fiction and Stendhal translations.Another bookseller, who preferred not to give her name, sells secondhand and antiquarian books in Ukrainian and Russian. She said the choice of language was largely determined by generation. “Young people mostly want to read in Ukrainian,” she said.When people offer her Russian books to buy, she rarely takes them: demand is down.View image in fullscreenHundreds of discarded books, mostly Russian-language, at Pochaina flea market.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianOccasionally, she said, customers ask for “new books published in Russia. There are very, very few of these people.” From 2016, importing books from Russia has been restricted, requiring a permit, and since 2023 it has been outlawed.Dmytro Drobin, a bookseller surrounded in his shop by thousands of Russian-language books, said he believed his government is pursuing “forced Ukrainianisation”. He compared the climate to the situation under the Tsarist empire, when publishing books in Ukrainian was severely restricted.Russian-language books by Ukrainian authors may be published, but, since 2023, are ineligible for state grants. Since 2023, books by Russian citizens may not be published. Ukrainian is the sole official language of the country, but Russian remains widely spoken; minority languages include Crimean Tatar.Business was slow, said Drobin. He attributed that to the millions of Ukrainians who have left the country, to the numbers in the army, and the hard economic times caused by the war. “The very nature of reading has collapsed,” he said.In a Ukrainian-language bookshop in a southern suburb of Kyiv, on the city’s left bank, the mood was more upbeat. Alpaca, a world away from thenew hipster bookshopsof central Kyiv, sells mostly children’s books.View image in fullscreenMaryna Medvedeva, the manager of Alpaca family bookshop.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianIt has been offering customers a deal: if they bring in unwanted Russian books, they can get discounts of 20-30% on new books to buy from the shop. Any extra funds gleaned by the shop from selling the Russian titles for recycling are donated to the Ukrainian armed forces.“I wanted to give people the opportunity to get rid of their stocks of old books that are just lying around. You can’t give them away, you can’t sell them, it’s a shame that they are just lying there,” said the store’s manager, Maryna Medvedeva.She and her colleagues had brought their own Russian books to the scheme. “I’m not sorry. I was going to keep [some Russian books], but then I opened one, I thought I’d read it – but no, I can’t, it’s just a feeling of repulsion.”Yulliia Kavun was shopping in the store with her young son, Myron. Her family was displaced from the city of Kostiantynivka in the eastern Donetsk region after the Russian-backed takeover of parts of the region in 2014. The bulk of their home library – in Russian, the family language – was definitively destroyed along with their house on 26 February this year.View image in fullscreenYulliia and Myron Kavun bookshopping in Alpaca.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianNow she was contemplating taking advantage of Alpaca’s scheme to help buy the books needed for Myron’s education.For Kavun, choices about books reflect a necessary accommodation to her unenviable circumstances as a refugee.She planned, she said, to go to Poland, where her graduate daughter is already living – but that will require yet another linguistic and literary shift.“We are nobody here, and in Poland we are nobody either. So what’s the difference? We might as well just go there. So we’ll have to buy Polish books, once we are there.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineUkraine in depthEuropeRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

For example,Good Boyfrom 2022 revolved around a man and his “dog” (who is obviously a guy in a dog costume) acting like a mutt at all times. Similarly, his new feature features a character called Amir (Freddy Singh) with a psychological fixation that’s so unusual he feels he must keep it a secret from his girlfriend and all acquaintances: he has body integrity dysphoria (BID), which in his case means he has an overwhelming desire to amputate his left leg even though there’s nothing physically wrong with it.Amir lives with his super-nice, cheerful girlfriend Kim (Julie Abrahamsen) in hyper-tolerant, Scandi-socialist quasi-utopiaNorway, so when he drunkenly tries to self-amputate, everyone just assumes it was a suicide attempt and showers him with understanding and support. His old friend Jonas (Viggo Solomon) even offers him an office job, but Amir is so obsessed with his leg he constantly haunts the chainsaw aisle at his local DIY shop. After seeing an interview on TV with Rikke (Louise Waage Anda), a young woman who is open about her own BID (she wants to be blind), Amir seeks her out for advice. Soon, the two of them are having a sort of platonic affair, with Amir storing his cache of paintings depicting himself as an amputee that he doesn’t dare let Kim see.In back and forward flashes we get quick glimpses of gore-smeared rocks and pools of blood, promising horror to come. Plus, Bøe keeps putting a day-by-day countdown on screen, auguring the approach of the moment when the “accident” will happen, so we know things will go stump-shaped in some way. But while the will-he-won’t-he mystery gets resolved, some viewers may be left wanting a little more explanation about why Amir feels this way about his body.It doesn’t help that Singh, while physically imposing and a co-creator of the film’s story, is a bit limited as an actor apart from the scenes where he performs pain or anger. Amir’s lumpish demeanour and utter self-absorption rather undermines sympathy for him and make one wonder why poor, good-natured Kim and Jonas put up with him in the first place. But this is still a film that lingers in the mind long after it is over – not just because of the gore but because of the subtler questions it raises about identity and community.Above the Knee is on digital platforms from 9 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsNorwayEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

With Row, a smattering of startling jump cuts showing blood splashed around a boat and flashbacks of the protagonist Megan (Bella Dayne, very impressive) screaming, but the viewer needs to wait out a somewhat unreasonably long running time to find out if the antagonists here are biting fish or knife-wielding killers.All we know at first is that Megan is the only survivor of an attempt to break the record for rowing across the Atlantic from Newfoundland to the UK with four crew members, two men and two women. Having washed up on the Orkneyisland of Hoy, Megan spends most of the film’s present tense in bed recovering when she’s not telling DCI MacKelly (Tam Dean Burn) what happened after she, her best friend Lexi (a sparky Sophie Skelton), captain Daniel (Akshay Khanna) and mystery man Mike (Nick Skaugen), a last-minute replacement for Lexi’s boyfriend Adam (Mark Strepan), set off on their voyage. But how reliable is Megan as a narrator?Writer-director Matthew Losasso, making his feature debut with this, dispenses the reveals with skill, although there are a few stumbles in the motivational logic and a somewhat murky final five minutes of twistiness, which maybe torques the narrative a half turn too much. Nevertheless, for a film with such a small, mostly unknown cast and presumably a limited budget, the effects are very impressive, especially when the boat is storm tossed on waves the size of whales. Like the film itself, the little vessel has a surprisingly large arsenal of tech at its disposal, but of course bad things happen, sometimes by accident and sometimes by cruel design. Despite the aforementioned limitations, Row pulls together surprisingly well, thanks in part to the ensemble’s intense chemistry, striking cinematography and especially fine use of sound and score.Row is in UK cinemas from 5 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsThrillersScotlandRowingreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not the colour palette, which is Soviet-era pale beige, but the images of holidaymakers: elderly men strutting about in thongs and playing ping pong in their vests; retirees of both sexes glad-ragged at the disco.Like Parr’s photos, the images are funny but not unkind; everyone retains their dignity. The director is Irish film-maker Gar O’Rourke, who planned Sanatorium before the war, but filmed it after Russia invaded Ukraine, which adds a layer of melancholy to the guests’ search for health and happiness.The huge Kuyalnik sanatorium is a time warp with its brutalist architecture and institutional interiors. Back in its glory days, people must have come here in their thousands. Now, the place is a little tired: paint peeling off the walls, the ceilings stained by leaks. The health treatments too have a retro feel: mud wraps and electro massage machines. One guest is Natalia, who has brought her single 40-ish son Andriy, hoping to find him a wife. That doesn’t look promising since most of the other guests look old enough to have visited the sanatorium back in the day. Mother and son give the film a lovely moment slow dancing together to George Michael’s Careless Whisper at the disco. Other stories emerge: one woman’s husband was killed on the frontline; a younger guest is a soldier recovering from injuries sustained on the frontline. Another woman is here for help with fertility.The place is run by the Tony Soprano of hospitality, Dmitriy, a great wardrobe of man who walks around shouting at staff. He is under pressure: the Russians are shelling Odesa and the air raid sirens are going off, visitor numbers are down, guests are glued to their phones, checking the news and apps monitoring drones and missiles. Their resilience is heroic, and there is a very moving scene near the end during a recital of the national anthem; so many faces with tears, each registering a loss or struggle.Sanatorium is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsHealth & wellbeingUkraineEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

It being the 1990s, he doesn’t have the option of simply being creepy on social media; instead, he takes her hostage and attempts to marry her, as you do, in a period-comedy-horror-thriller that is entertaining enough moment-to-moment, but doesn’t add up anything very substantial overall. Standing in the way of Paul’s deranged scheme is bodyguard Bell (a grounded and nicely judged performance by Eric Dane), and rounding out the men in Sofia’s life is her NBA player boyfriend Rhodes (Jimmie Fails).Screenwriter Jimmy Warden knows a grabby real-life premise when he sees one. In 1985, a bear ate a massive amount of cocaine and fatally overdosed, leading, in 2023, to the release of the Warden-scripted movie Cocaine Bear. In 1996, Robert Dewey Hoskins was sentenced to 10 years in prison for stalking Madonna, providing the loose inspiration for this latest Warden script, which this time out he has also directed (casting his wife Weaving in the lead role). Warden is not a bad director of individual scenes, with several sequences playing out like miniature music videos, complete with big bold needle-drop choices on the soundtrack. The problem is the overall cohesion, or rather, lack of it – there are plenty of cool ideas, and a narrative that strings them together effectively enough, but it’s unclear what we’re meant to feel about any of it.Are we supposed to be ironically amused, in a Tarantino-esque emotionally detached way? Or are we supposed to be invested in Sofia as a horror heroine we hope will be able to defeat her captor? Is Paul an antihero in the Rupert Pupkin vein, or a straight-down-the-line killer, or some kind of nice guy underneath it all, with serious mental problems? The screenplay isn’t nuanced enough to switch between modes in a way that feels intentional and the result is the sense that there are a few different films jostling for attention.Still, it’s all pretty stylishly done, and if you’re thinking Nicholson is a dead ringer for a young Jack Nicholson, we can save you a Google: he’s his son, and doing a nice line in the kind of derangement his dad channelled so memorably in the The Shining.Borderline is on digital platforms from 8 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersComedy filmsHorror filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is Christopher Marlowe’s moment. Starring Edward Bluemel (My Lady Jane, Killing Eve) as hardworking, wary Will and Ncuti Gatwa (The Importance of Being Earnest, Doctor Who) as randy, troublesome Kit, Liz Duffy Adams’ new chamber play squirrels the literary titans away in a room in 1591 to 1593, playing out an energetic, erotic version of some historians’ suspicions that the playwrights’ lives – and Kit’s violent death – were more intertwined than we think.“It is a history play,” Will chides, as Kit bends the truth in the script of Henry VI Part I, which the two great poets are writing together. “All the more reason to use our imaginations,” Kit retorts with an exaggerated flourish of his quill. Enjoying the historical license her character grants her, Duffy Adams whips the competitors into a frenzy and releases them at each other’s throats, letting them flirt, threaten, fight - and very occasionally write.View image in fullscreenLithe … Ncuti Gatwa in Born With Teeth.Photograph: Johan PerssonBut the bold imagination Kit calls for in reframing history is restrained by Daniel Evans’ staging. Three walls of Neil Austin’s blinder lights form the writers’ cage. A wooden table is their stage, bed and barrier as their charged emotions flip-flop from rivals to lovers, their sometimes overly earnest outpourings sitting flush with stabbing insults and religious musings. The sharp shock of innovation in the opening scene exists in isolation, with the rest of the show relegated to the two men prowling around the table. Bursts of violent action are reserved for mid-act screens, though tension is diffused as Will steps out to address the audience, undermining the intensity of the locked-door environment.Bluemel is a raggedy Will, shedding his initial weediness as his star rises. We watch as his reputation shifts from a wry whine that “no one’s studying me”, to an aside referencing his legacy where, “well,” he shrugs, “you know”. Sincere where his counterpart is scandalous, Will grapples with his feelings for Kit, simultaneously desiring acute proximity and terrified of giving in to temptation.But this is Gatwa’s show. His boisterous Kit sweats in Zoë Thomas-Webb’s leather two-piece, his every lithe action a flirtation. He lunges towards Will first out of pure instinct, as something to shag, but he grows gentler, softened by his literary sparring partner. Beneath his restless exterior, he hides genuine admiration for his uncertain lover and unmistakable fear for the murky waters he has waded into.The Elizabethan England Duffy Adams paints is one of heavy surveillance, as Kit tries to lure Will into his underworld of royal spies. But for all we’re told of the dangers outside this room, they remain at a distance. The stakes simmer throughout but never reach boiling point.The ego-pumped versions of these men we see on stage would be delighted to know audiences and academics continue to ogle their lives and work – though Kit would no doubt be fuming that Will’s star has so drastically eclipsed his. An intelligent slice of historical fiction that offers muscular performances and reminds us to lavish more attention on the other great Elizabethan playwright, Born With Teeth yearns for a sharper bite.AtWyndham’s theatre, London, until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreChristopher MarloweNcuti GatwaWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

So some bands, including Lime Cordiale and Cloud Control, are trying small changes – like ditching confetti – and big ones, like building solar farmsGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailJack TregoningTue 2 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 21.19 EDTShareIn 2023 the Australian indie-pop band Lime Cordiale tested a pair of electric tour vans, driving from Sydney to a festival in the Hunter Valley via gigs in Wollongong and Canberra. With gear stacked high and a map dotted with charging stations, the band got a promising, if imperfect, glimpse of their touring future. “At each gig, we’d have to convince someone to let us plug the cars in,” recalls the band’s guitarist and vocalist, Oliver Leimbach. As it transpired, they ran out of charge en route to the festival and had to call for a lift.Lime Cordiale are part of a growing number of Australian musicians who are recognising the climate cost of touring and finding ways to lessen their impact. While no definitive emissions audit exists for Australia’s music sector, a 2010 study found the UK music industry produced about 540,000 tonnes of greenhouse-gas emissions annually. It’s estimated that a typical two-week, 15-stop tour in Australia produces about 28 tonnes of carbon emissions – the equivalent of an average household’s yearly output.In 2015 the musician and Green Music Australia co-founder Tim Hollosummed it up succinctly: “We’re an industry full of forward-thinking, caring people and yet we have festivals strewn with rubbish, energy-guzzling studios and venues, and massive transport emissions.”It was all eco: Coldplay beats emissions target for world tour – via kinetic dancefloors and trainsRead moreAs musicians’ incomes continue to be decimated by the rise of streaming, touring is essential – but it’s also one of the most environmentally damaging aspects of the industry (andis, in turn, affected by the climate crisis). Overseas,ColdplayandBillie Eilishhave taken steps to reduce the impact of their world tours, whileMassive Attack’s battery-powered show in Bristolset a record for low-carbon emissions. In Australia artists including Angie McMahon, Barkaa, Jack River and Montaigne have joined Lime Cordiale in taking up the environmental mantle once worn by Midnight Oil, Paul Kelly, John Butler and Missy Higgins.Oliver and Louis Leimbach, the sibling duo behind Lime Cordiale, grew up with hippy parents on Scotland Island, a community accessible only by boat in Sydney’s Pittwater. As surfers with an innate respect for the natural world, they played some of their earliest shows for the conservation organisations Sea Shepherd and Living Ocean.After the black summer bushfires, the brothers bought a cattle farm on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, next to a family friend’s property they’d visited often as kids. Grounded by the pandemic, they spent nearly two years learning about regenerative farming and are now collaborating with the agri-tech startupNumber 8 Bioto trial methods for reducing methane emissions. “People aren’t going to stop eating meat,” Oliver says. “So what can we do to change the process?”If you start boasting about something online, the first thing someone’s going to say is, ‘Well, how did you get to Europe?’Oliver LeimbachBut as travel restrictions eased, the band faced a dilemma: “Suddenly we were doing all this touring to make up for lost time, and we felt guilty. We’d just been calling ourselves environmentalists – you know, skipping out on the tractor for a day so we don’t use diesel – and then we’re just flying around the world.” Rather than simply stop touring, Oliver says the siblings committed to “tackle every single aspect we could to lessen our footprint”.Since 2022 Lime Cordiale have donated $1 from each ticket sold on their Australian tours to environmental causes throughSolar Slice, a ticket surcharge initiative created by Cloud Control’s frontwoman, Heidi Lenffer, as part of herFeat (Future Energy Artists) platform. So far, Lime Cordiale has raised more than $50,000.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe band travels by biodiesel bus in Europe and convinced their regular US bus driver to install a new generator and filtration system to cut emissions. Closer to home, they’ve found creative ways to engage fans in their mission, including having a mate in a whale costume crowd surf at shows to raise awareness for Surfers for Climate. Alongside producing a documentary about their climate journey, Leimbach says the band’s next aspiration is to stage a 5,000-capacity festival powered entirely by green energy: “We’re trying to put on the greenest show Australia has seen.”View image in fullscreenHeidi Lenffer from Cloud Control at Feat’s first solar farm in Brigalow, Queensland.

Speaking to Guardian Australia from her home in the Blue Mountains, she recalls an epiphany sparked by listening to Radiohead’s Weird Fishes/Arpeggi on a long-haul flight while touring Cloud Control’s 2013 album,Dream Cave. “The song came on, and I remember thinking I needed to draw a line in the sand to address the cognitive dissonance of choosing a high-impact, high-emissions career amid a worsening climate crisis.”After consulting the sustainability researcher Dr Christopher Dey, Lenffer learned about the carbon cost of touring – an insight that sparked Feat’s first major initiative: raising $7m, in partnership with Future Super and direct contributions from artists, to build the Brigalow solar farm in rural Queensland. With the goal of powering more than 11,000 homes for the next 30 years, Lenffer says Brigalow represents “a hardcore clean energy legacy we can stand beside and be proud of”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a responder and the people have always been the wheelHeidi LenfferSix years in, Lenffer says Feat now carries a “dual mandate” of “regenerating and protecting nature alongside decarbonising and cutting the emissions of our industry”. This includes Solar Slice’s contributions to Indigenous-led rewilding efforts in the Furneaux Islands in the Bass Strait. “I’ve never seen the government as a prime mover,” Lenffer says. “It’s a responder and the people have always been the wheel.”This year Cloud Control reunited for a 15th anniversary tour of their debut album, Bliss Release, dedicating $1 from every ticket sold to a regeneration project on Lungtalanana/Clarke Island. The band also provided venues with a “green rider”, requesting measures including eliminating single-use plastics; and made small changes to reduce waste, including doing their own food shopping at each stop. (“We’re a pretty low-fuss band,” Lenffer says. “There’s no mixed seafood platter.”)View image in fullscreenMetalcore band In Hearts Wake: ‘We just do the best we can without being so militant that it’s not fun for anyone.’Photograph: Unified Music GroupAs part of Feat’s broader mission, Lenffer has shared a detailed green rider template with Laneway festival, including recommendations for eco-friendly suppliers and asking audiences to use public transport. “We’re hoping to influence artists at the highest level internationally,” she says.In 2022 the Byron Bay-based metalcore band In Hearts Wake released a documentary, Green Is the New Black, chronicling their efforts to produce a carbon-neutral album and significantly reduce their touring footprint. Speaking to Guardian Australia straight from weeding on his northern rivers property, their frontman, Jake Taylor, says a respect for nature is “embedded in the themes of our work” and bemoans “the ashtray mentality” threatening local spots including Killen Falls.The documentary,available for free online, follows the band as they dissect every part of their process, including ditching plastic pool toys from their shows and replacing non-biodegradable confetti with “leaf-fetti” made from hedge clippings and dried leaves. (While novel, Taylor admits the latter was “not sustainable in terms of people’s allergies”.)View image in fullscreenSydney’s Enmore Theatre.

Freddie Fellowes, the founder of the Secret Garden Party festival, has offered to host the event on his family’s farm in Cambridgeshire.“The current independent festival model has become unsustainable, pressured and too financially stressful for most organisers since Covid, which means a wealth of incredible grassroots artists are being denied a fair opportunity to perform and carve out their own careers,” said Chai. “I’ve got a plan to save it that will work, but it needs everybody to get involved.”The cooperative will operate as a Community Benefit Society, with participants co-owning and co-programming the festival. A public crowdfunding campaign will launch later this year, offering members a stake in how the event is run.“This is a rescue plan,” Chai said. “We’re not here to compete with the independent scene. We’re here to help.”The model, organisers say, is designed to reduce production and transport costs by up to 40%, while marketing will rely on shared databases rather than expensive commercial campaigns. The aim is to create a replicable blueprint that could stabilise parts of the sector most vulnerable to market shocks.Those shocks have already been severe. According to the Association of IndependentFestivals(AIF), 78 UK festivals were cancelled or closed in 2024 – more than twice the number lost the year before. The AIF blames a combination of rising insurance premiums, energy costs, licensing fees and exclusive supplier deals as the main culprits.UK festivals face ‘really tough’ year due to fewer headline acts and rising costsRead moreMore worrying, said John Rostron, the chief executive of the AIF, was a cultural shift that would heavily impact the future of the UK’s music scene. “Where small festivals once served as testing grounds for emerging artists, they are now struggling to survive in an industry increasingly skewed towards multinational operators like Live Nation,” he said.Live Nation Entertainment, which helped launch the careers of stars including Adele, Ed Sheeran and Stormzy, was formed in 2010 after a merger with Ticketmaster. It was a controversial launch, initially opposed by the UK’s competition watchdog. Now the US-based company runs all but one of the UK’s major festivals and collectively sellsa quarter – or 880,000 – of all festival tickets.A Live Nation spokesperson agreed that “pressures on festivals are felt from top to bottom, with costs rising significantly”. But, they added: “Independent festivals are where many artists take their first steps and where fans discover music they love for life. Thanks to the popularity and success of some of our established festivals, we’re able to partner with and invest in independent festivals and events such as the Great Escape, First Fifty and the BBC Introducing stages at Reading and Leeds.”Chai said Where It All Began was not attempting to scale up or rival that dominance. Instead, it is designed to protect what remains.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

More are expected to join before the public campaign opens.Rostron believes that Chai’s model is “pioneering and gamechanging”. He added: “It is an interesting and creative potential solution to the current crisis that might just get us over the line by sharing the risk of holding a festival that is now too great to be shouldered by any one organiser on their own.”Fellowes said the new model was “necessary, hopeful and long overdue”.“It fills a vital role in the development, patronage and support of artists, without which the growth of creativity will be stunted,” he said.But Chai said the collective was not dealing in hope. It was, he said, focused on survival. “If this works, it won’t just be a festival,” he said. “It will be proof that independents still have power when they act together.”Explore more on these topicsFestivalsMusic industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Should the Russian soprano, who has condemned the Ukraine invasion, be blocked from singing in London?Tue 2 Sep 2025 03.41 EDTLast modified on Tue 2 Sep 2025 05.57 EDTShareIt is one of my very earliest concert memories. In October 1965, my father drove us to Manchester to hearMstislav Rostropovichplay in the Free Trade Hall. Rostropovich played Dvořák’s cello concerto with the Moscow Philharmonic, who began the concert with a symphony byTikhon Khrennikovand ended it with one by Brahms. I was smitten by Rostropovich’s noble playing. I had never heard a musician like him before.This was, though, a concert taking place slap-bang in the middle of the cold war. The Cuban missile crisis had taken place less than three years earlier. The Berlin Wall was still fairly new. The Vietnam war was deepening. That summer I had read The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. The movie version of Le Carré’s novel, with Richard Burton, was due out by the year’s end.So a concert visit by a Soviet orchestra, opening their programme with a piece by a notorious Soviet cultural apparatchik, and featuring a superstar cellist whose oppositional support for human rights was at that stage not widely known, certainly not by me, but whose biography casually mentioned his award of aStalin prize, was a freighted event. It could have been depicted as a visit from the enemy, and certainly as a political act as well as an artistic one.The 1960s were years of an almost total standoff with Russia. Travel in either direction was off limits to ordinary people, but cultural links always existed.Be clear that politics were undoubtedly involved. The Soviet Union would have weighed the risk of triggering another high-profile defection – it was only four years since Rudolf Nureyev’s sensational escape to the west – but must have judged the visit nevertheless as a worthwhile expression of what we now call soft power. Before issuing visas the UK authorities would certainly have thought about all these implications, too.And so will many in the audience before buying tickets. My communist father, for example, was a great music lover, and we had Rostropovich’s recording of the Dvořák concerto at home on LP. But I am sure he bought tickets at least in part to show support for Soviet visitors, and because he wanted to help promote detente between Britain and the Soviet Union.Yet as far as I recall it, there were no protests outside or inside the Free Trade Hall. Maybe I missed them or have forgotten them. If so, I apologise. But their absence will not surprise those who lived through these years. The 1960s were years of an almost total standoff with Russia and all the iron curtain countries in most respects. Travel in either direction was off limits to ordinary people on either side of the divide. But cultural links always existed.View image in fullscreenThe Melbourne Symphony Orchestra with conductor Jaime Martin, whose Proms performance on 29 August was interrupted by protestors from the Jewish Artists for Palestine group.Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCIn spite of the occasional defection, there were regular visits by Soviet musicians and dancers – and even tours by the Red Army Ensemble – throughout the cold war years. Among the Soviet artists who gave regular concerts in the west were Sviatoslav Richter, David and Igor Oistrakh, Emil Gilels, Gennady Rozhdestvensky and Rostropovich. Among the westerners who triumphed in Moscow were Leonard Bernstein, Glenn Gould and our own John Ogdon. And while a London recital by Richter or Oistrakh could be wholly free of political resonance, a visit by Dmitri Shostakovich, sitting in the Soviet ambassador’s box at the Royal Festival Hall for the UK premiere of his 15th Symphony, which I witnessed in 1972, was far more officially charged. Yet do I regret hearing any of them? Not at all.How times have changed. Last week, the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra Prom washeld up by pro-Palestinian protests in the Albert Hall. Next week the Russian soprano Anna Netrebko is due to sing the title role in a new Covent Garden production ofPuccini’s Tosca. The prospect of protests is very real there, too.Netrebko rose to artistic greatness in the early years of Putin’s Russia, where she was the star soprano of Valery Gergiev’s MariinskyOperain St Petersburg, and she was much feted, including by Putin. Nevertheless, within days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine three and a half years ago, Netrebko put out a statement of condemnation, the very opposite of Gergiev. She even used the word “war” which is officially taboo in Russia. She has not returned to Russia from her home in Austria since the invasion.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin, Plácido Domingo, conductor Valery Gergiev and singer Anna Netrebko, among others, at the opening of the new Mariinsky II theatre in 2013 in St Petersburg.Photograph: Sasha Mordovets/Getty ImagesYet Netrebko’s participation in the Tosca production has rekindled a debate about whether she should be taking part at all andwhether the Royal Opera House was right to hire her. It seems likely that Netrebko’s appearance will continue to be a news story, a source of public debate and of social-media furore. Demonstrations outside Covent Garden are certainly planned, and it is regrettably not out of the question that protests inside the house will occur, too.Not all Russians are supporters of Putin, just as not all white South Africans were supporters of apartheid, and not all Israelis are supporters of NetanyahuVery obviously, we live in extremely different times in 2025 from those of 1965 when Rostropovich came to Manchester. Some of the issues, though, have powerful echoes. No one seriously argues that the arts can or should be a politics-free zone. The arts and politics are bound to mix to a degree, just as sport and politics are also bound to. A concert tour by a Soviet orchestra during the cold war was inescapably political. But it was also right that it took place, and was allowed to proceed. It undoubtedly did some good. We should also never forget that not all Russians were or are supporters of Stalin or Putin, just as not all white South Africans were supporters of apartheid and not all Israelis are supporters of Netanyahu.Neither theRoyal Opera Housenor Netrebko has, however, shown the pragmatic sensitivity that today’s complicated dispute demands. In some people’s view, Covent Garden’s hiring of a Russian soprano when her country is killing Ukrainians is completely unacceptable. But that has to be weighed against the fact that Netrebko has opposed, not supported the invasion, and that, in any event, she is a great artist and not a politician.The arts and politics are not the same thing. The arts have meaning far beyond politics. Boycotts are a dangerous denial of that truth. Save in very exceptional circumstances, such as when we are at war as a nation, we risk demeaning what ultimately we stand for if we refuse to allow an artist their freedom to express themselves. Denying an artist like Netrebko her voice – and what a voice it is – because of her nationality, her ethnicity, or her views, real or supposed, is a course that we take not just at her peril, but at our own.Explore more on these topicsOperaRoyal Opera HouseClassical musiccommentShareReuse this content"

Never mind trigger warnings: these are the narrative pillars ofShostakovich’s Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, theopera decried by Stalin as “muddle instead of music”. Stalin’s sudden condemnation was thoroughly political, of course – but British music critics were similarly taken aback after the first UK performance in 1936. “Some of it is clever parody, but much of it is crude,” sniffed the Daily Mail. Almost 90 years later, the opera remains unequivocally grim.Like its UK premiere, thisPromsouting was a concert performance in English translation. Without the trappings of a full staging or the linguistic buffer of the original Russian libretto, the nastiness of this tale of a rape that starts an affair that leads to two murders seemed even more inescapable than usual. Ruth Knight’s semi-staging involved minimal paraphernalia – an iron bed, a small table, a wooden witness box – but used lighting to melodramatic effect. Harsh spotlights isolated characters. The digital screens behind the performers switched several times to blinding white, transforming the Chorus of English National Opera into a mob in silhouette. The entire stage was bathed periodically in red.View image in fullscreenShostakovich’s Lady Macbeth at the BBC Proms.Photograph: Andy ParadiseNo wonder the audience giggled as Nicky Spence’s Sergey muttered “Now we’re really in the shit,” as the betrayed husband approached the lovers’ bedroom: light relief was in distinctly short supply. For all that Shostakovich called the piece a “tragic satire” and included numerous lively musical parodies – of ballroom dances and operetta, circus music and brass-band oompah – conductor John Storgårds kept the BBC Philharmonic deadly serious. There were rude bassoons (grittily flatulent in their lowest register) and even ruder, detumescent trombones, strings that waltzed and woodwind that fidgeted. But Storgårds allowed no levity. Long stretches of the score function as mid-century modern wallpaper, the orchestra ticking over in the background, as restless as the heroine. Occasionally, Storgårds coaxed quiet passages of stunning tenderness; but climaxes crashed relentlessly in vast waves of blaring brass and vicious timpani strokes.That the solo voices struggled at times to compete only added to the performance’s increasingly acute claustrophobia. Brindley Sherratt was on rich-voiced, characterful form as Boris, the piece’s appalling patriarch. As his son and the heroine’s husband, John Findon had both the vocal power and imposing stage presence to resist any suspicion that the character is purely a pushover. There were impressive contributions from Ava Dodd and Niamh O’Sullivan as alternative lust-objects. But nothing was more striking or disturbing than the interaction between Spence’s Sergey and Amanda Majeski’s Katerina: the former heroically clarion even while dramatically faithless, the latter a terrifyingly lyrical portrait of a woman “so bored I could hang myself” – or, as it turns out, commit murder.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

Oversleeping and missing lectures, forgetting where your study group is meeting, mislaying your books – a lot of your time is spent looking for things.It is these small mysteries that concern Little Problems, a cute detective game, in which the protagonist, Mary, must use her sleuthing abilities to make it through each day as a new student . Created by Indonesian designer Melisa, who has chosen to go by her first name only, the idea comes from her love of detective stories, but also her wish to take violence out of the genre.“I read detective comic books, novels and manga, and have been playing detective games since I was a kid. I like horror as well, so I originally thought it would be a great idea to develop a detective game with a horror aesthetic. But after a few weeks of consuming murder and horror stories 24/7, I began to feel depressed, like the world was such a dark place. I wanted to make a story about good people who grow up and make mistakes. This game is all about that nice fuzzy feeling you get from solving small life mysteries.”View image in fullscreenRelatable … Little Problems.Photograph: Posh Cat StudioIn short, there is no criminal activity here. Sometimes, it is just about Mary trying to find a favourite earring, a friend in the crowd – or her mischievous cat. Each scene works like a hidden object puzzle game; you search a location for clues, which may be photos, notes or schedules, and then deduce what has happened. Who broke your favourite mug? You need to check what was in it, then use information about what your housemates like to drink and if they were around at the right time to find the culprit. Surely this is the most relatable crime ever investigated in a video game.The wholesome, low-stakes feel is accentuated by an art style that draws inspiration from soft manga and anime such as Doraemon, Chibi Maruko-chan and Kobo-chan. As with similarly domestic titles such as Unpacking and A Little to the Left, there is a lot of subtle storytelling going on in the background around friendships and family, giving weight to the simple premise. Melisa started the project as a quick prototype for a Twitch game jam, but ended up spending two years on it, bringing two other staff onboard and setting up her studio, Posh Cat. It has been something of a passion project. “I would love to play more cosy detective games, so I made one,” she says. “Here’s to more cosy games in 2025 and beyond!”Little Problems is released onPCon 9 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPCIndie gamesPuzzle gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That created the sense of the kunstkammer, the Renaissance idea in which wealthy people would bring together exotic items from around the world.”Among the highlights of the collection is a celestial globe commissioned in the 16th century by one of the earliest modern astronomers, Wilhelm IV of Hesse-Kassel.View image in fullscreenA celestial globe commissioned in the 16th century. ‘It’s like those apps of the night sky you get that tell you which stars you are looking at.’Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianWhen it was wound up, the globe turned to show the position of constellations. “It’s like those apps of the night sky you get that tell you which stars you are looking at,” Stephens said. “It was made in the 1570s. To have that level of precision and complexity and so many moving points is awesome.”The silver ship – the Schwarzenberg Nef – was created in about 1580. It is a ceremonial ewer – a pitcher or jug – that could be filled with drink through a hole in the deck with the spout concealed within the bow. “It’s miraculous,” said Stephens, pointing out details such as the rigging billowing out with the weight of a crew member and the hefty chicken on a plate in the captain’s cabin.It is not certain that Henry VIII handled the silver-gilt cup that appears in another cabinet, but the signs are that it was his – one of his inventories describes such a vessel weighing exactly the same as this one.Most of the objects were collected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They have been held at various homes and offices owned by members of the Schroder family.The only collection comparable to Bath’s new kunstkammer, Stephens said, wasthe Waddesdon Bequest in the British Museum, a collection of Renaissance treasures collected by Baron Ferdinand Rothschild. “What’s really exciting is to see all these objects brought together in one place. It’s extraordinary, really.”The Schroder Gallery opens to the public on 10 September 2025Explore more on these topicsMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

Tucked away, just off the bustle of London’s Uxbridge Road, the building’s muted colours, simple sign and arched doorway give little away. Step inside, though, and you’ll soon be enticed by what is the UK’s first permanent exhibition and cultural space dedicated to Somali heritage.Officially opened last May, Culture House features a collection of over 150 artefacts, a rotating exhibition, poetry workshops and a digital archive.It has quickly developed a reputation as a hub for the UK’s Somali community, while drawing in curious visitors from outside the diaspora too. Non-profit group theAnti-Tribalism Movement, who lead the project, say the aim is to “celebrate, preserve and connect” Somali culture and communities.“We want the space to feel very open for people – be they Somali or non-Somali,” says Intisar Yusuf, the project’s operations director. “Culture House is about British-Somali identity – what did we bring over with us? What is meaningful to us?”Visitors can explore artefacts grouped into three themes: Spiritual Echoes, Threads of Daily Life and Crafting for the Individual. Items on display include hand-carved combs, wooden headrests, camel bells and incense burners, each labelled with its place of origin and details of how it might be used in nomadic communities. The main room features a striking exhibition of portraits of Somali locals with their favourite cultural objects, captured by Nimbles Archive. Other rooms are dedicated to temporary exhibitions, which the team plan to use as a platform for emerging local creatives.View image in fullscreenThreads of Memory, an exhibition of portraits of Somali locals with their favourite cultural objects, captured by Nimbles Archive.Photograph: Lyndon DouglasThe permanent collection emerged organically from over 15 years of community donations. “They were just sitting in boxes and suitcases in people’s homes,” Intisar recalls. “Many people in the community realised that if we don’t preserve these objects now, we risk losing them altogether.”After a small trial exhibition at the International Somali awards in 2016, another project by ATM, the team saw the impact such items could have. “People were emotional when they saw an old photo or old spoon and had conversations about their memories,” says deputy director Abdirashid Fidow. “That’s when we realised how powerful this heritage is and how deeply people wanted to have a space where those stories could live.”With support from DrakonHeritageand Conservation, and Abira Hussein, a Somali curator and researcher, the team developed their collections policy and built curatorial skills, working towards museum standards.The building itself – once a fire station and later a storage unit – has been redesigned in collaboration with architecture studioFreehaus, known for theAfrica Centrein Southwark. Traditional Somali design elements were integrated throughout – including geometric wall ventilation features inspired by Somali architecture and lampshades modelled after hand-woven baskets found in homes across the Horn.“We wanted people to feel like they were stepping into a Somali cultural space, as if you’re stepping back home,” says Intisar. “We don’t want to be visible in a textbook, but in a place that people can visit and connect with.”The team say that the community response has been “overwhelmingly positive”, with visitors asking for “a bigger space, more artefacts, and more events”.“With our capacity, it has proven to be difficult. But it’s a good problem to have – it just shows how needed a space like Culture House is,” says learning officer Abeer Ali.View image in fullscreenMama Asha, a respected elder in the local Somali community who donated several artefacts to Culture House.Photograph: Mahamed Mahamud (aka Nimble)Among those moved by the space was Mama Asha, a respected elder in the local community and long-time visitor of ATM, who donated several artefacts. “She was emotional – not because of any single object,” says Fidow, “but because for the first time, she saw a cultural space that existed beyond her own house.” He recalls her saying: “I never thought I would see a Somali cultural object in London. I thought this would disappear in people’s memories – seeing this gives me hope.”The exhibition has also become a powerful educational space for younger generations. Many British Somalis, who feel disconnected from their roots, have found the space helpful in rebuilding that relationship.Intisar shares one mother’s experience: “She was in her 30s, and her kids were quite young. She told me, ‘Today we’re having a Somali day – I’m taking them to eat Somali food and visiting Culture House.’ They were dressed in traditional Somali clothes. She said she didn’t even know half the words herself, but the Culture House gave her a way to teach her kids – and learn alongside them.”Among the local artists featured in the first temporary exhibition is Najma Elmi, whose work Signs of Allah explores themes of Islam, travel and identity. For Elmi, having her debut exhibition in Culture House was especially meaningful. “It felt like the perfect fit,” she says. “To have my work shown in a space frequented by Somalis – young and old – was very special. My private opening night was the first time many of my aunties and uncles attended an exhibition – they were delighted to see our culture preserved in London.”The team is also building relationships with larger institutions like the British Museum and Powell-Cotton Museum , which hold collections and archives of Somali artefacts.“There are lots of collectors that brought back objects fromSomaliaduring the colonial period, so the wording and experiences of some of the objects is very colonial,” Intisar explains. “We want to build a bridge so that we can give the real stories and experiences behind how these objects were used. We want to choose how to present ourselves to a wider platform.”That wider platform includes plans for talks, open mics and book panels – for everyone, not just Somali artists. This September it will join the Open House festival, a city-wide event inviting the public to explore London’s architecture and community spaces. The team hopes it will draw in a wider, more diverse audience and not exist solely as a place for Somali people. The choice of the seemingly ambiguous name was intentional, they say: “We want the space to be open to all.”Explore more on these topicsArt and designHeritageMuseumsArchitectureExhibitionsSomaliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

While the rest of us were stringing out guy ropes on tents as glamorous as giant cagoules, she arrived with a bell tent, duvets instead of sleeping bags, sheepskin rugs and vintage folding chairs. For all the talk of breathability, practicality and “high performance” gear, it was Becky’s tent we all wanted to sleep in. In the years since, I have never quite achieved her level of camping chic – until this summer, when I discovered the innovative Spanish camping brand Kampaoh.It all began back in 2016, when Kampaoh CEO Salvador Lora and his partner were backpacking in the Dominican Republic. One night they came across a campsite with pre-erected tents within which were mattresses and blankets. “We were in the middle of nature, surrounded by peace, and lacked nothing,” he tells me.Back home in Spain, Salvador wondered if something like that could work there – and decided to experiment setting up a handful of tents in Tarifa. Today the company has 90 sites across Europe, most of them in Spain, but also in Portugal and Italy. Coming across the brand by chance when looking for somewhere to stay in Andalucía, I booked intoCamping Los Villares, one of its showcase sites, in the hills above Córdoba.Arriving in the golden hour, after travelling overland by train, Los Villares looks like a dreamy backdrop to a Sofia Coppola film. From the entrance, the land drops gently away to reveal avenues of cream-coloured canvas tents, the sun filtering through tall Aleppo pines.View image in fullscreenThe writer stayed in one of the campsite’s Anza tentsLos Villares has a wide range of accommodation, from bell tents to vast, safari-style Bali tents, cute triangular Buka tents (with private, rustic-chic washrooms outside), Tiny Love cabins (with private baths with views), and Tiny Play family cabins (with a slide from their mezzanine bunks down to the living areas). My mid-range Anza is a lofty, triangular tent with a shower and toilet tucked behind the sleeping area and a raised, decked porch. The site is open year-round and the tents have air-conditioning and a small heater. There’s space for basic tent campers and a small campervan area, too.We wanted to bring back the magic of connecting with nature and outdoor adventures without giving up comfort or styleSalvador Lora, CEO, KampaohOutside the school holidays, with the campsite’s restaurant closed midweek, dinner that first night is sliced tomatoes, olives and tortilla foraged from a nearby village shop. As I eat on the terrace, all is deeply peaceful – the wind twisting through pines, blue-tailed Iberian magpies resting on branches overhead.Inside, my white, cream and wood tent is decorated with fairy lights and faux pot plants; the low platform bed (with proper mattress and pillows!) made up with white bedlinen. Plates, cups and cutlery are provided – and if I’d brought a pet, a mini version of the tent would provide a shady dog bed. An information sheet encourages me to tag @kampaoh on social media; arrival details had been sent via WhatsApp.It’s perfectly designed to appeal to gen Z travellers, the experience-seeking, social media-canny cohort that are becoming the dominant demographic in travel. While aesthetics are important, blingy, performative luxury is not; conscious of overtourism and the need to prioritise wellbeing, they look for off-the-beaten-track outdoor stays where they can run, swim, surf and cycle, as well as social connection. If Kampaoh’s campsites ticked any more of the demographic’s boxes it would break TikTok.View image in fullscreenInterior of an Anza tent“We wanted to bring back the magic of connecting with nature and outdoor adventures without giving up comfort or style,” says Lora. “The new generation love experiences like camping but they also have high expectations for design, comfort and aesthetics. Visual appeal isn’t superficial; it’s part of how we live and share our experiences.”Kampaoh isn’t the only camping brand tapping into this market. In France, the Parisian hotel brand Touriste recently launched three stylishly revamped holiday parks under itsCampings Libertébrand, whileHuttopia, which began in 2000 with a small, nature-based campsite in the French Alps and a devotion to wood and canvas structures, now offers 152 sites in eight countries. Unlike other glamping providers, the aim is not to add on hotel-style frills, but to increase basic comfort. Setting themselves apart from big, pre-erected tent and cabin operators such as Eurocamp, operators like Kampaoh keep sites relatively small and, crucially, stylish.As I sit on the restaurant’s terrace sipping coffee the next morning, shielded by fig trees, I watch a steady trickle of campers heading out for the day in hiking or cycling gear. It was 37C in Córdoba when I collected my hire car, but up here it’s a pleasant 26C.

The GR48 long-distance footpath goes through it, and a network of cycling routes around it. After hiking up to a viewpoint behind the park’s visitor centre to get my bearings, I drive to the small town ofSanta María de Trassierrato walk the 20-minute path to theBaños de Popea.Remote and jungly, this river pool was a favourite spot with Córdoba’s Cántico group of poets and artists in the late 1940s. The tumble of small waterfalls and pools – full from unusual spring rain – form a magical spot, reached through glades of bear’s breech (Acanthus mollis), and paths edged with beams of gorse-like French broom.I could easily spend all day here, but there’s still Córdoba to see, with its parks of orange trees, the shady gardens of the Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos and the famous mosque-cathedral ofMezquita.View image in fullscreenThe gardens of the Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos in Cordoba, Andalucía.Photograph: AlamyThe highlight, for me, however, is theMedina Azaharaarchaeological site, just out of town. Its construction was started in 936 by the first caliph of Al-Andalus, Abd al-Rahman III. This palace-city saw service for only 70 years but its evocative ruins and richly decorated archways are a powerful reminder of its opulence. Walking the Medina’s ancient stones as grasshoppers hop and jasmine scents the hot air, it’s easy to see the appeal of this strategic location, between the mountains and the Guadalquivir River.Driving into the campsite afterwards, off a road flushed with hot pink oleanders, the landscape is washed in pale gold. Momentarily distracted by the view, I double-take as four hoopoes suddenly appear in front of me, their black and white stripes backlit by the sun. I probably ought to have taken a photo and posted it with the hashtag #kampaohvibes. Instead, I keep very still and watch. Some experiences are still tailormade for us analogue Gen Xers.The trip was provided by theSpanish Tourist Office, with support fromAndalucíaandKampaoh, which is open all year.

What else can we make with cress?Sophie, via emailThis is also a pressing matter for Rosie Birkett, author of theA Lot on her Plate Substack, because her daughter recently returned home from nursery with a yoghurt tub containing cress: “It might be tiny, but cress is mighty – peppery punchy, and full of character, almost like a mini rocket leaf.” And if eggs are off the menu, Birkett’s first port of call would be to harness the young seedlings’ ability to accessorise: “Do your usual mashed avocado with a little lemon and olive oil, spread that over bread or toast, then top with a scattering of cress. It will add brilliant bite, freshness and pepperiness.”The same goes for bruschetta, or toasts with hummus, olive oil and gentle spices such as cumin, says Anna Jones, author ofEasy Wins. She’s no stranger to growing cress, either: “I did it with my own kids, and it’s a really good lesson in seeing and feeling where food comes from.” She also recommends using the stuff where you might watercress, rocket, salad leaves or fresh, summery herbs (think chives). “I would love a cream cheese sandwich with a bit of salt, a bit of cucumber andlotsof cress,” she says. “On a hot day, that would feel quite fun and afternoon tea-ish.” In a similar vein, Birkett might stir cress through cream cheese or ricotta for a “super-simple spread” to spoon on to sandwiches or jacket potatoes, or for spreading on crackers. Otherwise, simply stir cress into hummus or, if there’s yoghurt in the fridge, another slam-dunk dip would be “thick strained yoghurt, a squeeze of lemon, maybe some grated garlic and finely chopped cress”, which would be perfect for scooping up with cucumber sticks or pitta chips.Cress is also a good gateway to greens, says Georgia Levy, author ofThe Lunch Box Substack: “It’s a very good way to get children familiar with seeing flecks of green in their food,” she says. “Try stirring some through a bowl of macaroni cheese or their favourite pasta dish, and then, in future, that can be replaced by spinach or herbs.” Well, that’s the hope, anyway. If, however, your children are already au fait with herbs, Jones would be inclined to throw her cress into a salad: “I often make a herb salad with basil, mint, a bit of parsley and cress.” But be sure to dress it with something slightly sweet, she adds: “A bit of honey, say, or maybe maple syrup.”Finally, mix cress into spuds, Birkett says: “Scatter homegrown cress on a buttery potato or sweet potato mash to add a lovely freshness and a touch of grown-up flavour that little palates might just surprise you by loving.” In theory at least, children should be more open to trying new foods if they’ve had a hand in growing them, Birkett says: “That sprinkle of cress will feel like a proud moment for them, as well as a sweet garnish.”Got a culinary dilemma?

But only when it’s warm outside.I have to say, this sounds like a lie.And yet there is undeniable proof of it, in the form of a survey of 2,000 people that was recently commissioned by LG.The television manufacturing brand?That doesn’t make it any less valid. What’s more, there’s a good chance that the survey is conservative. The true number of icy beer fanatics is probably much higher.Why is that?Because another 10% said embarrassment was holding them back from requesting ice in their beer, and another 20% said that they had previously been told off by friends, family and bar staff for requesting it.Seriously, though, why is putting ice cubes in beer a bad thing?Because beer is already delicately flavoured enough as it is, so diluting it with melted ice risks rendering it tasteless. Plus, a lot of work went into crafting that flavour profile. Don’t just mess it all up because you like your glass to clink when you swirl it.Where did this horrible trendoriginate?France, apparently. In the southern regions, it is normal to do it on a hot day.Even though TikTok is perpetually full of American people complaining about France’s innate hatred of iced drinks?Listen, things change. People put ice cubes in beer. It’s progress.This has to be the worst drinks trend of the year.Clearly someone hasn’t seen Materialists yet.OhGod, why?Because that’s the film where Dakota Johnson orders a drink that’s half beer and half Coca-Cola, known as a diesel in Germany.What is happening to the world?Calm down. People drink shandies all the time, and that’s beer and lemonade. What’s so bad about using a different fizzy drink?I suppose that does make more sense than putting ice cubes in beer.Don’t worry, this isn’t actually going to be the future.Why’s that?Because younger generations typically drink less than their older counterparts. And this, combined with the World Health Organization’s goal to reduce alcohol consumption by 20% per capita by 2030, means that drinking culture as we know it is on the verge of disappearing.Oh fine, I’ll turn a blind eye this time.That’s more like it. Barman, one half-beer, half-cola slushie, please.Do say:“I put ice cubes in my beer to stay cool.”Don’t say:“I prefer to submerge a baked potato in mine to make it more filling.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
