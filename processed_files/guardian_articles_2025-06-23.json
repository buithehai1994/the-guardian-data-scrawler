Consider me a convert!Rebecca NicholsonMon 23 Jun 2025 17.05 EDTShareThe Gilded Age is a curious, unwieldy thing. It is rich in qualities that I love, such as Broadway stars of a certain pedigree and truly extravagant hats. But, for a series that clearly takes a great effort to make, at what appears to be an enormous expense, it is oddly slight. The events of New York society in the late 19th century glide on by, as women dressed in fine, frilly clothing dip in and out of dramas that are sometimes important, sometimes entirely trivial, but almost always afforded equal weight, regardless of how much they matter. To watch it is to sink into a comfortable fugue, and think mostly about the hats.The household of the sisters Agnes Van Rhijn (Christine Baranksi) and Ada Forte (Cynthia Nixon) has undergone a significant shift in power. After their nephew Oscar (Blake Ritson) almost ruined the family by losing Agnes’s fortune, the crisis of impending poverty was averted at the last minute by the revelation that Ada’s husband, the Rev Luke Forte, who died not long after they were married, was actually stinking rich thanks to a profitable textiles business, leaving Ada a fortune. Fancy that! The Gilded Age can be so soapy that the suds practically foam on the screen.The previously timid Ada is now funding the household, while the more domineering Agnes is struggling to adjust to her new position as a dependent. When Ada is drawn towards the temperance movement, her attempts to get the staff and her family to join her crusade against the evils of alcohol get short shrift. This goes on for some time. Nixon and Baranski are great, and I suspect that at least 80% of their scenes are contrived simply so we can watch them thesp, if thesping may be used as a verb. (On the evidence of The Gilded Age, it absolutely must be.) Baranski gets to deliver the Maggie Smith lines, such as responding to claims of an unhappy marriage: “Unhappy? What is this babble?”View image in fullscreenGiving it some thespian welly … Ashlie Atkinson as Mamie Fish and Carrie Coon as Bertha Russell in The Gilded Age.Photograph: HBOThe nouveau riche Russell household, preposterously showy even by Gilded Age standards, is undergoing a similar power shift. At the beginning, George Russell (Morgan Spector) is out west, buying mines, making money and plotting to build a railway across the US. This leaves his wife, the imperious Bertha (Carrie Coon, also giving it some thespian welly), in charge in New York, and being in charge is a position she relishes. She spends much of this season pondering how to rule the roost, and meddling in the romantic prospects of her son Larry (Harry Richardson) and daughter Gladys (Taissa Farmiga), who are hot tickets on the New York marriage scene.In the previous seasons, it could be hard to work out whether the creator,Julian Fellowes, had been too constrained by what he was supposed to be making, or too free to make exactly what he wanted to make. Whole episodes would go on, and on, as the stakes dwindled away like a candle burning down to a stub. At least in Downton Abbey, he let rip the onset of Spanish flu; here, it’s mostly society snubs, as women in big hats say things such as, “I hate to pull rank, but my grandfather signed the Declaration of Independence,” and, “What a ghastly gathering.”But it’s a lot more fun this time around. Modernity is coming, through the railways and commercially viable small clocks. Money comes and goes. Divorce rears its reputation-destroying head. Marian (Louisa Jacobson) announces she has taken a job at an ordinary high school. “But won’t she need a bodyguard?”, asks aunt Agnes. Peggy (Denée Benton), one of the least tiring characters on the show, has been destined for greatness, but now we finally get to see her on the verge of achieving it.There is romance everywhere. The debate over whether to marry for wealth, security or love, and whether these ambitions are mutually incompatible, is played out in various relationships, over different social plains. There is even the prospect of international fame, amid some boo-hiss villainy from English society, as the old ways butt heads with blunt American forthrightness.The Gilded Age has become not just grand, but silly too. Instead of joylessly pompous, this show is nowjoyfullypompous. I’m in.The Gilded Age aired on Sky Atlantic, and is now available on Now in the UK, HBO and Max in the US, and Paramount+ in Australia.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJulian FellowesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fast-moving as in totally suboptimal. Fast-moving as in completely out of his control. Fast-moving as in he would rather have pulled the duvet over his head and pretendedthe whole thinghad been a bad dream. That he could go back to sleep for a while and wake up to the world as it was.Maybe we all wish we could do that. These are the days that many of us would rather had never happened. Does the world feel any safer to you today?Then there is no accounting for Donald Trump. There has never been a more capricious US president. Even The Donaldhas no idea what The Donald is going to do next. The only certainty is uncertainty. A man who lives almost entirely in the present. No sense of the past. No sense of the future. Just a collection of unpredictable neurons desperately trying to fire across the synapses.Just last week,Keir Starmerfelt able to sign a communique with other leaders of the G6 – Trump had long since got bored and gone home – which talked of finding a diplomatic solution in the Middle East.There were hopes that The Donald could be talked out of the military option. That his macho posturing was just that. Hell, even Trump was talking of givingIrantwo weeks to come good on reaching a nuclear deal acceptable to the west. There again, the president often says things will happen in two weeks. It’s almost a Pavlovian response. Almost as if he has no idea how long two weeks is. Could be a day. Possibly two.Maybe it was the Taco label that got to The Donald in the end. Trump Always Chickens Out. But sometime between sunrise and sundown on Saturday, The Donald decided he knew better than his own director of intelligence services and ordered stealth bombers tounload their bunker busterson three of Iran’s nuclear facilities.Trump had asked himself: “Do you feel lucky, punk?” and had decided that, on the whole, he did feel very lucky. Hell, that Nobel peace prize wasn’t going to win itself, was it?The reaction was everything the Donald would have hoped for. Total confusion. Chaos. Trump’s speciality. The US secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, immediately declared the operation atotal success. The greatest military raid the US had ever done. No other president could have been that visionary.Iran’s nuclear capability had been totally destroyed, Pete said. Just as the rest of the world was saying there was no real evidence yet to support that. Maybe Iran’s nuclear facilities were still in the game after all. But don’t worry, Pete added. Everything was going to be just fine. This was just a one-off. Regime change had never been part of the plan. Hold my beer, The Donald chipped in.Back in Blighty,David Lammywas trying to play catch-up. Trying to look as though he had known about the military operation all along, when he had been just as blindsided as the rest of us. That he had got the call from the president when the planes were about an hour out of Iran and been presented with a fait accompli.Even now, he was still unsure whether it would have been better to be in on the plan – part of the inner circle – or to have the legitimate deniability of the outsider.Come Monday morning,Lammy was in entirely defensive modeon Radio 4’s Today programme. Refusing to answer any questions about whether the US action had been lawful. “We weren’t involved,” he said, time and again when Justin Webb pressed him.Which wasn’t really the point. The UK was certain that other wars in which we were not involved were unlawful. So if we could pronounce on their legality, how come the foreign secretary was so reluctant to give a view on the US bombing Iran? A simple yes or no would have cleared things up.Things were no clearer when Lammy gave a statement to the Commons in the afternoon. Iran couldn’t have nukes, he said. It had failed to reassure the west. So … it had sort of had it coming. Not that we Britons would have gone about things that way, but the Americans quite liked the smell of napalm in the morning.Now things got even more confused. Because although the escalation had been one of those things that just happen from time to time, it was now time to de-escalate.And it was up to Tehran to dial things down a bit. Run that one past me again, Dave. Iran was the one that had just been attacked and it was somehow their fault. They were the ones who needed to come to the negotiating table. Clearly different rules apply in the Middle East.We need a diplomatic solution, said Lammy. Though he couldn’t rule out a little more recreational bombing in the days ahead. “What happens next is hard to predict,” he concluded. Code for “HELP”. “RUN FOR THE HILLS.”This was to be a session of firsts. Because in reply, Priti Patel said she wanted to work constructively. Something she has never before done in her life. Mostly, though, she was just sad that she wasn’t foreign secretary andcould have launched a few bombs of her own. There’s no way she would ever have been left out of the loop. Please, please, she begged, if there is to be a second attack, please can she join in? Possibly even flying a plane.Other people saw things differently. Emily Thornberry observed that the only way to end the crisis was with a deal and at present she could see the US had no clear objectives. Negotiations could only be successful if there was mutual trust. And bombing wasn’t generally conducive to trust. Wimp, muttered Priti Vacant. Constructive to the last.Explore more on these topicsDavid LammyThe politics sketchDonald TrumpIranKeir StarmerNuclear weaponsIran's nuclear programmeForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

No one would say, “Better not put the kettle on in case somebody wins a quid”’Interviews byRich PelleyMon 23 Jun 2025 09.57 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 16.02 EDTShareDavid Liddiment, ITV director of programmes (1997-2002)I was responsible for the schedule. I’d listened toChris Tarrantdoing this game on the radio – Double or Quits – which was brilliant. I was intrigued by its TV version, called Cash Mountain, because it was well known in the industry that various people had turned it down. I invited the producer, Paul Smith, to pitch the full idea to me and Claudia Rosencrantz, ITV’s controller of entertainment.My main worry was: how likely was it to bankrupt the network? Four multiple-choice answers seemed too easy. I played the game with Paul in the office, with Claudia as my phone-a-friend, and quickly realised that as the amount of money at stake got higher, more and more doubt crept in. “We’re not going to call it Cash Mountain. I think that’s a terrible name,” I said. “Let’s call it Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” It’s the title of a song written by Cole Porter for the 1956 film High Society.I agreed to commission it, so long as we could do a non-broadcast pilot. It was clear that the quiz never really drew to an end: one contestant would win or lose, then another comes on and does the same thing. There was no natural climax. So I thought we should launch it as a strip – on every night – to maximise the drama. Initially I was going to schedule it at 7pm, but I already had Emmerdale working well at five times a week at 7pm, so I decided to go for broke and play it at 8pm, in the hope that the tension of someone potentially winning a million quid would create gripping prime-time drama.Rather brilliantly, it did very well and became a hit within its first week. Because everyone was talking about it, the ratings got bigger, and we had a phenomenon on our hands. Then the whole world recognised that what was happening in Britain was quite extraordinary – and everybody wanted their own version.Chris Tarrant, presenter (1998–2014)I was at Capital Radio presenting the breakfast show, and also doing the clip show Tarrant on TV. David Briggs, my former producer at Capital, had left to seek his fortune on TV. We’d done a game on the radio called Double or Quits, where your pound doubled with every correct answer. Briggsy said over a lunch one day: “I’m trying to turn it into a TV format.” I was so bloody busy, up at 5am, I only did the pilot as a favour.We shot it in July. The producer Paul Smith said: “It needs more menace.” Composers Keith Strachan and his son Matthew were given 24 hours to rewrite the music, all those stings and “Da da das …” so we could shoot a second pilot straight away. We knew the prizes had to go up fast. Nobody would say: “Better not put the kettle on in case somebody wins a quid.” It was my job to add tension. The prize was a cheque, so I’d say: “We don’t want to give you that …”My screen didn’t show the answer – and if I knew it, I’d do this really gormless faceThe pauses were added to really milk the tension. The show was filmed the day before, with rough spots where we needed to break to the adverts. I’d deliberately choose the most dramatic places to cut to commercials, usually between the contestant giving their final answer and me saying whether it was correct. I always wondered if, when the first person played for a million, I’d still have the guts to say: “We’ll take a break.”But I did when Judith Keppel was on her way to winning the first million, and she looked at me like: “You bastard!”Briggsy said it was about the shoutabilty: people shouting at the television. My screen didn’t show the answer. Even if I did know the answer, I’d taught myself to do this really gormless face, not even raising an eyebrow. I remember one contestant, this really nice guy, a fireman. His £500,000 question was: which of Henry VIII’s wives did Holbein paint a portrait of? It’s weird what you remember from school. I was thinking: “For fuck’s sake, just say Anne of Cleves.” He didn’t answer and settled on £250,000. I’d have bet a million quid I was right.The press thought winning such high amounts of money would ruin people’s lives. We had therapists on standby, but no one who won £500,000 said: “Take me to my therapist.”Before the first show, I was in my dressing room with my wife and manager. I said to them both: “Do you mind giving me 10 minutes?” I must have thought: “You better take this one seriously, mate. It might go big.”Jeremy Clarkson, presenter (2018-present)The Grand Tour had just gone from weekly to two specials a year, freeing up a lot of time. Wayne Garvie, president of Sony PicturesTelevisionand an old mate from the BBC, had worked out he owned the rights to Millionaire, and asked if would I like to host it.Kevin Lygo, the managing director of ITV Studios, said: “That sounds like good idea.” I signed on the dotted line right there. We went through a couple of runs on a laptop in my office. Before I knew it, I was learning how to use the Autocue in the TV studios in Manchester. The main problem is that the Autocue is so far away, I’ve had to start wearing spectacles.View image in fullscreen‘Unbelievably cool’ … Jeremy Clarkson with £1m winner Donald Fear in 2020.Photograph: Stellify Media/PAI didn’t think I needed to stamp my personality on the show. I thought: “Chris Tarrant did a pretty good job. I just have to do what he was doing.” One of the new things was the “Ask the host” lifeline. I don’t think there’s any shame in not knowing about Greek mythology or tiramisu. Sometimes you luck out. I was asked: “What was the first American spaceship to orbit the Earth?” I knew it was Friendship Seven, and thought: “I’m going to look like an absolute genius.” Other times you’re asked, “What’s a four-legged animal that barks?”, don’t know the answer, and feel like an idiot.Donald Fearis the only person who has won a million on my watch. He was unbelievably cool. The million-pound question was something about pirates that I didn’t know, even though I’d just done a programme about pirates, but he knew it was Blackbeard.I’m supposed to wear hearing aids these days – I’m deaf as well as blind – but people would assume it was an earpiece and I’m feeding people the answers, so I thought I’d better not. These days you can even get spectacles that translate any language in real time. Presumably you could use similar technology to help you answer various questions, but they have an independent adjudicator to spot any anomalies like that. How the coughing thing ever happened was incredible. When you watch it, you think: theymusthave known something odd was going on.It’s a show I really look forward to. I get up with a spring in my step when I think: “I’m off to ask people what the capital of Ecuador is.” It’s great. I get to sit in a nice, warm chair and make people happy. You can’t ask much more than that.Explore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeTelevisionChris TarrantDavid LiddimentJeremy ClarksonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is time we recognised this extreme weather for exactly what it isMon 23 Jun 2025 12.38 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 14.25 EDTShareIthink I must be on someone’sRolodexof killjoys, because whenever something good happens – schools break up, summer holidays start, the weather’s nice, it’s Christmas, it’s Easter – I get a call from a talk radio show asking if I’ll come on and explain why that’s bad, actually. Usually I say, in the nicest possible way, that I don’t want to: sure, kids are much more annoying when they’re not at school; yes, it’s irresponsible to fly; no, Christmas isn’t magic, it’s an orgy of overconsumption; yes, Easter was pillaged from pagans (probably?), and Christianity itself is the imperialist template (arguably?) – in which case, the last way we should mark it is with aCreme Egg. But I just don’t want to be that person. Let someone else ruin everything for a change.On Friday, however, I agreed to make the argument the next morning onLBCthat heatwaves aren’t a treat, they’re a problem. We have to do more than just ready our infrastructure for the more intense temperatures to come: we have to bring our narrative a bit closer to reality. The climate crisis isn’t tomorrow’s problem, it’s today’s, and its impacts aren’t better conditions for vineyards in Kent, they are a broad-spectrumenshittification, in which everything, from bus journeys to growing dahlias, becomes harder, and takes longer, and is worse. It was, in other words, exactly the kind of true, unlovely thing that I don’t like being the person to say, and I don’t know why I said yes – it’s possible that I was just too hot.Once the thought was implanted, though, I couldn’t help but notice the heatwave media formula, and how extravagantly weird it is. It starts a few days before, as soon as the Met Office gives us all a heads-up, and is illustrated with either a stock photo of an ice-cream, or a chart of graphics in which the sun is always smiling and sometimes has his hat on. As the heat begins, images pour in as they happen: kids splashing in a fountain, heaving beaches. It’s like illustrating a war with a photo of a soldier coming home and kissing his sweetheart: sure, that must happen to some people, eventually, but it is not most people’s lived reality of war. More evocative photos would be: your pet, or anyone’s pet, lying beached on the floor, with that baleful, all-species expression: “How are you doing this to me, human, and why?”; people on the tube looking as if they’re all about to faint; office workers fighting over a fan; tourists overwhelmed by the merciless sun on their shelterless day trip to hell.I went on a tour of the Arctic Circle once, years ago, and we all moaned constantly about the cold, until the gruff Swedish guide said: “Listen, you marshmallows,” (he really did call us that; I kind of liked it), “At least you can protect yourself against the cold. How do you protect yourself against the heat?” A woman in the group said: “That’s easy – factor 50 and a piña colada,” and everyone laughed, and it’s taken me 25 years to realise that even though she was funny, he was still right.Weather tracker: Europe and China in midst of record-breaking heatRead moreAn estimated600 people will die as a result of this one heatwave. Those kinds of numbers from a virus would spark at least a localised lockdown, and in a plane crash, a national day of mourning. But it’s hard to respond to climate fatalities proportionately without confronting global heating and taking on the underlying inequalities that make some people more vulnerable than others. High temperatures are much more dangerous when you’re disabled, when you’re homeless, when you’re incarcerated, when you’re old. It would be pretty rum to be squeezing disability benefits at the same time as worrying about whether disabled people are at greater risk from the weather, and need more care – better to imagine this an act of God, in which the deaths cannot possibly be prevented.In the end, I got benched by the radio show. I think they might have also given a bit of thought to what an anti-heat argument would sound like, and decided I’d be too depressing. But I wasn’t depressed at all. I was relieved – the collective effort of kidding ourselves that it’s too hot to move but that’s awesome takes more effort than you’d think.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While some viewers loved the dialled-up-to-11 intensity of everything – more characters, more drama, more staggering brutality – others found the tone relentlessly bleak. And this was a show whose original concept – a cabal of rich benefactors recruit poor people to compete in bloodsports for cash – was already plenty dark. Anyone hoping the show’s third and final season, arriving this week, will provide a reprieve should probably just rewatch Emily in Paris instead.“The tone is going to be more dark and bleak,” says series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk, through an interpreter. “The world, as I observe it, has less hope. I wanted to explore questions like, ‘What is the very last resort of humankind? And do we have the will to give future generations something better?’ After watching all three seasons, I hope we can each ask ourselves, ‘What kind of humanity do I have left in me?’”Characters die in creative ways, like being pulled off a ledge in a gigantic tug of war gameThat’s a lofty ambition for what has become a flagshipNetflixshow – one of the defining cultural products of the 2020s, which seemed to hold a mirror up to a new era of desperation and savagery. The first and second seasons set global viewership records for the streamer – remarkable for a show that’s not in English – and in 2023, it released Squid Game: The Challenge, a reality show based on the series, which saw contestants competing for a $4.5m prize. All this in spite of the fact that Squid Game is also one of the most extraordinarily violent shows ever aired, featuring all manner of brutal, disturbing death scenes. Watching the show can be a gruelling experience: in nearly every episode, several characters are pushed to their limits before being unceremoniously shot by one of the show’s pink-suited guards.Because of Squid Game’s outsized success, it is surprising the show is ending after only three seasons in four years. By the time its finale airs, Stranger Things, another Netflix hit, will have run for five seasons over nearly a decade. Lee Jung-jae, who plays hapless hero turned vigilante Gi-hun, says Hwang’s vision initially didn’t even allow for a second season. “He told us Squid Game was a limited series,” he says, also through a interpreter. “But because it was met with so much love from across the world, he had to do subsequent seasons.”View image in fullscreenAttention-grabbing … Park Gyu-young as No-eul.Photograph: ./NetflixThe fact that Squid Game was conceived as a one-and-done hasn’t lessened the show’s impact. After a shocking first season that played up the contrast between the children’s playground aesthetic and the copious amounts of blood and betrayal, season two raised the stakes with complex, attention-grabbing new characters. The purple-haired rapper Thanos, played by the rapper TOP, was a bizarre pill-popper with a proclivity for violence and speaking in a strange version of English, while Park Gyu-young played Kang No-eul, a North Korean defector who becomes a guard.While he is aware of criticisms of the second season, Lee says there was no opportunity to change season three, given that the two seasons were filmed back to back. And besides, fan response was not the chief consideration. “The messages of Squid Game are very important,” says Lee. “Instead of ‘fixing’ the narrative, we just wanted to make sure the message was conveyed. And of course it’s a TV show – you have to provide entertainment. In season three, we have new games, new characters, twists and turns. It’s going to be very entertaining – but with a message.”That message – about humanity’s capacity for violence, and the danger capitalism puts people in – has been consistent throughout, but in season three, ideas of vengeance and retribution are given a lot of airtime, and the show leans into moral ambiguity even more.This darkness is at odds, Hwang suggests, with what most viewers are looking for. “People like a happy ending,” he says, “I’m like that too. But some stories, by nature, can’t have one. If you try to force one, the essence is compromised. If a story is holding up a mirror to something, then it’s not always a happy ending. Squid Game is no exception.”As for whether loyal fans will be satisfied with the ending, Lee remains tight-lipped about what we will see, but is philosophical about its effect. “The finale was something even I didn’t expect,” he says, “so I’m sure a lot of fans will not see it coming. I think a lot of people will have different reactions. It’s definitely going to spur a lot of conversation. I’m looking forward to listening.”For Lee, making two seasons back-to-back was challenging. “It was non-stop filming for about a year and two months,” he says. “So it was draining, physically. But I could really immerse myself in Gi-hun. When I’m stressed out or physically drained, I usually have really good food and that cheers me up. But I was on a diet. There was no way to release the stress!”Lee is a veteran of the South Korean screen but he finds playing Gi-hun – who goes from wet-blanket nobody to hardened hero – endlessly exciting. “Gi-hun is constantly pressed,” he says. “He’s very frustrated, because whatever he tries to do is just not working. If someone is pushed to that extent, even a good guy can change. It was intriguing to play a character who goes through so much change.”Sometimes the show’s intense brutality – characters die in horrifying and creatively violent ways, such as falling through glass panels or being pulled off a ledge in a gigantic game of tug of war – can feel almost desensitising, which Lee says isn’t the intention. “I really hope that people don’t become desensitised,” he says. “All these characters have very tragic backstories. I hope people will focus on that and mourn their deaths.”Squid Game’s anticapitalist sentiment is so strong that it is strange to see the number of promotional tie-ins Netflix has set up, with companies ranging from McDonald’s to Uber – many of which have been accused in the past of putting profits before employee wellbeing. Hwang says that, at the end of the day, Squid Game exists in a capitalist system.View image in fullscreen‘Fans won’t see it coming’ … Squid Game season three.Photograph: Noh Ju-han/Netflix“For me and Netflix,” he says, “we started out wanting to create a commercial product. It would be too far a stretch to criticise wanting to profit from something that criticises the capitalist system. No studio is going to want to create a story that’s too critical of society. Having said that, if I felt [the partnerships] were too excessive, to the point where I felt it was damaging the spirit of the show, I might feel differently. But it wouldn’t be right for me to tell Netflix not to do something. I don’t have the legal grounds for that. I have had certain feelings about certain things, but I do not think it would be right for me to say exactly what, or to express my negative feelings.”Perhaps that’s because Hwang is already thinking about what a Squid Game sequel might look like. “There’s no saying we’ll never do something again,” he says. “I don’t want to close the door – there are some threads left untied. If I were to come back to the Squid Game universe, I think I would come back with a spin-off. Narratively, there’s a three-year gap between seasons one and two. While Gi-hun was on the search for the Front Man and the Recruiter, what were those villains up to? What do the pink guards do outside Squid Game? Those would be fun ideas to explore.”‘I didn’t sleep for days’: readers on the TV shows that went way too farRead moreThere’s also the matter of the show’s US remake, which is reportedly being developed by David Fincher, director of Gone Girl and The Social Network. Hwang says he hasn’t had any confirmation, but he looks forward to seeing Fincher’s take. “I am a big fan – I watched a lot of his works when I was studying film. So if it’s true, I welcome it with all my heart.”Until then, Squid Game fans have the show’s final season, which seems destined to spark as much hullaballoo as the previous two. “People have been so curious. A lot of them come to me asking for spoilers. I keep telling them that if you want to have fun watching season three, you just have to hold still. It’s coming.”Squid Game season three is on Netflix on 27 JuneExplore more on these topicsSquid GameTelevisionNetflixDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

From pop A-listers to underground ones-to-watch, here are our picksBen Beaumont-ThomasMon 23 Jun 2025 05.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 08.59 EDTShare‘Not a vintage year,” came the usual grumbles about the Glastonbury lineup when it was announced in March – and it’s perhaps only in England where people would moan about the lack of quality on offer at a festival with more than 3,000 performances across five days. In reality, Glastonbury remains stacked with varied, progressive, boundlessly vital artists, and the real challenge is picking your way through them: here are some of our tips.The big namesAt 79,Neil Youngis as irascible and fired-up as a man a quarter of his age, and seems to steel-tip his laurels so he doesn’t rest on them: after reuniting with Crazy Horse in 2024, he’s swapped them out again for new backing band the Chrome Hearts (featuring 81-year-old legend Spooner Oldham on organ). You rather hope Young will get the same memo Elton John did in 2023, stating that the Pyramid crowds need more hits than most, though he may well ignore it. Even if he does, an ornery and obscureNeil Youngset is still a thrill.Olivia Rodrigodelivered a bracing seton the Other stage in 2022, naming the supreme court justices who overturned Roe v Wade that weekend and telling them “we hate you, we hate you” – and she has splenetic pop-punk and heart-rending balladry to match that venom. And kicking off these three Pyramid headliners on Friday night, there’s no doubting the pop heft ofthe 1975’s quite considerable catalogue, their lyrics rooted in the weirdness of the way we live now.View image in fullscreenSunset at the Pyramid stage.Photograph: Joanne Newman/AlamyOutside the headliners,Alanis Morissette– anthemic, ubiquitous in the 90s – is the kind of artist the Pyramid crowd unites behind: songs such as You Oughta Know and Ironic will be big moments.Noah Kahan’s Stick Season will be another huge Pyramid singalong, andRod Stewartback-to-back withChicis about as crowdpleasing as it gets.Rayeplays her biggest show to date before Young – she pairs old-Hollywood glamour with genre-surfing, propulsive pop and will put on a sumptuous show. Former Little MixerJadebrings bug-eyed personality to her solo performances, as dothe Prodigy, who still sound unhinged three decades after their peak. In the field and at home on TV, all eyes will be onKneecap– cabinet ministers and indeed our prime minister have voiced their distaste at this set going ahead, but you hardly imagine they’ll dial down their political fury, or indeed ketamine-referencing rap-rave intensity. AndCharli xcx’s current power-walking, phlegm-licking, Brat-heavy live show is the work of a pop star operating at the highest level.View image in fullscreenShowboating duo … Alt Blk Era.Photograph: Dean Chalkley for Earache RecordsRising starsIt’s worth trying, but you’ll be lucky to get in the Woodsies tent forLola Youngin her breakthrough year, showcasing global hit Messy and more – and the Avalon stage will probably be even more oversubscribed forParis Paloma’s dramatic, Florence-esque songcraft andOrla Gartland’s maximally emotive pop, any of whom could have commanded a decent Other stage audience. It feels as if Aussie indie-poppersRoyel Otisare one song from pan-Glasto awareness and are shamelessly populist, with their big singalong choruses (“you’re so fucking gorgeous!”) and bigger cover versions (Linger, Murder on the Dancefloor) making them a very reliable bet in a mixed-taste friendship group.Anyone unable to wait for the Prodigy’s industrial-jungle onslaught can enjoy a similar vibe from showboating duoAlt Blk Era. Rapper and singerLemfreck, winner of the Welsh music prize, is turning heads with his versatile vocalisations: one minute offering a croaking, conversational flow, the next soaring Sampha-like soul songs. And any Kneecap fans should check out hot drum’n’bass producerMozey– he did their latest single.Rap and R&BIf there is a criticism to be made of the lineup it’s that there’s a relative dearth of rap names – possibly a reflection of its waning position in mainstream pop culture – but there’s a scattering of masterful MCs, including arguably the hottest on earth right now:Doechii, whose preening brilliance, undercut with radical and self-lacerating honesty, makes for a series of miniature soap operas, dark thrillers and situation comedies. Her delivery, almost like dotting words on to the mic rather than speaking through it, is almost as superhuman as fellow performerBusta Rhymes, whose brain and embouchure continue to operate in a completely different gear.Don’t missBawo, whose funny and ruminative lyrics make him one of the UK’s most underrated MCs, followed straight after by beautifully melismatic R&B singerSasha Keableand socially conscious veteran UK rapperBashy.View image in fullscreenWedded to the hardcore punk scene … Turnstile.Photograph: Sonja Horsman/The GuardianRock and indieGlastonbury’s unofficial “no mosh” policy continues to fray at the edges, with some of their heaviest bookings to date. Powered as ever by Chino Moreno’s nape-tickling groans and nu-metal chatter,Deftoneshave rightly become lauded as true greats and this set could promise some cross-generational circle pits, helicoptering dreadlocks and airborne pints. DittoTurnstile, who – especially live – remain totally wedded to the hardcore punk scene even as they expand their sound.Woodsies on Sunday lunchtime offers a brace of smart, sardonic post-punk turns, first fromGurriers, then from Irish quartetSprints: powered by the withering vocals of Karla Chubb, they went Top 20 with their debut and they’ll no doubt be touting new material here. Also worth an earlyish start isHorsegirl, the Chicago indie-pop trio whose second album, produced by Cate Le Bon, is among this year’s very best, full of head-turning contradictions: naive yet world-weary, doleful yet brightly melodic. Having sloughed off his Black Midi bandmates,Geordie Greepis a maximalist prog-pop showman, whileRachel Chinouriri’s own alt-pop stagecraft has been honed by a spell supporting Sabrina Carpenter, and the reformedTVon the Radio, fronted by the ultimate Dilf in Tunde Adebimpe, remain magnetic.Dance musicIt started with a trickle of acts including Underworld and Orbital, and three decades on Glastonbury is essentially the UK’s best dance festival. One of the people from which today’s entire dance culture flows,Juan Atkins, is doing two polar opposite sets: as the bodypopping Cybotronas well an ambient set under his own name. Another Detroit icon,Richie Hawtin, is followed by similarly austere gear fromAmelie Lens, whileMathew Jonsonis another class act in the pure techno realm.Easing us in on Thursday evening areMajor League DJz, one of the biggest names pushing South Africa’s calm yet sensual amapiano sound. Of the back-to-back sets,Kettama b2b Interplanetary Criminalhas the potential for the most T-shirt-stripping, lizard-brained pandemonium of the weekend, whileConfidence Man b2b Job Jobsewill be chirpily cheery. In the bass zone,Skream and Bengawill hurl wobbling dubstep boulders andHiTechwill booty-shake through witty ghettotech, whileCalibretops an awesome daylong lineup of drum’n’bass and UKG at Levels on Friday. And kicking open the doors of perception with mini strobes in hand are two world-class, mind-expanding producers questing to the coalface of dance culture:VerracoandAvalon Emerson.Global namesView image in fullscreenEmotive musicianship … Abel Selaocoe.Photograph: Parlophone Records LtdAt 80, reggae legendBurning Spearis still devoted to uplifting Black consciousness and some gentle skanking for his mid-afternoon Pyramid set will limber you up nicely for the evening ahead, while there’s similar depth of heritage from his compatriotsBlack Uhuru. Argentine rappersCa7riel and Paco Amorosomay not be widely known in the UK but if their live set here is anything like their phenomenally popularTiny Desk concert, they’ll create one of those crowds that swells and swells – get there early.For a blast of pure emotive musicianship check out South African cellistAbel Selaocoe, whileIchiko Aoba’s pretty yet profound ambient pop will be equally spellbinding, and Italian pop-Afrobeat troupeRumba de Bodasare the kind of group to get multiple generations out of their folding camping chairs. And in what is fast becoming a great tradition at Glastonbury, the vibrancy of the global south Asian underground is given its fullest expression across multiple areas, including new stage Azaadi which hosts UK legends such asBally SagooandPanjabi Hit Squadalongside new-school names including US duoBaaltiand Mumbai techno DJRafiki.Events from the GuardianThe Guardian is hosting three Q&A events at the Astrolabe theatre, at noon each day.

The images appeared to confirm that Iranian authorities had preemptively removed some material from the site, possibly including its uranium stockpile – or parts of it.On Monday, Israeli jets struck Fordow in order to obstruct its access routes, the IDF said.According to briefings from unnamed US and Israeli officials to American and Israeli media, Fordow had been heavily damaged but not destroyed. A senior US officialtold the New York Timesthe site had been taken “off the table” but that even 12 bunker-busting bombs could not destroy it.Speaking in Vienna, Grossi said that given the “explosive payload utilised and the extreme vibration sensitive nature of centrifuges, very significant damage is expected to have occurred.”He added, however, that “at this time, no one, including the IAEA, is in a position to have fully assessed the underground damage.” Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, had earlier said Tehran was still “calculating the damage”.Grossi also called for agency inspectors to be allowed to return to Iran’s nuclear sites in an effort to “account for” Iran’s highly enriched uranium stockpiles and a “return to the negotiating table”.Whether or not Iran had managed to remove technology and uranium from the attacked sites is likely to be a key question in the coming days and weeks.“We are going to work in the coming weeks to ensure that we do something with that fuel and that’s one of the things that we’re going to have conversations with the Iranians about,” the US vice-president, JD Vance, told ABC’s This Week on Sunday, referring to the stockpile of uranium theoretically sufficient to make nine or 10 atomic weapons.Natanz enrichment facility satellite imageSatellite images released by several imaging companies in the immediate aftermath of the US strikes suggested changes to the above ground topography of the Fordow site, which is buried beneath layers of sedimentary rock in the Zagros mountains.Other images showed what appeared to be two distinct clusters of holes in a ridge at the site, caused by the entry of the dozen bunker-busting Massive Ordinance Penetrators dropped by US B2 Spirit stealth bombers.According to Joseph Rodgers, deputy director and fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Project on Nuclear Issues, the US bunker busters appeared to have targeted ventilation shafts at the Fordow facility.“The reason that you’d want to target a ventilation shaft is that it’s a more direct route to the core components of the underground facility,” Rodgers told Wired magazine.Among those so far sceptical about the impact of the US strikes was Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, who tracks Iran’s nuclear facilities.“At the end of the day there are some really important things that haven’t been hit. If this ends here, it’s a really incomplete strike,” Lewis told NPR, echoing other experts who pointed to Iran’s continued retention of enriched uranium as the key issue.In a lengthy thread on social media, Lewis expanded his point: “This means Iran has retained 400kg [of 60% highly enriched uranium], the ability to manufacture centrifuges, and one, possibly two underground enrichment sites.Isfahan nuclear complex satellite image“That is enough, if enriched further, for nine nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA’s calculation, although Iran insists it does not seek nuclear weapons.”“That is also to say nothing of possible secret sites, which opponents of the JCPOA [the Iran nuclear deal Trump pulled out of] used to invoke all the freaking time,” Lewis said.“If the strike leaves the current regime, or something very much like it, in power with a nuclear option then it will have been a strategic failure. What does it say when two of the most amazing military operations in modern memory are still unable to fully eliminate Iran’s nuclear programme? I think that’s proof that this is tactical brilliance […] may be in service of a foolhardy strategy.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

This outage has added to people’s fear and anxiety, as we no longer knew which cities had been bombed or which areas were under evacuation orders.If the internet outage continues, many jobs will be lost.The government has arrested [scores of] people on charges of espionage and collaborating withIsrael, [people fear that the regime] is planning to execute them. Just today on the national television news, arrests and executions were announced.It’s frightening – because even if, hypothetically, these individuals were spies, a fair trial should take weeks to prove such a charge.The government has deployed police patrols and checkpoints at entrances of [various] cities and main streets, [according to] friends and relatives of mine who live in different cities. I see them every day in Kerman. They are even randomly confiscating mobile phones in the city, searching cars both when entering and leaving the city, and also on the main streets during normal traffic. It hasn’t happened to me yet.It seems that the United States has also joined the war. People are worried about the risk of radioactive contamination [as nuclear facilities are being bombed].View image in fullscreenThere are concerns that the Bushehr nuclear power plant could be targeted.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAWe are very afraid that Iran might respond to the US attack, and that the situation could get worse. We are also worried about a possible strike on the Bushehr [nuclear power plant] facility, [that] this could lead to another Chernobyl.A map of Iran showing the location of the Bushehr nuclear power plantA large number of people have returned to Tehran, although the bombing there hasn’t stopped. People were forced to come back to the city. Many of my friends also returned because they have to work, otherwise they won’t have any income. And many people don’t have a place to stay outside of Tehran for many weeks.There are gasoline shortages, and even in safer cities such as Kerman, many businesses have partially shut down. Everything is semi-closed. Online businesses, tourism-related jobs, and travel agencies are shut down.The postal service is closed, which has led to the closure of online shops as well. University exams and the national university entrance exam have been cancelled. However, government offices and banks remain open.Many private companies have not paid salaries, and it’s unclear when they will. I myself haven’t received my monthly salary either. My company announced that due to the wartime situation, they are currently unable to process salary payments. The same goes for my husband, as production in his factory has completely halted.I have some savings, but if the war continues and salaries remain unpaid, my savings will run out in at most two or three weeks. This is the case for most people. Due to high inflation, it’s very difficult for us in Iran to save much money.In smaller townslike Kerman, Yazd, or Rafsanjan, food supplies are still available, although prices are rising sharply.However, in Tehran and other major cities, there is now a significant shortage of bread, fruit, eggs, and other essential food items.[I don’t know anybody who has tried leaving the country] – not yet. People are still in shock and believe that this war will end soon. It’s probably a psychological defence mechanism. Many believe the war will end once most major military sites have been bombed.One of my friends, who is undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, has run into serious trouble.The medications for her chemotherapy used to be sent from Tehran every day, but now it is no longer possible to deliver them.With each passing day, situations like these are getting worse.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelUS foreign policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

No assessment had yet been completed on the effectiveness of the US attacks, he added, raising questions over whether Iran has moved its enriched uranium to a new site.Lammy, in an hour-long statement to the Commons, also disclosed an RAF plane had evacuated 63 British nationals and their dependents to Cyprus fromIsrael. He said negotiations were under way to help the 4,000 British nationals in Israel that had registered with the Foreign Office.View image in fullscreenLammy gave an hour-long statement to MPs in the Commons.Photograph: Parliament TV/PAReferring to the Iranian parliament’s decision to vote for the closure of the strait of Hormuz, he said contingency plans were in place.He told MPs: “Be in no doubt we are prepared to defend our personnel, our assets and those of our allies and partners. We are closely monitoring how energy markets are responding to the conflict. We have been extremely clear to the Iranians. Any action to blockade their straits of Hormuz would be a monumental act of self-harm, making a diplomatic solution even harder.”The strait of Hormuz: how could Iran close it and why does it matter to global trade?Read moreLammy repeated his plea for Iran to return to the negotiating table. He said: “My message for Tehran was clear, take the off-ramp, dial this thing down, and negotiate with the United States seriously and immediately.“The alternative is an even more destructive and far-reaching conflict, which could have unpredictable consequences.”For the first time since the crisis broke, party political splits started to emerge with Liberal Democrats, Scottish National party and Labour backbenchers, including the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Emily Thornberry, challenging the trustworthiness of the US and the legality of its action.Lammy was repeatedly asked if the UK’s reputation as an upholder of the rules-based order was not damaged if it could not admit the acts of its allies were unlawful.By contrast the Conservative frontbench and Reform MPs congratulated the US’s actions, with some MPs backing regime change. Lammy said: “It’s not our belief that it is for us to change the regime of any country – that is for the people of that country.”He added: “I am confident that this is not about regime change and the Israelis have been clear they are not attacking the civilian population.”Asked about the Israeli bombing of the gates ofEvin prison in Tehran, he said he had been reassured in a phone call by the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, that “nuclear targets remained their objective and focus at this time”.The UK has long taken the view that any public criticism of the US only reduces the UK’s private influence, but it has been rare for the government to be so circumspect in setting out its views on such a major crisis.Lammy did implicitly question the wisdom of a US strategy based heavily on air power, saying that “strikes cannot destroy the knowledge Iran has acquired over several decades nor any regime ambition to deploy that knowledge to build a nuclear weapon”.Thornberry expressed her concern over whether diplomatic negotiations favoured by Lammy would occur since that required a modicum of trust. She said given that Donald Trump tore up the previous nuclear deal in 2018, Israel had ended the previous US-Israel talks by striking Iran and an emboldened Benjamin Netanyahu was talking about regime change, it was difficult to see how negotiations based on trust could take place.Lammy broke new ground by saying for the first time that the UK’s focus in any future diplomatic negotiations would be a requirement for Iran to accept zero enrichment of uranium, saying we have “moved on” from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that allowed Iran to enrich to 3.75%.He said Iran was in breach of its obligations by enriching uranium at levels of purity as high as 60% and said the country was engaging in deception and obfuscation.Speaking to the BBC, he refused to say if he agreed with the latest US intelligence assessment that Iran was close to securing a nuclear weapon, saying instead that he relied on the report from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear inspectorate, which said in its latest report it had no evidence that Iran was seeking to make a nuclear bomb.Explore more on these topicsIranDavid LammyIsraelIran's nuclear programmeForeign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Karim Sanjabi, the leader of the secular liberal National Front, was a former Sorbonne-educated professor of law. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was the leading Shia opponent of the Iranian monarchy since the 1960s. Both were in their 70s at the time.Sanjabi had arrived in Paris with the draft declaration of goals of the coming revolution the two men were to lead. The document stated that the revolution would be grounded on two principles: that it be democratic and Islamic. Yet Sanjabi later recalled to historians that at the Paris meeting Khomeini in his own handwriting added a third principle to the declaration – independence.That third principle, the primacy of independence, born of Iran’s history of exploitation by colonial powers, helps to explain what may seem otherwise mysterious in the current dispute between Iran and the US: Iran’s dogmatic insistence that it must have the right to enrich uranium. It has been the issue that dogged the talks between Iran and the west over Tehran’s nuclear programme since the turn of the century and was the sticking point in the two years of discussions that were eventually settled in Iran’s favour when thejoint comprehensive plan of action(JCPOA) was agreed under the Obama administration in 2015. It is the reason why Iran is being bombed now by Israel and, at the weekend, by the US.View image in fullscreenThe Iranian Islamic Republic army demonstrates in solidarity with people in the street during the Iranian revolution. They are carrying posters of Ayatollah Khomeini.Photograph: Keystone/Getty ImagesYet to many American eyes, this obsession with enrichment inside Iran, instead of importing for instance from Russia, is only explicable if it is accepted that Iran covertly wants to build a nuclear bomb. The fatwa against “un-Islamic” nuclear weapons twice issued by the supreme leader has to be a smokescreen, this US perspective goes.On social media last week,JD Vance, the US vice-president, largely took that view. He wrote: “It’s one thing to want civilian nuclear energy. It’s another thing to demand sophisticated enrichment capacity. And it’s still another to cling to enrichment while simultaneously violating basic non-proliferation obligations and enriching right to the point of weapons-grade uranium.“I have yet to see a single good argument for why Iran needed to enrich uranium well above the threshold for civilian use. I’ve yet to see a single good argument for why Iran was justified in violating its non-proliferation obligations.”The process for enriching uranium to make civil nuclear energy and a nuclear bomb is broadly the same. It is generally accepted that uranium enriched to 3.67% is sufficient for civil nuclear energy, while purity levels of 90% are required for a nuclear weapon. Once purity levels reach 60%, as in the case of Iran, it is not a lengthy process to proceed to 90%.Iran, of course, argues there is no mystery why it has enriched to these high levels of purity. It was part of a clearly signalled staged escalatory response toDonald Trumpunilaterally pulling the US out of the JCPOA in 2018 – an act that that had deprived Iran of the sanctions relief it had negotiated. Moreover, Trump, by imposing secondary sanctions, made it impossible for Europe to trade with Iran, the second planned benefit of the JCPOA.Iran’s politics as a result for the past decade has been shaped by the sense that it was the wronged partner, and the US confirmed as inherently untrustworthy.Centrist figures such as the former president Hassan Rouhani and the foreign minister Javad Zarif expended huge internal political capital to sign a deal with the west, and the west promptly reneged on it. Meanwhile, Israel, a country that is not a member of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty – unlike Iran – and which has a totally unmonitored and undeclared nuclear weapon, receives largesse and support from the west.Nevertheless, Vance may have a point. As a casus belli, the right to enrich uranium to purity levels of 3.67%, the level permitted under the JCPOA, seems on the surface an implausible issue for the current supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, to risk martyrdom.View image in fullscreenIranian lawmakers burn two pieces of papers representing the US flag and the nuclear deal as they chant anti-American slogans at the parliament in Tehran, Iran, May 2018.Photograph: APWhy did a country with large oil reserves feel such a need to have home-grown civil nuclear energy?A persuasive new account by Vali Nasr, entitled Iran’s Grand Strategy, helps unlock the key to that question by placing the answer in Iran’s colonial exploitation and its search for independence.He wrote: “Before the revolution itself, before the hostage crisis or US sanctions, before the Iran-Iraq war or efforts to export the revolution, as well as the sordid legacy of Iran’s confrontations with the west, the future supreme religious guide and leader of Iran valued independence from foreign influence as equal to the enshrining principles of Islam in the state”.Khamenei was indeed asked once what was the benefit of the revolution, and he replied “now all decisions are made in Tehran”.Nasr argues that as many of the lofty ideals of the revolution such as democracy and Islam have been eroded or distorted, the principle of Iranian independence has endured.The quest for sovereignty, he argues, arose from Iran’s benighted history. In the 19th century, Iran was squeezed between the British and Russian imperial powers. In the 20th century its oil resources were exploited by British oil companies. Twice its leaders – in 1941 and 1953 – were removed from office by the British and Americans. The popular prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh was removed ina CIA-engineered coup in 1953due to his demand to control Iran’s oil resources. No event in contemporary Iranian history is more scarring than Mosaddegh’s toppling. For Khomeini it confirmed Iran still did not control its destiny, or its energy resources.Fear and shock in Iran: ‘I’m constantly afraid a missile might hit my home’Read moreAlthough civil nuclear power and the right to enrich became a symbol of independence and sovereignty after the revolution, Ellie Geranmayeh from the European Council on Foreign Relations points out it was the British and the Americans that introduced nuclear power to Iran in what was named an “atoms for peace” programme.The shah of Iran, with US approval, embarked on a plan to build 23 civil nuclear power stations, making it possible for Iran to export electricity to neighbouring countries and achieve the status of a modern state. Michael Axworthy, the pre-eminent British historian of contemporary Iran, said: “Using oil profits in this way seemed a then sensible way of investing a finite resource in order to create an infinite one.”In an interview with the Washington Post, Henry Kissinger later admitted that as US secretary of state he raised no objections to the plants being built. “I don’t think the issue of proliferation came up,” he said. Work started on two nuclear reactors including one at the port city of Bushehr with the help of the German firm Kraftwerk Union a subdivision of Siemens and AEG.The shah recognised the dual use for nuclear power, and in June 1974 even told an American journalist that “Iran would have nuclear weapons without a doubt sooner than you think”, a remark he rapidly denied. Gradually the US became more nervous that the shah’s obsession with weaponry might mean Iran’s civil programme turning nuclear.After the Iranian revolution in 1979, progress on the near-complete two stations ground to a halt. Khomeini regarded nuclear power as a symbol of western decadence arguing bloated infrastructure projects would make Iran more dependent on western imperialist technology. He said he wanted no “westoxificiation”, or gharbzadegi in Farsi. The programme was largely ended, to the disappointment of some nuclear scientists.But within a year or two electricity shortages and the population boom put pressure on Tehran’s policy elite to start a discreet reversal of the shutdown. Iraq’s use of chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq war, Tehran’s sense of diplomatic isolation in seeking international condemnation of Iraq’s repeated attacks on the incomplete Bushehr nuclear station, and finally multibillion-dollar legal wrangles with European firms over the incomplete nuclear programme of the shah, together spawned a nuclear nationalism.By 1990, Iran’s AtomicEnergyAuthority declared that by 2005 20% of the country’s energy could be produced by nuclear electric power and 10 power vaults would be built over the next decade.Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran’s speaker of the parliament during the 1980-88 war and then president from 1989 to 1997, made numerous appeals to Iran’s nuclear scientists to return home and build the programme. In 1988 he said: “If you do not serve Iran, whom will you serve?” Suddenly Iran’s nuclear programme had shifted from a symbol of western modernism to a source of patriotic pride.By the turn of the century, the Iranian nuclear programme was erroneously thought to consist primarily of several small research reactors and the nuclear light water reactor being constructed by Iran and now Russia at Bushehr.Rafsanjani later admitted Iran first considered a deterrent capability during the Iran-Iraq war, when the nuclear programme first resumed. He said: “When we first began, we were at war and we sought to have that possibility for the day that the enemy might use a nuclear weapon. That was the thinking. But it never became real.”Rafsanjani travelled to Pakistan to try to meet Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme who later helped North Korea to develop an atomic bomb.In mid 2002, a leak from a dissident group, possibly via the Mossad, revealed that Iran had two secret nuclear installations designed for enriching uranium at Natanz near Isfahan and Kashan in central Iran. Iran said it was under no obligation to notify the International Atomic Energy Agency UN nuclear inspectorate of the existence of the plants because they were not operational. Iran added the non-proliferation treaty declared it was the “inalienable right” of all states to develop nuclear programmes for peaceful purposes under IAEA safeguards. In itself, uranium enrichment is not a sign of seeking to make a nuclear weapon, but critics said it was hard to explain why Iran needed to make nuclear fuel at a stage in which it had no functioning nuclear reactor.From then on, the diplomatic dance started and has continued at various levels of intensity ever since.In October 2003 via the Tehran declaration, Iran under huge international pressure due to the leak, agreed to sign the additional protocol, which authorised the the IAEA to make short-notice inspections. In November 2004, under the Paris agreement, Iran agreed to suspend uranium enrichment temporarily pending proposals from the E3 (France, Germany and the UK) on how to handle the issue on a more long-term basis. But in deference to Iran’s sovereignty, the E3 recognised that this suspension was a voluntary confidence-building measure and not a legal obligation. ButMahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran’s populist president elected in June 2005, became more assertive, insisting Iran’s technology was the peaceful outcome of the scientific achievements of the country’s youth. “We need the peaceful nuclear technology for energy, medical and agricultural purposes and our scientific progress,” he said.View image in fullscreenMahmoud Ahmadinejad visits the Natanz uranium enrichment facility in April 2008.Photograph: APGradually the case for negotiation increased. With the US demanding an end to enrichment and Iran insisting on its legal right to enrich, the E3 were caught in the middle. All kinds of compromises were floated, including by Brazil and India. But western opinion was shaped by the then head of the UN nuclear inspectorate, Mohamed ElBaradei, who said: “In my view Iran’s nuclear program is a means to an end: it wants to be recognised as a regional power, they believe that the nuclear knowhow brings prestige, brings power, and they would like to see the US engaging them.”Rouhani made a similar point in an article in the Washington Post. He said: “To us, mastering the atomic fuel cycle and generating nuclear power is as much about diversifying our energy resources as it is about who Iranians are as a nation, our demand for dignity and respect and our consequent place in the world. Without comprehending the role of identity, many issues we all face will remain unresolved.”Nevertheless, if Iran’s goal with its nuclear programme was security and independence, and not something more sinister, the leadership has paid a huge and probably self-defeating price.Explore more on these topicsIranNuclear weaponsNuclear powerAyatollah Ali KhameneiMahmoud AhmadinejadThe Iranian revolutionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has also been signed by former cabinet minister Louise Haigh andVicky Foxcroft, who quit as a Labour whiplast week.They claim the amendment, to be published on Tuesday, is not intended to wreck the welfare bill but as many Labour MPs are uneasy about the government’s plans that could be the eventual outcome.“We all want the Labour government to succeed in getting people back into work and supporting those who can’t. We don’t want to defeat the government but we want the government to think again,” Hillier told the Guardian.“We are being asked to vote before consultation with disabled people and before impact assessments.”Ministers have argued that dropping, or even watering down, the welfare plans could leave a multibillion-pound black hole in Rachel Reeves’s attempts to balance the country’s books.But Hillier said: “We recognise that the financial situation is difficult. As the chancellor says governing is about choices. We don’t disagree that there is a need to reform welfare but it’s hard to deliver the proposed improvements in the proposed timescale. And disabled people must be protected.”Dozens of backbench MPs have signed the amendment. . Government whips have already beensteeling themselves for a rebellionon the welfare bill when it is first voted on next week.A senior MP said: “The government hasn’t listened to private concerns so now will have to address these very public ones.”The aim would be to pass a so-called “reasoned amendment”, which halts the passage of a bill. It means the bill would not pass its second reading, saying that provisions “have not been subject to a formal consultation with disabled people, or co-produced with them, or their carers”.It also says the bill should not pass until the Office for Budget Responsibility can publish its analysis of the employment impact of the changes this autumn. The amendment adds that most of the additional employment support funding will not be in place until the end of the decade.It notes the government’s own impact assessment estimates that 250,000 people will be pushed into poverty as a result of the provisions, including 50,000 children. It calls for an assessment of the impact of the changes on health or care needs and for the conclusion of other reviews.The amendment would need to be selected by the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and gain the support of opposition parties to pass, and there is no guarantee of either. But the symbolism of so many MPs signing the amendment would make taking the bill forward extremely problematic for Keir Starmer.The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, has addressed a private meeting of MPs at which she told them there was “no route to social justice based on greater benefit spending alone”.She said the cuts were about “ensuring the welfare state survives” and that the government would always seek to protect those with the greatest need.Some frontbenchers are believed to be considering their positions ahead of next Tuesday’s vote on cuts to personal independence payments and changes to the health-related element of universal credit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At least 170 MPs have expressed concerns about the bill in public interventions and private letters to party whips.Foxcroft, a former shadow disability minister,quit her post last weekas a government whip, saying she could not support the cuts, which could affect more than a million people.The changes, which are at the centre of a £4.8bn welfare cuts package, will mean even people who are unable to wash half their body or cook a meal for themselves will be denied the payments if they have no other impairments.Look at Labour’s cruel attitude towards disability benefits, then tell me Keir Starmer cares about ‘human dignity’ | John HarrisRead moreReeves denied earlier on Monday that the government would go any further to appease MPs, either by making tweaks to the changes or by delaying the vote. “There will be no U-turn. We’re voting on it next week,” she said.Speaking to MPs at the parliamentary Labour party meeting, Kendall urged them to support the government and emphasised the extra support it would be establishing.“The path to fairer society – one where everyone thrives, where people who can work get the support they need, and where we protect those who cannot – that is the path we seek to build with our reforms,” she said. “Our plans are rooted in fairness, for those who need support and for taxpayers.“They are about ensuring the welfare state survives, so there is always a safety net for those who need it. They’re about putting proper safeguards in place to protect the most vulnerable.“But above all they are about our belief that everyone can fulfil their potential and live their hopes and dreams when – collectively – we provide them with real opportunities and support.

Britain pushed for and secured a later date.Military chiefs are expected to welcome the announcement but officials acknowledged the 5% increase would combine traditional defence spending of 3.5% with a broader “whole of society” category worth 1.5% of GDP.Some defence officials have privately said the headline figure risks conflating military capability with investment already budgeted for by the Treasury. They pointed out that the target would be hit only after the next election but one.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had faced weeks of lobbying from pro-defence Labour MPs and military figures for a higher spending ceiling amid warnings that Britain risked falling behind its Nato peers.No 10 is presenting the commitment as a signal of seriousness before a meeting involving Nato leaders and the US president, Donald Trump, in The Hague on Tuesday. However, some MPs are concerned that the timing of the announcement gives the UK less leverage at the summit.The pledge, which comes before the publication on Tuesday of the government’s national security strategy, will formally split the 5% pledge into 3.5% for core defence and 1.5% for wider resilience, covering infrastructure, energy security, cyber defences and economic shock absorption.The strategy will include a long-awaited review of UK-China relations, which was part of Labour’s manifesto and was originally planned to be released in January.The government has promised to spend 2.5% of the country’s economic output on defence by 2027-28, with a further ambition to spend 3% at some point during the next parliament.Nato’s secretary general,Mark Rutte, has called on member states to commit this week to the target of spending 5% of GDP when Trump is rewriting his country’s role in global security.Europeans back higher defence spending amid Russia threat, poll findsRead moreThe US president, who has in the past threatened to walk away from Nato unless allies step up their contributions, has also urged them to reach 5%. The US spends 3.4% of GDP on defence.UK officials say the 5% ambition reflects the reality of modern threats – from supply chains and food prices to digital sabotage and economic coercion.However, the UK’s 2035 target is three years behind the 2032 deadline originally pushed by Rutte amid difficult negotiations and resistance from the Treasury.The prime minister will travel to The Hague “against a backdrop of global volatility”, No 10 said, citing Israeli and US strikes on Iran, the continued war in Ukraine and Russia’s intensifying aggression.While rising tensions in the Middle East may dominate the summit, Starmer is expected to use the occasion to argue that a “just and lasting peace in Ukraine is only possible if we continue to show strength” and that there will be “no letup” in British support.While officials are framing the 5% commitment as future-facing and economy-linked, it is unclear whether the package will meet Washington’s higher bar and harder definition of military readiness.Some of the UK’s allies have moved notably faster and more decisively. Germany, under chancellor Friedrich Merz, has eased constitutional debt limits to fund a €500bn (£425bn) rearmament programme and has pledged to reach 3.5% by 2029.Poland and the Baltics are already spending 4% to 5% of GDP. Spain has opted out entirely, striking a deal with Nato to keep its defence budget at just above 2%, arguing that it could meet its defence commitments with lower investment than allies.The UK currently spends about 2.3% of GDP on defence. A formal Nato review of progress toward the 5% goal is expected in 2029, by which point Starmer and Reeves will face renewed scrutiny over whether rhetoric has been matched by delivery.A No 10 spokesperson said the pledge marked a “generational increase in defence and security spending”, adding that it would “have a considerable impact on the strength of our alliance”, given the UK’s position as the second-largest economy in Europe and third-largest in Nato.Starmer said: “This is an opportunity to deepen our commitment to Nato and drive greater investment in the nation’s wider security and resilience.“After all, economic security is national security, and through this strategy we will bring the whole of society with us.”Explore more on these topicsDefence policyNatoMilitaryMark RuttenewsShareReuse this content"

If passed, it would make it illegal to be a member of, or invite support for, Palestine Action.The group, founded in 2020, says it aims to prevent the commission of genocide and war crimes in Palestine and to expose and target property and premises connected to such crimes against humanity.Many of its activists have been acquitted by juries in the past and a letter from Kellys Solicitors, which represents several Palestine Action activists, sent to Cooper on Monday said the group “has gathered a significant level of public support”.But in her statement, the home secretary said: “The disgraceful attack on Brize Norton in the early hours of the morning on Friday 20 June is the latest in a long history of unacceptable criminal damage committed by Palestine Action. The UK’s defence enterprise is vital to the nation’s national security and this government will not tolerate those that put that security at risk.”Palestine Action called the proposed ban “unhinged” and accused Keir Starmer of “rank hypocrisy”, given that he defended protesters who broke into RAF Fairford in 2003 to stop US bombers heading to Iraq.View image in fullscreenAfter arrests were made in London’s Trafalgar Square on Monday, protesters chanted ‘Let them go’ at lines of police.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianDescribing its members as “teachers, nurses, students and parents”, it said: “This is an unhinged reaction to an action spraying paint in protest [at] the UK government arming Israel’s slaughter of the Palestinian people.“The real crime here is not red paint being sprayed on these warplanes, but the war crimes that have been enabled with those planes because of the UK government’s complicity in Israel’s genocide.”It said Cooper’s statement repeated a series of categorically false claims made by pro-Israel groups and that its lawyers were pursuing all avenues for legal challenge.The letter to Cooper from Kellys, shared exclusively with the Guardian, said there were no previous instances of direct action protest organisations being proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000, despite several others having used comparable methods to Palestine Action, and that it was a “terrifying precedent” to place it alongside groups such as Islamic State, al-Qaida or National Action.It said: “Whilst some actions of those associated with Palestine Action have involved damage to property, activists do not advocate or intend unlawful violence against the person. A significant number of actions associated with Palestine Action have used entirely conventional campaigning methods such as marches, rallies and demos. It is an authoritarian turn and an abuse of language to label them as a ‘terrorist’ organisation.“The proposal to proscribe Palestine Action is wholly unprecedented and constitutes an unlawful, dangerous and ill thought out attack on freedom of expression and assembly.”View image in fullscreenProtesters in Trafalgar Square in London called the government decision ‘anti-democratic’ and a shocking overreach.Photograph: Ethan Parker/The GuardianAmnesty International and Liberty also wrote a joint letter to Cooper before the announcement to express their concerns.The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the government’s decision “as absurd as it is authoritarian”, adding: “It represents a draconian assault on democratic right to protest and is a disgraceful attempt to hide the real meaning of violence: the mass murder of Palestinians.”The Labour peer and barrister John Hendy KC said: “This is an abuse of anti-terrorist legislation which was passed to apply to terrorist activities, not non-violent protest. There is a full armoury of criminal laws to deal with unlawful non-violent protest, as the PM knows better than most.”The former justice secretary Charlie Falconer said on Sunday that the “sort of demonstration” at Brize Norton would not justify proscription, “so there must be something else that I don’t know about”.The home secretary’s statement appeared to offer no new information about the group. Cooper said it had been deemed to meet the threshold for proscription “through a robust evidence-based process, by a wide range of experts from across government, the police and the security services”.On Sunday night, the Metropolitan police placed public order restrictions on a planned solidarity demonstration for Palestine Action, so hundreds of supporters instead took to the streets surrounding Trafalgar Square in London on Monday afternoon.A Met spokesperson said 13 people had been arrested, including six people for assaulting an emergency worker. “While the protest initially began in a peaceful manner, officers faced violence when they went into the crowd to speak to three individuals whose behaviour was arousing suspicion,” they said.“This sequence of events repeated itself on multiple occasions, with officers being surrounded on each occasion they tried to deal with an incident.”As arrests were made, protesters chanted “Let them go” at lines of police. Those in attendance called the government decision “anti-democratic” and a shocking overreach.Among those concerned was Nasiya, who has lived in London for 20 years. Born and raised in South Africa, she knew what apartheid looked like first-hand, she said, as she held a placard that said: “Remember when they called Nelson Mandela a terrorist.”She said: “It breaks my heart to think that I fought for something growing up, to see a change in the world, and that change hasn’t really turned to fruition.”Explore more on these topicsProtestIsrael-Gaza warYvette CoopernewsShareReuse this content"

Hungary, which is a staunch ally of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, opposed even launching the review.Over the weekend, Israel reacted furiously tothe leaked review, describing it as “outrageous and indecent”. In a memo to the EU’s foreign service, it said the review was“a biased and extremely one-sided summaryof many anti-Israeli voices”.The EU report is largely based on findings from UN bodies and the international court of justice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Every second of delay costs lives.”The association agreement, which came into force in 2000, underpins a trading relationship worth €68bn (£58bn) between the 27 EU countries and Israel.

We see the world through the same lens. We stand for the same values.”Canada won’t become the 51st US state – but could it join the EU?Read moreNot mentioned was another leader in the transatlantic space: Donald Trump, whose disrespect for old allies appears to have galvanised what was an already healthy EU-Canada relationship.The US president is expected at the two-day Nato summit in the Hague starting on Tuesday, when members of the transatlantic alliance are called to pledge to spend 5% of GDP on defence.Carney, a veteran central banker turned politician, wona stunning victory in Aprilpledging that Canada would not become the 51st US state, a proposal often floated by Trump.He said he had a mandate “to diversify and strengthen our international partnerships” and find new means of cooperation and coordination. The summit took place, Carney told reporters: “in a hinge moment of history, a world that is more dangerous and divided, a time where the rules-based international global order is under threat”.The EU-Canada security and defence partnership opens the door to increased Canadian participation inthe EU’s fledgling €150bn defence fund, known as Safe. Von der Leyen said the defence partnership meant working on joint capabilities, interoperability and joint procurement, referencing air defence. “The access of Canada to our joint procurement in the European Union, the door is open,” she said.The security pact is a Canadian version of the agreement the EUsigned with the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, last month. The bloc already had similar arrangements with six other countries including Norway and Japan, but this is the first with any country in the Americas. The defence pact includes joint work on cyber, maritime and space security, arms control and support for Ukraine.Countries that have a defence and security pact with the EU can take part in joint procurement of weapons funded by the €150bn (£128bn, $173bn) Safe programme, although must negotiate a further technical agreement. Von der Leyen pledged both sides would “swiftly launch talks” on Canadian access to the joint procurement scheme.Carney said the agreement with the EU would help Canada “deliver on our new capabilities more rapidly and more effectively”. Canada has been one of the laggards of the Nato alliance: in 2024 it spent just 1.37% of GDP on defence, well below the 2% set in 2014.The two sides have a €125bn trading relationship, underpinned by the Ceta pactsigned in 2016that abolished 98% of tariffs. The agreement, however, has yet to be ratified by national parliaments in 10 EU member states, includingBelgium, France, Italy and Poland, meaning elements of the deal have yet to enter into force.In advance of the meeting, Carney and his wife, Diana Fox Carney, visited Schoonselhof military cemetery in Antwerp, where 348 Canadians are buried. On social media, Carney wrote: “brave young soldiers who ventured across the Atlantic to defend the freedom of Europe”.The Carneys were accompanied by Belgium’s prime minister, formerly a long-serving Antwerp mayor, Bart De Wever, where they were given a tour of the ceremony and laid wreaths on behalf of Belgium and Canada. The last post was played by one of De Wever’s sons, according to local paper Het Nieuwsblad.Explore more on these topicsCanadaEuropean UnionTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsAmericasEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But the concert has become a topic of debate, with campaigners urging Brighton and Hove city council, which owns the venue, to cancel the performance.Now, the MP Siân Berry has expressed concerns in an open letter to the local council leader, arguing the concert goes against “the city’s well-renowned values”,the Argus reported.Marilyn Manson: Unmasked review – should a tour bus really need the age of consent pinned to the wall?Read moreManson, 56, has repeatedly denied all the allegations and called them “provably false”. In January,California prosecutors said they would not file charges against Mansonafter a years-long investigation of sexual assault and domestic violence allegations.Berry, a Green MP and former leader of the party inEnglandand Wales, highlighted multiple policies she felt the event went against.These include the city plan, which states there is “no place in our city for fear of crime, violence, or abuse”. She said the concert’s age restrictions would allow children as young as 14 to attend.“Many survivors in Brighton and Hove, and organisations supporting them, will have serious concerns about this booking and its wider impact on other people visiting the city centre, local residents and the wider community,” Berry wrote in the letter to the council leader, Bella Sankey, which was co-signed by a host of groups and the University of Sussex students’ union.She said freedom of expression was an important principle that should be defended, including in relation to artists, “but there is an obvious risk to community cohesion and the council has separate equalities obligations to foster good relations between people who share protected characteristics and people who do not share them”.She added: “The council has a responsibility to take action where there are risks of discrimination, harassment and victimisation.”Berry wrote that “the level and nature” of the accusations against Manson were “concerning” enough, “but so too is the message sent out by providing a platform for this individual, at our city’s biggest publicly owned venue, and what this will mean to survivors”.In January, US prosecutors said the allegations against Manson exceeded the statute of limitations and that they could not prove charges beyond a reasonable doubt.The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke with were not revealed, but the Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco – whosued Manson in a case that now has been settled– said she was part of the criminal investigation.In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for nonexistent roles in music videos and movies.In 2021, Manson’s former fiancee, the Westworld actor Evan Rachel Wood, also named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

The mission was seen as a test run for future celestial bodies that may be on a course for Earth.Asteroid 2024 YR4, which orbits the sun, is now too far away to be properly observed and is not expected to be visible again until 2028, when researchers can reassess its size and trajectory.Despite earlier concerns that an impact with the moon might alter its orbit around Earth,Nasa ruled out that scenario in Aprilwhen it reassessed its size.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsAsteroidsThe moonSpaceAstronomynewsShareReuse this content"

And I couldn’t be more proud of my country for all that it represents and all that it is doing.”Evans was born in England to Welsh parents but has considered himself Irish – and Ireland his home – since he was a toddler.He formed U2 in 1976 with three Dublin classmates – Paul Hewson, better known as Bono, Larry Mullen Jr and Adam Clayton – and went on to record Sunday Bloody Sunday and other songs that became Irish anthems.Evans, however, never got around to applying for citizenship. “Honestly, there were many moments in the past when I could have done it with just the form to be filled out but I’m happy it’s now, it feels more significant,” he said.Wearing an Irish tricolour clip, Evans swore an oath of loyalty and fidelity to the Irish state with hundreds of other newly created citizens in the Gleneagle arena – one of several back-to-back ceremonies that will confer citizenship on 7,500 people on Monday and Tuesday.He said the ceremony had been very moving and especially significant for him because of Ireland’s support for multilateral organisations, such as the international criminal court and the UN, and for “speaking truth to power”.“I have always felt Irish, Ireland will always be home to me and I’m so grateful for that,” he said. Ireland was showing real leadership in the world, he said. “It couldn’t come at a better moment for me so I am just so happy to be at this point, to be in even deeper connection with my homeland.”Critics of U2 say the band’stax arrangements, which route some income not generated in Ireland overseas, undermine its commitment to the country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They include shop assistants, meat plant workers and financiers.The minister for justice, home affairs and migration, Jim O’Callaghan, said the ceremonies were milestones that would connect the new citizens to their adopted homeland. He said: “It is a great privilege to become a citizen of this country and obviously with it comes responsibilities and duties, and I think everyone who is taking on citizenship will be aware of that.”His comments came amid a growing backlash against immigration in the US andEurope, including Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Could reusing greywater help?Sandra LavilleExperts say the average Briton uses too much water per day and societal change needs to start today to tackle looming water crisisMon 23 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 15.33 EDTShareWater shortages are no longer a distant threat. By 2055, in England alone, the publicwill face a shortfall of 5bn litresa day – a shortfall of such immensity it will require societal and cultural change, which experts argue needs to start today.Scientists have long predicted that the UK would not be immune to climate change-induced extreme weather. The evidence is all too clear now that our traditionally grey, mild and wet European island – which this weekend experienced a heatwave made100 times more likelyby climate breakdown – is already in the midst of a water crisis that will only worsen in years to come.The Environment Agency has said it expects water companies to save 60% of the 5bn litres a day shortfall by managing customer demand and reducing the 3bn litres a day they leak from their pipework.The remaining 40% would come from boosting supply, including through the construction of new reservoirs and water transfer schemes.David Black, the chief executive of Ofwat, has recently urged people to cut water use by shortening shower times, collecting rainwater and turning off taps when brushing teeth. And last week, AffinityWateradvised customers to cut water use with the same tips.While these are sensible ways to reduce individual household consumption, with public trust in the water industry at an all-time low as a result ofBritain’s rivers being flooded with sewage, it might be a hard message to land.What is so far missing is a strategic response from the government, the regulators and water companies to change behaviours and facilitate the reuse of rainwater as well as the greywater in our homes – the runoff from baths, showers, and washing machines – to properly tackle high water consumption.The average person in the UK uses 142 litres of water a day,compared with 78 litres a day in Slovakia– the lowest in Europe – and 300 litres per day in Switzerland (Europe’s highest).While the government has a target under the Environment Act 2021 for individuals to cut their water use to 122 litres per person per day by 2037-38 – considered far too unambitious by many – the existence of the target is a mystery to most people because there has been no public information campaign, no social media outreach and no widespread household leafleting to explain the problem and encourage changes to our lifestyles to reduce consumption.Ofwat has been talking about a public information campaign for several years, and the Guardian understands that after many delays, a £100m campaign will be launched later this autumn.For their part, water companies are focusing bill payers’ money on mega-engineering projects to boost supplies, such as desalination plants, water transfers and new reservoirs, rather than investing significant energy into a strategic approach to make reuse a feasible option in our homes.Mark Lloyd, the chief executive of the Rivers Trust, said rather than being seen as waste, water must be treated as a precious resource, managed as close as possible to where it falls as rain and appreciated for the critical role it plays in our economy, ecosystems and in keeping us alive.“We cannot simply build and bulldoze our way to water resilience,” he said.Smart meters are considered the best way to cut household consumption because they provide real-time usage data, identify leaks and encourage behavioural change.Yet only an estimated 12%of households in England have smart meters fitted.In countries more used to drought conditions, holding on to water and reusing it is an established system. Rainwater collection and reuse, capture and reuse of greywater, are all tried and tested methods to reduce water consumption in countries such as Australia, Cyprus, the US and Japan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Residential reuse projects for non-potable water – that is not suitable for drinking – can be found in every state of Australia.Alastair Chisholm, the director of policy at the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management, said harvesting rainwater or greywater and reusing it to flush toilets could cut an individual’s water use to 80 litres per person per day.He wants the government to set upa national rainwater management strategyand make it mandatory that new-build properties limit consumption to 80 litres per person per day via new pipes and fittings to enable rainwater or greywater reuse.A key change which is urgently required is an amendment to the ‘“wholesome water’” rules inEnglandand Wales which mean that water companies can only supply drinking water to homes. This is a barrier to the companies implementing any water reuse schemes which use greywater or rainwater.Building regulations also need to change to mandate water efficiency to 80 litres per person per day in new homes, he said.“We need to treat rainwater as a resource and asset to be valued and we need regulatory and policy change to do this,” said Chisholm.Explore more on these topicsWaterEnglandanalysisShareReuse this content"

One of the most important messages in the strategy is that the government will focus on accelerating growth for the fastest-growing third of the economy.The government has identified eight sectors – the IS-8 – that it judges have the highest potential for economic growth. They are: advanced manufacturing, the creative industries, life sciences, clean energy, defence, digital and technology businesses (including artificial intelligence and quantum computing), financial services such as banking and insurance, and professional services such as accounting and the legal profession.Those sectors will receive the bulk of government industrial support, whether that be through cheaper energy prices, trade support or skills training.Here are some of the most important policies in the strategy.Cutting energy costs for big usersThe centrepiece of the industrial strategy is reducing energy costs for big electricity users – although not immediately. Action to cut energy costs has been a keyrequestfrom industry for years.The government said that it would introduce a “British industrial competitiveness scheme” from 2027, toreduce electricity costs for 7,000 businesses that use electricity intensively. Companies in manufacturing sectors such as automotive, aerospace and chemicals will be exempted from paying for the renewables obligation, feed-in tariffs and the capacity market. Those “policy costs” were imposed to pay for green energy programmes but industry has long argued that they put British businesses at a disadvantage to competitors.Energy-intensive industries – including makers of steel, chemicals and fertilisers – will alsoreceive a 90% discount, up from 60%, for other policy costs that help to fund the electricity network. The government said the network charging compensation scheme will cut costs for about 500 businesses from 2026.Speeding up grid connectionsEnergy costs are not an issue for companies thatcannot even connect to the gridin the first place for factories, energy generation or housing. To reduce the queueing times, a new “connections accelerator service” – launched by the end of this year – will act as a concierge for projects that could create jobs or speed economic growth.The government will add new powers to change regulatory processes to make it easier for strategically important projects to get connected, and will look at ways of pressuring network companies to speed up.Increase exportsThe government wants to be seen as a free trade champion, even as the US turns to protectionism. It highlighted talks on trade agreements with the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, South Korea, Switzerland and Turkey, aligning industrial strategy with Japan, and looking at ways to deepen cooperation with France and Germany.Overseas investment support will be focused on the IS-8 companies, and ambassadors in key markets will be tasked with drawing up plans to help those sectors. UK Export Finance, a government department that guarantees loans for exports, will be allowed to grow further.Defence technologyThe government hasalready committed to increased defence spending, making it an attractive source of funding for British industry in straitened times. At least 10% of the Ministry of Defence’s equipment budget will go on “novel technologies” such as drones and artificial intelligence. To that end, UK Defence Innovation, a body announced in March, will get a budget of £400m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That took its total capacity to £25.6bn.The BBB will be allowed to take equity stakes for the first time of up to £60m, which could give the government big, direct economic returns if startups become highly valued, billion-dollar “unicorns”.Quicker medicines and opening health dataThe government will aim to cut delays to medical trials and “streamline” drug approval processes at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to try to accelerate development of new treatments and make it more attractive for companies to invest in the UK. NHS procurement of medical technology will also be accelerated.What was missing?There is still more detail to come on various important sectors. Notably, “sector plans” for the life sciences and financial services, plus a whole separate “defence industrial strategy” have not yet been published.Ministers have also promised a trade strategy, a “resilience strategy”, a clean energy workforce strategy, a circular economy strategy to look at the reuse, repair and recycling of materials and products, and a critical minerals strategy, to add to the huge pile.The government is also relying on other policies to provide benefits for British businesses – eventually. Monday’s industrial strategy did not offer any new policies to reduce wholesale energy bills,by far the most important determinant of overall costs. In the longer term, the government hopes that increased renewable electricity supplies will lead to much lower prices.Explore more on these topicsIndustrial policyEconomic policyEconomicsEnergy industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On a visit to London, he discusses Ukraine, immigration – and his presidential intentionsMon 23 Jun 2025 10.22 EDTFirst published on Mon 23 Jun 2025 06.41 EDTShareIn the conference room of a hotel in Kensington, the man who would be France’s next head of state is sharing his views about Brexit. Microphone in hand,Gabriel Attalis here to meet activists and expatriates. Once 270,000 strong, London’s French community has dwindled in recent years. The 36-year-old leader of Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party is doing his best to gee them up.“We are waking at the moment from a long sleep when we talk about relations between France and the UK,” he says. In the face of war inUkraineand turmoil in the US, old alliances are reforming. “Many thought the channel would become an ocean. And that all the ties that bound us had to be cut. But we are emerging from this sleep because in some measure we are forced to.”In two years, when the term of his mentor, Macron, comes to an end, Attal is positioning himself to lead their centrist party intobattle against Marine Le Pen’s populists. If he succeeds, he would take not only Macron’s crown but also his record as France’s youngest-ever president. For now, he is launching himself on the international stage, with visits to Ukraine, Israel and later this year to Africa.Macron’s party moots banning headscarves in public for under-15sRead moreIn London last week, he was accompanied by his bodyguards and a team of smartly dressed young men, staffers and parliamentarians, graduates like him of France’s elite Sciences Po universities. During his visit he called on the former UK prime ministerTony Blairand laid a wreath at the statue of the French wartime leader Charles de Gaulle. On Wednesday evening in Kensington, in the heart of London’s French quarter, he addressed his audience with the confidence and lyrical flow that have earned him the nickname of “le snipeur des mots” – the word sniper.View image in fullscreenGabriel Attal and Tony Blair meet in London.Photograph: @GabrielAttal“Liberty was given by the proponents of Brexit as a reason why they had to leave the EU. But being free is not being able to choose the colour of your passport. It is about being able to choose the face of your destiny.”Attal’s rise through the ranks has been a succession of firsts. At 29, he became the country’s youngest postwar minister after being put in charge of education. At 34, in January 2024,he became prime minister, another record. He was cheered in the national assembly when he spoke of his pride at being the first out gay man to hold the office. It was a short-lived success – Attal’s term came to a premature end last September after Macron calleda snap electionin a bungled attempt to see off the hard right.View image in fullscreenGabriel Attal (right) in London, where he was accompanied by a team of smartly dressed young men.Photograph: SuppliedDusted off and back in the saddle, he has not officially declared his candidacy for the presidential race in 2027, but he is fairly open about his intentions. Asked whether he would stand during an interview with the Guardian, Attal replied: “J’y travaille.” (I’m working on it).The interview was supposed to be in person but London traffic intervened, and Attal, after a polite apology, spoke by phone from a car as he raced to catch the Eurostar train back home. His focus for now, he said, was on policy and party renewal. Renaissance has been churning out papers, with proposals to curb immigration and tackle teenage screen addiction. The party wants a social media ban for under-15s, and an internet curfew between 10pm and 8am for those under 18. Videos would switch to black and white after half an hour’s viewing.“I’m working with my party, Renaissance. I want us to have a project and a candidate. Many candidates for the presidency today don’t have a project.”Gabriel Attal de Couriss followed a well-worn path through elite schools into the ranks of the political class. The son of Yves Attal, a lawyer and film producer, and Marie de Couriss, a film production worker from a family of traders who settled in Russia then Ukraine after the Bolshevik Revolution. He thrived despite the disruptions of divorce and his father’s early death from cancer. After attending the exclusive École alsacienne private school, he studied public affairs at Sciences Po, theParis universitywhose graduates include Macron and a long list of presidents and prime ministers before him.His social politics are a mix of liberal and authoritarian. He voted to make access to abortion a constitutional right, but has legislated to curb the wearing of clothes associated with Islam. As education minister he banned the abaya for girls and the qamis for boys in schools.Last month, Attal proposed to go a step further, byoutlawing headscarves in public for girls under 15. The reaction was swift and negative, with accusations he was just looking to grab headlines, and members of his own party distanced themselves. The Renaissance education minister expressed “the most serious doubts” about asking police to question or even caution children in the street.Attal rejects the notion that designating the clothing worn by children as the latest culture-war battleground puts them at risk.“I think that what puts a little girl in danger is to impose on her an outfit that consists in inculcating to her the idea that she is inferior to man and that it is impure for her to discover her face.”On immigration, he wants closer cooperation with the UK. He saysMacron’s state visit to Britain next month, during which the president will stay at Windsor Castle, will be an opportunity for bilateral talks.View image in fullscreenGabriel Attal laying a wreath at the statue of the French wartime leader Charles de Gaulle.Photograph: Supplied“I think there are several subjects which are absolutely major on which we must move forward,” he said. He listed defence – “the UK is part of the European continent and with France is one of the two countries that has a complete army” – the economy, energy and immigration.On the vexed question of access for UK arms firms to a new €150bn (£129bn) EU armaments fund, he was diplomatic.“When it comes to EU financial instruments, they come first to support the European defence industry, and it will depend on financial participation, but I know this is being negotiated right now. I hope we can find a way to deepen the military cooperation with the UK.”He said the next big step would be discussion on how the UK can align with a new pact for asylum and immigration that will enter into force across the EU next summer.The agreementallows faster processing and triage of migrants at designated entry hubs. Importantly, each member state will take an agreed share of new arrivals, or pay countries of reception €20,000 to keep them.“It is very important that we can identify the way in which this pact will be implemented in connection with the UK,” said Attal. “I remind you that there is an estimate of 30% of immigrants who come to the European continent who do so to go to the UK.”ForUkraine, Attal wants an accelerated path to membership of the EU. Hungary is threatening to use its veto, and farmers are worried about the continent’s largest food-producing nation flooding the tariff-free single market with cheap agricultural produce. The pushback has delayed the accession talks, which were due to begin this month.In March, Attal hosted asummit in Pariswith allies from the European parliament, and members of opposition parties in Hungary and Slovakia. They agreed to campaign for Ukrainian lawmakers to attend the parliament as observers, starting no later than 2026. Other measures included seizing the €200bn of Russian assets frozen in Europe to finance Ukrainian resistance and increasing defence budgets to 3% of domestic product.“We have a situation that is obviously unprecedented, with a country attacked, at war, which wants to join the EU. And therefore the procedure itself must be adapted.”Is he in favour of theparallel negotiationsolution, which would allow progress without needing Hungary’s approval, being suggested by some officials in Brussels? It seems so. “I think all channels must be used,” Attal said.He spoke with the confidence of a man adept at finding his way around obstacles. The interview came to an end as his car approached St Pancras station. A call to the French embassy, and Attal and his bodyguards were whisked through security, making the 11.30am back to Paris with minutes to spare.Explore more on these topicsGabriel AttalFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropeForeign policyUkraineMigrationinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But ‘intellectual humility’ is a trainable trait that deepens relationshipsHannah SeoMon 23 Jun 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 14.45 EDTShareYou may be familiar with the feeling. Someone factchecks you mid-conversation or discredits yourdishwasher-loading technique. Heat rises to your face; you might feel defensive, embarrassed or angry. Do you insist you’re right or can you accept the correction?Admitting to being wrong can be difficult and uncomfortable. But the ability to admit to incorrect ideas or beliefs – what psychologists call “intellectual humility” – is important. Research shows that people with higher intellectual humilitythink more critically, and areless biasedand less prone to dogmatism.People high in intellectual humility “are able to acknowledge the limits of their knowledge and beliefs”, says Tenelle Porter, an assistant professor of psychology at Rowan University. They recognize that we all get things wrong and are willing to admit their own gaps in knowledge. Meanwhile, people low in intellectual humility tend to overconfidently cling to their beliefs, and are not swayed by opposing evidence.How intellectual humility makes relationships betterPeople who are more intellectually humble tend to have better relationships. Being unable to acknowledge other people’s perspectives can damage the trust in a relationship, says therapist and author Nedra Glover Tawwab. Acknowledging that you’re wrong, on the other hand, can be a great opportunity to deepen a relationship.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Research suggests that couples who score higher in intellectual humility tend to havehealthier conflict management, as well as higher relationship quality and satisfaction. On average, peopleprefer to befriend or datepeople who are more humble, says Daryl Van Tongeren, who studies psychology and social values at Hope College. People also tend to bemore committed to and satisfied withrelationships when they perceive their partners to be more humble, Van Tongeren adds, and having both individuals in a couple rank highly in humility is associated with ahealthier, less stressful transitioninto parenthood.How to assess your intellectual humilityPeople with low intellectual humility will often react defensively when contradicted, says Leor Zmigrod, a political neuroscientist who recently wrotea bookabout rigid, ideological thinking. They might feel personally attacked or insulted, and arrogantly double down, she says.But recognizing such qualities in yourself can be easier said than done. When Van Tongeren published hisbook on humility, people would say things like: “Humility – that’s what my father-in-law needs.”People are terrible at knowing whether they’re very flexible or very rigid thinkersLeor Zmigrod, political neuroscientist“No one starts off by saying: ‘Oh, humility, that’s whatIneed,’” he says.Our personalities can be flexible if we put in the work, says Tawwab. So how does someone get better at admitting they’re wrong?Studiesshow that “people are terrible at knowing whether they’re very flexible or very rigid thinkers,” says Zmigrod. But a good way to start is to practice noticing how you respond to being contradicted. Be mindful of when your emotions and ego get in the way of a thoughtful response, she says – and over time you may be able to recognize your patterns.A person’s intellectual humility is alsolinked with how flexibletheir thinking is in general, Zmigrod says. So if you notice defensiveness or anger when, say, a regular routine is disrupted, that could be a sign that your intellectual humility could use some work.I’m disagreeable – and it’s backed by science. Can I change my personality?Read moreIf self-driven introspection is difficult, Van Tongeren recommends asking trusted people to assess how open they think you are to new perspectives, and whether they think you get defensive of your own ideas. “Ask people from a variety of areas of your life,” he says, because “you might be really humble at work, but not super humble at home, or vice versa.” You can glean information about your intellectual humility while also signaling to others that you’re trying to work on yourself. Before attempting this, consider whether you’re honestly ready to hear this kind of feedback.How to accept that you’re wrongLearning to be more gracious when contradicted is an important skill, because an inability to recognize when you’re wrong diminishes trust in relationships, says Tawwab.The first thing to do is “reframe what being wrong means”, says Tawwab. A lot of people internalize the idea that being wrong means they’re stupid, ignorant or worth less as a person, she says. But if we lived in a world where no one was wrong or allowed to be wrong, “we would live in a world that has never shifted”, she says. Seeing it as associated with personal growth, curiosity and other positive values will make being wrong feel less fraught.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People who can admit when they’re wrong tend to be better listeners, says Van Tongeren. But more than that, when one person in a conversation is a good, deep listener, “the act of listening actuallycultivates and generates humility” for both parties.If you find yourself resisting admitting being wrong, Porter recommends casting your memory back to a time when you realized you had erred.Researchsuggests that when you remember your own fallibility, “that can help recalibrate us and make us more open to listening to what we might be missing,” she says.How to help others develop intellectual humilityIf you want to encourage someone else in your life to work on their intellectual humility, they first need to feel like they’re in an environment where it’s safe to make mistakes, says Tawwab. And “people tend to digest information best when they’re seeking it out for themselves,” she says. So rather than lecture them on the importance of acknowledging their errors, it may be best to simply share articles, books or personality quizzes that can help them self-reflect and come to their own conclusions.You can also take the edge off by suggesting that you both work on this issue together, says Van Tongeren.How to admit you were wrongOnce you’re able to recognize when you’re wrong and admit it to yourself without an emotional or ego-driven reaction, being able to verbalize your mistakes will come much more easily.What is metabolic syndrome – and do we really need to worry about it?Read moreAnd when it comes to telling another person that you were wrong, Tawwab says you don’t have to do it immediately. After a conversation, it might take you some time to process and accept this assessment. In that case, you can go back to the person a few days later. “Even if you can’t do it in the present moment, you can still recover that conversation and build that trust,” she says.Over time, hopefully you’ll get better and faster at it, eventually being able to notice and address errors in the moment. And you’ll probably deepen your relationships as a result, she says.There are many headwinds when it comes to intellectual humility, says Porter, especially in contemporary life. Social media creates echo chambers, people constantly express ever more polarized views, and false informationproliferates online. All this pushes us away from being willing and able to change our minds or admit we’re wrong. But remember that we as peoplevalue these traits, she says, regardless of how challenging it is to maintain them.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyFriendshipRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hawley first played the much-lovedSheffieldmusic venue in 1984, four years after it opened in 1980. This week, it’s closing its doors – at least in its current incarnation. Miles Kane will give the final performance on Friday. “I feel honoured to be closing it,” says Kane. “It’s the end of an era and we have got to do it justice.”While these closing gigs indicate a venue going out on a triumphant high, there’s no ignoring the fact that the end of the Leadmill has been clouded by a hugely acrimonious, bitter, prolonged fight and accompanying legal battle – one that isn’t as clearcut as some headlines around the crisis facing Britain’s small venues.In March 2022, the Leadmill was served an eviction notice by its landlords Electric Group, a company owned by Dominic Madden, which also operates multiple venues across the UK such as Electric Brixton and NX Newcastle. Madden bought the building that houses the Leadmill in 2017 and later announced plans to continue operating it as a new, refurbished, music venue.View image in fullscreenHeroic 45-year run … The Leadmill, Sheffield.Photograph: Christian Hopewell/AlamyThe initial story, and reaction, was of the big bully London landlord coming to Sheffield to boot out a beloved institution and trade off its hard-earned success. Many people, such as Hawley, still passionately feel this is the case. He has described the process as simply “theft”.The Leadmill ran a campaign called “The battle for the soul of Sheffield”, stating: “If we don’t stop this hostile takeover, the very soul and character of our great city is at risk.” There have been many angry and inflammatory exchanges ever since. The Leadmill’s director, Phil Mills, even applied for permission to demolish part of the building before having to vacate. The Leadmill did not respond to multiple requests for comment and Madden said he would only speak off the record.The campaign prompted support from Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker – “they may own the bricks and mortar, but they don’t own the spirit of the Leadmill” – and local MP Louise Haigh, who described it as “devastating”. But the story has transpired to be much more knotty and complex – largely revealed in superb reporting by Victoria Munro of the Sheffield Tribune.When the Leadmill opened in the 1980s, the venue was a multi-arts co-op that was rooted in social and political issues and intended to help address sharply rising youth unemployment in the city. It later became a charity and by the 1990s, with Mills at the helm, was turned into a for-profit business. Some argue this professionalised the venue and made it the success and cultural touchstone it is today. Others feel that it killed the original spirit of the place and was akin to what Electric Group are doing today. One of the original founders, Chris Andrews, has publicly wished bankruptcy on Mills during the legal dispute.The Leadmill finally lost their appeal for eviction and are now due to vacate the premises. To hit home just how messy the narrative has become, Kane was unaware, in our interview, that it was even continuing as a music venue. Many locals are understandably mourning the loss of a name and sense of place that holds a lot of memories and formative experiences for them – even if perhaps not everyone is reliably informed about what exactly will come next.Which is somewhat understandable. Concrete plans and dates for the new venue are not yet public but the building is going to have a refurbishment estimated at a cost of around £2-3m that Madden initially said “will be a slightly more polished, probably modernised, version of the same thing”. Later, after tensions had flared and he had been accused of benefiting from the Leadmill’s reputation, he stressed that he was “going to do something very different”. The Leadmill, as a promoter, still has pre-existing bookings stretching to spring 2026, which have been moved to other Sheffield venues.But the idea that Sheffield’s independent music soul is being ripped out as a result of the Leadmill furore overshadows the city’s thriving DIY music culture – something that should be held up as an antidote to the small venues crisis. “It’s as strong as I’ve known it for a long time,” says Paul Tuffs, who runs Sidney & Matilda, an independent venue with three gig rooms varying from 80-250 capacity. “It’s not all doom and gloom.”View image in fullscreenCity centre DIY venue Delicious Clam.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe city has always struggled with mid-sized venues. “There’s a bit of a ceiling in Sheffield,” says Tuffs. “We miss that 500–900 space. If you go to Leeds, there’s probably half a dozen. Manchester is the same.” It’s frustrating – although there are more gigs popping up at the 500-cap Crookes Social Club – but in its place has blossomed a genuinely thriving and diverse collection of smaller venues and DIY spaces with strong identities.Gut Level is a queer-led event space and collective that leans towards dance music. Delicious Clam is the kind of place you’ll find Crack Cloud or Hotline TNT playing before they blow up. The Lughole is a mecca for punk and hardcore; Hatch is a haven for experimental goings on, while promoters Sonido Polifonico regularly use a 1500s Tudor building, Bishops’ House, for intimate shows. There’s also a £7m council-funded venue, Events Central, due to open next year. Then throw in Alder, Hagglers Corner, Dryad Works, Plot 22, Yellow Arch, the Greystones, Network, plus independent music festivals such No Bounds, Get Together, Float Along, and Sensoria, and what Sheffield has is a healthy, vibrant and staunchly independent network.A genuine community has sprung from this. “We’ve started a network of independent venues to get together and help each other,” says Gut Level’s Katie Matthews. “It’s about moving away from the idea that all grassroots venues are struggling. It’s not really a good message to put out there – it’s quite depressing.” Gut Level is a members’ club and has a total of about 5,000, with roughly 600 paying monthly – a remarkable feat for a venue that has only been in its current location and iteration for a year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

There is a real grassroots spirit. Maybe in a different city you’d have one space that has different nights – but we have these micro clubs that all have their own different flavours.”‘Yes, there was a riot, but it was great’: Cabaret Voltaire on violent gigs, nuclear noise – and returning to mark 50 yearsRead moreFor Nick Potter, often found manically pinballing around audiences in a wedding dress as the frontperson of experimental rock band Dearthworms, this has resulted in a key cultural attitude. “It’s almost like an anti-growth argument in a way,” he suggests. “It shows you can have something that’s really healthy and beneficial but it doesn’t have to be vastly successful and constantly growing and getting bigger. Plus, these places are cheaper.”To Potter’s point, if you head to Sheffield City Hall – recently taken over by ASM Global, the world’s largest venue management company – you’ll now pay £8.25 for a pint of mass-produced beer. At Delicious Clam it’s £4.50 for a pint from a local brewery.If there’s one person who understands the huge significance in embracing and celebrating the smaller end of music venues in Sheffield, it’s Tuffs, who has been putting on gigs in the city since his days working at the Grapes back in the early 2000s. The small Irish pub utilised its upstairs function room for gigs, including the first ever show by Arctic Monkeys. “It’s important to treasure these sacred places,” he says. “They’re the lifeblood of the city in many ways. Without places like this, the story of Sheffield would be a lot shorter. And a lot more boring.”And so as the Leadmill winds up its heroic 45-year run, there is no denying its vastly important role in the history of music in the city, or people’s sadness at the end of an era. But if you’re searching for the independent soul of Sheffield music in its wake: you really don’t have far to look at all.Explore more on these topicsMusicSheffieldIndieExperimental musicnewsShareReuse this content"

Like psychic vampires. Right? If you go through life, you’ll either meet a psychic vampire every day or every year. You should avoid beings like that, that’s a good rule for life. That’s what I don’t believe in, associating with them. I’m sure you’ve met some beings that draw the energy out of you if you give them 10 minutes. But after 10 minutes, you gotta run. I give everybody 10 minutes.Have you ever lived in a haunted house?Yeah, I believe so. Certain little things happened. I never saw a spirit. My friend Gary saw a spirit in the Hollywood Hills, North Hollywood, on Mama Cass’s old estate. You know the great Mamas and the Papas? A great band. This was Mama Cass’s house. Jimi Hendrix stayed there, as did John Lennon and Ringo Starr; Harry Nilsson owned it for a while. Donna and I bought that house in the 80s and lived there for many years, raised three beautiful daughters there. And sure enough, people would see a big, dark shape along the top stairway. I remember the housekeeper saying she heard the Stairmaster going when no one was there. Her name would be called, she felt touches on the shoulder. I remember vividly one night when Donna had some jewellery sitting there and the bracelets started to do this little whirlwind. Now, maybe that’s the energy between us, who knows? But it might have been Mama Cass.View image in fullscreen(L-R) Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis in Ghostbusters.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyWhat has been your most memorable interaction with a fan?I guess having Bill Clinton join the Blues Brothers to play saxophone? It was at the opening of the Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut. That was a pretty spectacular night. Bill was a fan of the Blues Brothers so he agreed to play sax with us. I think we did I Saw Her Standing There, the Beatles tune. That was a beautiful interaction with a true fan of the music – and a two-term Democratic president! He had the full secret service escort, of course. Remember that movie [Guarding Tess] with Nicolas Cage and Shirley MacLaine, where he’s the secret service agent assigned to her? Shirley is great. She’s a great believer, of course, in, shall we say, the unexplained, the inexplicable otherworldly matters, the presence of alien beings. And then, of course, Nicolas Cage. I will watch anything he’s in. He just warms my heart when he comes on screen. I loved him in that film. Such a great pairing.Curtis Stone: ‘My most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity?

What is the plan this year?Sadly this year I will be travelling, but I have had the honour of doing things like starting a parade, or the best one was when I was sworn in as federal immigration judge, and I welcomed half a dozen immigrant families to Canada as they were getting their citizenship. This was in 2001. It was so great to see the hope in these people coming to Canada and ostensibly living a better life. So it’s Judge Aykroyd now. I’d prefer that going forward.

I’m a blowhard and a gasbag. People who are smarter than me will say “just listen” – and I’m trying to learn that.You converted John Belushi to blues musicbefore you made The Blues Brothers. I once read that you put on a particular record in a bar that kicked off his love for blues. Do you remember what the record was?Well, John was from Chicago, so he had been to blues clubs that I had never even heard of – he’d been to the Checkerboard, Wise Fools, Kingston Mines, Legends. He knew blues – but he was just a heavy metal fan. He loved Grand Funk Railroad and Cream – and that’s great, because it’s all from blues!Anyway, we were playing this record, Straight Up, by this Canadian band called the Downchild Blues Band. Do a search, everybody, and get some party music for the summer! So we were listening and he said, “Who’s this?” I said, “Oh, this is a beautiful local blues band that loves the stuff,” and he said, “Oh this is good. This is good.” I said, “Well it’s the blues, John, you’re from Chicago!” But from that record we started to work on the act. We perfected it with Tom “Bones” Malone, our arranger and horn player, and Paul Shaffer. We put together a super band that’s unparalleled.

That’s an intimacy coach issue. Whenever I did have that kind of scene – and there were not many [laughs] – I was always conscious of making the other person comfortable. So that’s what she’s talking about, feeling comfortable and real in the scene, to actually be in the moment. And it wasn’t hard to pretend to like kissing Jamie.Do you have a nemesis?I would say ignorant, well-armed people. I could walk out the door tonight and who knows? What a world, huh.What book, album or film do you always return to, and why?Well – the Bible. I’m a lapsed Catholic, OK? But hopefully somewhere in there there’s some shred of Judeo-Christian value left. I’m trying to live on those fumes as much as I can. But the Bible has great stories, great quotes and wonderful wisdom from Christ, and in the end, it’s the only book left. So I do turn to it. To whom much is given, much will be required – that’s what Christ says and I certainly am trying to live that as I go on.View image in fullscreenThe poster for the Dan Aykroyd and John Candy film The Great Outdoors.Photograph: Universal Pictures/RGA/RGR Collection/AlamyAs for film, I always return to The Day The Earth Stood Still, that spectacular movie with Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal about the saucer landing in Washington DC in the 1950s. What a great film – and it could really happen, that there’s some more powerful interstellar beings with stronger weapons than us out there. If we don’t smarten up here with all this nuclear talk and nuclear play, they’re going to come down here and straighten us out. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could believe that?If you had to fight a famous person, who would it be, how would you fight them and who would win?I’d rather fight an animal than a human being. Let me go off on a tangent, maybe we can come to an answer. The ultimate answer to that, human or animal, is: I would flee in the other direction.How about a bear? I did a scene once with two bears, a black bear and a grizzly [in The Great Outdoors with John Candy]. We got on well! They were both much better actors than I was. Bart was the grizzly and the other one was called Uncle Joe. They decided there should only be one bear scene in the movie, so my scene with Uncle Joe was cut. We shot it at night – I had to sit next to the bear with my arm around it and its arm around me, and drink beer. He had his paw up and I was feeding him and we were both drunk. I kind of liked Uncle Joe.But I would flee from a real fight with a bear. Bart the grizzly was intimidating. One swipe of the paw, you know? That’s what I loved about my career as an actor – I can turn to you today and say, “I worked with that bear. That bear and I did a film together so many years ago … ” And Bart’s son and grandson are also in the business because they need grizzlies in Hollywood still.

Sometimes she would stand in the corner of the soundstage, says Allison Williams with a nervy laugh. “The dilemma is: do you turn her around so she’s facing the wall, or do you let her face the room? Both answers are wrong.”In the sequel to the sci-fi horror M3gan, Williams resumes her role as Gemma, a roboticist who has become a crusader against rampant and reckless AI development after her creation – developed for her orphaned niece – became murderous. (She is also a producer on the second film.)Acting opposite M3gan was unsettling, says Williams, speaking over a video call from a hotel room in New York. Sometimes she was played by the 15-year-old dancer Amie Donald, but often she was a robotic doll, animated by a small team. “When she’s been working for a while, her eyelids can get sticky,” says Williams. M3gan’s handlers would paint lubricant on to her eyeballs with a brush and Williams would have to catch herself: “She’s not flinching and for a second you’re like: ‘Ugh.’ Then you remember: this is not a live thing.”Still best known for her first role as Marnie inLena Dunham’s landmark TV series Girls, Williams has gravitated towards comedy-tinged horror in recent years. Her first post-Girls film role was in the Oscar-winning dark comedy horrorGet Out. It and M3gan were relatively low-budget projects that became cultural phenomena – Get Out for its commentary on racial politics, M3gan for what it says about the dangers of AI (as well as the uncanniness of M3gan herself).Watch the trailer for M3gan 2.0 – video.Williams has long been interested in AI – she knowsSam Altman, the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, which created ChatGPT, who put her in touch with robotics experts when she was researching the role of Gemma. The film raises questions not only about the danger of rogue AI, but about the ethical concerns –including how we should feel about the “rights” of devices. “It’s easy to imbue anything that has AI in it with humanity. Like our little robot vacuum we have at our house; I often feel it’s doing all this labour and being overlooked.”Does she worry that her job will be taken by AI in the not-too-distant future? She laughs. “If you ask me any question that starts with: ‘Are you worried?’ the answer is always yes, because I have an endless capacity to be worried about things.”But it’s possible, she says, that humans in acting, or any other job, are not special or unique and that “we will all be seamlessly replaced. But so far, especially in the arts, I haven’t yet had an experience that’s supposed to mimic a human output that has felt seamlessly human to me – and who knows if that’s going to be true for ever. For now, it’s towards the bottom of the list of things I worry about.” She smiles. “But it’s notnoton the list of things I worry about.”M3gan raises questions about the tech to which we expose our children. “You wouldn’t give your child cocaine,” says Gemma in M3gan 2.0. “Why would you give them a smartphone?” Williams’ son is three and she is wary of it. “He has so many questions and they’re incredible; I often don’t know the answers.” The other day, she says, she used ChatGPT to answer one about rocket launches. “Watching what happened to his face was like when Gemma sees her niece interacting with M3gan. Like, I have connected my kid to a drug, this is so immediately addictive and intoxicating.” She quickly put her phone away and made a mental note to go to the library next time to get out a book. “I can’t justify it, logically,” she says. “It just felt like an innate instinct.”View image in fullscreenCultural phenomenon … with Daniel Kaluuya in Get Out.Photograph: Justin Lubin/PAParenting is the central theme of the new podcast Williams launched this month with two friends, Hope Kremer, an early childhood educator, and Jaymie Oppenheim, a therapist. It came out of a group chat in which just about everything to do with motherhood, ageing and life in general was discussed. A future episode is about the guilt many mothers feel, which is also a theme in M3gan 2.0. Will our expectations of mothers ever change? “Oh God, I hope so,” says Williams. “The guilt, I think, is most potent in the absence of a community where you can voice the things that you feel guilt about. I think the guilt around what kind of parent we all are is something that only survives as long as we hold each other to insane standards and expectations.”She is, she says, “filled with rage about the majority of Instagram and TikTok ‘mom content’ – the aspirational version of it, anyway. I think it’s poisonous [and] it really only exists to make people feel bad about themselves, maybe under the guise of wanting to motivate people, but the impact is so painful.”She laughs as she describes the dishonesty of an influencer making a perfect packed lunch, filled with nutritious food – because it’s actually 4pm, perhaps, or because they have nannies – that makes other parents, primarily mothers, feel as if they are failing. “I would be in a puddle on the ground if we didn’t have the nanny that we have, who is the reason my husband is shooting in London right now and I’m here,” says Williams. “None of this is possible without her, and we’re so grateful. I’m just like, show your work. Show me a clock. Like, what day was this filmed?” She is laughing, but she is on a roll. “I cannot stand artifice about creating an expectation of what someone should be able to achieve that is totally unreasonable. Who is that helping?”View image in fullscreen‘We were easy targets’ …(from left)Lena Dunham, Zosia Mamet, Jemima Kirke and Williams in Girls.Photograph: PR Company HandoutOn another episode, she says, they discuss ageing and unrealistic beauty standards: “I talk about my love for Botox when I’m not filming, because, you know, you need to make facial expressions when you’re shooting.” She laughs. “But, right now, there’s not a ton I can do with my forehead. But the idea that someone would look at me and be, like: ‘I should be capable of that forehead.’ No, you shouldn’t! I’m not better than you because I have no wrinkles there, I just paid to put chemicals in my face. Let’s be real about this.”I always think it’s quite an achievement for famous people to hang on to pre-fame friends, once acclaim and money start getting in the way. Is it important to have “normal” friends? “I don’t walk the world and feel like a celebrity,” says Williams. “I think I did in my 20s, shooting and living in New York. But that isn’t how I feel dropping our son off at preschool; I feel like a person among people. My job is public, and that’s unique and weird, and our culture thinks it’s more important than other jobs, for sure. But, in our friend group, we celebrate what everyone’s up to and that has been such a stable, steady source of nourishment in my life.”Williams noticed recently that her son is about the same age she was when she realised acting could be a job and that she might one day do it (his father, Alexander Dreymon, is also an actor; Williams and Dreymon met on the 2020 thrillerHorizon Line). She watched bits of The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins and it dawned on her that the woman in both films was the same. “Julie Andrews was like a goddess to me,” she says.Her parents, the former NBC news anchor Brian Williams and the producer Jane Stoddard Williams, insisted she get an education, which she did (English at Yale), rather than become a child actor. “I’m grateful that my parents didn’t cave and that I didn’t make my way into this business any sooner than I did, because already, at 23, whenGirlscame out, that was a lot to process.”I’m not better than you because I have no wrinkles in my forehead, I just paid to put chemicals in my faceIn a way, Williams had the reverse experience – her parent was famous. At a time before media was so fragmented, being an NBC news anchor meant Brian Williams reached millions of people. His reputation took a battering in 2015, when it was revealed he had embellished – mistakenly, he said –a story about being shot down in a helicopterwhile covering the Iraq war. He was suspended for six months and left NBC shortly after.What was that like to go through as a family? “Anything that feels loud, like people are talking about you and all of that, is horrible,” says Williams. “I think it’s the underbelly of the media – it happens all the time, they eat their own. Everything just goes back to its fundamental priorities – family, friends, people who matter.”In the recent criticism ofnepo babies, Williams has always been admirably upfront and unguarded about her advantages. “Aside from all the many layers of privilege, high on the list is the fact that I could pursue a career in acting without being worried that I wasn’t going to be able to feed myself. I had been surrounded by people who did what I wanted to do.” It didn’t seem like an unreachable dream when Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, were family friends. When she was still at high school, she got a summer job as a production assistant on Robert Altman’sA Prairie Home Companionand got to be around its starry ensemble cast, which included Meryl Streep. “Having had that experience gives you a leg-up when finally it’s your turn and you have to know how to be on a set and how it all works.”Gratitude seems to be a defining theme in Williams’ life. She is happy she is not starting out now. There was huge hype around Girls during its six-year run, which ended in 2017, but she can’t imagine what that would be like with social media now. (Williams came off Instagram in 2020 – a time, she felt, when the platform was becoming more cynical and toxic.) It was, she says, as if there were “a gazillion think pieces about every episode that we did – and most thought we all took ourselves too seriously. We were all pretty privileged people who were the leads of this HBO show that was definitely skewering our own, but we weren’t given credit for that, or for being in on it.”View image in fullscreen‘When she’s been working for a while, her eyelids can get sticky’ … Gemma (Allison Williams) and Cady (Violet McGraw) with M3gan in the original film.Photograph: Geoffrey Short/Universal PicturesSome of the criticism was valid – it was set in New York, yet was overwhelmingly white – but much of it was misogynistic and more. “The shame is that, when it is coupled with misogyny and fatphobia and everything, the valid criticism gets lost.” Some of the coverage was so mean, she says with a laugh, especially on Gawker, which didn’t describe the lead characters by their names, but as the daughters of the famous parent each actor had. “We were easy targets, I get it.”For a while, Williams struggled with people assuming she was inseparable from her character, Marnie, a narcissist verging on sociopathy. “I really desired to put distance between us, because I thought that was the kind of acting everybody respected – like, I’m wearing a prosthetic nose and I gained 40lbs, or whatever. And here [our characters] were, who looked basically like we looked and sounded like we sounded, but crucially said and did things that we would never do. It always felt weird that, since we didn’t transform ourselves in some way, people weren’t buying us playing characters.”Mostly though, she says, it was an amazing experience. Will there be a reunion? “I would love it,” says Williams. “I know that Zosia [Mamet, who played Shoshanna] has been pushing for a spin-off, which I would voraciously consume and try to elbow my way into. I kind of want us all back together. It was so fun and it was the beginning of my career, so I didn’t have the perspective I have now on just how lucky we were, or to know how unusual a creative experience it was.”For those of us who loved Girls, I can think of nothing better – four hilarious, horrendous humans, no scary AI doll in sight.Allison Williams’ podcast,Landlines, is available now.

The feeble response from mainstream liberal parties is entirely dissonant with the gravity of the moment. As theUS joins Israel in attacking Iran, and the Middle East heads toward a calamitous unravelling, their inertness is more disorienting than ever. They are passengers in Israel’s war, either resigned to the consequences or fundamentally unwilling to even question its wisdom. As reality screams at politicians across the west, they shuffle papers and reheat old rhetoric, all while deferring to an Israel and a White House that have long taken leave of their senses.At a time of extreme geopolitical risk the centre presents itself as the wise party in the fracas, making appeals for cool heads and diplomacy, but is entirely incapable of addressing or challenging the root cause. Some are afraid to even name it. Israel has disappeared from the account, leaving only a regrettable crisis and a menacing Iran. The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, hascalled for de-escalation. But he referred to the very escalation he wishes to avoid – the US’s involvement – as an alleviation of the “grave threat” posed by Iran, all the whilebuilding upUK forces in the Middle East.The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen,underlines the importance of diplomacywhile making sure to assert that Iran is the “principal source” of instability in the region. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, had seemed to be inhabiting the real world,warning against the inevitable chaosthat would be triggered by regime change in Iran and in repeating the mistakes of the past. But by SundayFrance hadfallen into line, joining the chorus calling for de-escalation and restraint in vague general terms, and reiterating “firm opposition” to Iran’s nuclear programme.No matter what Trump says, the US has gone to war – and there will be profound and lasting consequences | Simon TisdallRead moreIf this seems maddeningly complacent to you, let me reassure you that you are not, in fact, missing something. The war with Iran is very bad news, and introduces a number of profoundly destabilising scenarios: regime change with no day-after plan, leaving a large cadre of armed military and security forces in play; the amassing in the region of western military forces that could become targets and flashpoints; or simply a prolonged war of attrition that would seize up the region and open a large festering wound of anger and militarisation. It’s also – and this is something Israel’s assaults have inured us to – killinghundreds of innocent people. To say nothing of the fact that it is, above all the extant risks, illegal.But most western leaders continue to treat it as just another chapter of unfortunate but ultimately fixed realities of the world to manage. And here is the sinkhole at the heart of the entire response to Israel over the past year and a half – a vacant centre. Trump is Trump. No one is expecting him to have a coherent, brave and stabilising response to Israel. But the problem predates him: a political establishment of ostensibly liberal, reliable custodians of stability that has no moral compass, and no care for the norms it constantly claims to uphold. Under its watch, international and human rights law has been violated again and again in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and now Iran. Its answer has been to get out of Israel’s way at best, and arm it and provide it with diplomatic cover at worst. Joe Biden’s administration set the tone, and European governments followed. Collectively, they have clung on to a status quo of unconditional support for Israel and, in doing so, shattered the legal and moral conventions that imbued them with any measure of integrity or authority.And yet they still carry on amid the wreckage. Their pronouncements about the importance of diplomacy sound like echoes from an era that has long passed – one before a livestreamed genocide demolished any semblance of a coherent system of international law. What the current moment has revealed is a cohort of regimes fundamentally unsuited to crisis, fit only for management; a crop of politicians whose very role is not to rethink or challenge the way things are, but simply to shepherd geopolitical traffic. Their mandate is indeed to stabilise, but only in the sense of locking in a world order offailing assumptions and hierarchies. It is not to make the world a better place, but to cast a veneer of credibility over why it is necessary that we live in this worse one.This is not to be confused with “pragmatism”. Pragmatism implies a lack of position or vested interest. What is obscured by the language of reluctant engagement is that it is underpinned by beliefs that are defined not by values, but by tribal supremacy. Iran is a country which, in the eyes of a liberal establishment, is never fully sovereign because it has diverged from western interests. It has no right of response when attacked (and in fact,must show restraintwhen it is). Its people have no right to expect a careful consideration of their future, or indeed the entire region’s. Israel, on the other hand, is a super sovereign, and never culpable.This default position is so naked in its hypocrisy, so ignorant and parochial in its worldview, so clear in its disregard for human life, that it represents a colossal erosion of sophistication in political discourse, and a new low in contempt for the public. Support for Israel can only be defended by facile, logic-defying references to its right to defend itself even when it is the aggressor, and Iran’s “threat to the free world”. Forgive me, but is that the same free world that backed unilateral attacks on four Middle East territories by Israel, a country whose leader iswanted by the international criminal court? At this point, the biggest threat to the free world is itself, which will sacrifice everything to ensure that not a single challenge to its power is allowed to pass.The end result is that such leaders are not only irresponsible, they are unrepresentative, unable and unwilling even to manufacture consent any more. An accelerating nihilism has taken hold. Mandates fray as centrist governments and political parties stray further and further from the public, which in Europe declares ahistorically low level of support for Israel. In the US (including Trump supporters), a majorityopposes involvement in war with Iran. And so the gap between a detached politics and bloody reality widens even further. The managers of western hegemony hurtle into the void, taking all of us with them.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionIranPalestinian territoriesTrump administrationDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricaEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

He’s the 33-year-old Muslim leftist and Queens assemblyman running for the New York mayoralty with the support of the Democratic Socialists of America, and the vitriolic campaign against himsuggests his momentumhas caused panic in gilded circles. His chief opponent for the Democratic nomination, Andrew Cuomo, could not scream party establishment more loudly: he’s New York state’s former governor – just like his father was – and a former cabinet secretary. He married into that classic Democratic royalty, the Kennedys; his endorsements include the former president Bill Clinton; and billionaires such asMike Bloomberg are pouring millionsinto his Super Pac.In another age, someone like Mamdani would have been a no-hoper. What changed was the 2016 presidential campaign of the long-marginalised socialist senatorBernie Sanders, which re-energised the US left. But Donald Trump’s recent victory on a more extreme platform led to predictions of a general rightwing lurch in US politics, with progressive positions scapegoated for the Democratic loss (even though Kamala Harris ran on a squarely corporate, “centrist” ticket). I was scheduled to interview Mamdani on the night of the US presidential election, but his campaign asked to postpone as results started to come in suggesting a Trump victory was likely. Presumably, they wanted to reassess strategy in the coming US political winter.But just a few months later, Mamdani is surging, and his campaign offers lessons for the western left in an age of chronic economic insecurity, rising far-right authoritarianism, war and genocide. The primary election vote is tomorrow, buta poll released during crucial early votingshows Mamdani overtaking Cuomoin “ranked choice” voting: it’s within the margin of error, but five months ago the insurgent candidate was polling only 1% support.In only a month, Mamdani hasleapt from 22% to 32%, particularly powered by a 2:1 lead among the under-50s.Why establishment Democrats still can’t stomach progressive candidates like Zohran Mamdani | Arwa MahdawiRead moreYes, the millennial has been helped by Cuomo’s chronic liabilities – theformer governor resignedin disgrace afteran investigation by the state attorney general found that he had sexually harrassed several women – but rival candidates with bigger profiles and more political experience could have gained from that instead. The New York Timespleaded with readersnot to rank Mamdani in the preferential voting system,rich New Yorkers are threateningto flee the city if he wins, he’s been attacked for inexperience, and smeared over his championing of Palestinian rights. “Zohran Mamdani is a public menace,” screeches rightwing magazine the National Review.So what’s the universal lessons for the western left? Three Ms are key: messaging, medium and movement. Grace Mausser is the co-chair ofNew YorkCity Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). When I suggested that Mamdani’s campaign would surely originally have been driven by revitalising the left, rather than the prospect of an actual election victory, she disagrees.“When we started, we knew the path to victory was narrow,” she conceded. But, she emphasised: “We don’t run races for purely moral reasons or to make a point like the Green party in the US which has failed in their project.” Indeed, the DSA played a pivotal role in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’sshock defeat of another Democratic luminary, the former chair of the House Democratic Caucus Joe Crowley back in 2018. In turn, Ocasio-Cortez has bolstered Mamdani with her endorsement, underlining how progressive victories feed off one another.“Super-clear messaging” is how Mausser sums up the Mamdani strategy. The early campaign settled on three main messages: “Fast and free buses, freeze the rents, free childcare. That’s so easy to remember. People know it, and it’s said over and over and over again.” Mamdani has other pledges, too – such as launching publicly run grocery stores – but key to his success are core, endlessly repeated commitments focused on a cost of living crisis triggered by a broken economic system.This strategy is essential in combating a “culture war” designed to force leftists into a defensive posture. It doesn’t mean abandoning marginalised minorities – Mamdani has unequivocally committed to transgender rights, for example. It just means emphasising unifying economic messages. Anger is redirected from the disenfranchised to thriving economic elites, whom Mamdani seeks to tax to fulfil his pledges. The campaign has settled, too, on not backing down to bad faith attacks: Mamdani has not given an inch in his pro-Palestinian advocacy.View image in fullscreenPeople attend a Zohran Mamdani rally in Manhattan, 14 June 2025.Photograph: Laura Brett/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockThen there’s the medium. What Mausser calls “high-quality video production” has been pivotal. Across the west, the far right has proven adept at using platforms such as TikTok to radicalise supporters, with the left mostly not even playing catch-up. Mamdani’s campaign made slick videos that are witty, sassy and snappy, communicating its messages to wide audiences. “All the conversations after the election [were] about needing a ‘Joe Rogan of the left’, how people aren’t getting their news from traditional media, how they’re getting their news from TikTok, Instagram and YouTube,” says Democratic strategist Waleed Shahid. “And that is exactly the story of Zohran.”When Sanders endorsed Mamdani, he declared how he was “very impressed by the grassroots movement that he has put together”. Mamdani’s campaign has an army of door-knockers, often visiting districts traditionally ignored by Democratic machine politicians. For many of these canvassers, this is their first political experience. Mausser reports: “If you ask them, ‘How did you hear about Zohran?’, it’s like: ‘Oh, I saw his video on Instagram or TikTok.’” The message and the medium raised an army. There’s another factor, too: Mamdani, like Ocasio-Cortez, is charismatic and telegenic. It’s not fashionable to discuss this on a left which prioritises the collective over the individual, but we need compelling communicators who look the part.Mamdani may not win the Democratic nomination. Even if he does, Cuomo will stand as an independent candidate, although the socialist challenger may do this, too. His campaign’s weaknesses reflect those of the wider US left: too little inroads among Black and older voters, as well as those with little online political engagement. But Mamdani’s against-the-odds success underlines why the far-right surge doesn’t have to weaken the left – far from it. Indeed, Mamdani positions himself as best-placed to resist Trump, rather than kowtow to his agenda. When the Republicans won, one of Mamdani’s first viral videos was visiting local districts where Trump enjoyed his biggest swings.Whatever happens, Mamdani shows that the US left lives on after what Shahid calls “a shitty year”: along with Trump’s triumph, there have been dispiriting primary defeats of progressive representativesJamaal BowmanandCori Bushat the hands of notorious pro-Israel lobbyists Aipac. Mamdani has built a movement in New York, but his campaign has also given a shellshocked western left a gift: a strategy to take on the establishment even in adverse circumstances.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why now? The answer is political opportunityMon 23 Jun 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 14.52 EDTShareThe United States hasbombed Iran.Donald Trumpannounced on Sunday that B-2 bombers attacked three nuclear sites including the Fordow nuclear site, sometimes referring to as the crown jewel of Iran’s nuclear program.As the world waits for Iran’s response, it is worth revisiting events since 12 June, when Israel, with US support, attacked the Islamic Republic. The official reason is nuclear weapons. The real reason I contend is the elimination of the Iran-led Axis of Resistance and establishing Israeli regional hegemony over the Middle East with tacit support from Arab autocrats.According to American and Israeli leaders, Iran was about to construct a nuclear weapon. Israel was forced to engage in a pre-emptive attack by way of response. “Israel’s very survival” was at stake according to Benjamin Netanyahu, while Trump claimed Iran was “very close to having a weapon”. Tulsi Gabbard, the US director of national intelligence, has now fallen in line. Weeks after testifying before Congress that Iran was not pursuing a bomb, thus undermining Trump’s stated position and embarrassing him politically, she nowclaimsIran could get a bomb “within weeks”.No serious analyst of Iran’s nuclear program believes this to be true. As the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency hasaffirmed, there was no indication of a “systematic program in Iran to produce a nuclear weapon”. CNNreportedlast week that according to US intelligence assessments, “not only was Iran not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, it was also up to three years away from being able to produce and deliver one to a target of its choosing” When Secretary of State Marco Rubio wasaskedthe day after the US attack if he had seen evidence that Iran was about to weaponize its nuclear program, he responded that the question was “irrelevant.” When pressed further he said “forget about intelligence.”If Iran’s nuclear program was not an imminent threat, what motived the US-Israeli attack? Why now? The answer is political opportunity.First, the Islamic Republic of Iran has never been weaker. Decades of economic sanctions and government corruption have impoverished the average citizen while enriching the ruling elite. Official poverty figures reveal that roughly one-third of Iranians live in poverty, and the real figure is believed to be much higher. Early this year, for example, the state run Mardomsalari newspaper had front-page headline: “The 400% Drop in Wages Over a Decade”. Iran’s economy is broken, and its citizens are struggling to survive.Internally, the Islamic Republic suffers from a crisis of internal legitimacy. This was on full display after the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022 that saw the birth of the “Women, Life, Freedom Movement” that rocked Iran and shone a global spotlight on its sordid human rights record. Over 60% of Iran’s population is under the age of 30. They have no memory of life before the 1979 Revolution. Their moral reference point is religious authoritarianism and clerical rule which they overwhelmingly reject. If there was a referendum in Iran today, no serious Iran expert doubts that the Islamic Republic would lose the vote by a wide margin. While the recent bombing of Iran has produced a rally-around-the-flag effect it is too soon to make any conclusive determination on how widespread this phenomenon might become.Regionally, Iran has never been weaker. The loss of its main regional ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah was a huge blow to Iran’s regional influence and its national defense doctrine. A core reason why Iran has supported and armed Hezbollah was for a moment like this. In the event of a direct Israeli or American attack on Iranian soil, it was assumed that Hezbollah would open a second front against Israel. This is no longer an option after Israeli’s sophisticated attack on Hezbollah last summer effectively neutralized this organization. The toppling of the Assad regime in Syria and the weakening of Iran-backed militias in Iraq contribute to this overall picture of Iranian geostrategic weakness. This has produced a golden opportunity for Israel to press ahead in the hope of delivering a blow to its chief regional rival.Israel seeks to be the regional hegemon and for a long time Iran stood in its way. The real threat Iran has historically posed to Israel, rhetoric aside, has never been existential but rather strategic and ideological. As we are seeing today, there is a vast power imbalance between the two countries measured in terms of military hardware, intelligence capabilities and international support. They all strongly favor Israel. Iran cannot protect its top military leaders and nuclear scientists. It cannot even protect its own airspace.The real Iranian threat to Israel is rooted in Iran’s ideological opposition to Israeli and American policy in the region. Its “Axis of Resistance” has sought to actively challenge, both in words and in deeds, western influence in the region. Iran and its allies have also sought to rally popular opinion in the Arab-Islamic world around this anti-imperialist theme. This is the real Iranian threat that the United and Israel seek to eliminate.During the cold war in Latin America, a similar situation existed. The enemy back then was Fidel Castro and Cuba. Regional instability was frequently blamed on communist insurrection orchestrated by Cuba and after 1979 by Nicaragua. Like Iran today, Cuba’s regional destabilizing role was grossly exaggerated in American foreign policy circles, and it was demonized in similar ways and for identical reasons. The Cuban threat, like the Iranian one today, was that these countries had foreign policies that were outside US influence and control. This is the primary reason why they were attacked and portrayed as enemy states.Iran’s threat is not nuclear weapons. Recall, Iran’s ability to weaponize its nuclear program was effectively curtailed in 2015 when it negotiated a deal with the Obama administration. At the urging of Netanyahu, Trump tore up that agreement three years later which set the stage for today’s crisis. The real Iranian threat is that it has an independent foreign policy. This does not mean Tehran has a good foreign policy on normative or ethical grounds; far from it. It simply means Iran operates independently as an actor in the Middle East challenging American and Israeli hegemony. This is the real Iranian threat that the US and Israel seek to eliminate.Nader Hashemi is associate professor of Middle East and Islamic politics and director of the Alwaleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at the Edmund A Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown UniversityExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionDonald TrumpUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

They – or, I should say, we – were raised on a diet of The West Wing and closely follow the twists and turns inside the Beltway coming from American media. This obsession has an effect on the real world: what happens in the US shapes British politics. Long ago this was seen in the parallels between Bill Clinton and Tony Blair’s “third way”; and this time last year Keir Starmer’s Labour party was looking to Joe Biden’s Democrats.Biden went all-in on reforming the US economy. Through theChips and Science,Infrastructure Investment and JobsandInflation Reductionacts, he spent billions hoping to build more at home, boost growth and grow wages. It worked. Public investment led tomore than $1tn(£750bn) of private sector spending, and real wagesgrew by $4,000a person, with more for the worst off. Even with the pandemic, economic growth averaged 3% a year under Biden.This is an economy the Labour government would die for and is one of the reasons it embraced its own version of Biden’s plans. Theindustrial strategyreleased today is the most concrete expression of Labour’s “securonomics” that it has given in government, after Rachel Reeves unveiled the strategy in Washington in opposition.But for all Biden’s economic success, the Democrats did not win the election in 2024. Immediately commentators turned on the former president’s economic platform, arguing that long-term reform was a waste of time. Only one thing mattered when it came to votes:the price of eggs.Labour hasn’t jettisoned its industrial strategy based on Biden’s loss, despite many urging it to. But for the strategy to be successful and to last the 10 years that Labour intends it to (not thethree yearsthat the Inflation Reduction Act did) the government will need to learn from Biden’s mistakes.To understand how, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), where I work, spoke to more than 40 people in Washington, including many former senior White House officials. Here are two key lessons.First, long-term reform is crucial but will always be slow. Expecting it to win votes now is a recipe for disaster. One former official put it this way: “Industrial policy achieved its goals … but nobody cares, we delivered on stuff they didn’t care about.” The problem was that even in the White House there wasn’t agreement on the purpose of industrial policy. While those running the policy were trying to make long-lasting clean energy investments, it was sold to the Democratic party as the way to beat Trump.The interim effect was the same – money went to predominantly Republican districts (more because of their cheaper labour than a deliberate strategy). But building a factory, hiring people and eventually building things is a decade-long project. As one official said: “[Industrial policy] wasn’t going to transform the map in two years after 50 years of deindustrialisation.”While Labour is explicit that this is a 10-year growth strategy, it can speed things up – planning reform will help. It must also address Britain’s workforce shortages now, not just think about skill development in the future. Rebuilding capability inside government is also vital. The US government was engaging for the first time in facilitating the production of new, rapidly developing technologies such as clean hydrogen. Creating policies such as thehydrogen tax credittakes time and expertise. Officials in the British government are going to need to get to grips with the intricacies of37 new high-potential subsectors.The second lesson: to give long-term policies the space to succeed, governments need a short-term economic improvement to people’s lives. This is crucial: battery manufacturing projects are now being cancelled across the US because Democrats didn’t win a second term to protect them.Biden’s team had wanted a broader economic story that spoke to inflation. But things that would actually help – cheaper childcare or tax provisions for working-class Americans – were cut out of legislation by the Senate. This was at a time when Covid-era support was expiring. Defending the imperfect Inflation Reduction Act and championing investments rang hollow with the public, who wanted to hear about prices coming down.Labour has space to address this. The IPPR has conducted polling that tells us energy prices easily top every other economic issue as the public’s economic priority. Of those surveyed, 47% said they would prefer the government to focus on lower costs even if this meant stagnant wages (something the British public is well used to), as opposed to 12% who would take a wage rise even if costs went up too.A final point is that the world is much bigger than the US and there are lessons to be learned elsewhere.In Spain, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has overseeninvestment of €163bn(£140bn) in the green transition – but rather than relying solely on this, his government has also acted on the rising cost of housing bycapping rent increases. Anthony Albanese last month won a second term in Australia for the Labor party for similar reasons. HisAUS$22.7bn (£10.8bn) investmentin a future made in Australia – predominantly in clean energy – came withenergy bill relief, rent assistance and cheaper medicines.So rather than sitting down for another rewatch of The West Wing, perhaps it would be a better strategy to examine how similar-sized countries elsewhere have given themselves the chance to make long-term industrial strategies work.Sam Alvis is associate director at IPPR and a former political adviser to the Labour partyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the big difference between Greg Clark’s 2017 industrial strategy andJonathan Reynolds’s “modern” version on Mondaywas supposed to be the latter’s emphasis on reducing the sky-high cost of electricity for UK industry. Does it deliver?Well, it acknowledges the problem, which is a start. But then it’s impossible to avoid the UK’s woeful position on electricity prices. The statistics are aired alongside every deindustrialisation story from thePort Talbot steelworksto theGrangemouth oil refinery. The lobby group Make UK estimates costs for UK steelmakers of £66 per megawatt hour in 2024-25 compared with estimated German prices of £50 and French ones of £43.So a plan to “slash industrial electricity prices” for 7,000 companies and “move us from being an outlier to right in the middle of the pack”, as Reynolds put it, is definitely a step towards sanity. The detail, however, matters. For at least three reasons, this looks more like a sketch of a plan rather than a fully worked-up scheme.First, the new “British industrial competitiveness scheme” won’t arrive until 2027, which leaves an uncomfortably long period for more crises to occur. Shouldn’t the government have made up its mind by now? The forerunnerInvest 2035consultative document was issued last October, but the outcome on Monday was a further consultation on eligibility criteria for the headline measure. At least the separate and established “British industry supercharger” scheme, aimed at industries such as steel, chemicals and glass, will deliver bigger discounts next year – but that scheme covers only about 500 companies.Second, the tally of 7,000 firms in the new scheme is not enormous in the context of a broadly defined UK manufacturing sector of 140,000 companies. The hospitality industry and others grumble about how painful electricity bills also bite on them, but most within manufacturing sector will also be outside the fold. Food and drink manufacturers, which are still a substantial part of the economy, are not a priority, for example.Third, the savings for eligible companies will be “up to” 25%, raising the obvious question of how many will get the full whack. Net zero levies, such as renewables obligations for wind and feed-in tariffs for solar, will be removed from their bills, but those costs still have to be funded, and the government has simultaneously promised that other bill payers will not pay more. So the money will come from “bearing down on levies and other costs in the energy system” plus the proceeds from “the strengthening of UK carbon pricing”.How much does that yield in practice? Most energy experts agree UK carbon prices should float upwards, yielding a gain for the Treasury as the the country aligns with the EU carbon market. But precision is impossible. As for reforms in the energy system, that’s a reference to persuading windfarm developers to accept a lower headline price-guarantee for, say, a 20-year contract than they would for a standard 15-year one. The economic principle makes sense, but the length of the contract is not the only current consideration. Rising cost pressures on offshore windfarms, as evidenced by Ørsted’s decisionto shelve a huge scheme of the coast of Yorkshire, cannot be wished away.None of which is to deny the basic logic of trying to remove renewable levies for key non-domestic users. We need those companies to survive the costs of energy transition and contribute to the running of the system in the future. Nor is it to deny that other aspects of the wide-ranging industrial strategy generally got a cheer from business, especially on skills and startup funding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This latest gambit appears less a strategic gamechanger than a desperate bid to regime-change Iran and prop up a rickety regional status quo built around unchecked Israeli dominance.The timing of Israel’sinitial surprise attackon 13 June was no coincidence. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu – who has long sought to sabotage any prospect of US-Iran detente – appears to havesteamrolled Donald Trumpinto the escalation he has always wanted. The result looks like a trap: Trump, once again, manoeuvred into a destabilising Middle East conflict that serves Netanyahu’s agenda far more than the US’s.Although the joint strikes have caused significant damage, they have also provoked a swift response. Iran’s missile barrages are piercing Israel’s vaunted defences, sending millions into bomb shelters day and night, and exposing strategic vulnerabilities previously thought secure. Crucially, Tehran appears to have anticipated the US attack on the Fordow uranium enrichment plant over the weekend –reportedly removing sensitive equipmentand sealing the site’s entrances ahead of time. Even senior US officialsnow concedethat Fordow was not destroyed. Instead,they’re signallinga return to negotiations as the only viable path for addressing Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile – an implicit admission that there is no military solution to this problem.The episode underscores a deeper reality: Iran’s nuclear infrastructure is designed to withstand precisely this kind of attack. Its dispersal, depth and scope mean that meaningful and verifiable destruction would require a full-scale ground invasion – repeating the catastrophic miscalculations of Iraq. Far from eliminating the threat, military escalation risks pushingIrancloser to weaponisation, while foreclosing the only durable solution: diplomacy.No matter what Trump says, the US has gone to war – and there will be profound and lasting consequences | Simon TisdallRead moreWorse still for the US andIsrael, the strike has failed to ignite mass revolt and regime change. Despite years of repression, many Iranians – secular and religious alike – now view their sovereignty, national identity and territorial integrity as under direct assault. A rally-around-the-flag effect is taking hold – not in support of the Islamic republic per se, but in defence of Iran as a nation confronting foreign aggression. The government, for its part, appears unified across political factions, emboldened by the belief that it has weathered the worst and can emerge more resilient.Netanyahu’s bid to prop upReza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former shah, has only underscored the incoherence of the regime-change project – Pahlavi is seen as an out-of-touch relic of a bygone era.Bombing Iranian media outletsandcivil infrastructurein a clumsy attempt to incite rebellion has only further discredited the effort.The US, too, now finds itself at a crossroads. Trump’s national security team is split. Some advisers, such as the vice-president, JD Vance, have signalledopenness to renewed talks, even suggesting negotiations over Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile. This is an implicit admission of failure – that coercion has reached its limit, and that diplomacy is the only viable path forward.But diplomacy cannot succeed under the shadow of airstrikes and assassinations. Nor can it be sustained if the US continues to outsource its Iran policy to a militaristic Israeli government intent on perpetual confrontation – one whose core aim is to keep the US locked in endless conflict in the Middle East on its behalf.Too often, US understanding of Iran’s nuclear behaviour remains filtered through the lens of alarmism, ignoring the strategic logic behind Tehran’s decisions. Iran’s nuclear programme is best understood not as an ideological crusade for the bomb, but as a calibrated instrument of deterrence and leverage. Iran has deliberately positioned itself as a threshold nuclear state – developing the infrastructure, enrichment capabilities and scientific knowledge needed to produce a weapon, but stopping short of actually doing so. This ambiguity was viewed as serving multiple purposes: strengthening Iran’s hand in negotiations; raising the costs of any attack; and maintaining strategic flexibility without crossing the line into open proliferation.Indeed, Iranian officials have positioned their nuclear programme as a bargaining chip, not necessarily as an end towards nuclear weapons. At key moments, including during the negotiations at the 2015joint comprehensive plan of action(JCPOA), they have demonstrated a willingness to place verifiable limits on their nuclear programme in exchange for credible security guarantees and economic relief.The time has come for a sober reassessment of US policy in the Middle East – one grounded not in maximalist illusions, but in strategic balance. Iran is not a problem that can be bombed into submission. Decades of pressure have failed to produce compliance or collapse. Instead, they’ve entrenched resistance and accelerated Iran’s nuclear capabilities. Any strategy that assumes coercion alone will yield stability is not just flawed, it’s self-defeating.Just as critically, Washington must reckon with the growing strategic costs of deferring to an increasingly uncompromising Israeli government. Rather than serving as a stabilising partner, Israel’s posture under its current leadership has become a liability – fuelling cycles of escalation, derailing diplomacy and entangling the US in conflicts that distract from pressing global priorities. A durable US strategy must prioritise regional equilibrium over unconditionally underwriting any one side, and reclaim decision-making in service of long-term US interests.This moment demands a shift – not in tactics but in strategic vision. The Middle East cannot be remade through bombs and genocidal wars. If the US truly seeks stability, it must abandon the illusion of managing the region through Israeli supremacy, propping up pliant dictators and trying to regime-change rivals. That project has failed and the current war shows no sign of changing this. What comes next depends on whether Washington is finally ready to choose realism over fantasy.Sina Toossi is a senior non-resident fellow at the Center for International Policy, where his work focuses on US-Iran relations, US policy toward the Middle East and nuclear issuesDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It elevates a group known forthrowing red paintat buildings and military aircraft into the same legal category as al-Qaida and Islamic State. If there’s a serious threat from these activists, we’ve yet to see it – just a ministerial statement discussing civil disobedience in the language of counterinsurgency.If this is all that Palestine Action can be accused of, then the government is wrong. Ministers are setting a dangerous precedent by using terror laws to outlaw protest – and penalising protesters not for violence but for making a nuisance and vandalism. The cost will be felt in press freedom, political accountability and the right to resist. The home secretary’s statement says that Palestine Action’s activities “meet the threshold” for terrorism under the law, yet fails to specify how the group’s actions – which consist primarily of damage to property, not threats to life – satisfy the statutoryrequirementof intending to influence the government or intimidate the public through serious violence or threats.If this passes, the threshold of terrorism will have been lowered from plotting to plant bombs or take hostages to daubing aircraft or chaining oneself to doors – activities once associated with anti-nuclear and anti-apartheid activists. Palestine Action has, since2020, mounted a campaign of direct action targeting firms supplying weapons to Israel, most notably Elbit Systems. Their tactics include criminal damage, trespass and disruption. To go from these offences to terrorism is morally fraught. But that has not deterred Labour ministers.Contained in terror laws is a logic that George Orwell would haverecognised: where danger lies not just in bombs or bullets, but in words, connections and ideas. Proscription criminalises not just action but association. It becomes an offence to support, affiliate with or even express “moral support” for the group. If Palestine Action are deemed terrorists, then writers and journalists offering even mild approval could be prosecuted and imprisoned for up to 14 years.This is not the policing of public safety; it is the policing of dissent – and limiting belief and speech. If a government can define non-violent acts it disapproves of as terrorism, the boundary between civil disobedience and extremism becomes whatever a minister says it is. The law already has the tools to deal with Palestine Action – as the Home Officeadmits, some cases involving the group are still before the courts. So why jump to proscription? What does a terror label achieve that prosecution doesn’t – beyond muzzling the group and chilling wider activism on Palestine and the arms trade?This is a government that seems all too eager to project control over protest at a time when its foreign policy is deeply unpopular. It may seem cynical to suggest that redefining visible dissent as a national security threat is a way to contain public anger, but the effect is the same. When it comes to Gaza, ministersstruggleto locate in law the actions of the UK or Israel. Yet they have no such difficulty when it comes to those protesting against them.The Labour peerShami Chakrabartiwas right to ask: when did criminal damage become terrorism? If civil liberties mean anything, they must survive protest that offends. Democracy can’t just tolerate disagreement, it must stomach defiance. Even when it’s splashed on an arms factory wall.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But links between poor care and overstretched staff must not be avoidedMon 23 Jun 2025 13.53 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 21.31 EDTShareThe announcement of a new inquiry into maternity care failures in England, including theshockingly higher risk of mortalityfaced by black and Asian mothers, indicates an overdue recognition that improvements are needed. From the devastating 2015 review of a decade of failure at Morecambe Bay, tolast year’s birth trauma reportfrom MPs, there is no shortage of evidence that women face unacceptable risks when giving birth on the NHS. The question is whether a review chaired by Wes Streeting himself can achieve what previous ones have not.Hisrole as chairis not the only novel aspect of this inquiry. A panel including bereaved parents will share their experiences and knowledge, alongside expert evidence. This format should focus minds on the human consequences of systemic failures, including mother and baby deaths, and on the need for accountability when things go wrong.But while the ultimate goal is a “national set of actions”, there is no getting away from local variations. Part of the impetus behind this review comes from campaigners in Sussex and other areas where maternity services are currently causing serious concerns. Ten of these will now be scrutinised in the inquiry’s first stage.Past inquiries have generally pointed to a combination of resource and cultural factors, including poor leadership, in seeking to explain why and how things have gone wrong. Such findings have not been limited to the hospitals themselves, and have included regulators.But the reality is always complex and not reducible to soundbites. For example, poor relationships and communication between nurses and doctors are known to cause problems in maternity settings. Wheresuch conflictshave been uncovered, they have generally had an ideological aspect, relating to differing attitudes to vaginal versus caesarean deliveries. But they can also be connected to wider questions about the level of skill and investment in the workforce.In his seminal review of care failures in Mid Staffordshire, Sir Robert Francis asked the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to examine the evidence about staffing ratios and patient safety, and to make recommendations. But in 2015, as Prof Anne Marie Rafferty and Prof Alison Leary noted in an article on that report’s legacy,this work was suspended. They believe this decision was motivated by the Conservative government’s anxiety about potential cost implications.Mr Streeting says he is horrified by what he has heard about maternity care failures, particularly the lack of compassion shown to families after life-changing losses. Hence his decision to make this issue a “litmus test” for the government. But raising standards in the context of tight funding settlements, high levels of unmet need and ongoing staffing difficulties will be an enormous challenge.Judge-led public inquiries should not be the only means for people who have been failed by the state to seek redress. Mr Streeting’s maternity review looks like a worthwhile attempt at developing an alternative – and hedeserves praise for explaining this. With a pledge to present findings at the end of the year, he hopes to avoid one of the flaws with inquiries – that they take too long. The problem of how to deliver the accountability that affected people want is more intractable. Hardest of all, judging from past experience, is turning the findings of such inquiries into viable plans for real service improvements.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We’ve become so used to seeing Ben Stokes conjure up something extraordinary when a Test match is on the line, whether it’s a blizzard of sixes, a tumble of wickets, a spectacularly acrobatic catch, an intuitive decision to put an unorthodox fielder in just the right position, it was a surprise to watch him scrabbling around trying to make a breakthroughas India batted on, and on, and on, through Monday afternoon.England looked well in this game when Rishabh Pant walked to the crease, and looked well out of it when he left again, four hours and 118 runs later, on the far side of a 195-run partnership with KL Rahul.KL Rahul, the anti-Pant, torments England with precision of a maths nerd | Simon BurntonRead moreStokes tried. He set an odd field after lunch, when Pant was on 31, and India were crawling along at three runs an over. It didn’t have a slip, which, as Stokes goes, felt so very defensive that everyone assumed it must be a cunning ruse. They were disabused when Pant immediately edged the ball and Stokes moved Joe Root back there after all, too late to do anything about it. Soon after, Stokes launched himself into a headlong dive to try to catch a drive Pant walloped through extra cover, but it was travelling so fast that the ball ricocheted off his fingertips.With everything else failing him, Stokes turned to the one tactic he’s always been able to count on and brought himself on to bowl from the Kirkstall Lane end. Rahul spanked his first ball to the boundary.Stokes is one of the game’s great illusionists. His belief in this team makes them better than they really are. Shoaib Bashir can barely get a wicket in county cricket, but he’s taken 54 in 13 games for England under Stokes’s captaincy. Trouble is that on days like these, when Stokes is struggling to impose himself on the game, Bashir looks more like the guy who can’t even get into Somerset’s first team. By the time Pant was done with him you half-wondered if he’d actually turn out to be a tower of three little kids standing on each other’s shoulders disguised in a set of whites.Pant toyed with his bowling, and just when you were pondering if he was restraining himself to leisurely singles so that England would keep Bashir in the attack, he decided to emasculate him by smacking him back over his head for a couple of sixes. Bashir got him in the end, caught at long-on. He’s taken three wickets this week, all of them caught in the deep.

He sees the best in all his players, which must make him a wonderful man to play for. In his eyes, Chris Woakes is a wizard who can work wonders with the new ball, as opposed to a grey-bearded medium-pacer whose body is held in shape by kinesiology tape. Woakes took his first wicket in his 40th over of the match, when he lured Karun Nair into slapping a drive right back at him for a return catch. You’d like to think the lack of pace on it was deliberate.You may look at Zak Crawley and see a man with a habit of playing bad shots and one first-class hundred in the last 12 months, but in Stokes’s eyes he’s one of the world’s great opening stroke-makers. You may say that Ollie Pope has got the temperament of a startled deer at No 3, but in Stokes’s eyes he’s a rock of the middle order. And you may think that Jamie Smith is the kind of slap-happy batter who gets out trying to hit another six over the head of long leg, but Stokes knows he’s doing exactly what they want him to do.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Seventy-three runs needed to beat Australia and only Jack Leach left to bat with? Game on. Every one of his most famous wins seems to be a test of faith.And somehow, at the end of the fourth day’s play in which India’s batters have scored their fourth and fifth centuries of the match, England are still in this one, too. Because while everyone else in this game may say that scoring 350 on a fifth‑day pitch, against an attack with Jasprit Bumrah in it, is as good as impossible, Stokes will tell you otherwise.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025Ben StokesEngland cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

They would have to pay around double that for Eze, who was one of the Premier League’s most eye-catching performers in the final weeks of last season. It has been reported that Eze’s contract contains a £68m release clause.The 26-year-old scored his first goal for England in the World Cup qualifying winagainst Latvia on 24 Marchand it was the trigger for him to finish the campaign in arguably the form of his career. He scored nine in 13 matches for Palace, including twoin the 2-0 league victory at Spursand then the winnerin the FA Cup final against Manchester City.Eze can play wide or as a No 10 while the England manager, Thomas Tuchel, even used him as a second striker in the friendly defeat against Senegal two weeks ago. Tuchel is a huge fan. Eze is represented by the influential CAA Base agency, which has a number of players at Spurs, including the captain, Son Heung-min, James Maddison and Pape Sarr.Son’s longer-term situation at Spurs is unclear. He has one year to run on his contract and will be 34 next summer. He has been linked with a move to the Saudi Pro League.Tottenham have agreed a deal to sign the Japan international defender Kota Takai from Kawasaki Frontale.

Atlético Madrid’s Jan Oblak, however, stretched out to keep the match scoreless.Chelsea training cut short due to ‘impossible’ heat in PhiladelphiaRead moreJulián Alvarez nearly gave Atlético Madrid the lead just before the half. The forward collected a pass just outside the area, turned and whipped a right-footed shot, but his attempt was pulled wide.Early in the second half, Atlético again put the pressure on Botafogo with Griezmann attempting to sneak in a left-footed shot by the near post, but it caromed off the post and out of play.In the 67th minute, Botafogo went on the offensive as Cuiabano lofted a cross into the box that Igor Jesus hit first-time.

The event will be played in a streamlined two-day format during the week before the US Open. Raducanu says they first got to know each other at Wimbledon in 2021 and forged a friendly connection during their respective breakout runs at the US Open that year.Alcaraz beats Lehecka to extend win streak and regain crown as king of Queen’s ClubRead more“I remember he beat Stef [Tsitsipas] in the third round and it was like a big win, his breakout win on a big stage and it was really cool to kind of go through that tournament together. We have a good relationship still. He’s obviously overtaken me a lot, but it’s nice we have that from a while ago.”A few days aftertheir partnership was announced, Raducanu opted to catch a glimpse of Alcaraz at Queen’s Club during his semi-final win against Roberto Bautista Agut.“I saw some really cool drop volleys and I was like: ‘Yes, let’s save some of that!’ But he’s got plenty of magic to bring to New York,” she said.For the time being, Raducanu has more serious challenges to focus on than a glorified exhibition event. Her solid start to the grass court season at Queen’s Club, where she reached the quarter-finals and re-established herself as the British No 1, was soured by further problems with back spasms, which have troubled her on numerous occasions this year. Raducanuwithdrew from the Berlin Openlast week.“It’s OK,” she said. “I’m still managing it, to be honest. I have good days and bad days with it. I trained a fair bit last week in London and it was good. I was getting a lot of treatment and then woke up pretty stiff at the weekend, took a day off and then trained yesterday and today, but it needs a lot of work and it is up and down. So I’m just trying to manage it as best as I can.”Raducanu, the No 7 seed, will face Ann Li in the first round at Eastbourne, her final tournament before Wimbledon begins next week.She says she is doing everything she can to ensure that she is in top physical shape and form for her biggest tournament of the year. “Needles, soft tissue, some ­muscle ­stimulation stuff, taping, everything,” Raducanu said. “It’s just ongoing, but it’s OK. It seems to be OK today.”Raducanu also thanked Wimbledon for stopping a man who had been stalking her from buying tickets for this year’s tournament. The man attended four events featuring Raducanu in February and she was in tears when she saw him in the stands at the DubaiTennisChampionships.

At Euro 2022Norway lost 8-0 to Englandand exited at the group stage while at the World Cup a year later the Barcelona star Caroline Graham Hansen was benched for the second game and came out swinging towards the coaching staff after the final whistle. They made it out of the group but lost meekly to Japan 3-1 in the last 16.It is a new start in many ways for this team: there is a new head coach, the Englishwoman Gemma Grainger, and she has implemented a new formation. More important, perhaps, she began in February 2024 to build a new, more harmonious culture. A year later she gave the captain’s armband to Ada Stolsmo Hegerberg, who is extremely motivated to lead Norway to success this summer.“It’s been a long journey with the national team for me,” Hegerberg said when she was appointed the team’s new leader, replacing Maren Mjelde. “Standing here and getting that trust from Gemma is a great feeling.”However, while spirits are high and the group seem to be working better together, they have struggled to find any rhythm on the pitch, especially going forward. In their six Nations League matches this campaign they scored only four goals and won only two of the games. Grainger is unconcerned, though. “It doesn’t worry me. It’s about winning matches and that’s what we’ve done,” she said after the 1-0 win against Switzerland that ended their campaign.It has been an awkward spring for Grainger with injuries hampering her selections. Most of them seem to have cleared in time for the tournament, though, with only the first-choice centre-backs, Mathilde Harviken and Guro Bergsvand, fitness doubts.NorwayThe coachGemma Graingergot off to a flying start with two wins and a combined scoreline of 8-0 against Croatia in the Nations League playoffs last year. The 42-year-old from Middlesbrough is a self-proclaimed football fanatic and most of her waking hours are spent watching or thinking about football. She’s already been a football coach for more than two decades; since the age of 19 Grainger has devoted herself to the occupation, with Silva Neid, the former Germany international and national-team head coach, as her idol. “She is the most successful female coach in history and has truly influenced how I am as a coach today,” she has said.Star playerIfCaroline Graham Hansen, technically brilliant and an artist on the pitch, can find her best form at the Euros, the vice-captain can take Norway a long, long way. At Barcelona she is usually seen on the right wing combining with Aitana Bonmatí, but for Norway she has more of a free role, finding space behind Ada Hegerberg. Last year the 30-year-old finally got the recognition she deserves, finishing second in the Ballon d’Or, being included in the Fifa Best team and winning Norway’s Kniksen award.One to watchThe way she has been playing this year, it wouldn’t be a surprise ifSigne Gaupsettook the Euros by storm. At the age of 20, she has utterly dominated the Norwegian Toppserien. The talented Molde native has a mature style of play and is adept at both defending and attacking, proving her worth every time she has been given the chance by Gemma Grainger. Despite interest from a lot of clubs abroad this winter, Gaupset extended her contract with Brann until the summer of 2027. It will be interesting to see how long they can hold on to her.View image in fullscreenSigne Gaupset (left) takes on Switzerland’s Smilla Vallotto during a Nations League match in June 2025.Photograph: Marius Simensen/Bildbyrån/ShutterstockProbable lineupView image in fullscreenStatus of domestic top-flightMore than 73,000 women and girls are registered as football players in Norway and it is the most popular sport for women in the country. Media coverage is on the rise and the rights holder TV 2 has full coverage of all 27 rounds of Toppserien this season. The league is still semi-professional with teams such as Vålerenga, Brann, Rosenborg and LSK Kvinner dominating both on and off the pitch. Encouragingly clubs in Norway’s second tier are increasing their financial support for their women’s team and are on the rise.Realistic aim in SwitzerlandThey will aim to win their group – and should do so. If they avoid Spain in the quarter-finals we could see Norway in a European semi for the first time in 12 years.The Norway team guide was written by Christina Paulos Syversen forTV 2 Norge.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euros 2025: Guardian Experts’ NetworkWomen's footballNorway women's football teamWomen's Euro 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

It’s a platform to inspire. It’s a platform to change lives. And it’s a platform to bring hope.”Reflecting on how her life had also been changed by the Olympics, Coventry said: “I was very fortunate to have strong women around me from a very early age, from my grandmothers to my mom, to many of you women here in this room today, to my coach, Kim.”But Coventry, who will hold a two-day workshop this week to get feedback on key IOC issues, also warned members that they needed to remain united.“The other day my six-year-old, Ella, pointed out a spider’s web in the garden. And she was pointing out how it is made, how strong it is, and how resilient it is against the bad weather, against the other little creatures. But if one tiny, little piece of that spider web breaks, it automatically becomes weakened.“Each and every single one of you is that spider web. It’s complex, it’s beautiful, and it’s strong. But it only works if we work together and if we remain united.“Keeping united our movement will ensure and will allow for all of us that we can wake up daily and continue to inspire the next generation to continue to change lives. And most importantly, to make dreams come true.”Coventry, who won 200m backstroke gold at the 2004 Athens Games and in Beijing four years later, was also given Bach’s blessing at the event in Lausanne. “With Kirsty Coventry, the Olympic movement will be in the best of hands,” he said.“As an Olympian, she knows what it means to live the Olympic values. She knows how to lead with courage. She is driven by a desire to give back to our Olympic movement that has shaped her life. Now she makes history.”Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeSport politicsOlympic GamesnewsShareReuse this content"

He endured a torrid comeback, twice dropping the ball before he was sent to the sin-bin for his clothesline tackle on the French fly-half Antoine Hastoy, his yellow card subsequently upgraded to red.Lions warn Joe Schmidt over Wallabies player release for tour matchesRead moreOn Sunday, Feyi-Waboso was handed a three-match ban, which will be reduced to two provided he completes “tackle school”. As a result, the 22-year-old wing misses the two Tests against Argentina next month but is available to face USA in Washington.If his inclusion in the 36-man squad – co-captained by Jamie George and George Ford – is a ­surprise, it demonstrates just how important a playerSteve Borthwickconsiders Feyi‑Waboso to be. Before Saturday he had not played since December because of a shoulder injury after his return was delayed amid confusion as to whether he would undergo surgery.It is understood, however, that Borthwick sees value in having Feyi‑Waboso with the squad in Argentina with an eye on the future as well as to provide competition to the other wings in training with Will Muir, Cadan Murley and Tom Roebuck selected. Feyi-Waboso’s inclusion means he will stay fresh should the British & Irish Lions come calling but, as things stand, his ban does not expire until after England’s second Test against Argentina on 12 July, a week before Andy Farrell’s side play their first Test against Australia.Feyi-Waboso was handed an enhanced contract by the Rugby Football Union last October and is sure to be on the list that Borthwick names after the summer tour. That England do not have their usual week’s training camp before their autumn Tests may also explain why the head coach believes Feyi-Waboso warrants a place in the summer squad. Elsewhere, Borthwick has made two changes to the squad that was announced last Monday to prepare for the fixture against the France XV. Ben Curry comes in for Jack ­Kenningham while Raffi Quirke is replaced by Harry Randall. Both Curry and Randall were with the squad for rehabilitation last week but have been deemed fit to make the touring party. George Furbank and Fraser Dingwall were also rehabbing last week but have not been considered for selection.In total, Borthwick has selected 10 uncapped players with Muir joined by Bath teammates Max Ojomoh and Guy Pepper. The Gloucester trio of Seb Atkinson, Charlie Atkinson and Arthur Clark are also selected along with Oscar Beard, Joe Carpenter, Luke Northmore and Emmanuel Iyogun.“The three-Test series is a huge challenge and a valuable opportunity for the continued development of this squad,” Borthwick said. “For some of the younger players, this will be their first experience of touring overseas with England. Travelling together helps strengthen team bonds and offers a valuable chance for new players to integrate into our environment.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bancontains an exemptionthat could apply to players, staff or associated families with teams at the 2026 Fifa World Cup.Iran, who faced USA in the group stage of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, qualified in March for their fourth consecutive World Cup. Although 2026 is also being hosted by Canada and Mexico, only by being given a specific slot in group A couldIranavoid playing in the US, with their matches then taking place in Mexico.Fifa again under scrutiny for World Cup’s increased carbon footprintRead moreIf Iran won that group they would stay in Mexico for their last-32 game and any last-16 match. Should they go further – and they have never reached a World Cup knockout game – they would then play in the US.Fifa did not respond on Monday to a request for comment from the Guardian and will likely be considering its options before the World Cup draw, which is due to take place in December. The decision will be a difficult one for its president,Gianni Infantino, who has associated himself closely with President Donald Trump, who authorised the use of US bombs on Iranian nuclear sites last weekend.Infantino and theFifaCouncil will have the final say on inclusion in the competition and the makeup of the draw, but the organising committee for Fifa competitions will be expected to have input. The committee has members from Canada, Mexico and Iran, and its chair is Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin. In 2022, his organisation announced that Ukraine and Belarus would be kept apart in Uefa competition draws, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and his action may provide an example for Fifa to follow.Before the World Cup draw in Qatar, the agreed draw constraints included limitations on where teams could be selected but this related only to a “general principle” that no more than one team from each confederation (excluding Europe) should appear in a given group.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026IranWorld CupFifaGianni InfantinoFootball politicsTrump travel banShareReuse this content"

The squad had to call off their post-arrival recovery dip in the Indian Ocean – a letdown for local news crews and the lurking sharks off Cottesloe beach – because of incle­ment weather and the first media squall of the trip has also blown in.The Lions chief executive, Ben Calveley, has made clear the ­touring side expects Joe Schmidt, the Wallabies head coach, to make hisnational players availablefor their Super Rugby teams before the Test series commencing next month and the host nation has been gently reminded of that contractual detail following the Lions’ arrival in Australia.“The agreement is very clear; it says that Test players have to be released to play in fixtures leading into that series,” Calveley said at the Lions’ official welcome overlooking the Swan River. “That is our expec­tation. It’s really important that these games are competitive.Andy Farrell’s Lions land in Australia aiming to revive the spirit of SydneyRead more“It’s not just for a performance standpoint – the players do want to test themselves and build towards the Test series – but it’s also right for the fans, partners and broadcasters who are all expecting competitive fixtures, and for the rugby-loving public. That would be their expectation as well.”The opening game against ­Western Force should fulfil that criteria with Nic White, Darcy Swain and Nick Champion de Crespigny all ­potentially available to face the Lions on Saturday. But another couple of ­Wallaby squad members, Carlo ­Tizzano and Ben Donaldson, have been retained in camp by Schmidt before Australia’s warm-up Test against Fiji next week and it remains unclear how many will represent the Lions’ next clutch of opponents.“We’ll see a competitive fixture at the weekend and that’s what we’re looking for,” Calveley said. “We want to make sure our guys are ­battle-hardened when it comes to that Test series against the Wallabies.”Following the Western Force game, the next three fixtures are against the Reds, the Waratahs and the ­Brumbies, and the Lions tour manager, Ieuan Evans, is similarly keen to encounter the strongest possible opposition. “I think what’s clear is that we are an elite sporting touring team and we need to be challenged and tested in our preparations towards the Tests,” Evans said.Discussions, accordingly, will continue with Australian officials, although the requirements of the ­Australia-Fiji game in Newcastle will clearly complicate the situation. The Lions, meanwhile, insist there are no plans to divert from their traditional tour rota but Calveley did say he was potentially open to the idea of the Lions touring other countries such as France in future. “You can certainly understand why people would get excited about that sort of concept. We would as well,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Probably the most shocking statistic in this area is that we are paying out more in clinical negligence for maternity failures than we are spending on maternity services.”The inquiry will look at factors contributing to failures in maternity safety, such as a lack of staff and specialised equipment across NHS trusts. It will also look at racial disparities within maternity care, such as the fact that black women are up to three times more likely to die during pregnancy or shortly after birth than their white counterparts.The government also said on Monday that a national maternity and neonatal taskforce would be established, chaired by the health secretary and consisting of a panel of maternity experts and bereaved families.The announcement of an independent review of maternity services acrossEnglandhad been looking increasingly likely after a series of high-profile failures in maternity care across several NHS trusts.InFebruary, Nottingham university hospitals NHS trust (NUH) was fined £1.6m after admitting it failed to provide safe care and treatment to three babies who died within months of one another.The Ockenden review,published in 2022, investigated 1,862 maternity cases at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust, finding that hundreds of babies died or were seriously disabled because of its mistakes.During his speech, Streeting apologised to the families affected. He said: “All of them have had to fight for the truth and justice. They describe being ignored, gaslit, lied to, manipulated and damaged further by the inability for a trust to simply be honest with them that something has gone wrong.”Campaigners and medical organisations welcomed the national inquiry, but the government was urged to ensure that recommendations were fully implemented.Anne Kavanagh, a specialist medical negligence solicitor at Irwin Mitchell who has represented many families affected by poor maternity care, said the inquiry must lead to “decisive action” by the government in order to restore confidence to the service.“Sadly, many recommendations from previous reports and investigations have not been fully implemented, missing crucial opportunities to improve patient safety and learn from mistakes, which is the best way to improve healthcare,” Kavanagh said.The RCOG said that, as it stood, “too many women and babies are not getting the safe, compassionate maternity care they deserve, with tragic outcomes that are devastating families”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In total, rates of overweight or obese children will rise in 136 of 151 local authority areas (90%) in the next decade, the analysis suggests.And for the first time since records began, rates are projected to top 50% in nine council areas, which means there will be more overweight or obese 10- and 11-year-olds in those areas than not.They are Blackpool (54%), Knowsley (52%), Sandwell (52%), Barking and Dagenham (52%), Wolverhampton (51%), Walsall (51%), Newham (51%), Luton (50%) and Nottingham (50%).Obesity mapIn an interview with the Guardian, William Roberts, the chief executive of the RSPH, said the causes of the crisis were “wide-ranging” but junk food and low levels of activity were “major factors”.“Obesity in childhood leads to several complex health problems that can last a lifetime,” he said. “These include diabetes, high blood pressure, certain types of cancer and poor mental health. Making it easier for children to move around and eat healthily is a key part of preventing this.”Roberts, who previously held senior roles in the NHS, said: “As a nation we’re failing the test on childhood obesity. Our projections show that we are heading in the wrong direction on obesity, with children in some of the most deprived areas set to be worst affected.”The latest data from the government’s national child measurement programme, which covers mainstream state-maintained schools, shows the percentage of children leaving primary school in England overweight or obese was 36% in 2023-24.A report by the RSPH, due to be published this week and seen by the Guardian, analysed data from the programme going back to 2009-10, when the figure was 33%. The RSPH projects the rate will increase to 39% by 2029-30 and climb to 41% by 2034-35.The 18-page report, Playground Rules, calls on the government to encourage greater levels of physical activity in schools, which it argues is key to curbing child obesity.However, Katharine Jenner, the director of the Obesity Health Alliance, said ministers must also bring in reforms “to fix the commercial food system that is causing soaring rates of childhood ill-health”.She added: “This is a national issue, but the impact is felt locally – by families, schools and already stretched health services. With over a third of our children, in some areas up to a half, projected to be overweight or living with obesity in the coming years, we’re facing longer NHS waiting lists and a generation of children too unwell to run, play or thrive.”Blackpool is not only projected to have the highest proportion of overweight or obese children in England by 2034-35, but is also predicted to have the largest rise in rates over the next decade, according to the analysis.Obesity graphChris Webb, the Labour MP for Blackpool South, said: “These projections from the RSPH are deeply concerning – but they don’t have to be our future. With the right action and investment, we can turn the tide on child obesity and build a healthier Blackpool.”Webb said the country’s “broken food system” was to blame. Local initiatives like Grow Blackpool, a food growing project in the town’s largest housing estate, Grange Park, could help, he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The broadcaster denies the claims.After initially self-funding the legal action, Amankona is now launching a public crowdfunding campaign with the Good Law Project on Monday.He added that he had made a verbal complaint with a senior manager about what he believed to be racist behaviour by two colleagues in June 2024. He believes no immediate investigative action was taken. GB News denies any racist behaviour occurred.“The only way that I might be able to change the situation is if I stand up for myself and say it is wrong, and use the channels available to me to make my case,” he said.A source at GB News said Amankona was given notice, along with a number of other contributors, two days before his on-air remarks about Braverman.In a statement GB News said: “Mr Amankona’s claim is misconceived, without merit and being robustly defended. As the claim is ongoing we do not propose to comment further.”The source said GB News maintained that its apology to Braverman was appropriate, particularly in light of Louise Casey’s recent report on group-based child sexual abuse and the government’s subsequent decision to call a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs.GB News has drawn criticism and praise for its approach to news broadcasting since its launch in June 2021. It has frequently fallen foul of Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, and has been in breach of its rules12 times.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The chief executive of GB News, Angelos Frangopoulos, said Ofcom’s decision to withdraw more cases was “another vindication of GB News editorial decision-making”.Amankona said he had been drawn to the broadcaster’s “fresh approach” on its launch, and its commitment to free speech. “I really felt like I was part of something new, something fresh, exciting, and something being done in a different way. I am a very passionate believer in free speech and more opinions being foregrounded,” he said.The 31-year-old began appearing on GB News in July 2021 and started co-hosting The Saturday Five from March 2023 until his last appearance in August 2024. He said that he had believed strongly in the GB News project, and had been left feeling dismayed by the nature of his departure from the broadcaster.“I’m actually very sad about the situation. I was obviously very sad when it happened, and I’m more sad that we’ve got to a point where I am pursuing legal action against GB News,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGB NewsnewsShareReuse this content"

Writing on social media, he called for “maximum political and diplomatic coordination” and closer work on “joint defence projects and weapons production”.Speaking at the Chatham House thinktank, Ukraine’s president said both countries would begin co-producing “long-range drones” soon. He declined to give details, but the drones are likely to be used against strategic military targets inside Russia.“We will do it together. I’m happy about these strong relations between both of our countries,” he said, thanking the UK, “Keir” and previous governments for their support of Ukraine.Ukraine is the world’s leading producer of drones, which now dominate the battlefield. Earlier this month Ukraine’s SBU security agency carried out a spectacularcovert drone attack on five Russian airbases, destroying about 20 Russian bomber aircraft.The prime minister and Zelenskyy chatted in the Downing Street garden with Ukrainian troops being trained in the UK. Earlier Ukraine’s president described Russia, Iran andNorth Koreaas a “coalition of murderers”.He arrived in London hours after the Kremlin launched another big air raid on Kyiv. It involved 352 drones – half of them were Iranian-designed Shaheds – and North Korean ballistic missiles in what Zelenskyy called “a completely cynical strike”.At least 14 people were killed and five civilian apartment blocks badly damaged. “A large number of drones and missiles were shot down by our air defenders – but not all,” Zelenskyy posted on social media.“Everyone in countries neighbouring Russia, Iran and North Korea should be thinking carefully about whether they could protect lives if this coalition of murderers persists and continues spreading their terror.”View image in fullscreenA residential building damaged in Russia’s latest attack on Kyiv.Photograph: Sergey Dolzhenko/EPAZelenskyy has supported Donald Trump’s missile strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities and has accused Tehran of complicity in Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its fourth year. Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons arsenal in the 1990s in exchange for US, British and Russian security guarantees.These failed, however, to prevent Vladimir Putin’s 2022 attack. Zelenskyy’s latest trip to the UK was to discuss how to compel Russia to stop its war, Ukrainian officials said.His previous visit in March followed a disastrous meeting in the Oval Office in which Trump accused him of “gambling with world war three” and the US vice-president, JD Vance, berated him for supposed ingratitude.Monday’s discussions encompassed sanctions and the Trump administration, which has so far refused to punish Russia and has practically ended US weapons deliveries to Kyiv. Ukraine has been attempting to keep Washington onside diplomatically, despite its apparent pivot to Moscow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As well as talks with Starmer, he met King Charles at Windsor Castle.Zelenskyy will travel to this week’s two-day Nato summit in The Hague and is scheduled to meet the alliance’s secretary general, Mark Rutte. It is unclear if he will have a face-to-face meeting with Trump, who is expected to arrive on Tuesday and push for greater defence spending from Nato member states.Since Trump’s return to the White House in January, Russia has dramatically stepped up its aerial attacks on Ukraine. It has refused Zelenskyy’s offer of a 30-day ceasefire and continues to target civilians. Monday’s strikes hit a residential area, hospitals and sports infrastructure.The most severe damage was in Shevchenkivskyi district, where a section of a five-storey apartment building collapsed. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said six people had been killed in the district. Ten others, including a pregnant woman, were rescued from a nearby high-rise that also sustained heavy damage.Oleksii Pozychaniuk, 29, who lives in the building next to the one struck, said he heard the whistle of a rocket approaching and “froze in terror” before feeling the impact.“Windows blew out, glass was flying everywhere,” he told the Associated Press. “We barely made it downstairs with my child.

Daily high records were broken in parts of Minnesota, Wyoming and Michigan.Cities under active heat alerts include Chicago, Kansas City, St Louis, Detroit, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Washington DC andNew YorkCity. The NWS classified some of its warnings as “extreme heat” alerts, its highest level, due to the severity of the conditions.As a heatwave approaches, experts say US sunscreens are less effective than those abroadRead moreSome cities – including Boston, New York City, Philadelphia and Washington – could approach or surpass 100F (37.8C) during the peak of the heatwave. New York’s Central Park hasn’t reached that level since 18 July 2012, the NWS said, while Philadelphia last hit it in June 1994.Humidity is also a factor, with oppressive moisture levels driving “heat index” values – which factor in humidity to give a sense of how hot it feels to a human – into the triple digits in part of the midwest, Great Lakes, mid-Atlantic and north-east. In some areas of the central US the heat index could reach as high as 115F (46C).Meanwhile, night-time lows around 70F-80F (21C-27C) in urban areas will offer little relief and increase the risk of heat-related illness, particularly among vulnerable populations.In New York City, officials are encouraging residents to take precautions. “This is the deadliest weather threat we face in New York City – treat it that way,” the city’s emergency management agency warned on Saturday onsocial media. “Don’t wait until you feel sick. Heat builds. It compounds. It kills quietly.”The National Weather Service in New Yorknotedlate on Monday afternoon that the record high temperature for 23 June in “Central Park has been tied at 96 degrees” and that the “last time 96 degrees was reached on this date was back in 1888”.Philadelphia’s department of public healthdeclareda heat health emergency starting Sunday at noon.Officials are urging the public to stay hydrated, limit time outdoors and check on elderly neighbors and others at risk as the heatwave persists.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherClimate crisisExtreme heatExtreme weatherNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

The place is nondescript in the morning drizzle: two mine shafts, some modern-looking office buildings, a staff car park, lines of landscaped trees. The reason for the police presence, however, is what lies beneath: 42,000 tonnes of toxic waste stored under our feet.Stocamine, which lies in the old industrial town of Wittelsheim, Alsace, once held an old potash mine. Now, the mine shafts are closed, storing poisonous waste from elsewhere. Above the mine shafts is one of Europe’s largest aquifers.Some fear this toxic waste won’t stay sealed in the mine. In time, scientists say it could seep into the Alsace aquifer, which feeds into the Upper Rhine aquifer running between France, Switzerland and Germany, potentially contaminating the drinking water ofmillions of people.Contained in the mine are substances that have been linked to mass die-offs in wildlife, which could have severe and longlasting effects on ecosystems.On 17 June, a judge upheld the decision of the government and ruled the waste should stay and be smothered in tonnes of concrete to avoid it leaking out. Those campaigning for it to be removed have called the decision “a timebomb for future generations”.Today, the main visitors are 30 cyclists in plastic ponchos, with a couple of children and support vehicles in tow. They have come to protest, but only last a short while in the rain before leaving.View image in fullscreenCampaigners have protested regularly at the site since the 1980s.Photograph: Stefan Pangritz/The Guardian“It’s rare the police aren’t here,” says Yann Flory, a retired sports teacher who campaigns against leaving waste in the mine and has organised more than 20 demonstrations since 1989.Flory started fighting against the mine because he had small children. Now he is doing it for his grandchildren. “It won’t be for tomorrow. Maybe I won’t be impacted any more. I’m too old. But my children, my grandchildren, surely they will,” he says. “We are convinced that one day or another, the water we drink will be irreversibly polluted.”An ‘eternal grave’ for wasteThe aquifer sits 5 metres below the surface. Down another 500 metres through striped pink and white rock is the old potash mine, containing 125km of tunnels. A space the size of seven football pitches contains mercury, arsenic and other heavy metals as well as cyanide and residues from household waste incinerators. Reports suggestadditional illegal wastemay be hidden down there too.View image in fullscreenThe plan to store waste in the tunnels was originally sold as a life-line for former miners, providing them with continued employment.Photograph: Sébastien Bozon/AFP/Getty ImagesOver the years, authorities and waste producers around the world have used former mines as “safe” eternal graves for toxic waste – out of sight, out of mind. But the rock here is in motion, subsiding under pressure from neighbouring mines, corroding in 30C heat. Ceilings are sagging and walls are caving in at a rate of2cm a year. There are concerns some of the containers of waste are not accessible – or won’t be for much longer.We hoped we would find a solution to treat this waste and recycle it. But work on this never saw the light of dayJean-Pierre HechtProjections vary, but research suggests thatover the next 300 yearswater will gradually flood the mine. Some scientists say it is possible to seal the pits and delay the release of contamination – or even stop it altogether. Other scientists argue that the only thing to ensure the safety of future generations is to remove the waste, which could costabout€65m(£55m).The government has chosen to inject tonnes of concrete into the galleries and backfill shafts to make them watertight, leaving the waste down there permanently. Environmental groups believe this is reckless, given the uncertainty over shifting rock.View image in fullscreenA photograph taken at the bottom of one of the mine shafts in 2016. Water has still managed to enter despite the shaft being concreted and backfilled.Even in low quantities, heavy metals in water have beenlinked to a series of health problemssuch as cancer, neurological conditions and kidney damage, and can accumulate in the body over time.The prospect of a leak also has significant consequences for wildlife living in rivers and wetlands fed by the aquifer. In aquatic lifesimilar impactsincluding neurological issues and developmental deformities have been documented, with researchers saying waste leakage globally poses an “enormous threat” to biodiversity. More cases are being documented ofpollution leaching from landfillinto water systems and contaminating soils, threatening ecosystems. Cyanide – one of the most toxic substances present in Stocamine – is extremely dangerous to river ecosystems, and has been linked tomass fish deaths and dead zones.Alsace Naturetook the case to the European court of human rights, arguing that leaving the waste where it was posed a risk to public health. On 17 June, the court ruled that the waste could stay, sayingdeterioration of the gallerieshad already made removal dangerous.Miners ‘betrayed’At the protest is one of the men who put some of the toxic waste in there in the first place: Jean-Pierre Hecht, who grew up in the town of Wittelsheim, known officially as aville fleurieor “floral city” but informally as “the garbage commune”. Hecht started mining in 1982 when he was 20 years old. After long shifts he would hang his mining uniform on hook 366, proud of his work. He enjoyed the camaraderie and the physicality of it. He finished his career in the same tunnels where his grandfather started his.View image in fullscreenCampaigner Yann Flory, left, and former miner Jean-Pierre Hecht, who says he feels ‘betrayed’.Photograph: Stefan Pangritz/The Guardian“Everyone worked in the mine,” says Hecht.Miningcompanies created towns, roads, churches, canteens and health services for their workers. Schools and sports clubs were provided for children. The company subsidised holidays by the sea or in the mountains. “What was good was that everyone was the same. There was no jealousy, everyone knew each other,” says Hecht. In the 80s there were 6,500 miners arriving here each morning. But even that was half the number who had worked here in the 60s, and through the 90s it continued to wane. “We were the last generation,” he says.Fearing toxic waste, Greenland ended uranium mining. Now, they could be forced to restart - or pay $11bnRead moreIn 1997, the decision to store toxic waste in the mine was sold as a lifeline to miners: running a waste repository underground could provide them with continued employment. For years, officialsreassured the publicthat the waste would only bestored down there for 30 years.“We hoped that by storing the waste underground, we would find a solution to treat this waste and be able to recycle it in one way or another thanks to advances in technology. But work on this never saw the light of day,” says Hecht.Flyers distributed at the timedescribed the project as “a mine to serve the environment”.View image in fullscreenA classic car show takes place outside the mine, whose disused conveyor tower can be seen in the background.Photograph: Stefan Pangritz/The GuardianMore than 90 jobs were planned, but they did not materialise. In September 2002 a fire broke out below ground, burning for days and spewing out toxic fumes for months. The CEO at the timereceived a four-month suspended sentenceand the facility was closed down, having created just24 jobs. After liquidation in 2009, the French governmentbecame the sole shareholderof Mines de Potasse d’Alsace, which owns Stocamine, and declined to comment for this article.We have to fundamentally change the way we deal with waste. We cannot dispose of it in the environment – it will come back.Marcos BuserMany of the children of miners still live in Wittelsheim. Today, Hecht – once a supporter of the project – says: “Us former miners feel like we were betrayed.”View image in fullscreenThe mayor of Wittelsheim, Yves Goepfert.Photograph: Stefan Pangritz/The GuardianWhen asked by journalists in 2022 what he would wish for the year ahead if he had a magic wand, the mayor of Wittelsheim, Yves Goepfert, said: “I’d get rid of Stocamine.” For Goepfert, leaving the waste in the mine was “the least bad solution that there is … For the moment.”“I don’t have an alternative solution that is less harmful than this one,” he said. He said there needed to be more research to understand the hydrology of the area, and potential risks in terms of flooding scenarios, and how it could be made more stable. “There are plenty of hypotheses – as many hypotheses as specialists who come to have a look,” he said.‘Aburden for our dependents’Subterranean landscapes are unpredictable and what is buried can resurface in other ways. Stocamine is destined to gradually flood over the coming centuries but much is unknown about what happens when water meets waste. Several salt and potash mineshave collapseddue to contact with fresh water, causing landslides, subsidence and sinkholes above ground.Dozens of hydrologists, geochemists and geologists have been pulled on to the Stocamine dossier to work it out. One is Marcos Buser, who first studied the case in 2010 when he was appointed by the French government as part of a steering committee.Buser’s conclusion from the outset was clear – the waste can be removed and it should be done urgently. “It’s best to do it now and not to leave these things to future generations,” says the Swiss geologist, who is a specialist on toxic and nuclear waste.The standard approach of burying waste underground and forgetting about it is flawed, says Buser, who describes thehistory of hazardous waste disposalin landfills as “a history of failures”. Containment measures often only last a few decades, and then it is expensive to remediate them.View image in fullscreenAn aeriel view of Stocamine.Photograph: Sébastien Bozon/AFP/Getty ImagesStocamine is more than just a technical issue – it is a moral one too, he says. “We have to fundamentally change the way we deal with waste. We cannot dispose of dangerous waste in the environment – it will come back,” says Buser, adding that we have to work towards a circular economy, not entomb mountains of waste. “We are just leaving this burden for our dependents.”In the meantime, the European Community of Alsace will appeal against the government’s decision to seal up the waste in Stocamine with concrete. “We intend to systematically remind citizens and their elected officials that they have a timebomb ticking under their feet,” says Flory.Explore more on these topicsMiningThe age of extinctionWasteChemical industryAccess to waterGlobal healthWaterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s also noteworthy that those reports were typically of isolated single turbines, whereas in 2025 they have all been of large windfarms, operating multiple turbines.”In one instance, the towers of three turbines within a single windfarm were broken into, which Crisp said underlined the scale of the criminality and the organised nature of the heists.The spate of thefts has emerged as windfarm developers prepare to invest innew projects in Englandafter the Labour government lifted a ban on such proposals last year. The government hopes to double the number of onshore windfarms by the end of the decade to help create a virtually carbon-free electricity system by 2030.A source close to the affected windfarm owners – which have not been made public – said it was understood that thieves broke open the doors found at the base of wind turbine towers, which are used for maintenance work.The offenders have appeared undeterred by the fact that the turbines were operating at the time of the thefts, which suggests a high level of confidence and familiarity with the infrastructure.Windfarm developments are often in remote rural areas, meaning criminals do not necessarily need to wait for the cover of nightfall to carry out their thefts, the source added.“Copper is a valuable resource. So if you can steal something that will get a good price, there will be people willing to do that,” the source said. “From a risk versus reward calculation, stealing copper from a windfarm will be a lot more attractive than dealing drugs, for example. Stealing copper does not come with a class-A penalty.”The industry is working with the National Infrastructure Crime Reduction Partnership, which aims to combat metal crime from other infrastructure, including railway and telephone lines.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The victim reported the theft to the Metropolitan police that evening.It haspreviously been reportedthat David López Ibáñez, of the Philharmonia Orchestra, had been dining with a friend when the violin disappeared from his side. It had been loaned to him by a German businessman who wanted to help his career.View image in fullscreenThe missing violin, made in Florence in 1740, is valued at more than £150,000.Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PAIbáñez told the BBC that his “life was torn apart” after realising it was gone. He added: “Your heart feels like it’s going to explode.”PC Michael Collins, from the Met’s local policing team in Camden, said on Monday: “We … are releasing this CCTV in an effort to help identify them as soon as possible. The victim, who is a member of London’s Philharmonia Orchestra, has told us the piece is worth more than £150,000 and was made in Florence in 1740.“It is incredibly precious, and for the victim, it’s priceless. Please help us find the person responsible and have the violin returned it to its rightful owner.”The violin, made by Lorenzo Carcassi, was “generously” loaned to Ibáñez to help him perform at major concerts with the Philharmonia. Also stolen were three bows, one with a mother of pearl tip.The alleged theft of the musical instrument has echoes of thedisappearance of a 1696 Stradivariusworth £1.2m and two bows with a combined value of £67,000 from Euston station in 2010.The theft prompted a public appeal for help and the release of CCTV on BBC’s Crimewatch. A man was jailed for four and a half years at Blackfriars crown court for the theft in 2011.There was a false lead suggesting the violin might be in Bulgaria – but that instrument turned out to be a replica training instrument. The real violin was eventually found at a property in the Midlands – intact with some “very minor” damage.Explore more on these topicsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Sales had soared 11.5% in the prior three months, according to the latest figures from analysts at Kantar.M&S was forced to stop trade on its website – which sells clothing, homeware, gifts and flowers – on 25 April and did not restart trade until 10 June, so the business missed out on a bumper few weeks in the clothing trade as Britons splashed out on summer essentials during a warm spell.The collapse came despite an industry-wide pickup in sales, with growth rising to 4% during the four weeks to 25 May, up from 1% in the previous four weeks.M&S said the cyber-attack was “a moment in time”, and its stores had performed well “across all fashion categories and particularly womenswear” when orders on its website were paused.“This underlines the strength of our product offer – where quality and value perceptions remain market-leading and style perceptions continuing to increase – and loyalty of our customers. A big thank you to them for shopping with us.”It said the strong performance in stores meant that M&S had still managed to hold on to its position as the UK’s biggest clothing retailer, by value.Analysts at Jefferies compared M&S’s performance with its closest rivals over two 12-week periods – the three months to 25 May and three months to mid April – and M&S’s sales growth fell to 1% in the later period from 11.5% before.In contrast,Nextbrand sales growth rose to 4.8% from 1.6%. James Grzinic, a retail analyst at Jefferies, said this showed the brand had been “benefiting from the digital disruption seen by major peer [M&S]”.While Zara and H&M’s share of the UK market is smaller so that Kantar’s market research is perhaps a less reliable guide, it indicates both brands experienced a big pickup in trade, helped by their online service as M&S moved offline.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She co-founded the charity MamaSuze , which supports refugee and migrant women with art and drama activities.In a tribute, the organisation had said it was “devastated” by Rook’s death, adding that she treated everyone with “warmth and kindness”.Speaking after the charge on Monday, acting DCS Brittany Clarke said: “Our thoughts continue to remain with the family and friends of Annabel as they navigate this devastating loss.“We ask that the public refrain from speculation and respect their privacy at this time, and we thank the Hackney community for their ongoing support.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

In other words, it could be carried out in the presence of living cells without harming them.The team made their discovery when they took polyethylene terephthalate (PET) – a type of plastic often found in food packaging and bottles – and, using sustainable chemical methods, converted it into a new material.When the researchers incubated this material with a harmless strain of E coli they found it was converted into another substance known as Paba in a process that must have involved a Lossen rearrangement.Crucially, while the Lossen rearrangement typically involves harsh laboratory conditions, it occurred spontaneously in the presence of the E coli, with the researchers discovering it was catalysed by phosphate within the cells themselves.The team add that Paba is an essential substance that bacteria need for growth, in particular the synthesis of DNA, and is usually made within the cell from other substances. However, the E coli used in the experiments was genetically modified to block these pathways, meaning the bacteria had to use the PET-based material.The researchers say the results are exciting as they suggest plastic waste can be converted into biological material.“It is a way to just completely hoover up plastic waste,” said Wallace.The researchers then genetically modified the E coli further, inserting two genes – one from mushrooms and one from soil bacteria – that enabled the bacteria to convert PABA into paracetamol.The team say that by using this form of E coli they were able to turn the PET-based starting material into paracetamol in under 24 hours, with low emissions and a yield of up to 92%.While further work would be needed to produce paracetamol in this way at commercial levels, the results could have a practical application.“It enables, for the first time, a pathway from plastic waste to paracetamol, which is not possible using biology alone, and it’s not possible using chemistry alone,” Wallace said.Explore more on these topicsDrugsPlasticsChemistryBiologyEdinburghScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Young people were particularly vulnerable, it added.Countries should consider extending the graphic health warnings already required on cigarette packets to vapes or e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products and nicotine pouches, the WHO said.In many countries, tobacco products had become more affordable in the past decade, the report said, despite a WHO recommendation that cigarettes should be taxed at 75%. While cigarettes became less affordable in 46 countries, they became more affordable in 42 others, including 23 low or middle-income countries.In 133 countries, vapes and similar devices are now regulated in some way – up from only eight in 2007. However, 62 countries apply no regulations at all. The extent of regulation varies, with almost 90% of wealthier countries either regulating or banning sales, compared with 66% of middle-income and only 27% of poor countries.View image in fullscreenCigarettes and tobacco for sale in a UK shop, showing the packaging with graphic warnings of smoking risks that the WHO wants extended to other nicotine products.Photograph: AlamyIn the UK,disposable vapes were banned this monthin a bid to prevent young people using them and on environmental grounds.Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said: “Twenty years since the adoption of theWHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, we have many successes to celebrate, but the tobacco industry continues to evolve and so must we.”The report highlightsnicotine pouchesandheated tobacco products, as well as vapes, as examples of new products. Dr Rüdiger Krech, the WHO’s director of health promotion, said they were “aggressively marketed in ways that undermine hard-won public health gains”.He said national regulators could not be expected to deal with an onslaught of “thousands” of new products, which represented an attempt by tobacco companies to focus attention away from their “major business” of traditional tobacco.He added, however, that it was “hugely important to regulate these new products, because they are attracting children and young people to actually use nicotine, and that’s with the addiction that it brings”, which he said would lead to tobacco use. Data is not available for all countries, but surveys suggest about 6% of children aged 13 to 15 use e-cigarettes.The WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic focuses onsix tobacco control measuresand rates countries on how far they have implemented them.These include taxation, introducing smoke-free air legislation, and offering smokers help to quit. Other measures include monitoring tobacco use and prevention policies, bans on tobacco advertising and sponsorship, and warning people about the dangers via pack labels and information campaigns.Since 2007, 155 countries have implemented at least one of the six measures at “best-practice” level, the report found, with four countries – Brazil, Mauritius, the Netherlands and Turkey – implementing the full package.Tobacco giant accused of ‘manipulating science’ to attract non-smokersRead moreHowever, 40 countries have no measure at best-practice level, and more than 30 countries still allow cigarettes to be sold with no mandatory health warning. It means billions of people remain unprotected from the ill effects of tobacco, which claimskills more than 7 million people a year, the report warned.Alison Cox, director of policy and advocacy at the NCD [non-communicable disease] Alliance, said: “It’s clear that there is a long way to go if we are to reduce the many unnecessary tobacco related illnesses and premature deaths still occurring globally.“Raising taxes is one of the most effective measures that offers governments a triple win of reducing tobacco consumption, saving lives and healthcare costs, while raising much-needed revenue.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal healthSmokingTobacco industryWorld Health OrganizationHealthYoung peopleShareReuse this content"

The behavior is the first such documented mutual grooming in marine animals and is outlined in a new scientific paper.The discovery was made in a contained group of 73 killer whales that live in the southern part of the Salish Sea, a section of the Pacific Ocean hugging the coast of Washington state in the US and Canada’s British Columbia.Researchers were surprised to see a whale remove a 2ft section of bull kelp, balance it on its nose and then approach another whale to wedge the kelp between their bodies and rub it between them. At first, the scientists thought this was a quirky one-off but then noticed this was a widespread behavior within the group, according to the paper, published in journalCurrent Biology.View image in fullscreenWhale with kelp in its mouth.Photograph: Center for Whale Research, NMFS NOAA Permit 27038“We started keeping an eye out for the behavior and realized this was a common, frequent behavior, which was a very exciting moment,” said Michael Weiss, research director at the Center for Whale Research and the study’s lead author.“We realized we had stumbled across a newly described behavior, which is remarkable. You don’t even think it is a possibility to find something new like this when you’re observing whales.”Cetaceans such as whales have been previously seen with kelp draped over their bodies, a practice known as “kelping”. The behavior witnessed for the first time last year and published in the new study, however, differs because the kelp is selected, trimmed and manipulated between two whales working together.The “allokelping” occurred between all whales within the pod, but particularly between those closely related, of a similar age and involving those with lots of dead skin. This has led researchers to posit that the grooming practice is done to remove dead skin, help the whales stay free of parasites and foster the sort of social bonds that a select group of other animals, such as humans, get from interacting in this way.“In primates, including humans, touch moderates stress and helps to build relationships,” said Darren Croft, a researcher at the University of Exeter and executive director of the Center for Whale Research. “We know killer whales often make contact with other members of their group, touching with their bodies and fins, but using kelp like this might enhance this experience.View image in fullscreenOrcas in the southern resident killer whale endangered J Pod play in the Salish Sea at sunset.Photograph: Richard Ellis/Alamy“It might also be important for skin health. Whales and dolphins have a variety of strategies to help them slough dead skin, and this may be yet another adaptation for this purpose.”Killer whales, despite their name, are the largest members of the dolphin family and can reach up to 33ft (10 metres) long and weigh as much as 22,000 pounds (10,000kg). Known to be an intelligent apex predator found in all of the world’s oceans, killer whales have been seenworking cooperativelywhen hunting but until now it wasn’t known that they use tools in this way.The deployment of tools is seen elsewhere in the animal world, most famously with chimpanzees using sticks to retrieve termites from a mound.Elephants,tamarinsandcrowshave also been seen using tools in some way, although few creatures, other than humans, are known to use tools in the sort of mutually beneficial way documented in the Salish Sea killer whales.“It doesn’t surprise me that they have these intricate social interactions because we know they develop deep bonds between each other, that they are very smart and they figure out problems in their environment,” said Weiss.A more surprising aspect of the discovery, Weiss said, was how long it took. The Salish Sea killer whales have been studied for the past 50 years, with the kelp usage only spotted last year. “These are probably the most monitored marine mammals in the world,” said Weiss.“It really shows that these whales have so much to teach us and that we are still just scratching the surface of their lives and behavior. There is probably a lot of other such behavior we are just waiting to stumble upon, in this and other marine species.”A breakthrough in better understanding the whales’ lives came through the use of cameras on drones, which allowed researchers to observe them more closely. By flying and zooming in on the pod as it swam together, researchers could make out the short strands of kelp and how they were being pressed up and moved between the whales.The study’s discoveries were “amazing” and raised the question of other instances of cetacean tool use, said Monika Wieland Shields, director of the Orca Behavior Institute,who was not involved in the research.“Thus far, there is still a pretty small sample size of allokelping, but if, as the authors suggest, this behavior relates to social skin care, it’s probably been ubiquitous for some time,” she said. “This research demonstrates the new behavioral, cultural and social insights that can come from relatively new techniques like drone observation.”Distinct groups of whales have been known to share certain traits, such as their songs containing regional “accents” in different parts of the ocean around the world. Researchers said they were keen to find out if kelp grooming practices are unique to this group of killer whales or are found elsewhere, too.Even though this grooming practice has only just been discovered, it is under threat. The group of 73 whales do not interbreed with other killer whale populations and Weiss said the outlook was “very bleak” as the group slowly declines. The whales feed primarily on chinook, or “king”, salmon which have suffered steep population drops due to overfishing, the climate crisis and the destruction of spawning habitat by dams built on rivers.The bull kelp itself, meanwhile, is menaced by global heating, which is causing oceans around the world torapidly warm up. The kelp thrives in colder water and whole swaths of the algae are being wiped out in the Pacific north-west as conditions become increasingly hot.“The killer whales are in danger and we are at risk of losing this unique behavior, too,” said Weiss. “If we lose them we may never see this behavior on the planet again. We don’t just lose 73 whales; we lose everything they have been doing for thousands and thousands of years.”Explore more on these topicsCetaceansWildlifeMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday, Brent crude fell nearly 1%, to just over $76 a barrel.The price could hit $110 a barrel if oil flows through the critical waterway were halved for a month and then remained down 10% for the following 11 months, according to new estimates from the investment bank Goldman Sachs.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, has warned it would be “economic suicide” for Iran to close the strait and pushed for China to influence Tehran on the issue.He told Fox News: “I encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the strait of Hormuz for their oil.”Oil flows chartHolger Schmieding, the chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said the strait of Hormuz was “the key economic risk to watch”, but argued that a disruption to energy flows in the Gulf region “seems unlikely”, as trying to limit energy exports would be a high-risk strategy for Tehran.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If no candidate surpasses 50% in the first round of voting, the candidate who’s last is eliminated and their votes are redistributed.That could, in theory, favor candidates that have not until now featured strongly in the polls, including comptroller Brad Lander, who was last weekdetained by Ice agents, or Adrienne Adams, the city council speaker, or Scott Stringer, the former comptroller.But the mayoral primary does not includeEric Adams, the current Democratic mayor who has decided to run in November’s election as an independent after becomingembroiled in a fundraising scandal. Cuomo, too, is still tarred by the sexual harassment claims that forced him toresign as governor in 2021.The down-ticket race also features another New Yorker, or “boomerang candidate”, with a clouded reputation. Anthony Weiner, subject of multiplesexting scandals, is running for the city council.Cuomo has led the polls until now, but Mamdani has surged in recent weeks, setting up a contest between a centrist and a progressive that may, or may not, indicate the direction of travel for Democrats nationally. Both factions of the party will welcome a win as significantly indicative.Cuomo, whose campaign is lavishly backed by some of New York’s richest people, is endorsed by Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, as well as Bill Clinton and Jim Clyburn, the influential South Carolina congressman. Meanwhile Mamdani scored endorsements from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, but not the New York Times editorial board, which called him “uniquely unsuited” for the city’s challenges.The race between the leading candidates has been colored by international politics, with some accusing Mamdani of being antisemitic after he defended the phrase“globalize the intifada”. Mamdani says the phrase has been deliberately misinterpreted to smear him and others who stand up for Palestinian rights.After theUS strike on Iranian nuclear facilitiesat the weekend, Mamdani slammed the military action as heralding a “dark new chapter” for the US.“Donald Trump ran for president promising to end wars, not start new ones,”he said on X, adding: “unconstitutional military action represents a dark, new chapter in his endless betrayals that now threaten to plunge the world deeper into chaos.”Cuomo later addressed the subject: “Iran cannot have nuclear capability. That’s number one,” he said. “It’s dangerous, not only for the region, it’s dangerous internationally. It’s dangerous for the United States.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But as the Southbank Centre erupts after the opening horns of Gorilla,Little Simzhas to run it back, starting the track again in the manner of a rowdy club set.Backed by the majority Black and ethnically diverse Chineke! Orchestra and her own live band, Simz – closing out the 11-dayMeltdown festivalwhich she curated this year – performs a set that is equal parts genuine and genius. The energy in the room is overwhelming, overcoming any misgivings about performing to a seated crowd.Songs of contrasting styles are played one after the other, to highlight the malleability not only of Simz as a performer but of the combination of the live band and orchestra. Young, with post-punk production and Mike Skinner-esque rapping, topples into Free, which is soulfully stripped back. The string players create a frantic, horror-film atmosphere for Thief and Flood, but immediately after, serve to make the “I love you” on Two Worlds Apart far more tender. This extends to word painting: on Introvert, the flutes invoke a choir (“I see sinners in a church”); vibrato strings mimic a voice trembling and breaking on Lonely, the raw, vulnerable track about her internal struggle with producing new album Lotus.Joining her are Miraa May for Peace, longtime collaborator Obongjayar for Lion and Point and Kill, and Wretch 32 and Cashh for Blood. For the latter, Wretch emerges from the crowd and walks down through the stalls, clever staging since the song is structured as a phone conversation, forcing the audience to look between the two rappers like watching a tennis match.At points, Simz feels larger than life, spectacular, replacing conductor Chris Cameron at the helm of the Chineke! Orchestra during Venom, rapping while facing the ensemble until the chorus, to frantic lights. Yet she’s chatty between songs, strolls the aisles during Heart’s on Fire, and stands beaming like a schoolgirl soaking in minutes-long applause. The whole experience is perfectly orchestrated – in every sense of the word.Explore more on these topicsLittle SimzRapHip-hopMeltdown festivalFestivalsMusic festivalslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

In the early 2000s, 28 Days Later became the most popular and influential zombie movie in decades, with its fast-moving, virally infected, not-quite-undead marauders rampaging through a post-apocalyptic England. Now Boyle and Garland have reunited with28 Years Later, easily the most talked-about horror movie sinceSinners, and the biggest zombie movie since the PG-13 dilutions of World War Z back in 2013. Compared with the countless familiar zombie movies and TV shows that have popped up since the original movie, 28 Years Later is a thorny, challenging, unpredictable work, which means there’s plenty to discuss now that it’s spent a well-attended weekend in wide release. Here are some major spoiler-heavy topics related to the film’s style, themes, sociological implications and, of course, that ending.28 Years Later review – sprinting zombies take evolutionary leap forward in badass threequelRead moreZombieevolutionThe original 28 Days Later is notable for its zombie efficiency. Rather than the slow shuffling and gradual, varying levels of undead decay often seen in zombie classics from George A Romero (and the many movies influenced by his films Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and so on), these zombies aren’t technically zombies at all. They’re victims of a lab-leaked “rage” virus (with the hilariously dodgy origins of … showing monkeys violent news footage?!) that seems to be spread by virtually any exposure to an infected person’s blood or saliva. Within a minute or two, the newly infected will be vomiting blood and attacking anyone around them in a deranged frenzy. The victims are analogous to zombies because of their seeming thirst for human carnage (though it’s never clear whether they’re truly “feeding” on humans) and the mindlessness with which they pursue it, but they’re a less supernatural variation than some of their ancestors. The same was true for the 2007 sequel 28 Weeks Later.That’s still the case in 28 Years Later, but with the passage of time built into the story, Boyle and Garland introduce new variants on the post-viral populace. There are still mobs of rage-virus victims, often in rags or no clothing at all, roaming the countryside, which remains confined to the United Kingdom. But 12-year-old Spike (Alfie Williams) and his dad Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) also encounter infected who have been grotesquely swollen by the virus, and now lurch belly-down around in the dirt, often subsisting on worms. On the other end of the spectrum, our heroes are also menaced by an “alpha” zombie who is bigger, stronger and craftier than the others. He also seems capable of reproducing, and not just because of his, ah,endowments. Later in the film, Spike and his ill mother Isla (Jodie Comer) encounter a woman who is both infected and pregnant – and is even distracted enough by the imminent arrival of her baby to allow Isla to lend a helping hand in the birth. Perhaps most surprisingly, the baby is born healthy, seemingly not infected with the virus. (The idea of an asymptomatic carrier, as seen in 28 Weeks Later, goes unmentioned, but it’s a fair bet that if the baby were infected, the humans who carry her around for the next day-plus would probably get sick at some point, too.)The movie’s resident philosophical doctor-recluse Ian Kelson (Ralph Fiennes) chalks this up to the miracles of the human placenta, which seems … oversimplified. But these zombie variants raise a lot of interesting questions. Are the alpha zombies evolving closer to what we think of as humanity, regaining some of their intelligence while maintaining a capacity for brutal violence? (He’s seen multiple times pulling off heads in tandem with spines, like something out of a Predator movie.) It’s vaguely implied that the alpha is the father to this newborn, suggesting that the zombies procreated post-infection, which is something these movies (or any movies? Surely there must be one with zombie sex, but it’s not a typical feature of the genre) haven’t shown before. Zombie reproductive rates must still be low; Dr Kelson points out that a human baby can’t really survive for more than a few days without milk, and if infected women can still breastfeed at all, it’s hard to imagine how that would work on a practical level, especially in terms of not spreading the virus. Maybe this baby, saved by Isla and Spike, is the first zombie-born human to survive.Thematically, the baby’s arrival fits with the complication of the seemingly functional isolated community where Jamie and Isla have raised Spike. The baby, who Spike ultimately delivers back to the community before striking out on his own, implies that the world that they’ve understandably cut themselves off from nonetheless keeps turning, and may even produce new humans without the easiest and most comforting signs of renewal. Quite the opposite: the zombie variations give that outside world its own strange new shape, rather than showing the virus simply burning itself out in quarantine. Viewers will probably be split on whether dirt-crawlers or alphas are too cheesy, too reminiscent of other zombie pictures, too far afield from the relatively grounded viral origins of the first film. But in a movie that some audiences will probably also find short on traditional thrills, these elements keep the landscape strange and unpredictable.DigitalrevolutionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Miya Mizuno/APAs a director, Boyle has long been known by a certain degree of flash;28 Years Laterevolves his style even further. The original film made innovative use of early digital video, which has held up remarkably well even as the tech itself has degraded; few movies have reproduced the grimy low-res immediacy that sometimes smears into a kind of poetic abstraction. For the sequel, Boyle and returning cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle haven’t reproduced this look, either. Instead, they’ve updated it, using inventive multi-iPhone rigs to capture similarly bracing images. Boyle and Mantle use this technology to shoot from Boyle’s trademark extreme angles and unexpected vantages, add micro-freeze-frames to scenes of particularly tense action, and deftly utilize real locations, adding up to one the most distinctive-looking movies of the year and a major triumph for Mantle. For all of its wild swings, his work never feels overloaded or sensationalized. Instead, the visuals guide the audience through a series of expectations-bending shifts, including passages where the movie feels more akin to a dark fairytale (with the alpha looming in shadow on the horizon) than a traditional horror picture. As with 28 Days Later, it’s easy to see how other film-makers might imitate some of these techniques on a superficial level. It’s also hard to picture others bringing them together with such virtuosity. Digital cinematography is now the norm; Boyle belongs with Michael Mann, Steven Soderbergh and David Fincher as some of the few mainstream directors who are able to embrace its differences from celluloid, rather than trying to hide them.23yearslaterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc./PA‘You’d never make Slumdog today’: Danny Boyle on risks, regrets and returning to the undeadRead moreSomewhat more time has passed in the world of the movie than in our world; technically, they’re five years further into the future than we are. In terms of release dates, the movies have taken us from an immediately post-9/11 world to one that still bears the scars and hears the echoes of the Covid pandemic, a rise of authoritarianism, and countless post-9/11 armed conflicts, including one unfolding in the Middle East right now. Boyle has specifically mentioned Brexit as a touchpoint in the development of 28 Years Later, which indeed sees Britain isolated – by force, rather than by choice – and festering. Though the movie doesn’t underline any Covid parallels too boldly, it could be read as a post-pandemic allegory, with Spike’s desire to rejoin the world, regardless of how it’s been altered from what his parents knew, conflicting with the strictness of the community he was born into – essentially a quarantine within a quarantine. Dr Kelson, in the meantime, is determined to memorialize the dead with his towering bone temple of skulls, rather than using his resources to move on or fortify his defenses (which also sets our sympathies apart from outright Covid denialism or the anti-vaccine crowd). It might be surprising for a sequel to a movie that came out in the shadow of 9/11 to traffic in messaging that could amount to “never forget”, but Boyle and Garland turn that mantra around to grapple with how we, as the collective human race, are expected to proceed as survivors of so many contemporary disasters. How many of those disasters came to pass in the rest of the world, which we’re told has been cleared of the rage virus, is another one of the movie’s enticing open questions.Whatwasthatending?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Miya Mizuno/APOn paper, 28 Years Later ends on an infuriating sequel tease that leaves the movie largely unresolved. The reality is a bit more complicated than that. The film actually reaches a highly satisfying, if thoughtfully elegiac and open-ended, conclusion. After Dr Kelson makes an approximate diagnosis of terminal cancer for Isla, she asks him to be euthanized, and her son places her newly polished skull at the top of Kelson’s monument. Eventually, Spike returns to his island community alone – but only long enough to drop off the infant and a note for his father. He then heads back out into the unknown, alone. This both continues the coming-of-age thread at the beginning of the film, when Spike makes his first trip to the infected-heavy mainland with his father, and rejects it, via Spike not just dabbling in zombieland for some real-life target practice, but deciding to actually explore the country at length. He has prioritized a less regimented, prescribed life over the ritual and safety that he’s known, having accepted (at least to some degree) the role of death in life itself, through the loss of his mother.Then a bunch of chavs called Jimmy show up.The final scene of 28 Years Later actually picks up from its opening, set during the original rage outbreak, where a young lad named Jimmy escapes the zombies as his vicar father welcomes them, seeing the hordes as a harbinger of end times. Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s Jamie is close enough to a homophone of “Jimmy” to maybe mistake him as the grownup version of that survivor, but no: an adult version of the real and now tracksuited Jimmy (Jack O’Connell, who also played an interloper in Sinners) pops up to save Spike from another group of zombies. He’s commanding a mini-army of imitators and seeming acolytes who gleefully, athletically dispatch the infected as if they’ve just run in from a Guy Ritchie movie. Then the movie ends, not exactly on a cliffhanger, but leaving the audience hanging on what’s next for Spike and the Jimmys. This also involves a cultural touchstone most American audiences will miss, making the whole thing seem even more inexplicable: Jimmy and his gang are dressed like Jimmy Savile, a once-ubiquitous British TV presenter posthumously accused of widespread sexual abuse, including of children.Jimmy Savile died in 2011 and the allegations against him became well-known afterward, which means this Jimmy wouldn’t be aware of his namesake’s crimes. In the world of 28 Years Later, there’s a good chance they never came to light at all. But for 2025 viewers (at least those aware of Savile), the surface goofiness of this sequence gives way to discomfort, and more thoughts about what gets preserved in a fallen world. Is this apparent religious cult formed around the image of a Top of the Pops host a grim joke on the accidental whitewashings of history, or are there more sinister parallels to be mined? Alongside that question, there’s also some bonus confusion: the lead character of 28 Days Later, played by Cillian Murphy and unaccounted for in this film (and supposedly a lead in the as-yet-unfunded third film) is also named Jim.What’snext?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Miya Mizuno/APWell, Guy Ritchie hasn’t directed 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple – and neither has Boyle. Nia DaCosta, who made the 2021 Candyman reboot as well as The Marvels and Little Woods, directed the already-filmed Garland-penned sequel, which is supposedly out in January (though sometimes ultra-short-gap sequels wind up pushed around the schedule, fearful of going out too soon). Its subtitle refers to something that’s already been unveiled: Dr Kelson’s monument, which the movie seems to have left behind as Spike makes his way in the world. The second film could well circle back to follow Dr Kelson, and leave the Jimmys for whatever Garland and Boyle have planned for the third movie with Murphy; that would certainly fit the new movie’s repeated narrative swerves refocusing the who/what/where/when of survival. But Boyle and Garland have said that the Jimmys sequence does set up the second movie, and that Murphy will appear in a similar capacity to set up the third, so it’s fair to assume Spike will remain the lead character for that installment. (This would make him, and whoever joins him, the first 28 Days Later series character to really carry over, as Days, Weeks and Years all followed different groups of people.) Maybe the Bone Temple is more of a symbolic reference than a literal one, referring to how Spike carries awareness of the dead with him on his journey, which seems like a pointed contrast to the uniform joviality of the Jimmys. One thing is clear: Boyle and Garland have set up a sequel not by obviously holding over-many characters and stories back for another movie, but by overflowing this post-apocalyptic world with ideas.Explore more on these topics28 Years LaterNow you've seen itJodie ComerRalph FiennesDanny BoyleJack O'ConnellZombiesHorror filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Keyboardist Rod Argent, singer Colin Blunstone, guitarist Paul Atkinson, drummer Hugh Grundy and bassist Chris White were the amazingly talented group from the English home counties who, in this film, look heartbreakingly like a five-man team on University Challenge.The Zombies became a hugely prominent part of the British invasion of the US, while at the same being royally manipulated and exploited. Their eerie and sublime harmonies, topped off by Blunstone’s beautiful, plangent and weirdly vulnerable lead vocals, were the foundation of iconic songs like She’s Not There, praised by George Harrison on Juke Box Jury (the equivalent of getting a simultaneous OBE and papal blessing). Then there was the mysterious, psychedelic and weirdly unwholesome masterpiece Time of the Season from 1968, although sadly Schwartzman doesn’t ask the band to walk us through those groovy lyrics: “It’s the time of the season for loving / What’s your name? What’s your name? / Who’s your daddy? Who’s your daddy? / He rich? Is he rich like me?” It stormed the US charts after the band had made the gloomy decision to break up, exhausted and demoralised and, above all, needing money to pay the bills.Some of the band stayed in the business as performers; chaotically, Blunstone continued as a solo artist by experimenting with a change in name (“Neil MacArthur”) which only confused everyone. And after the band split up, American copycats started ripping off their act under the same name. The Zombies’ story in many ways cuts to the heart of the dilemma for everyone who wants to make it in music: when do you cut your losses, give up, take a boring straight job and then torment yourself with the thought of what might have been if only you’d stuck at it a little bit longer? Incredibly, Blunstone was plugging away in a dull sales office when he heard about Time of the Season making it big in the US.Eventually the surviving members of the band reformed and were passionately praised by younger musicians such as Dave Grohl who admired their cult 1968 album Odessey and Oracle. (The band had long claimed that “Odessey” was a deliberate coinage, mixing “Ode” and “Odyssey” – before finally admitting it was a spelling mistake which stayed on the cover after it was too late to do anything about it.) There’s a lump-in-the-throat moment when the surviving Zombies are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; it was amazing, they say, “to realise in your 70s, that you were successful in your 20s”.Hung Up on a Dream: The Zombies Documentary is in UK cinemas from 24 June, and US cinemas from 29 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsMusic documentaryPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

It shouldn’t work, but it does – and so splendidly, too. In Paul Feig’s comedy Spy,Melissa McCarthyplays Susan Cooper, a timid CIA desk agent who gets sent out into the field by her fearsome boss (Alison Janney) after the death of her slick Bond-like colleague, Bradley Fine (Jude Law, in a rare comedic turn). The cast is full of delightful surprises. Rose Bryne is a stiletto-clad Oxford-educated villainess with quips so brutal that she makes Regina George look like Barney. Peter Serafinowicz does a game turn as an – admittedly very pre-#MeToo – cringey Italian pervert figure named Aldo (“like the shoe store found in American malls”).‘Always something I can watch’: why Spotlight is my feelgood movieRead moreAnd in the film’s most magnificent twist,Jason Stathamparodies the hard-as-nails action leads he’s played over the years as a hard-edged buffoon with “a habit of doing things that people say I can’t do: walk through fire, water-ski blindfolded, take up piano at a late age”. That’s not even to mention whatever it is that’s going on between the English comedian Miranda Hart, who stars as Susan’s best friend and co-conspirator, and American rapper 50 Cent, who plays himself.I was first introduced to McCarthy’s charms in another Feig feature, the 2011 comedy Bridesmaids, then hailed as a vital intervention in the major debate, considered legitimate and interesting at the time, about whether women were funny. Bridesmaids proved the affirmative. There were gross-out gags: who could forget Maya Rudolph’s diarrhea-ridden bride-to-be, festooned in her custom designer dress, running through a busy street before giving up to let loose among the cars, the sacred commingling with the literally shitty profane. Then there were the nuances of girl-world jockeying: the self-cannibalising competition involved in organising a bachelorette party, or showing up to a fancy party in your best clothes, only to be asked by the insouciant rich girl whether you had just “come from work”.Among this cast of funny women, McCarthy was a scene-stealer. As Megan, she first appeared as someone Hollywood would at best ignore or at worst despise: she was plus-sized, she was unglamorous, she dressed in clothes that – to borrow a joke fromSpy– made her look like “someone’s homophobic aunt”. But McCarthy delivered a magnetic performance of a woman who was foul-mouthed, sexually confident and utterly self-possessed. Far from being a figure of pity, McCarthy made Megan a figure of admiration.Those comic gifts are given more space to roam in Spy. McCarthy’s Susan Cooper is a meek middle-aged woman stuck in a fossilised routine, unappreciated at work and unseen in life. She watches her younger, thinner colleague get served faster at the bar, basking in the glow of the kind of male attention Susan’s never had in her life.Jude Lawgives her a hideous necklace with a grinning cartoon cupcake, which says: I like you, but I do not respect you. It is Susan’s invisibility, and the fact that people will underestimate her at every turn, that grants her a chance to go on a mission. Just follow the target from a distance, her boss tells her. Inevitably, Susan breaks the rules.My love for spy films began in the 2000s with cartoon Totally Spies, which follows a trio of high school girls in California who spend their time shopping, partying and undertaking high-flying missions for an international organisation. I was drawn to the boundlessness of their lives, their glamorous escapades, their incredible gadgets and total competence. That quickly led me to McG’s Charlie’s Angels films (great fun,dodgy accents) then later the classics: the Hitchcocks, the Bonds, the Le Carré adaptations.The spy films I returned to most, though, were the comedies that embraced the high camp of the genre, understanding that these stories were as total a fantasy as those about being saved by a perfect prince. I was also drawn to the stories about women, because the appeal of the genre is, to me, inextricably tied to gender. In a world that reminds girls that danger may be lurking around every corner, and asks women to embrace a kind of harried, self-sacrificial domesticity, the female spies in these films were a perfect on-screen foil.Spy – it’s in the name – is both a satire and homage. There’s a high-powered gadget lab with cars that look like smooth, expensive spaceships, and a sardonic gadget master to match. There’s a high-stakes poker game; a dangerous drop-off in a bumping club; a high-speed car chase through a European city. These tropes are both indulged and subverted to fun, frothy effect.And Spy is radical in other respects: it remains the only major Hollywood spy film that features a middle-aged woman as the lead. I know because every so often, in search of a feelgood film, I rewatch what can be inelegantly described as “female-fronted spy comedies”: Charlie’s Angels 1 and 2, the recent reboot of Charlie’s Angels, as well as the fun Mila Kunis-Kate McKinnon buddy comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me. Projects like these are few and far between; I guess Hollywood does not think there’s enough of an audience for them. To that I say: join us. The delights are profound; the sense of freedom intoxicating; the costumes and the gadgets and the intrigue sexy and absurd and larger-than-life – and an exciting new adventure, that great siren song to the desk-bound, is always just around the corner.Spy is available on Hulu in the US and Disney+ and Netflix in the UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsSpyMy feelgood movieMelissa McCarthyMiranda HartJason StathamComedy filmsPaul FeigAllison JanneyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What’s ironic about the many instances detailed here of how daily life still excludes them is that being part of daily life is exactly what most disabled people wish to be; not visible, not exceptional.That said, Fighters does choose a focal point: the struggle of lower-limb amputee boxer Matt Edwards to gain approval from sport’s authorities to take part in amateur boxing bouts. Training and sparring have been a lifesaver for him; after losing a leg aged 19 in a road traffic collision, he fell into addiction. But with the boxing authorities refusing to let him compete, Edwards is forced to sweat it out – elegantly pivoting on his prosthetic limb – in white-collar bouts.The question of Edwards’ participation is in some ways highly specific, linked to his disability type (though there is a history of lower-limb amputee and wheelchair boxing), and available opponents. But it’s also emblematic of a wider resistance in sport and other arenas of life, both conscious and unconscious, to adapting to disabled people’s needs. Unbelievably, it can still come down to basic questions of access. Grimmett recounts an anecdote about a boxing gym who would only roll out their wheelchair ramp for him between 11am and midday.It’s exasperating because sport should be a universal route to self-validation and social interaction, all the more so for disabled people whose mental health is ground down by the constant struggle for recognition. Gladiator Jodie Ounsley, who is deaf, attests to how sport coaxed her out of her shell, and Amelia, a 10-year-old deaf boxer from a Pembrokeshire gym, is following the same path. There is some divergence here about whether the business rationale – the so-called “purple pound” – is the key driver for widespread change. Grimmett doesn’t editorialise, but lets the arguments breathe and allows quiet indignation to sink in. It would be good to see him tackle other facets of the disabled experience.Fighters is in UK cinemas from 27 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsDisabilityDisability and sportBoxingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet the bill is such a stylistic mixed bag that it’s hard to draw many conclusions besides the simple truth that some have aged a lot better than others.Manchester’s ultimate cult band the Chameleons’ gnarled angst and integrity remains intact, particularly on the mesmeric paranoia of Soul In Isolation. So does the doomed glamour and brittle cool of the Bowie-indebted Psychedelic Furs, with suave showman singer Richard Butler increasingly resembling a louche rock’n’roll Peter O’Toole.“If this is shit, it’s your fucking fault!” declares the mohawk-sporting John Lydon, clad in a clown-like oversize blue checked jacket, as he arrives to begin Public Image Ltd’s set. He reconsiders, and concedes that at least a little of the blame may be his: “My voice is a bit squeaky because I’ve been on a three-week bender … in 12 hours.”Thankfully, PiL are not shit. Lydon’s attitudinal irony hangs from every note and word yet their throbbing dub excavations are thrilling, especially on a surprise revisit of Open Up, Lydon’s 1993 club collaboration with Leftfield. He quits the stage with a sneered swipe at absent ex-friends: “I apologise for nothing … except the karaoke Sex Pistols!”View image in fullscreenAttitudinal irony … John Lydon of Public Image Ltd.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesThe amiableJohnny Marrappears to be on a mission to refocus minds on the beauty of Smiths songs such as Panic, This Charming Man and How Soon Is Now? rather than on Morrissey’s current toxicity. Billy Idol is equally keen to restress his status as a punk-pop cartoon, spinning Frisbees into the crowd during a comedic new anthem, Too Much Fun.Technical issues bedevil the second stage. Happy Mondays have to cut their set short – mercifully so, on this wretched form – and the Damned and theJesus and Mary Chainare also curtailed, with the latter’s singer Jim Reid’s earnest apology – “Sorry it was so short!” – ironic for a band who, in their earliest days, regularly delivered 15-minute sets.The The tellingly open their set with Sweet Bird of Truth, their 1986 song about American bombing raids on the Middle East. Armageddon Days Are Here (Again) is infused with a similar doom-laden topicality, but the crowd notably warm far more to the sweet synth-pop alchemy of their early hymns to adolescence, This is The Day and Uncertain Smile.Everybody else is running late butKraftwerkinevitably line up behind their four onstage keyboards at the exact second they are due. Electronic music’s ultimate pioneers, they deliver music that sounds as sacred as school hymns: from Autobahn to The Model, they spiel out exquisite techno-symphonies, with peerless melodies to die for, in front of incredible 3D visuals. Playing songs close on half a century old, while headlining a retro festival, they don’t sound remotely dated: forever now indeed.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockIndiePunkJohnny MarrJohn LydonPublic Image Ltdlive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Let’s hope that the male protagonists persuade more boys to pick up a bookSam LeithMon 23 Jun 2025 07.16 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 07.17 EDTShareThis year’s Carnegie medals for children’s writing, awarded on Thursday, brought to light an unexpected trend. At a time of widespread public anxiety about thedecline in boys’ reading habitsand the rise of the toxic influencers of the online “manosphere”, male friendship and masculinity were front and centre on the shortlist.The winner, Margaret McDonald’s superb debut, Glasgow Boys, tells the story of the relationship between two looked-after children on the threshold of adulthood who process trauma in different ways. Banjo’s aggression and Finlay’s avoidance could be seen as two models of dysfunctional masculinity. Luke Palmer’s Play, also on the shortlist, tells a story of male friendship which touches on rape culture and county lines drug gangs, while teenage gang membership is the focus of Brian Conaghan’s Treacle Town.Nathanael Lessore won the Shadower’s Choice medal (voted for by young readers). King of Nothing tells the story of Anton, a pre-GCSE hardman for whom reputation is everything. Anton hangs out with a thuggish crowd whose worldview is shaped by gang culture and Tate-like influencers. The arc of the plot – boisterously comic at first, but increasingly moving – shows how Anton’s developing friendship with the uncoolest boy in the school changes his priorities.Though the books were judged for their individual qualities, the panel’s chair, Ros Harding, observes a pendulum-swing in publishing. “We’ve gone from children’s adventure books, where it was always the boy as the hero, then there was a backlash against that, making sure that girls could be the heroes as well, which then maybe led to some boys feeling that things weren’t being written for them.” Now, she says, “another wave of books” is addressing that.McDonald says that in Glasgow Boys, she “wanted to explore the spectrum of masculinity that both Banjo and Finlay exist on. Finlay is the more ‘feminine’ man who we perceive to be empathetic and introverted – a very gentle person. Banjo, conversely, is the ‘masculine’ boy: violent and aggressive.”“People have been very curious as to why I have focused on two men when I’m not myself a man. But I don’t think it would have been much of a question if I was a male author.” McDonald had a considerable struggle to get Glasgow Boys published – 60 agents and 20 publishers, she says, turned it down.Does she think that one factor was a reluctance to publish books about boys? She believes the book’s use of Scots dialect (it comes with a glossary) was an issue, as was the fact she was submitting it during Covid. But the decline in boys’ reading, she suggests, might have created a vicious circle in publishing. “I think because there’s such a small readership it’s difficult, in a business sense, to cut out the bigger readership – which is girls and women.”Harding says her experience as a librarian is that most boys read more narrowly than most girls. “A girl who likes reading will read anything. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a male protagonist or a female. Boys were just a little bit more resistant to that. I think they are more likely to want the male protagonist.”When McDonald hears feedback on the book, male readers “often focus on Banjo and Finlay separately, whereas my female readers focus on the relationships. A lot of boys who read it will be like, ‘I related to Finlay’, or ‘I relate to Banjo’, whereas none of the girls read that way. So it suggests a little bit of a difference in the ways in which boys go into books.”The hope is that they go into books at all. The explosion in so-called toxic masculinity is taking place at the same time asstatistics tell usthat reading for pleasure, especially among boys, is on the decline. Novels are empathy machines: they invite you to imagine what it might be like to be somebody else. So they are, at least potentially, an antidote to the misogynistic influence of the manosphere and gaming culture. But it’s precisely with social media and video games that they are competing for the attention of boys and young men.Lessore says his book was inspired in part by discovering “my little nephew and my cousin – who were, I think, nine and 13 at the time – were both watching Andrew Tate videos”. He sees the long-term effects of that in school visits he does, to expensive private schools and “very, very underfunded state schools” alike. Children self-segregate: boys on one side, girls on the other. “Gay” is being used as an insult once more, and boys have so little respect for female teachers that they have to call over male staff to settle them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It’s a drop.

I do this with a heavy heart: one of the pleasures of this book is the jaw‑dropping coup de théâtre that comes halfway through. Until that point, Endling offers its readers the pleasures of a more or less conventional novel.The central character is a misanthropic obsessive called Yeva who drives a converted campervan around the countryside of her native Ukraine, rescuing endangered snails. She’s hoping to get them to breed, but some turn out to be endlings – the last living member of a species. First coined in the 1990s, the word was unknown to me before I read this book, but the tragic biological checkmate it describes is older than history. Aurochs, dodos, quaggas, mammoths and Tasmanian tigers must all have culminated in an endling.Instead of engendering new life, Yeva ends up being a hospice nurse for entire species as her charges become extinct. Her obsessive death-watch would be unbearably grim if it weren’t so funny. Here she is, indignant at the way her beloved snails are overshadowed by more glamorous species:Snails weren’t pandas – those oversize bumbling toddlers that sucked up national conservation budgets – or any of the other charismatic megafauna, like orcas or gorillas. Snails weren’t huggy koala bears, which in reality were vicious and riddled with chlamydia. Nor were snails otters, which looked like plush toys made for mascots by aquariums, despite the fact that they lured dogs from beaches to drown and rape them.Bearing constant witness to annihilation, Yeva finds her mental health is hanging by a thread. She’s also short of cash, so funds her mission by working for a company that runs so-called “romance tours”. Still reeking of her grotty campervan, Yeva turns up to swell the numbers at events to which foreigners have been lured by the comically specious promises on the agency website: “the secret of the Ukrainian Woman may be genetical. Invasions and wars led to fruity intermixing … Imagine an entire country of beautifulandlonely women! … This is where you, Western Man, enter.”It’s through the marriage agency that Yeva encounters the two characters who catalyse the plot of the novel: sisters Nastia and Sol. Inspired by their mother, the founder of a group of feminist activists, they want to draw the world’s attention to the patriarchal assumptions of the bridal industry. In order to do this, they’re planning to kidnap some of the foreign bachelors and hold them hostage in Yeva’s van. One of the bachelors, Vancouver-based Ukrainian émigré Pasha, completes the quartet of human characters at the novel’s heart. Pasha has returned to the land of his birth not only to find love but in order to fulfil a vague sense of artistic destiny.For roughly 100 pages or so, Endling barrels along, effortlessly resonating with larger ideas, sustained by humour and a sharp and empathetic intelligence. The book is shaping up to be an engaging comic heist: an eastern European Coen brothers caper, inflected with a feminist sensibility. And then Russia launches its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The shock of this event is so huge that it doesn’t just affect the lives of the characters, it breaks open the entire novel. It’s like one of those moments in the theatre when someone shuffles on to the stage to share the news of a terrible event behind the scenes: a fire or a flood.The scale of this disruption is acknowledged formally in the book. Reva does the novelistic equivalent of running the credits. The story we’re reading appears to conclude on page 136, complete with acknowledgments page, author biography and a note on the typeface. Then, overleaf, an alternative version of the novel resumes.We learn in this section that after the critical success of her first book, the short story collectionGood Citizens Need Not Fear, the author began and then abandoned a version of Endling. “Even in peacetime,” we overhear her telling her agent, “I felt queasy leaning into not one but two Ukrainian tropes, ‘mail-order brides’ and topless protesters.” A Canadian citizen of Ukrainian descent, she finds herself struggling to write, stricken with guilt, worrying about her grandfather who is living near the frontline in Kherson. She’s chastised by a ruthless inner voice that accuses her of opportunism. “Fourteen dead, ninety-seven wounded. But don’t let us interrupt. By all means, sink into those high-thread-count sheets.

Something deepens in the relationship between reader and author. We all have skin in the game at this point. Sitting in the theatre, with the smell of smoke rising from behind the curtains, the reader wonders, among other things, what on earth is going on? How is she going to pull this off? What’s going to happen to the central characters? Are the Russians going to bomb all of us?In this second half of the book, we return to the story of Yeva, Nastia, Sol and Pasha, as it unfolds in the days after the invasion. A possible mate has been sighted for one of Yeva’s lone snails. Yeva has to decide between driving the kidnapped bachelors to safety or heading towards Kherson and right into the path of the Russians. Given what’s happened so far, it’s not a surprise to learn that the book eschews the safe option. But now Reva has established a different kind of rapport with the reader and is able to intrude more directly into the narrative. She shares with us personal details about her connection with Ukraine, as well as her awareness of the war and the artistic challenge she faces: can anyone in good conscience make fiction out of these tragic events? Though not every element of the story is equally successful – I was left puzzled by the passivity of the kidnapped bachelors – the answer to that question is resoundingly affirmative.Endling by Maria Reva is published by Virago (£20).

It’sOur Arachnid, ancestor, mother of allOf us, mother of gorm and of gormlessnessAmong women. Humble herself in origin,Hard she works through us.Nothing can cut the umbilical cord thatCalls us back to her, her bellyful of threadPaid out and yet perpetual, her silkenSac where we began.She is alone, outwith the worn orb web ofThe world. She’s woven into the wherewithalOf her own imagination, her mantleOf maternity.She is alone and she is loved among, asNo-one else in all her anonymity.One foot on the mountain, one foot on the web’sHer way, as she says.The legend of the weaving contest between the goddess Minerva (Pallas Athene) and the humbly born Arachne, istold by Ovid in Metamorphoses. The goddess is infuriated by Arachne’s ingratitude for her talent, and horrified by the scenes of un-godly behaviour her magnificent weaving depicts. After Minerva has ripped up Arachne’s work and beaten her with her shuttle, Arachne slips a noose around her neck. Minerva spares her life, but Arachne doesn’t avoid punishment: “Her whole body became tiny. Her slender fingers stuck to her sides as legs, the rest is belly, from which she still spins a thread, and, as a spider, still spins her ancient web.”In this week’s poem, from Gillian Allnutt’s new collection,Lode, Arachne becomes Arachnid, mother-spider and deified leader of her tribe. The ode that crowns Arachnid’s annual festival offers the tribe’s gratitude “to her and to their own being in her”, Allnutt’s endnote tells us. Ovid’s Arachne was rude and scornful about old age when Minerva appeared to her disguised as a grey-haired woman with a stick. Allnutt’s poem doesn’t only transform Arachne; it hands power to the singer-speaker, an elder of the tribe. Celebrating Arachnid’s power, she affirms her own.Allnutt, who describes herselfas a cultural Christianrather than a Christian poet, brings traces of Christian theology into her feminist and matriarchal narrative. Arachne’s redemption is through humility, signalled in a delicately homely first stanza: “Webs are small and spacious as simplicity / See-through as a summer’s day, old-fashioned as / A slip of butter-muslin, girlhood’s own.” “Webs” (importantly plural) represent simplicity, openness, respect for tradition. Once defiant in the self-assertion of young genius, Arachne/Arachnid is restored by her spider-smallness to her true imaginative resources.Imperfection is admitted. Spiders are “poor predators [who] love to catch the light / As it falls from the air”: like all life-forms, they’re devourers. Perhaps they’re especially like artists and writers in seeing their prey not as meat but as moving light. The winged creatures such arachnids trap become their means of self-creation, the wonders of addition: “What is not yet born, an acrobatic dot / And carry one.”Arachnid is always reborn, always mother. Her celebrant utters a gasp of thrilled discovery in the enjambment of verses two and three: “It’s // Our Arachnid.” Certain phrases in verse three evoke the rhythmic murmur of the prayer, Hail, Mary. But Allnutt’s goddess is wonderfully, humorously, earthed. She’s no “Mother of God”. As “ancestor, mother of all / Of us” Arachnid is also “mother of gorm and gormlessness / Among women.”“Gorm” may bea northern dialect wordfor “understanding”. Understanding, of a deep, grainy, common-sense kind, is what registers in the poem. Its opposite, the more familiar “gormlessness”, is the less ideal aspect of “simplicity”. Its use echoes the poem’s refusal of unthinking praise – the kind of praise Minerva expected from Arachne. The children of the spider-goddess are imperfect, too. But they are still the offspring of a divine mother, the “worn orb web” of earth, yet “woven into the wherewithal / Of her own imagination, her mantle / Of maternity.”Allnutt refreshes her diction with inventive interweavings: little grammatical “reversals” such as “Hard she works through us” and words with an antique patina: “silken”, “mantle”, “outwith”, “wherewithal”. Her alliterative music is a mnemonic web that reminds us that the tribal song lives by its orality. There are often whispers of end-rhyme. The tiny versatile spider of the word “as” recurs in verses one, two and six, signalling resemblance, duration and motion – the thread that is “paid out and yet perpetual”.In the last stanza, antithesis arrives at a more intriguing synthesis. The spider-goddess is “alone and [she is ] loved among, as / No-one else in all her anonymity.” The quality of being “among” others and “anonymous” – but unique – becomes a specific tribute in the line, “One foot on the mountain, one foot on the web’s / Her way”. The reference is to Lilian Mohin’s 1979 anthology of British feminist poetry, One Foot on the Mountain. A poetry anthology is an apt symbol of collectivism and individuality. And this particular anthology importantly “mothered” the art and politics of its female contributors.Lilian Mohin isremembered here by Cherry Potts, who in turn went on to found theArachne Press. Celebrating these poetic Mothers and their work, The Song of Arachnid presents the ecology of a feminised, maternally attentive cosmos in which weaving and mountaineering can both be “her way” and its generous, ecofeminist vision is enhanced by the celebration of real-life poetic mothers.The Song of Arachnid was written forthe Hardwick Park Festival of Minerva.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a question you will ask yourself on many occasions during the second instalment of Hideo Kojima’s hypnotising, mystifying, and provocatively slow-paced cargo management simulator series. First, because during the many long and uneventful treks across its supernatural vision of Mexico and Australia, you have all the headspace in the world to ponder its small details and decipher the perplexing things you just witnessed. And second, because the question so often reveals something profound.That it can stand up to such extended contemplation is a marker of the fine craftsmanship that went into this game. Nobody is scribbling down notes to uncover what Doom: The Dark Ages is getting at or poring over Marvel Rivals’ cutscenes for clues, fantastic as those games are. It is rare for any game to invite this kind of scrutiny, let alone hold up to it. But Death Stranding 2 is a different kind of game, one with the atmosphere and narrative delivery of arthouse cinema, light of touch in its storytelling but exhaustive in its gameplay systems, and the tension between the two makes it so compelling. At first you brave one for the other; then, over time, you savour both.For anyone who missed the first Death Stranding, yes, this really is the second in a series of games about moving cargo between waypoints, on foot or by vehicle; delivering packages of food, tech and luxury items, like a post-apocalyptic Amazon driver. A mysterious event fundamentally changed the world at the start of the first game, allowing the dead to return to the realm of the living as spectral entities known as Beached Things (BTs). When a BT kills a human, it creates a disastrous event called a “voidout”, a kind of supernatural nuclear bomb explosion that leaves behind nothing but a vast crater.View image in fullscreenA screenshot from Death Stranding 2: On the BeachWith humanity fragmented and sequestered in underground bunkers, protagonist Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus) was entrusted with connecting the remaining pockets of civilisation in the US to a global tech infrastructure called “the chiral network”, restoring hope for a better tomorrow. He managed it, too, making it across the entire continent with a sort of supernatural infant, Lou, carried in an artificial womb. As this sequel begins he is enjoying a secluded life in Mexico with Lou, now a toddler.And believe me, those are the scantest cliff notes possible. Death Stranding 2 begins with six solid minutes of cutscenes that attempt to convey the strange world of sci-fi and poetic metaphors that Kojima has constructed, and even that feels like a cursory summary. Decrypting the mysteries is half the fun here (the other half being the box-shifting) but even if you don’t engage that deeply with the world, it follows its own kind of dreamlike logic and starts to make intuitive sense. It is not clear whether Death Stranding 2’s Australian once looked like the one we know, for example, or whether it was always a patchwork of Icelandic tundra, snowcapped mountains and multicoloured desert. What matters is that it feels consistent.Meditative it may be, but this isn’t a game about watching Sam enjoy retirement and fatherhood for 50 hours. He is inevitably called back into action, this time reconnecting the Mexican and Australian populations to the chiral network for an outfit called Drawbridge, a logistics company funded by an unknown benefactor and headed by returning character Fragile (Léa Seydoux). If that sounds a bit dry, what if I told you that Fragile wears a pair of long Greta Garbo gloves around her neck, which she can move like a second set of hands?View image in fullscreenElle Fanning in Death Stranding 2.Photograph: Sony Interactive EntertainmentA swashbuckling gang of assists Sam on his mission, following him around on the DHV Magellan, a ship with more A-listers on board than a Cannes red carpet. Seydoux, George Miller, Guillermo del Toro, Nicolas Winding Refn, Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna all give brilliant performances, as does veteran game actor Troy Baker as chief baddie Higgs. The major characters exist primarily as poetic devices and morbid metaphors: Rainy (Kutsuna) is an ostracised optimist who makes it rain whenever she goes outside; Tarman (Miller) lost a hand to supernatural tar, and can now use it to guide the ship through its currents; Heartman (Darren Jacobs) dies and is reborn every few minutes. By rights, they should all be simply too strange to invoke pathos, but there are rare moments when the allegory is dialled down and they interact in human and poignant ways. If you don’t feel a lump in your throat watching Rainy and Tomorrow (Fanning) sing together, it’s not just Deadman who is dead inside.Package delivery is, strangely, depicted to the highest of gameplay standards. It sounds boring, but you can’t help get pulled in by the magnetic draw of these detailed systems. In the last game, combat felt like an afterthought, but there is more of it this time as missions bring you into conflict with both BTs and other humans, and it is supported by typically slick mechanics that make launching a grenade or snapping a neck feel equally gratifying. You can fabricate tools to take with you – ladders and climbing ropes for mountainous routes, assault rifles and grenades when a fight is likely. The pleasure is as much in the preparation as it is in the action; it feels good to impose some order on an otherwise chaotic and unknowable world. That’s probably why we all baked so much banana bread during lockdown.Kojima had a draft for Death Stranding 2’s story before the Covid-19 pandemic, but rewrote it from scratch after being locked down along with the rest of the world. You don’t have to look too hard to see the influences – a population that is too scared to go outside, governments that promise to save you by putting an end to travel and physical contact, the profound loneliness of Sam’s job as a porter travelling solo across barren landscapes.Fittingly, you can interact with other players, but only at a distance, sharing equipment, building structures and leaving holographic signs and likes for other players in their own games. This ends up being a biting piece of lockdown satire – as time goes by the world becomes clogged up with flickering icons, and as more structures appear you are confronted by constant “like” symbols. It feels like the mind-numbing attention spam of social media, and there’s no way this is an accident.The first game had the advantage of surprise. Death Stranding 2 does not. Much of what is good – and what is tedious – about this game was also true of the last, but at the same time it has refined each bizarre element. Combat feels punchier, the world map more hand-crafted, missions more varied. Asking you to do all of that schlepping about all over again in a whole new game should feel like a practical joke, but it is so mechanically rich and loaded with meaning, you just nod and don the backpack a second time.Of the many things Death Stranding 2 is trying to say, the message that comes to the fore is: you are never truly alone. Global disasters, big tech, even death itself – these things might abstract the way we connect to one another, but they can’t sever the connection altogether. Not bad for a game about delivering boxes.Death Stranding 2 is released on 26 June, £69.99/US$69.99/A$124.95Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5SonyreviewsShareReuse this content"

With a rollicking, sub-Game of Thrones epic based on a Liverpudlian legend. Will the happy couple go and see it?Brian LoganMon 23 Jun 2025 03.01 EDTShareThe benefits of hosting Eurovision are contested. But Liverpool has that song contest to thank, improbably enough, for wooing an exiled writer back to her native city. Helen Serafinowicz is the co-writer of BBC sitcomsMotherlandand, more recently,Amandaland. The world of TV, you might think, is at her feet – but instead she’s returning to Merseyside with a debut theatre show, a swords-and-sorcery pastiche about the relationship between Wayne and Coleen Rooney, rejoicing in the title The Legend of Rooney’s Ring.“I’ve started reconnecting with Liverpool recently,” says Serafinowicz, scouse accent unmistakable as she dishes up a cuppa at her home in Norwich. “And I was invited to the Eurovision song contest in the city a few years ago.” While there, she went to see her friend, the actor Keddy Sutton, in a Jonathan Harvey play calledA Thong for Europeat the Royal Court theatre. This was where teenage Helen used to watch heavy metal bands: elitist middle-class theatre the Royal Court is not. “It seems to have opened itself up to everyone.” And the play? “It was mad, but very funny. It showed that you can be very silly and true to Liverpool without taking the piss. That unlocked a lot of stuff for me. I began to think I might have some ideas.”It's a love story. I'm not making fun of themThe one she went with involved “a legend that exists in Liverpool of Wayne andColeen Rooneyhaving this massive argument in their car, and her chucking her very expensive engagement ring out of the window. The next day, everyone in town went out with their metal detectors, looking for it.” Local history? Urban myth? Or pretext for a sub-Game of Thrones summer panto with pop songs and a cameo for Donald Trump? “Coleen is a princess and her parents are queen and king, and Wayne is a warrior. They get together, they split up, she’s broken-hearted and he goes on a quest to find the ring and re-propose to her.” She pauses. “The theatre says they’ve never done anything like this before.”View image in fullscreen‘Some of their family go to that theatre and might come’ … the Rooneys at Aintree in 2012.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesIt is, she says, “a love story. I’m not making fun of them. There’s no Rebekah Vardy in it. I could have really gone for Wayne with some of the things that have stuck with him from previous news stories. But I don’t want to do that.” And as for Coleen: “She’s clever, she’s cool, she’s just a really interesting person.” She’s invited the Rooneys via their agent (no response so far) – and “I know that some of their family go to that theatre and might come.”Maybe that’s why the 51-year-old professes herself “a bit nervous” about the show. Or is it because the theatre, and writing by herself, are outside her comfort zone? The unglamorous-parenting comedy Motherland was co-written withSharon Horgan, Holly Walsh and Barunka O’Shaughnessy; so too its recent sequel Amandaland, about which Serafinowicz was “really not sure,” she recalls. “Because spin-offs don’t have a great record, do they? I was so surprised when we got those brilliant reviews.” Collaborating is tried and tested, then – but “being on my own is great too, to stick the blinkers on and delve into it”. And as for writing for the stage: “I just wanted to see if I could.”It’s like exposing yourself – like streaking at a football matchSo has she caught the theatre bug? “I would do, if the bug had a little bit of money attached to it!” Perhaps writing a local show for local people in Merseyside wasn’t the shrewdest way to capitalise on TV success. But it’s still pinch-yourself territory for a woman whose primary professional concern until recently was selling vintage furniture. “I had a shop here in Norwich. It’s what Hygge Tygge in Motherland was based on. I bought a lorry-load of mid-century German furniture from this guy selling it at £30 a piece. But the day I signed the lease on my shop was the day Motherland got the nod from the BBC. So I used it as an office. Customers would disturb me while I was on Zoom. It was a strange situation.”Back then, the most famous sitcom writer in Serafinowicz’s family was her then-husbandGraham Linehan (The IT Crowd; Father Ted), from whom she has since separated. Her brother, meanwhile, is actor, comedian – and host of Netflix’s recent Million Dollar Secret –Peter Serafinowicz. But now it’s Helen who’s hot telly property. “I’m in a really good position,” she admits. “People will look at my stuff. There are a million things I want to do, and not enough time to do them.”But first, Rooney’s ring. Might it be, in Eurovision parlance, her Waterloo? “I had a dream that I won a Tony award for the script. Oh, God!,” she groans, tea cups drained. “It’s like exposing yourself, like streaking at a football match. This is just what has come out of my head. I’m really interested – no, not interested, terrified – to see how it goes.”The Legend of Rooney’s Ring is at theRoyal Court Liverpool, from 18 July to 23 AugustExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Wayne RooneyColeen RooneyLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was a far cry from Twinkle the snarky dinner lady from Victoria Wood’s sitcom Dinnerladies, but not the first time she portrayed a real-life person. She played Myra Hindley in the 2006 ITV drama See No Evil: The Moors Murders, and the titular 19th-century Yorkshire lesbian landowner in the 2010 BBC period drama The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister.Peake has done a ton more TV: she played Veronica Ball in Channel 4’s Shameless, Martha Costello in BBC One legal drama Silk, and Grace Middleton in BBC One drama series The Village. She’s in that really weird (even for Black Mirror) black and white episode about the robotic dogs. She wrote and starred in a BBC Radio 4 play about Anne Scargill, who was married to Arthur. She used to play rugby for Wigan Ladies. And she pulled on a pair of hoseto play Hamlet.Back on the big screen, the Bolton-born Peake was the lead in2017’s Funny Cow, where her performance as a northern 70s stand-up was described as “magnificent” by Mark Kermode in the Observer. She’s inMike Leigh’s historical drama Peterlooas radical working class mother Nellie, and plays Samuel Beckett’s bit on the sidein 2023 biopic Dance First.Now, in Words of War, she takes on the role of journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya, who was murdered in Russia in 2006.In this very publicationPeake described her as “a woman with immense courage and integrity who, despite numerous threats to her life, continued to be a blazing beacon of truth in a time and place where speaking truth was extremely dangerous”.

It was the first time I had been on that hallowed ground.”Nearly three decades on, the film director and producer is a co-owner of the studios and is about to raise the curtain on its biggest revamp in 80 years.Thompson has something of an obsession with the west London site, which was founded in 1902, and is the world’s oldest continuously working studio facility for film production. Three years after Beckham’s dip, he jumped at the chance to formpart of a consortium to buy the storied complexfor a reported £10m.View image in fullscreenEaling may lack the scale of Pinewood and Shepperton, but benefits from good links to Heathrow and central London.Photograph: Stan Pritchard/AlamyBetween the late 1930s and mid-50s, the studio produced famous Ealing comedies such as the Lavender Hill Mob, and postwar hits includingThe Ladykillers and Kind Hearts and Coronets.Under subsequent BBC ownership, classics including Porridge, Monty Python and Doctor Who were shot there.But by 2000, when Thompson took over in concert with the Manhattan Loft Corporation, the property group behind the Chiltern Firehouse and St Pancras Renaissance hotel, the ageing studios were struggling to compete against modern rivals.View image in fullscreenValerie Hobson in the 1949 Ealing film Kind Hearts and Coronets.Photograph: 11/Ealing Studios/Studiocanal/Allstar“I grew up with the Ealing movies, it was a fabulous fantasy to own the studio,” he says. “Then one thing after another happened and suddenly we owned it. The place was charming but somewhat dilapidated. It needed to be modernised and brought into the 21st century. No one had spent any money on it since the war.”Since then, Thompson has managed several phases of development, and productions including Downton Abbey, Darkest Hour and the Amy Winehouse biopic Back to Black have shot there. But to complete his dream revamp he needed more investment.In 2022, the US private equity firm Starwood Capital took a majority stake in the studios for £48.5m – and a £20m expansion plan was subsequently announced.View image in fullscreenIdris Elba in the BBC drama Luther, which was shot at Ealing.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBCLater this month, Thompson will receive the official handover from the construction team, a moment that will mark the realisation of a quarter-of-a-century labour of love.“When we brought it [Ealing], what we dreamed of doing was to make a studio that had all this history, the old stages built in the 1930s and the heritage since 1902, but also have the most modern facilities,” he says. “It needed to be absolutely fit for the 21st century. And I think that is what we are completing this month.”With the overhaul, the studio has added a new 1,300 sq metre (14,000 sq ft) stage, increasing the overall amount of sound stage space by 60% to 3,437 sq metres, as well as new production offices.View image in fullscreenDarkest Hour is one of the many film and TV productions to have been shot at Ealing.Photograph: Working Title Films/AllstarNestled in the back streets of the westLondonsuburb, it lacks the scale of its out-of-town rivals including Pinewood and Shepperton, but has the benefits of fast links to Heathrow airport and central London.“The Elizabeth line has made an enormous difference,” says Thompson. “It takes 10 minutes to get to Bond Street and east London is just 25 minutes. We are so accessible, and if productions are looking at sustainability taking the tube rather than driving is such a do-able thing.”However, the official reopening comes against a vastly different TV and film production landscape than when Ealing closed its doors to outside productions.The 18-month construction project – officially Ealing was still running as it is also the home of MetFilm school, which kept its doors open – covered a period of immense change and upheaval.View image in fullscreenBlack Mirror.

The number of premium TV shows costing at least £1m an hour to makefell from 248 to 191 in the same period.Overall, the UK market for film and high-end TV production shrank by £2bn between 2022 and 2024, although most of this was in the television sector.View image in fullscreenDownton Abbey was among the TV productions shot at Ealing.Photograph: Rory Mulvey/© 2025 FOCUS FEATURES LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.“In terms of timing we were fortunate to have chosen to be closed during the strikes,” says Thompson. “I think the strikes brought on a day of reckoning. The streamers had come in and a lot of shows were being made for too much money. The strikes and subsequent slowdown have caused problems for the whole industry.”The figures from the BFI showed that last year was better than 2023, but Thompson believes the market will not return to the peaks of recent years. As for Ealing, he says the studio is booked up until at least the middle of next year.“It is levelling out, production is picking up but I don’t think it will go back to the same levels as before,” he says. “There is enough demand but there isn’t that streamer hysteria we had before, I don’t think [as many] budgets will be at the same level as before.”View image in fullscreenThompson welcomes the enhanced tax break for films costing up to £15m to support a sector that produced lower-budget hits such as The Full Monty.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarLast year, the government announced anenhanced tax creditfor independent film productions costing up to £15m, to support a sector that has produced lower-budget movies such as The King’s Speech, The Full Monty and Slumdog Millionaire.Thompson welcomed the move, saying: “I have spent most of my life making very British films and it is getting harder and harder to finance them. The tax break will help fill that gap.”Ealing Studios reported a £2m pre-tax loss in its most recent public accounts for 2023, with rental income of £3m. This followed a £3.3m loss in 2022, when rental income was £5.6m.View image in fullscreenRenée Zellweger in Bridget Jones’s Diaries, which was filmed at Ealing Studios, came out a year after Barnaby Thompson and a consortium bought the site.Photograph: PF1/Working Title/AllstarIn the pre-Covid years of 2019 and 2018, the studio complex generated about £5m in rental income and made under £1m in annual profits.Thompson, who is shooting a four-part thriller for Amazon in the south of France, says he feels lucky to have been able to continue the Ealing Studios story for the next generation.“I’m very proud of it and all we have done there,” the 65-year-old says. “It has obviously been my life for 25 years. But I’m a film-maker first and guardian of the studio second. It is an amazing place, so much a part of the British heritage and character that it would be foolish to think it ever really belonged to me.”This article was amended on 23 June 2025.

She takes in the enormous raggedy hide and the strangeness of the wild creature stomping through her streets. Up ahead, a giraffe peeks warily through a first-floor window as a zebra skitters backwards from a growling dog. “Kudu, washa!” The instruction comes through my radio. We turn away from the child and hurl our hefty creature forwards. The crowd scatters. We thunder through the narrow alleys to catch up with the rest ofThe Herds.In 2021,Little Amal, the puppet of a refugee child almost 4m tall, walked from the Syria-Turkey border to the UK. The Herds, from the same team, is even more ambitious. This new theatrical mega-marathon is shepherding a pack of life-size animal puppets a distance of 20,000km, from the Congo Basin to the Arctic Circle. More than 1,000 people will take part in creating the odyssey and, as the animals march into Marseille, I become one of them – as a volunteer puppeteer – for a galvanising (if sweaty) week.The rich societies are not immune. Hunger is comingThe idea for The Herds was sparked when Little Amal reached southern Italy. Artistic directorAmir Nizar Zuabibegan to hear stories from climate refugees who had come to see the little girl walk. “They had left their countries because of droughts and failing crops,” Zuabi explains. “As a Palestinian, it felt familiar: the world has collapsed on me and now I need to leave.” The climate crisis is predicted to create1.2 billion refugeesby 2050. “It unites us,” Zuabi says. “The rich societies are not immune. Hunger is coming.” With the movement of animals often proving a warning sign to the rest of us, The Herds disturbs our easy indifference, forcing us to pay attention.View image in fullscreen‘My arms start to quake’ … Kate Wyver in Arles, France.Photograph: Danielle Hassanali“Lots of this hasn’t been done before,” says line producer Annika Bromberg as we puff up a hill to my first rehearsal, “so it has to be invented.” The team sprawls across continents, with producers including former artistic director of the Young VicDavid Lan, and executive producer Sarah Loader, who spends her days quenching one logistical fire after another. They work alongside local producers at each stop. While Little Amal was animated by professionals, the puppets in The Herds are animated, in large part, by volunteers like me. In each city, up to 100 participants train and perform over the course of a week.When I arrive at the rehearsal, the animals are scattered sleepily across a sports hall: minuscule vervet monkeys, bulky gorillas and elegant zebras. Made from recyclable materials, there are wooden hooves, ragged cardboard mimicking the rough texture of pelts, and iron structures inside the biggest beasts. My group of 40 are in the expert hands of the South African puppet-building collective Ukwanda, who made these complex, delicate creatures. “Breathing is the language of puppetry,” says puppet designerSiphokazi Mpofu, as she gently tends to a gazelle. “The animals have to smell, they have to graze.” Her gazelle snuffles at the floor so realistically it wouldn’t be surprising to see it gambol off on its own.I am in a trio with Bastien Bangil, a comedian, and Virgile Lancien, a student. They have been learning how to manoeuvre the kudu, a towering African antelope that is the heaviest animal in the room after the giraffe (the elephant is so weighty it rarely comes out in rehearsal). I am assigned the head, holding it above my own until my arms start to quake and fingers blister. Making these creatures seem real and alive is hard, grubby and surprisingly moving work. “You have all these humans contorting themselves,” puppetry director Craig Leo says as he fixes the hind leg of a lion, “to present these fragile creatures to the world.”If an animal breaks it is taken to hospital – it’s not just a puppet, it’s a lifeWhen a puppet gets broken, the team, referred to as doctors, speak of it as an injury and mend it in their hospital. One day when we step out of our kudu, his head falls off and a stick flies out of his thigh. “I’ll be gentle,” says Ukwanda’s Sipho Ngxola, wielding a drill. “It’s not just a puppet,” says technical director Muaz AlJubeh, explaining the level of care they take. “It’s a life.”As The Herds moves across borders, new animals will be added, with puppet-making workshops formed along the route, from Stockholm to Wigan. By the time the production reaches the UK, where it will rampage through London and kick off theManchester international festival, the pack of puppets will be 100-strong.Alongside the volunteers, the troupe includes 42 young artists from 19 countries. Known as E-Co (Emerging Company), they have been recruited to hold the production together, and are travelling, learning, performing and helping Ukwanda teach participants across the European leg of the journey. Ochai Ogaba, a Nigerian choreographer who guides our herd’s other kudu with enviable ease, is one of them. “I come from a place where climate change is not talked about,” he says. “Being a part of this project has unlocked my responsibility to look after this world.”When the rest of us are steady on our hooves, the Ukwanda puppeteers teach us a few words in the South African language Xhosa. These become the instructions we follow while performing, fed through headsets: when to stop, go, be alert, retreat, turn. And the most exciting, “washa”, meaning to act with fire: to gallop. When we run together, it feels like a stampede.In each city, the animals trample alongside local artists. These beautiful beasts have kicked up swirls of dust in Dakar and stamped with flamenco dancers in San Fernando (in the Spanish province of Cádiz); Ogaba’s company danced in tandem with the animals in Lagos. Our first performance is in Arles, where we appear with local aerial artistsGratte Ciel, the air fizzing with pyrotechnics and dry ice. Everything moves at such speed in this production that we are frequently navigating on trust alone, awaiting Zuabi’s next instructions. “Get ready to sweat,” he warns.Suddenly the quiet roads are packed with people, elbows and cameras jostling to the front. Where the response to Amal was one of continual welcome, The Herds creates a buzz of uncertainty. Peel back the beauty and awe and there is a sense of wrongness at having these wild animals walled in on urban roads. Ogaba’s kudu leads the pack. We nuzzle through the crowd to drink from the historical centre’s fountain, Zuabi reminding us to keep our animals agitated and afraid in this unfamiliar environment.View image in fullscreenMane event … a lion in San Fernando, Cadíz, Spain.Photograph: Tony-san/Ayuntamiento de San FernandoThe Ukwanda team stay close throughout, on hand for any injuries (puppet or human). Our walk finishes by the river, where Gratte Ciel’s topless artists stand on swaypoles, red skirts sweeping in the wind. To a soaring soundtrack, they start to bend, the giraffe’s neck tilting upwards towards these strange creatures moving in the sky. Knackered, our kudu limps to the finish line. Bangil and Lancien emerge from its wooden body with matching exhausted grins. “Tomorrow,” Bangil jokes, “the elephant?”Catching our breath, we have a moment to watch the end of the show. The aerial performers’ movements become more violent, their bodies now swaddled in flowing plastic sheets that swim through the air like clouds. The animals lower themselves to the ground. “Nothing dies like a puppet,” Leo told us in rehearsal. “You know that when the curtain closes, it won’t get up and walk off. But it also always holds the potential of life.” The remaining puppeteers abandon their creatures in the street and walk away to rapturous applause.“This won’t stop the climate crisis,” says Zuabi before the next day’s event. “It is not trying to be successful. It is asking: how do you fail responsibly? We need to rewild nature, but we also need to rewild our imagination, rewild our political systems.” By placing these animals on our doorsteps, made internationally and held by local hands, The Herds makes all of this belong to us: the beauty of nature, the potential of life, the choice to take action or continue to look away.The Herdsis in London 27–29 June, and across Greater Manchester 3-5 July, as part ofManchester international festival. Itsglobal journeycontinues until August.

Aged 80 and suffering from lung cancer, Sutcliffe was given six months to live in January.Adam, Sutcliffe’s son, is enthusiastic. “I don’t think a pearl is possible but if mum’s ashes are made into anartificial reef, I’ll be able to dive to it,” he said. “Given how I feel when I dive - serene, calm and meditative - a reef is the perfect environment to remember mum.”Until recently, wanting an environmental funeral was a radical concept. Now, it’s increasingly mainstream: a recent report by the National Funeral Directors Association found over 60% of families said they would be interested in investigating green funeral options - up from 56% in 2021.Even local councils are responding: the Association for Public Service Excellence recently found that over 61% of councils across the UK already provide natural or woodland burial grounds, or plan to do so in the near future - up from 44% in 2018.There are now an almost bewildering number of options available for those who want their death celebrated in a sustainable way.Some are still under development, such as decomposers that turn the body into fertile soil, fungi bodysuits that decompose the body, and egg-shaped pods in which corpses are curled and a tree planted on top.View image in fullscreenArtifical reefs made of human remains are a sustainable alternative to land-based burials.Photograph: Resting ReefOther methods are already available in other countries: resomation - a chemical process of alkaline hydrolysis, and human composting - which involves keeping a body in a controlled environment so that remains are broken down quicker than a burial.Other complex options, such as aquamation - which yields the same results as cremation by using pressurised water, is growing in popularity, as are biodegradable urns and tree pod burials - placing a deceased person’s ashes into a biodegradable pod, buried under a tree.The world’s first mushroom coffin - a ‘living coffin’ that helps to speed up the body’s decomposition and enrich the surrounding earth - is as close as afuneral homein south London.Traditional funerals are losing popularity for a range of reasons, among them, the growing awareness of the damage they do.According to the Green Burial Council, traditional burials in the United States use an estimated 4.3 million gallons of embalming fluid, 20 million board feet of hardwood (including rainforest wood), 17,000 tons of copper and bronze, and 1.6 million tons of concrete each year - all of which use vast amounts of energy to source, manufacture, process and transport. Over time, these toxins leach into the surrounding soil.Even when filtered, cremations are also damaging; their fumes emitting carbon dioxide and toxic, mercury-laden gasses.Then there’s the price: traditional funerals can cost upwards of £5,000. Green burials can cost as little as £700.The fall in religiosity is also a factor: while fewer than half Britons now believe in god, belief among those aged over 80 - like Sutcliffe - has fallen from 82% in 1981 to 59% in 2021.When people are freed to make their own funeral decisions, results are often exuberantly celebratory.View image in fullscreen‘I want to become a pearl when I die - or a reef,’ said Madeleine Sutcliffe.Photograph: Adam Sutcliffe“My mum had cancer for five years and kept saying that she wanted to go up in a firework,” said Caroline Murphy, of her mother, Jeanne. “I never even knew it was a thing but after she died, we discovered that it was.”Jeanne’s ashes were divided into five fireworks - four of which have already been exploded in places significant to the family.Jeanne’s 14 year old granddaughter, Gabriella, loved it. “My grandmother always said she was going to watch over us and after seeing her explode in the night sky above us, I can believe that’s true,” she said. “Each time we let a firework off, it was really joyous and celebratory. It suited her character perfectly.”But with choice, comes risk: adverts for two funeral providers were banned a few years ago after they misleadingly implied their MDF coffins were more eco-friendly than other options.Then last year, the Green Burial Council had to review their own processes after removing certification from a company called Ovum Fungi.“Their pods initially met our certification criteria but their messaging made additional claims that were not consistent with our mission,” said Christopher Doggett. Ovum Fungi have not responded to calls from the Guardian.Rosie Inman-Cookfrom The Natural Death Centre is conflicted by the rise in natural burial grounds in the UK: “There are now over 300 in the country but only 70 that we certify,” she said.“There are real cowboys out there,” she warned. “We get far too many calls from families whose loved ones have been buried in the wrong grave, or their coffins improperly placed in the ground, or a space in the family plot filled with the coffin of a stranger.”The Law Commission is currently consulting on alternatives to established funerary methods. But in the absence of regulation, experts are concerned that families are being exploited.“There is a lot of opportunity here forgreenwashingby those, some perhaps with the best of intentions, who haven’t done the right research,” said Oliver Towner, a member of the SAIF National Executive, the group supporting independent funeral directors.Towner points to the woven coffins that many funeral directors market as being a sustainable alternative to a wooden coffin. “A lot of them are made in China and shipped to the UK. Are they still a more sustainable product than other options? The data at the moment just doesn’t exist.”Towner also points out how important it is to take wider facts into account when judging what option is most sustainable. “The carbon footprint of a cremation will obviously be more than a natural burial, but you’re more likely to live closer to a crematorium than a natural burial ground and you’re likely to scatter the ashes closer to home,” he said.Towner warns, however, that any interrogation of environmental claims has to cast its net even more widely. “When looking at aquamation, for example, we need to factor in the the Environmental Agency’s recent warning that London could run out of water in the next 25 years,” he said. “If we start to rely on water cremation, what happens if London runs out of water in London?”Explore more on these topicsDeath and dyingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, at 61, she’s a successful artist showing her work in publicPaula CocozzaMon 23 Jun 2025 01.55 EDTShareFor many months after skin cancer surgery, Linda Pitcher couldn’t leave the house. She avoided answering the front door, and if she had to go into her local village, she wore a hat and pulled it low. Now, at 61, she is taking part in her first major ceramics exhibition, at London’sNew Designersnext month, where she will look visitors in the eye. “It’s nerve-racking. But I’m going,” she says.Pitcher has not only had to overcome cancer, but also post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) triggered by the surgery, which entailed removing a large part of her nose. When the bandages were unwound after her first skin graft, the nurse held up a full-length mirror. “I fainted. I was sitting down, but I fell to the right. Half my nose had gone. Then you’ve got to walk out to your life and see people. No, no,” she says. “There was no support. I was so self-conscious.”Desperate for a way out of depression, social anxiety and PTSD, Pitcher embarked on a course of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). With the therapist’s encouragement, she went to the supermarket in nearby Hereford. She managed a conversation at the counter. She made progress.“What do you miss?” her therapist asked.“Sketching on location,” Pitcher replied. She had struggled at school in Leicester,where she had taken A-levels in science. “I worked my back off and I still got bad grades, and I never forgave myself,” she says. In 2022, she was diagnosed with dyslexia, but as a child, “I just thought I was thick.”Instead, she had always gravitated to mark-making. After saying goodnight to her parents, she’d sneak out of bed and “start working with pastels”. As she got older, she’d “go into the city and draw” – in Leicester, where she lived, or Birmingham – “and capture people’s expressions”. Now, she sees that sketching was “a way of talking”.Pitcher had a succession of jobs – selling tickets in a bus station, graphic designer, print sales representative, administrator at a hospital. She married, had two children and, over the decades, she continued to sketch.At 58, she embarked on a degree in contemporary design craftsat Hereford College of Arts. She had taken A-level art at night school in her 30s. (“I took a bottle of wine in, had a drink and just painted. Got an A grade for that,” she says.) She started her degree certain that she was going to become a printer. Instead, “I walked out going, ‘There’s something about ceramics, the feel, the process. The fight with that material.’“I could see a path ahead which I never – never, never – thought I would attain. And I got a degree! This person who thought they were so thick.”Her approach to ceramicsentails drawing on to bisque vessels– white, blank, after a first firing – on location.View image in fullscreenLinda Pitcher with a collection of her pottery.Photograph: Joann Randles/The GuardianShe loves porcelain – “the hardest medium”. It’s “like throwing cream cheese. It knows your mood. You throw it on to the wheel and you can feel it as it’s centring, the trouble you’ve got. If you’re stressed, it will pick you up. It’s the chase I enjoy. Will it work, will it not work, will the sides collapse?”You keep going. Exactly the same every day. You pick your head up and goShe often knows how the porcelain feels. “It’s having the resilience – and I use that word – because when things go wrong when you’re throwing, you have to rethrow or the pots will stress-crack. It’s like me,” she says. “You keep going. Exactly the same every day. You lift your head up and go.”Her focus is on drawing on to the ceramic in a way that “people can see the drawing, but the vessel can have colour too. You don’t want your voice as a mark-maker to be hidden by colour.”These are the problems Pitcher works through, out on location, in Hereford, London or Bath, while strangers stop to chat.“People give their life stories. The attention deflects. You are no longer the focus. As you draw, you’re listening. You catch the speed of it,” she says. It all goes into or on to the pot. Each one contains so much.Pitcher still finds “every day a struggle”. But some things have changed. “Now, when I talk, I look at people. And I forget I’m doing it.” Completing her degree, working with porcelain – she won thegreat northern contemporary crafter award– has “given me worth, drive, motivation and confidence. It’s given me my life back.”New Designers is at the Business Design Centre inLondon, from 2to 12 JulyTell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60CeramicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They won’t go off easily and won’t mind being squashed in a bag.”She also recommends a much more durable water carrier than the one included in our guide. “The one you suggested won’t last longer than a season: you can’t take it apart and dry it out properly before putting it away, so it sits over winter with old water in it. TheColapz water carrieris excellent and well worth the money,” she said.Avoid the shower queuesView image in fullscreenThe Ortlieb water bag is great for hydration and can even be used as a travel shower.ReaderEllis Kaysuggests taking acollapsible water bucket, a bar of soap and a cloth. “It’s a great way to keep clean while avoiding shower queues and environmentally problematic wet wipes,” she told us.

Cream cheese. In a fit of inspiration (I was thinking aboutrugelachat the time), I replaced almost all the butter with it to great success. These scones are a hit with children, too: my three-year-old quite competently helped make them, from fetching rosemary from the garden to stamping out the dough and brushing on the egg wash. A nice kitchen activity for any resident children, even if your dog turns up for the cheese tax at the last stage.Mini parmesan, apple and rosemary sconesPrep15 minCook15 minMakes30 mini scones25g cold butter, cubed100g cold full-fat cream cheese100g parmesan, roughly broken300g plain flour,plus extra for dusting2 scant tsp baking powder1 tsp sea salt2 rosemary sprigs, needles stripped and finely chopped1 medium-sized apple, grated1egg50ml milkFor the topping1egg, beaten50g parmesan, finely gratedA few small rosemarysprigs(optional)To serveCold salted butter or BoursinHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Tip the cubed butter, cream cheese, parmesan, flour, baking powder, salt and rosemary into a food processor, and blitz until sandy. In a bowl, combine the apple, egg and milk, then pour into the butter mix and blitz briefly, just until everything comes together into a dough.Tip out on to a floured surface, and then pat down until even and 2cm-thick (you can use a rolling pin, but this is such a malleable dough that just your hands will work fine). Use a mini round cutter to stamp out circles, and transfer these to a lined baking sheet. Bring together the offcuts, pat back down and cut out more circles until you’ve used up all the dough (I got 30 mini scones in total).Brush each scone with beaten egg, top with a scattering of parmesan and a tiny sprig of rosemary, if you wish, then bake for 15 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through. (If you used a larger cutter, check on the scones after 18 minutes.)Transfer to a wire rack to cool a little, then serve warm with cold salted butter, or at room temperature with butter or more cream cheese.Explore more on these topicsBakingQuick and easyFoodSnacksCheeseFruitBreadEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

Is that where you share a home with your partner, but you’ve become so emotionally estranged that you can feel your connectioneroding on a daily basis?No. Why?No reason. Carry on!It’s the opposite. Couples who live apart together remain a couple, but each has their own home.That doesn’t sound very romantic.Or maybe it’s the most romantic thing ever.How’s that?They’re constantly having it off, for one.Are they?Absolutely.A recent studyin the journal Andrology tracked 5,000 men to see how often they had sex. It found that men who lived with a partner managed it once or twice a month on average. Those living apart? Three to seven times a month.And why is this?It might have something to do with the data. The study included several young men in relationships who hadn’t moved in with their partnersyet.Ah, so before the deadening familiarity of their partnersdestroyed their libido for good.Listen, is everything OK?Perfectly fine! Carry on!Anyway, it isn’t just that. Researchers suggested that it might be down to cohabiting men letting themselves go a bit physically. They get comfortable and sedentary, which negatively affects their sexual activity.So living apart will make me have more sex and look better?I’m not sure that’s the exact message, but living apart together is more common than you’d think. It’s estimated that one in 10 long-term couples do it.Well, it seems to work.But ask yourself this: does the possibility of having sex a few extra times a month justify the financial burden of owning and keeping two households instead of one?Yes, yes it does.I suppose it does keep the mystery alive. It takes work to remain sexually invested in someone who you have seen pick their toenails.There’s nothing sexier than not being told you’re loading the dishwasher wrong.Exactly. Maintain separate residences and you only get to see your partner when you want to see them. There are fewer compromises to make, so your love will remain more pure.Sounds like a no-brainer to me.Well, you’ll probably die young.Wait, what?The researchers noted that men who live apart together are at higher risk of heart attack and stroke, the reason being that they don’t have a woman around to remind them to take their pills every day and eat healthily.Do you ever get the sense that men might be their own worst enemies?Honestly, every single day.Do say:“Darling, let’s sell the house and buy two studio flats.”Don’t say:“He died doing what he loved: forgetting to take his blood thinners.”Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsPass notesSexCohabitationHomesPropertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m now 32. He has been diagnosed with cancer, which prompted a review of the family finances.We realised that he is the owner of the account, even though the bills are in my name, butThree says it can’t process a change of ownership.Its latest suggestion is to register my father as deceased so they can use their bereavement process to switch the contract to my name. It admits this would affect his credit file but says thatit would inform the credit reference agencies that he is still alive once the change of ownership had completed.I refuse to put my father through such a conversation.CF, LondonIncredible but true: Three seemingly wants to “kill off” a sick customer in order to name his daughter as the primary account holder for her own mobile phone.Change of ownership is a standard process offered by most telecoms providers. Without ownership, customers can’t cancel contracts or make other critical decisions. Three, in its responses to customers on its community forum who were in the same situation as you, has claimed that a system update two years ago meant it was unable to do this.It initially suggested to you that you take out a new contract with a new number, which suggested it has zero understanding of the significance of a lifelong phone number. It then advised you to wait until your father dies, since its bereavement team has miraculous powers denied to the rest of customer services and can do the deed.When you rejected these unpalatable options and complained to the chief executive’s office, it came up with its brainwave. You can tell from the tone of the email that it really thought this was compassion in action. The bereavement team, it proposed, would call your father with you present and, if he consented to be declared dead, it would complete the transfer process used for deceased customers.It would, it continued blithely, have to report your father as deceased to all the credit reference agencies, but it would later correct this on his credit file, although it would be unable to circumvent a marker on his record. “I really hope this will work for you,” the letter ended brightly.The insensitivity of Three’s proposal is breathtaking and the legal and financial ramifications potentially serious. I asked the credit reference agency Experian what the effect would be. Potentially serious, came the answer. “Firstly, it would likely cause problems with future applications because lenders will see the deceased marker, and it will usually lead to the application being refused,” said its consumer expert John Webb. “Secondly, if existing lenders check someone’s credit report, it could result in them closing the account completely.”At this point, a remarkable thing happened. I contacted Three and it discovered that it could “easily” transfer your name after all. Not only that – it declared that it always did have such a process and blamed an agent “knowledge gap” for saying that it didn’t. Now, that’s a lot of agents who have gappy knowledge. First, the online community support team that advised community web users – including parents with now-adult children and those whose contracts were in the name of an ex-spouse – that the only option was to port the number to a different provider, then port it back again under a new contract. Then the call centre and web chat agents and the complaint escalations team who, for two months, insisted to you that there was no process.Three even informed the ombudsman – after you took your complaint to it – that the system did not allow for it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said it would review its processes in light of your experience.Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, told me that it did not require providers to offer a change of ownership service, but it would contact Three, as companies are required to give support and empathy to customers in vulnerable situations.You now own the contract and have been offered (via me – Three initially forgot to tell you) a paltry £75 in goodwill. You are incredulous after finding the impossible was suddenly possible.“They’ve suddenly prioritised fixing the change of ownership and tried to act like there’s nothing to see here,” you said. “This has been a horrible few years for my family, and this was a simple admin action that could have saved us extra grief.”We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

But in keeping with the theme for her spring/summer 2026 menswear collection shown in Milan on Sunday, there may be a change of tone.View image in fullscreenArmy-style epaulettes and shoulder patches with a fringed twist.Photograph: Alessandro Garofalo/ReutersThe show notes shared with journalists described the collection as representing “a shift of attitude – dismantling of meaning and dismantling power”.As the designer spoke about “the nastiness [in the world]”, her co-creative director, Raf Simons, said the pair “wanted to bring … something that makes you feel … positive and balanced”.The collection, displayed at the Deposito show space at Fondazione Prada, emphasised that point. Precision-pressed shirting with hand-drawn wave illustrations, khaki knitwear with fringed hems, utilitarian-grey tailoring paired with tiny matching shorts and striped tracksuits styled with thonged sandals mused individuality over conformity.Accessories including grey wash bags, backpacks with multiple pockets and compartments as well as white canvas plimsolls – items with sartorial origins in military survival gear – were countered with raffia cloche hats and a pastel palette that suggested escapism rather than restraint.View image in fullscreenA raffia cloche hat with a zip-up tracksuit-style top.Photograph: Luca Bruno/APView image in fullscreenKhaki shorts worn with sombre blues and greens.Photograph: Alessandro Garofalo/ReutersView image in fullscreenA military-style bag.Photograph: Luca Bruno/APView image in fullscreenPastels paired with leather.Photograph: Alessandro Garofalo/ReutersView image in fullscreenMuted tones and tiny shorts.Photograph: Alessandro Garofalo/ReutersThe buzzwords for this stripped-back collection included “limitless elemental compositions”, “nonconformist harmonies, new movements” and “impulse”. In reference to its simplicity, after the show Prada decried “useless, complicated ideas” and “a lot for the sake of doing a lot”, adding: “We did less –but doing less isn’t necessarily easier.”The catwalk setting emphasised the fine line between escapism and political statement. Models walked to an abstract soundscape, which started with birdsong and concluded with Elvis Presley’s 1969 hitIn the Ghetto, in a space that featured bare walls with retro, floral shagpile carpets, though it was usually adorned with chandeliers.View image in fullscreenSimple plimsolls on a shagpile carpet.Photograph: Alessandro Garofalo/Reuters“This is the first time the Fondazione is … completely bare, with all the daylight coming in,” said Simons. “I think we conceived it as a whole experience, not like a collection, a show space … more as a total feeling that we want to do.”As one of the world’s most influential and in-demand brands, the spotlight is always on Prada to set the next season’s trends, which it has done successfully for decades. That its recent menswear shows have taken place during pivotal political moments this year has again put Prada in the hotseat to respond.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I mean, I still do – I’m the sort of person who glides mindlessly through security only to be swiftly apprehended (“Er, madam, why is there a litre of water and four bottles of sun cream in your bag?”). But I find them a little less stressful these days. I put it down to the fact that I mostly travel alone. I can arrive as early or as late as I want, drink as many overpriced coffees as I fancy and not go into total unadulterated panic mode when I grossly underestimate the distance to the gate. Because this is my holiday – and my holiday only!Travelling solo is a pleasure, a tonic, and occasionally a character-building experience (more on that later …). I started doing it by accident. I was 29 when a friend couldn’t make a trip to Paris at the last minute. I went anyway, and also decided to make my life 500% harder by only speaking French, which I hadn’t done since I’d left university several years earlier. Having this goal also distracted me from the fact that I was visiting museums, galleries and restaurants alone, something that can seem almost taboo in a world set up for couples, pairs and groups.View image in fullscreenA snap from Hannah’s solo trip to Marseille.Photograph: Hannah J DaviesLuckily, people definitely care less in Europe. I have floated around bars by myself in Barcelona; sampled the best Korean food for onethat Toulouse had to offer; gone to the beach solo in Marseille; and almost caused security incidents on various European trains by trailing an illegally large suitcase behind me.Over the past few years, it has become my thing. The people I used to go on holiday with were getting married, having kids or moving away. I didn’t want to wait for anyone to be free, so I started booking more solo jaunts, figuring that long-term financial stability was overrated anyway, and maybe a little incompatible with the freelance life I had chosen. It felt like a good mix of joyful and nihilistic.I didn’t want to wait for anyone to be free, so I started booking more solo jauntsThere are challenges, of course, like the time that I had a heinous bout of food poisoning in Montreal, and found myself alternating between throwing up and sobbing (the French did at least help with the cleanup operation). But, travelling by myself is ultimately very freeing. I get to decide my timetable (read: start my days after noon), or maybe even extend my trip.If I fancy some social time I might book into an art class or go to a language exchange (usually free, if you buy a drink at the bar it’s hosted in). But other than that, I quite like drifting – and starting one of the many books I carry around at home but never read.I love a group trip, but travelling solo makes me pause, think, and stop nattering for a minute.

Sitting by the Baltic Sea, toes in the water, I gaze at distant, tree-covered islands as gentle waves lap over the long, flat rocks. I follow a rough, winding path back to my cabin, through woods so quiet you can hear the pine needles fall.I’m in Santalahti woods, near Kotka on the south-east coast of Finland, on the trail of Finnish author, novelist, painter and illustratorTove Jansson(1914-2001). Best known as creator of the Moomins, and for her love of island living, Jansson also wrote for adults. Last year, her first novel,The Summer Book, was made into a film starring Glenn Close and directed by Charlie McDowell. One film critic has described it as “an ode to Finnish archipelago nature”.View image in fullscreenThe Summer Book is a series of 22 vignettes on island summer living, featuring a young girl, Sophia, and her grandmother. I first read the slim volume in the early days of the Covid lockdown.During that uncertain, fearful time, and every year since, reading it has been a balm, a reminder to slow down and pay attention. I’ve come to Finland to explore Finnish summer living, fill my lungs with archipelago air and try to find a little of the stillness and wonder that Jansson’s writing gives me.View image in fullscreenTove Jansson pictured in 1956.Photograph: Ian Dagnall Computing/AlamyIn Finland, summer is to be savoured. The south of the country receives just six hours of daylight a day in winter, and in the far north the sun remains below the horizon in December. It’s this darkness that makes Finns revere and celebrate summer. Schoolchildren get a 10-week summer holiday, and most Finns take July off work. Summer is mostly spent in one of the half a million summer cottages, known asmökki,usually by a lake or on one of the tens of thousands of islands scattered along the coastline.Amenities vary, but there’s a deep affection for traditional rustic cabins: off-grid, without electricity or running water, and definitely no wifi. Cottage living, ormökkielämä, is focused on slow living in harmony with nature: time in the woods, in the sea, picking berries, and relaxing in the sauna.I begin my journey on Pellinki, in the Porvoo archipelago, about an hour east of Helsinki. This part of Finland is bilingual. (Like 80% of Pellinki residents,Tove Janssonwas a Swedish speaker; in Swedish the island is called Pellinge). It’s a quick hop across the water on a free ferry into a different, slower pace of life. Through the woods I spy dozens of cute red and yellow painted cabins, each by a stretch of water.Tove spent many childhood summers on Pellinki, and she drew her first Moomin cartoon here – on the wall of an outhouse – as a teenager. To generate extra income, island families would rent their homes for the summer, moving into an outbuilding. Tove’s family rented the home of the boat-building Gustafsson family. Abbe Gustafsson, the same age as Tove, became a lifelong friend and the children turned their daily chore of milk collection into an elaborate challenge: there were trees to be navigated in one direction, streams to jump over and “evil” cracked rocks to sprint past.View image in fullscreenThe forested islands of Pellinki (Pellinge)This childhood game was the inspiration for The Book about Moomin, Mymble and Little My, which has been adapted into the puzzle-solving outdoorIsland Riddlestrail. Clues are in rhyme, and I try a few, filtering water to make the next clue rise to the surface in a small well, and hunting for a red umbrella in the trees. “You just have to play like a child and use your imagination,” Erika Englund, a local who devised the trail, tells me.From the woods you can see the small island of Bredskär, where the Jansson family built a house in 1947. Craving further solitude, Tove built a cabin on the even tinier island of Klovharun in 1964, where she spent 28 summers with her life partner, graphic artist Tuulikki Pietilä. The couple lived a very simple life here, with the island, each other, and their vast imaginations for company.Tove built a cabin on the tiny island of Klovharun in 1964, where she spent 28 summers with her partner, Tuulikki PietiläThe landscapes of Pellinki, Bredskär and Klovharun are easily recognisable throughout Tove’s work in all mediums. The sea and the weather play a central role: storms rage, belongings are lost and found in the sea, and life is lived with respect for the elements.Porvoo is the nearest town to Pellinki and a stopping point on the way to the archipelago. The old town is one of the best preserved in Finland, built after a catastrophic fire in 1760. I wander through the winding streets, admiring the colourful wooden homes and learning about the town’s history as a salt trading port, with Birgitta Palmqvist fromPorvoo Tours.View image in fullscreenPorvoo has one of the best preserved old towns in Finland.Photograph: Riekkinen/Getty ImagesI stay at the handsome art nouveau-styleRunohotel in the town centre. The building has been a bank and the town library, and now has 56 minimal, Finnish-style rooms, changing art displays and an award-winning breakfast.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sauna culture is essential to Finns: in 2020, Unesco recognised Finnish sauna culture as part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, and there are an estimated 3.3 million saunas in a country of 5.6 million people (though everyone I speak to gives a higher number). Even in the tiny cabin on Klovharun there was a sauna in the cellar (more important than running water). Kannonnokka sauna is kept at 60C for longer, laidback sessions, with dips in the cold plunge pool and gently warm whirlpool bath. Afterwards, the young couple who run the venue cook delicious pancakes over the fire.As a young artist, Tove painted murals for local buildings in towns along the Finnish coast. In Kotka, 50 miles east of Porvoo, a huge fairytale mural remains on show in the town’s youth work department. It’s a delight, with layers of stories, hidden Moomin characters and gemstone embellishments.The long daylight hours are perfect for happihyppely, a Finnish concept translated literally as “oxygen hopping”: taking a short walk for fresh air and exerciseIn Hamina, a neighbouring town, panoramic fantasy scenes decorate the walls of the town hall: mermaids flirt with cadets under water and shipwrecked treasure fills Hamina harbour. In Kotka, I visit Maritime Centre Vellamo, whereCourage, Freedom, Love! A Moomin Adventurelaunched this year (it runs until March 2027) to mark 80 years since the first Moomin book was published.Children can play inside a replica Moomin house, clamber on the rocks surrounded by an animated sea, and dress up in a little theatre. Also on display is Tove and Tuulikki’s boat, Victoria, built for the couple by Abbe Gustafsson.My voyage of good cheer around Finland – the world’s happiest countryRead moreFrom Kotka I catch a free ferry to Kaunissaari (90 minutes). The island’s name translates to “beautiful island” – fitting, given its pine forests, long white beaches and pretty marina. The harbour is a cluster of red wooden cottages with wildflower gardens, and boat sheds with spooled fishing nets outside. There’s a fascinating island museum, packed to the rafters with memorabilia from centuries of hardy island living. I follow winding paths through the trees to find a long, sandy beach, which I have all to myself. I can’t resist a swim – even without a sauna to plunge into. I warm up at Kaunissaaren Maja restaurant, where the simple salmon soup recipe has not changed in 70 years.View image in fullscreenThe cabin on the tiny island of Klovharun built by Jansson in 1964Near Kotka I stay in my own little summer cottage. The amenities are basic: a kitchen diner and one bedroom, but of course a sauna. I set it to heat then spend an hour walking through the woods and around the bay, watching the sunset. The long daylight hours are perfect forhappihyppely, a Finnish concept translated literally as “oxygen hopping”: taking a short walk for fresh air and exercise. Back at my cabin I jump between the heat of the sauna and dips in the icy Baltic Sea. I exhale, with the night, the light and the summer stretching out in front of me. I can see why Tove Jansson loved this coastline: all I need for a dreamy summer is right here.The trip was provided byVisit Finland.Runo Hotelin Porvoo has doubles from €171B&B.Self-catering cabins atSantalahti resortstart from €89(sleeptwo); sauna cottages from €198(sleeps up to four)Explore more on these topicsFinland holidaysEurope holidaysScandinavia holidaysCultural tripsThe MoominsTove JanssonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is “yes” the answer to this question?The answers to today’s problemsAlex BellosMon 23 Jun 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 12.14 EDTShareEarlier todayI set five logic problems. Here they are again with solutions.A questionable planetA certain planet is inhabited by two kinds of alien, Cricks and Goops. Both types of alien – who are physically identical – have a strange way of speaking. They only ask questions. Cricks can only ask questions whose answer is yes, while Goops can only ask questions whose answer is no.1. Could you meet a person inhabiting this planet who asks you “Am I a Goop?”SolutionNoIf the answer is ‘no’, then the person must be a Goop because only Goops ask such questions. But if the answer is ‘no’, they are stating they are not a Goop. There’s a contradiction so this situation is impossible.If the answer is ‘yes’, they are a Crick. But if the answer is ‘yes’, they are a Goop! This situation is also impossible.2. You meet two friends, Katja and Anja. Katja once asked Anja “Is at least one of us a Goop?” What are Katja and Anja?SolutionKatja is a Crick and Anja a Goop.Say the answer is ‘no’, then Katja is a Goop. But if it is not the case that at least one is a Goop, none are Goops, and there is a contradiction. So this is impossible.So the answer is ‘yes’, which means Katja is a Crick. And if one of them is a Goop, it must be Katja.3. You overhear a conversation between two people. One of them asks “Am I the kind that could ask you whether there is a wizard on this planet?”. What are the chances that there is a wizard on the planet?SolutionThere is a wizard on the planetIf the answer to this question is yes, then the questioner is a Crick and if they can ask whether there is a wizard on the planet, that means there is a wizard on the planet, as Cricks can only ask questions to which the answer is yes.If the answer to this question is no, then the questioner is a Goop. If they couldn’t ask you whether there is a wizard on the planet, this means there must be a wizard on the planet, as Goops can ask questions only if their answer would be no. As they can’t ask this one, the answer must be yes.Note: the question is of the form ‘Am I the kind that can ask you whether X’, and X is true whichever alien type asks it. This insight will be used in the next question.4. You later learn that there is exactly one wizard on this planet of Cricks and Goops. You would like to find out who that is. You meet an alien called Andrew. He asks you “Am I the kind that could ask whether I am not the wizard?” Do you have enough information to tell for sure who the wizard is by now?SolutionNoThe quertion is of the form ‘Am I the kind that can ask you whether X’. So we know X is true, that is, we know that Andrew isnotthe wizard. But we still dont know whoisthe wizard.5. A strange alien asks you “Am I the kind who could ask you the question I am now asking?” What can be said about her?SolutionShe is a CrickSuppose the answer is no. This would mean that the strange alien is a Goop. But it also means she can’t ask the question she is asking. Not only does this not make sense (as she is asking it...) but also this implies the answer to the question is yes, as she can’t ask it and she is a Goop, which is a direct contradiction.Now suppose the answer to the question is yes. Therefore she is a Crick and she can ask the question she is asking, so the answer to the question is yes. Everything checks out.Thanks toWe Solve Problemswho devised these puzzles.

Or maybe you’ve done it yourself before a job interview or big presentation. This is “power posing” – the idea that striking a bold posture can make you feel more confident and improve performance. But does it work?The concept took off in the early 2010s. “A few studies seemed to show if you expanded your body position, it would change your psychological state,” says Professor Ian Robertson of Trinity College Dublin and author ofHow Confidence Works. “Other studies showed that it could alter testosterone levels, boosting motivation.”But science has since cooled on the claims. “Subsequent meta-analyses haven’t confirmed this as a reliable effect,” Robertson explains.Still, something interesting has emerged from more robust studies. While there’s limited evidence that making yourself bigger directly boosts confidence, there is strong evidence that making yourself smaller can have the opposite effect. Slumping in your seat, hunching shoulders or folding into yourself can make you feel less bold.“If you sit at a meeting in a crouched or huddled position, making yourself small, it affects both your emotion and your performance. You’re less likely to persist through difficult problems. Your mood is lower and you feel less confident.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When we’re angry, we expand. When we’re fearful, we shrink. These physical responses are not just outward signs of emotion – they may also feed back into our brains, reinforcing the feelings themselves.Our emotional circuits and our physical expression circuits are tightly wired together, says Robertson.

And while nostalgia may have brought back some alcopops, the new wave of ready-to-drink (RTD) options look and taste noticeably different.It is not just the drinks that have changed, but drinking habits too, driven in part by more health-conscious consumers and demand for variety, according to Marten Lodewijks, the president of the drinks market analysts IWSR US.“A decade ago, hardseltzers, with less sugar and a lower ABV [alcohol by volume], appealed to a new, more health-conscious consumer that didn’t want quite as much sweetness. Lower calories also meant less flavour, however, and, as with any trend, a countertrend soon emerged,” he said.Companies responded with a “much wider range of ABVs, flavours, sweetness levels and even carbonation”.BuzzBallz, founded by a teacher and inspired by a snow globe, is among the newer arrivals tapping into that shift.View image in fullscreenBuzzBallz are one of the companies tapping in to shifting drinking habits.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThe instantly recognisable palm-sized spheres “climbed to become the number 18 RTD brand by volume in the UK”, Jess Scheerhorn, the vice-president at BuzzBallz, told the Drinks Business magazine, citing data from Circana, the US market research group.On a roll: the snowballing success of BuzzBallz pre-mix cocktailsRead moreThe growing popularity of RTD products reflects a shift towards more casual, convenient drinking, often outside traditional settings such as pubs, Alice Baker, a senior research analyst at Mintel, said.“Sales of RTDs have shot up from around £530m a decade ago to an estimated £970m in 2024,” she said, with many people buying them as “a money-saving alternative to cocktails in pubs and bars”.The drinks company Diageo is aiming to make its classic brands such as Smirnoff, Guinness and Captain Morgan relevant to gen Z drinkers, whom it suggests are wrongly perceived to be less interested in alcohol.Giles Hedger, its global consumer planning director, said: “A lot of people talk about gen Z being a cohort that is moving away from alcohol. Our data tells us otherwise. While they drink socially a little less frequently than other cohorts, they do so very enthusiastically.”In fact, “gen Z is super-committed to socialising”, he says, with alcohol a “very significant and enthusiastic part of that”.According to Diageo, whose data draws on 150 consumer experts around the world and reams of market research, gen Z do half their drinking in pubs and clubs and are fans of “three-hour-plus” occasions. They also “love spirits” and have a soft spot for cocktails.Diageo has revamped Smirnoff Ice amid runaway demand for pre-mixed drinks. The 00s alcopop has a new look and comes in a can, but according to the marketers it still has the “citrus flavour notes that people know and love”.Looks matter too – especially for a social media-savvy generation, Kiti Soininen, Mintel category director of UK food and drink research, said. “Our research shows that 73% of white spirits drinkers think that using visually appealing glassware makes drinking white spirits more enjoyable – which no doubt works in favour of BuzzBallz.”Explore more on these topicsAlcoholnewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve come on this “rat walk” with a few dozenNew Yorkers, all milling about awkwardly, subjecting ourselves to the kind of brainless small talk heard at speed dating events. But instead of looking for love, we’ve come to learn more about New York’s rodent population. Tonight, knowing thine enemy means we must slink among the rats.We’re led by Kathleen Corradi, the city’s famedrat czar, appointed by Mayor Eric Adams in 2023, and we are united by our visceral hatred of rats. We don’t want to see them scurry by on late-night walks home, or watch as they slink in and out of trash bags on the street. We especially don’t want them in our homes. As one exterminatorput itto the famed metro reporter Joseph Mitchell back in 1944: “If you get a few [rats] in your house, there are just two things you can do: you can wait for them to die, or you can burn your house down and start all over again.”An estimated 3 million rats live in New York – far less than the fabled “five rats for every person” urban legend, but enough to cause problems. While it’s unlikely you’ll catch the plague, rats can spread leptospirosis, with arecord 24 New Yorkerscoming down with the disease in 2023. Rats contaminate food, damage property and make a notoriously difficult city even harder to live in by ick factor alone.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Anadolu/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesBut game must recognize game. New Yorkers are nothing if not tenaciously, blindly in love with our city. Rats, despite humans’ determined efforts, refuse to leave it. A lowly transplant might wear a “New York or Nowhere” T-shirt today but move back to Ohio in a few years. Rodents have their claws sunk intoNew York, enmeshed in its lore. You have to give them that much.This begrudging acceptance – what Corradi calls “the fear and fascination” – powers New York’s Rat Pack, a club of “anti-rat activists” who attend three events including a rat walk for education on easing human-rat relations. And for free swag: people who complete the training receive a T-shirt or hat with the Rat Pack logo. (For a club that aims to defeat rats, they sure made their enemy lookcool as hell.)When I did my rat walk, I learned that I live in one of New York’s official Rat Mitigation Zones (shortened to the rather militaristic-sounding RMZ). To be fair, I didn’t need Corradi to tell me this. Rats are everywhere. They live in the walls between apartments. They chew through the electrical wiring on cars. At night, I often find myself stepping off the sidewalk to letthempass by first.Rats, who live communally, look out for each other. Humans haven’t really nailed this yetIn 2022 Jessica Tisch, then the sanitation commissioner, announced their status as public enemy. “The rats don’t run this city, we do,” she insisted during a press conference about a new garbage policy requiring landlords use bins with lids. It had taken New York, which was founded in 1624, 400 years to come to the realization that “putting lids on trash cans” deters rodents – an undeniable victory for the rats. Soon enough, residents received flyers depicting a cast-out rodent toting a suitcase telling us to “Send rats packing!” Somewondered: did they have to make the forlorn rat looksocute?In 2023, Corradi got a $3.5m budget to raise public awareness about rat mitigation. The city had long given up on any hope of totally eradicating them, and now prioritizes damage control. It has tried gassing rats bypumping their burrowswith carbon monoxide. One vigilante grouphunted them down with dogs. Last year, the city passed a law initiating rat birth control in the form of non-toxic pellets, winning the support of the notoriously hard-to-please animal rights group Peta, because it replaces rat poison.My rat walk took place on a chilly evening in April. As Corradi led us around the park, I learned rats only need one ounce of food a day to survive – a minuscule amount compared with the amount of trash on the streets. She urged us to remind our dog-owning friends that rats can survive off the undigested food in pup poop left on the sidewalks (a fun fact to bring up at dinner parties). She encouraged us to report bad actors such as landlords who flout codes intended to mitigate rodents.Corradi also pointed out telltale signs: you can see rats even when they’re not scampering around, from the holes they dig for shelter, to the discarded soda cans or potato chip bags they essentially recycle to cover their burrows, to the droppings they leave.The lesson: don’t get too comfortable.View image in fullscreenNew York’s mayor, Eric Adams, introduces Kathleen Corradi as the city’s first-ever ‘rat tsar’ on 12 April 2023.Photograph: Bobby Caina Calvan/APUltimately, Corradi said, we’re not so different from rats. Like us, they’re looking for a home in a crowded, often inhospitable city.Studieshave shown people who live near infested areas report greater psychological trauma, trouble sleeping and overall stress. All New Yorkers deal with rats, but the RMZs are historically lower-income areas, such as the Bronx’s Grand Concourse, Harlem, Chinatown, the East Village and Bed Stuy andBushwick. In 2016, researchers from Johns Hopkinsfoundthat people who live in low-income areas consider rat infestations as distressing as drug sales on the street and the threat of random violence. Recent spikes in rat sightings have also beentied to rapidly warming cities.The rat czar noted, with a bit of frustration, that the city’s leaders cannot curb this issue on their own; they rely on us to do our part. During this rousing kicker, a young man pointed toward the sky. We all looked up to see a hawk perched on a lamppost with something dangling from its mouth.Was it a rat?It sure looked like one. With that, we were dismissed from our walk, the hawk as our new rat prevention role model.A few weeks later, I pulled up to a community center for a “Rat Academy” session – part two of the Rat Pack curriculum. Ostensibly, it was a lecture, but the audience was mostly home or business owners there to complain about the rat problem. Some detailed specific-to-them anecdotes about careless neighbors or insufficient action following reports of rat activity to 311.New York has a huge rat problem. These vigilantes with dogs think they can fix itRead moreAgain, it was stressed that it takes a village. Know your neighbors, so you can speak honestly with the guy who isn’t putting his trash out correctly, or the woman down the street who doesn’t pick up after her dog. Rats, who live communally, band together for survival. They look out for each other. Humans haven’t really nailed this yet.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Anadolu/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesWhen we got to the topic of rat birth control, one woman raised her hand and asked, with a straight face, “Does it work on humans? Because birth control … that’s a hard thing to get these days.” (It does not.)What would New York be without rats? It’s a futile question: most experts believe that the war on rats is fundamentally un-winnable. We’ve been trying to kill these guys since the Middle Ages. To quote a 2022study, “there is no overarching solution” to the rat problem. We have to layer on all of our efforts – hi-tech trash cans (OK, just ones with lids), birth control, cleaning up dog poop – to manage the population, and even then we’ll still have rats.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Robert Mecea/APSo was the whole “the rats don’t run this city” thing wishful thinking? Not exactly. Scientists say we’reentering“a new golden age” of rat research that could push mitigation efforts into overdrive. As Kaylee Byers, assistant professor at Canada’s Simon Fraser University,toldNPR this year: “We need to not only understand the rat, but we actually also have to understand ourselves and our relationship to rats in order to move towards a healthier coexistence.”My final task, which would earn me a spot in the Rat Pack: volunteer service. For three hours on a Friday morning in Queens, I picked up trash and rehabbed trees, putting down new soil around their trunks. Fellow volunteer Alex, a freshly retired employment lawyer and Grateful Dead fan, told me he was a vegetarian and big animal lover. But when I asked him how he felt about rats, he shuddered. “Absolutely not,” he said. “I hate them all.”I had good news for Alex. According to new city data, rat sightings aredown18.4% this year in all boroughs, but especially my home in Brooklyn, which saw a 28.6% reduction.Still, any reports of the death of New York’s rat population would be premature. The rats who live on my block – and maybe yours, too – seem quite comfortable indeed."

Plus a letter fromSimon TweedMon 23 Jun 2025 12.04 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 21.31 EDTShareLouise Casey’s report (Grooming gangs in UK thrived in ‘culture of ignorance’, Casey report says, 16 June) makes good sense. Nevertheless, her recommendations, and those who must act on them, won’t prevent the exploitation and abuse of children in care. Inher appearanceat the home affairs select committee last week, she highlighted how the system had failed the children “missing” from care. As so often happens, the system ends up protecting the organisation rather than the child.If children’s home workers follow procedure and conduct a return-home interview with the child, they are deemed to have done their job. But in some good children’s homes, where workers are supported to be personally and collectively concerned for every child, they will worry; they will stay up all night; sometimes they go out searching for the child, putting themselves at considerable risk. They will do what a good parent would do. Filling forms and following procedures does not protect children.However, such good children’s homes are rare. Local and national governments are wary of the risks involved in such direct personal concern and commitment. The owners and directors of children’s homes will avoid challenging officialdom, thereby making it more difficult to encourage grownups to make the commitment that every child needs. By attempting to avoid risk and accountability, yet be seen to take action, politicians may make it less likely that children find relationships of direct personal concern in care homes.John BurtonAuthor,Leading Good Care: The Task,Heart and Art of Managing Social CareThe limitations of the data regarding perpetrators of child sexual exploitation are, understandably, highlighted once again (Public must ‘keep calm’ over ethnicity of grooming gang offenders, says Louise Casey, 17 June). But these limitations reflect wider concerns about the robustness of the data collected about child protection issues. As researchers have pointed out for years now, we simply do not collect data that can help us understand the contexts in which children experience harms and, crucially, monitor whether and how these harms are being affected by government policies.For example, whileour researchhighlights the links between poverty and a child’s chances of being subject to a child protection intervention, we were not able to establish this link using the data currently being gathered by the Department for Education. Well-informed discussions about the prevalence of child harms are long overdue and should not be restricted to gathering data on any one aspect of identity.Brigid FeatherstoneProfessor emerita, University of HuddersfieldI understand Zara Mohammed’s concern, but this is not about scapegoating the Pakistani community, it is about seeking to understand why groups of men saw fit to abuse young girls (Dear Yvette Cooper, let the Casey review lead to justice – not the scapegoating of British Pakistani culture, 17 June). It is essential to be honest in investigating whether cultural perceptions in some ethnic male groups mean that they are more predisposed to see young girls as acceptable targets. It is no different from asking if particular groups of young males have misogynistic views and investigating why that has come about. Only by being honest about the causes of abuse can we prevent it in the future.Simon TweedLuton, BedfordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

He is right that international students are propping up the UK’s universities, of whichmore than two-fifthswill be in deficit by the end of this academic year. But it is untrue that universities could simply spot AI cheating if they wanted to. Dr Reeves says that they should use AI detectors, but the studies that he quotes rebut this argument.The last study he cites (Perkins et al, 2024) shows that AI detectors were accurate in fewer than 40% of cases, and that this fell to just 22% of “adversarial” cases – when the use of AI was deliberately obscured. In other words, AI detectors failed to spot that AI had been used three‑quarters of the time.That is why it is wrong to say there is a simple solution to the generative AI problem. Some universities are pursuing academic misconduct cases with verve against students who use AI. But because AI leaves no trace, it is almost impossible to definitively show that a student used AI, unless they admit it.In the meantime, institutions are switching to “secure” assessments, such as the in-person exams he celebrates. Others are designing assessments assuming students will use AI. No one is saying universities have got everything right. But we shouldn’t assume conspiracy when confusion is the simpler explanation.Josh FreemanPolicy manager, Higher Education Policy Institute; author,Student Generative AI Survey 2025The use of AI to “write” things in higher education has prompted significant research and discussion in institutions, and the accurate reporting of that research is obviously important. Craig Reeves mentions three papers in support of theTurnitin AI checker, claiming that universities opted out of this function without testing it because of fears over false positive flagging of human-written texts as AI generated. One of those papers says: “The researchers conclude that the available detection tools are neither accurate nor reliable and have a main bias towards classifying the output as human-written rather than detecting AI-generated text” (Weber-Wulff et al); and a second found Turnitin to be the second worst of the seven AI detectors tested for flagging AI generated texts, with 84% undetected (Perkins et al). An AI detector can easily avoid false positives by not flagging any texts.We need to think carefully about how we are going to assess work, when at a click almost limitless superficially plausible text can be produced.Prof Paul JohnsonUniversity of ChesterIn an otherwise well thought out critique of the apparent (and possibly convenient) blind spot higher education has for the use of AI, Craig Reeves appears to be encouraging a return to traditional examinations as a means of rooting out the issue.While I sympathise (and believe strongly that something should be done), I hope that this return to older practices will not happen in a “one size fits all” manner. I have marked examinations for well over 30 years. During that period I have regularly been impressed by students’ understanding of a topic; I can remember only enjoying reading one examination essay. The others, no matter how good, read like paranoid streams of consciousness. A central transferable skill that degrees in the humanities offer is the ability to write well and cogently about any given topic after research. Examinations don’t – can’t – offer that.I would call for a move towards more analytical assessment, where students are faced with new material that must be considered in a brief period. I think that the move away from traditional essays as the sole form of assessment might help to lessen (not, of course, halt) the impact of external input. From experience, this focus also helps students move towards application of new understanding, rather than a passive digestion of ideas.Prof Robert McColl MillarChair in linguistics and Scottish language, University of AberdeenHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Hyper-tourism drives the loss of community infrastructure, yet there is continuing pressure to attract even higher numbers. This also has deleterious effects on wildlife, which is disappearing at an alarming rate.It must be acknowledged that part of the cause of such losses is unsustainable farming practices, but human disturbance plays a significant part; hardly anywhere here is off limits. It is a deep irony that a place considered wild and natural is actually anything but.Our report also discusses the dire state of housing, yet housing is vital to sustain viable communities. There are now almost14,000 Airbnb propertiesin the Lakes. In some communities all former council houses are second homes and local people – members of my family included – are priced out.How do we expect young people to stay and work here, or pensioners who cannot afford market rates to continue living in their home areas? Ironically, such inflated housing costs affect the very families that world heritage status seeks to preserve – the children of farming families, many of whom can no longer afford to buy in the places that their ancestors lived in for centuries. These are serious concerns and should not be underplayed.Dr Karen LloydKendal, CumbriaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We see the world through the same lens. We stand for the same values.”Canada won’t become the 51st US state – but could it join the EU?Read moreNot mentioned was another leader in the transatlantic space: Donald Trump, whose disrespect for old allies appears to have galvanised what was an already healthy EU-Canada relationship.The US president is expected at the two-day Nato summit in the Hague starting on Tuesday, when members of the transatlantic alliance are called to pledge to spend 5% of GDP on defence.Carney, a veteran central banker turned politician, wona stunning victory in Aprilpledging that Canada would not become the 51st US state, a proposal often floated by Trump.He said he had a mandate “to diversify and strengthen our international partnerships” and find new means of cooperation and coordination. The summit took place, Carney told reporters: “in a hinge moment of history, a world that is more dangerous and divided, a time where the rules-based international global order is under threat”.The EU-Canada security and defence partnership opens the door to increased Canadian participation inthe EU’s fledgling €150bn defence fund, known as Safe. Von der Leyen said the defence partnership meant working on joint capabilities, interoperability and joint procurement, referencing air defence. “The access of Canada to our joint procurement in the European Union, the door is open,” she said.The security pact is a Canadian version of the agreement the EUsigned with the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, last month. The bloc already had similar arrangements with six other countries including Norway and Japan, but this is the first with any country in the Americas. The defence pact includes joint work on cyber, maritime and space security, arms control and support for Ukraine.Countries that have a defence and security pact with the EU can take part in joint procurement of weapons funded by the €150bn (£128bn, $173bn) Safe programme, although must negotiate a further technical agreement. Von der Leyen pledged both sides would “swiftly launch talks” on Canadian access to the joint procurement scheme.Carney said the agreement with the EU would help Canada “deliver on our new capabilities more rapidly and more effectively”. Canada has been one of the laggards of the Nato alliance: in 2024 it spent just 1.37% of GDP on defence, well below the 2% set in 2014.The two sides have a €125bn trading relationship, underpinned by the Ceta pactsigned in 2016that abolished 98% of tariffs. The agreement, however, has yet to be ratified by national parliaments in 10 EU member states, includingBelgium, France, Italy and Poland, meaning elements of the deal have yet to enter into force.In advance of the meeting, Carney and his wife, Diana Fox Carney, visited Schoonselhof military cemetery in Antwerp, where 348 Canadians are buried. On social media, Carney wrote: “brave young soldiers who ventured across the Atlantic to defend the freedom of Europe”.The Carneys were accompanied by Belgium’s prime minister, formerly a long-serving Antwerp mayor, Bart De Wever, where they were given a tour of the ceremony and laid wreaths on behalf of Belgium and Canada. The last post was played by one of De Wever’s sons, according to local paper Het Nieuwsblad.Explore more on these topicsCanadaEuropean UnionTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsAmericasEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It was mere days after his graduation from Dater.Teachers and soccer teammates from Dater joined protests that gathered at the local jail where he was held until his transfer to anIce facilityin Louisiana. Then, on 18 June, the Trump administration deported Colindres to a country where he had not lived for about 11 years.Speaking to WCPO fromHondurason a video phone call on Saturday, Colindres said he was relieved to no longer be jailed. “You were in there 22 hours in the cell doing nothing,” Colindres said of his confinement. “That’s crazy – like, that’s all … mentally draining.”He argued that “a lot of people” on his ensuing deportation flight had no arrest records in the US, “like myself included”.Nonetheless, “the whole flight I was handcuffed like we’re some big criminals”, Colindres added.View image in fullscreenProtesters hold signs during a protest by supporters of Emerson Colindres in Hamilton, Ohio, on 8 June.Photograph: Megan Jelinger/ReutersColindres’s family came to the US with him without documentation in 2014, requesting asylum in connection with claims of being targeted by gang activity in Honduras.

But she was well into her career when the harsh realities of slavery hit home.The poet began writing at a young age, and was inspired at first by the “trees, flowers, birds, the smells of the plants or shrubs, the air, the cane fields” she encountered as she walked to school.But after she attended a lecture about slavery about eight years ago, her writing took a new course.“I left that place a changed person. I had known, of course, about slavery, but I was presented that night with the facts, but also the statistics – the list of names of enslaved people, some of them 18, some of them 16, 13. I was confronted with the reality of enslavement in a way that I hadn’t been before,” she said.The experience shifted the focus of her work. The “ultimate goal” of her poetry, she said, became getting justice for those who had suffered at the hands of European colonisers.A strong supporter ofCaribbean leaders’ pursuit of justice and recompensefor the persisting impact of slavery on the region, Phillips believes her poems can help a modern society, far removed from the raw reality of slavery, to connect with the experiences of those who suffered at the hands of European colonisers centuries ago.She is on a mission to breathe life into stories about enslaved people buried in archives and obscured by decades of colonial narratives.“The sociologists, the politicians, they will give you the facts, they will give you statistics. But I think people will very often act not from what they know, but from what they feel, how they feel, what is it that propels you from the inside … That is the work and the realm of poetry – to touch the emotions,” she said, adding that poetry has the power to change views.The poet,who will speak in Londonabout her work and advocacy on 24 June, is particularly focused on enslaved women, many of whom were forced to endure the trauma of seeing their children taken away and sold to another plantation.“One of the things that really grieved me, and still does, whenever I think about [slavery] is the way in which we as human beings could be sold … but also how a mother’s children could be sold from her,” Phillips said.She added: “I’m a mother, and I’m still not understanding it … From the time she’s carrying this child, she knows that the child can be sold. What do you do as a woman? How do you prepare yourself?”The bitter choice to prepare a child for life as an enslaved person is captured in her unpublished poem Hard Love. An excerpt from the unpublished poem reads:She must not fetter her son with tenderness.So she flexes his feet and anklesto bear the weight of ball and chain;rubs her calloused hands down the soft skinof his back to ready him for whippings that will come.She lets the weight of her arms fall heavy on his neckas she hugs him; a yoke may be the collar he will wearIn addition to describing the horrors of slavery in her poems, the poet has been advocating for reparations for Barbados, and has written tothe British former MP Richard Drax, a descendant of colonisers, who still owns Drax Hall.Drax haspreviously saidthat his ancestors’ role in the slave trade was “deeply, deeply regrettable, but no one can be held responsible today for what happened many hundreds of years ago”.Philips said: “His response was, well, it is truly regrettable, but that has nothing to do with him. My argument is, if you are living off the proceeds, living off the wealth created by your foreparents’ enslavement of people, you are as guilty.”Enslaved people, who were once voiceless, she said, are speaking through her poems and telling colonisers and their descendants how they suffered.“You got their labour for free; you used their bodies as commodities; there were times when they were just there to breed and to produce more slaves. You got all of that. You beat them. You raped them. You did whatever you wanted with them, and you got whatever life they had.”She added: “We are not coming to you, cap in hand, begging for anything … You’ve got free labour for hundreds of years. You prospered from it. You have the wealth that you’re living on. Give the people back what belongs to them.”"

Two further bombs were detonated from towers on Trimouille and neighbouring Alpha Island.The area is now a marine park known for its turquoise waters, corals, dolphins and threatened turtles.Madison Williams-Hoffman, a PhD student at Edith Cowan University and lead author of the research, said the plutonium would have been part of the “fallout” from the nuclear tests that would have fallen from the blast cloud and into the surrounding waters and land.View image in fullscreenSediment samples being collected on a field trip to Montebello Islands in 2020.Photograph: Kathryn McMahonRadiation from plutonium cannot travel through skin and is most dangerous when ingested or inhaled.The 66 samples were collected in 2020 by divers who took the top 10cm of sediment, with analysis done at the university in Perth and also by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailWilliams-Hoffman said little was known about the amounts of plutonium that remained in the marine environment and it was too early to speculate on any ongoing risks. Further research would look at those risks, she said.She said: “This is a baseline that tells us what the levels are. Next we look at the risks to what’s living there.”Australia risks being ‘world’s nuclear waste dump’ unless Aukus laws changed, critics sayRead moreWilliams-Hoffman said because plutonium was entirely human-made it could only be released by nuclear bombs, nuclear facilities or nuclear accidents.The contamination will persist for many thousands of years, she said. While the islands are not inhabited, they are visited by recreational fishing boats.The research,published in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin, showed concentrations of plutonium at the islands were four to 4,500 times higher than those found in sediment samples taken at two distant coastal sites more than 1,000 kilometres away on the Western Australian coastline.View image in fullscreenLead author of the research Madison Williams-Hoffman said the plutonium would have been part of the ‘fallout’ from the nuclear tests.Photograph: Kathryn McMahonWilliams-Hoffman said it was curious that levels of contamination at the Montebello Islands were similar to those at the Marshall Islands in the Micronesia region of the Pacific in the northern hemisphere, even though nuclear testing there by the US government was “orders of magnitude” greater.“This is a really important question for us as a country,” she said. “We have unique ecosystems and environments and we need to understand how these materials behave in the environment once they are released.”Aprevious study of animals in the Montebello areafound low levels of plutonium in all tested species, but levels in fish muscles were so low that anyone eating them “would receive an increase in dose from the [plutonium] many orders of magnitude lower than that from the natural radionuclides in the same fish”, the research said.Visitors to the marine park are warned to limit any visits on Trimouille and Alpha Island to an hour a day, and not to disturb soils.Tim Hunt, the marine program coordinator for the Pilbara region of the WA government’s parks and wildlife service, said while it was useful to know that plutonium persisted in the marine environment, advice from nuclear experts was that the risk to humans was much lower in a marine environment than on land.“Because this radiation will persist for generations, we are looking to build on information and adjust our management if needed. But the information we have is that our measures are sufficient to mitigate the radiation risk that’s there, and will continue to be there.”Dr Megan Cook, radiochemistry laboratory director at the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, which supported the research, said the research was important because it provided “a unique insight into the impacts of nuclear explosions on the environment, and the longevity of radioisotopes many decades after an event.”She said: “Because of the radioactivity that is still present at Montebello Islands, the region is not inhabited by humans and has not been developed.“However, the surrounding waters are visited by fishing boats, so collecting data on the levels of contamination in sea water and marine life is important. Montebello Islands are part of a highly biodiverse marine ecosystem, home to numerous endangered and endemic species.“This ecological richness leads to precautionary environmental protection, including mapping contamination hotspots, monitoring bioaccumulation in marine life, and assessing ecosystem-level radiation impacts.”Explore more on these topicsWestern AustraliaMarine lifeNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

Writing on social media, he called for “maximum political and diplomatic coordination” and closer work on “joint defence projects and weapons production”.Speaking at the Chatham House thinktank, Ukraine’s president said both countries would begin co-producing “long-range drones” soon. He declined to give details, but the drones are likely to be used against strategic military targets inside Russia.“We will do it together. I’m happy about these strong relations between both of our countries,” he said, thanking the UK, “Keir” and previous governments for their support of Ukraine.Ukraine is the world’s leading producer of drones, which now dominate the battlefield. Earlier this month Ukraine’s SBU security agency carried out a spectacularcovert drone attack on five Russian airbases, destroying about 20 Russian bomber aircraft.The prime minister and Zelenskyy chatted in the Downing Street garden with Ukrainian troops being trained in the UK. Earlier Ukraine’s president described Russia, Iran andNorth Koreaas a “coalition of murderers”.He arrived in London hours after the Kremlin launched another big air raid on Kyiv. It involved 352 drones – half of them were Iranian-designed Shaheds – and North Korean ballistic missiles in what Zelenskyy called “a completely cynical strike”.At least 14 people were killed and five civilian apartment blocks badly damaged. “A large number of drones and missiles were shot down by our air defenders – but not all,” Zelenskyy posted on social media.“Everyone in countries neighbouring Russia, Iran and North Korea should be thinking carefully about whether they could protect lives if this coalition of murderers persists and continues spreading their terror.”View image in fullscreenA residential building damaged in Russia’s latest attack on Kyiv.Photograph: Sergey Dolzhenko/EPAZelenskyy has supported Donald Trump’s missile strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities and has accused Tehran of complicity in Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its fourth year. Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons arsenal in the 1990s in exchange for US, British and Russian security guarantees.These failed, however, to prevent Vladimir Putin’s 2022 attack. Zelenskyy’s latest trip to the UK was to discuss how to compel Russia to stop its war, Ukrainian officials said.His previous visit in March followed a disastrous meeting in the Oval Office in which Trump accused him of “gambling with world war three” and the US vice-president, JD Vance, berated him for supposed ingratitude.Monday’s discussions encompassed sanctions and the Trump administration, which has so far refused to punish Russia and has practically ended US weapons deliveries to Kyiv. Ukraine has been attempting to keep Washington onside diplomatically, despite its apparent pivot to Moscow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As well as talks with Starmer, he met King Charles at Windsor Castle.Zelenskyy will travel to this week’s two-day Nato summit in The Hague and is scheduled to meet the alliance’s secretary general, Mark Rutte. It is unclear if he will have a face-to-face meeting with Trump, who is expected to arrive on Tuesday and push for greater defence spending from Nato member states.Since Trump’s return to the White House in January, Russia has dramatically stepped up its aerial attacks on Ukraine. It has refused Zelenskyy’s offer of a 30-day ceasefire and continues to target civilians. Monday’s strikes hit a residential area, hospitals and sports infrastructure.The most severe damage was in Shevchenkivskyi district, where a section of a five-storey apartment building collapsed. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said six people had been killed in the district. Ten others, including a pregnant woman, were rescued from a nearby high-rise that also sustained heavy damage.Oleksii Pozychaniuk, 29, who lives in the building next to the one struck, said he heard the whistle of a rocket approaching and “froze in terror” before feeling the impact.“Windows blew out, glass was flying everywhere,” he told the Associated Press. “We barely made it downstairs with my child.

But the time is right. And I couldn’t be more proud of my country for all that it represents and all that it is doing.”Evans was born in England to Welsh parents but has considered himself Irish – and Ireland his home – since he was a toddler.He formed U2 in 1976 with three Dublin classmates – Paul Hewson, better known as Bono, Larry Mullen Jr and Adam Clayton – and went on to record Sunday Bloody Sunday and other songs that became Irish anthems.Evans, however, never got around to applying for citizenship. “Honestly, there were many moments in the past when I could have done it with just the form to be filled out but I’m happy it’s now, it feels more significant,” he said.Wearing an Irish tricolour clip, Evans swore an oath of loyalty and fidelity to the Irish state with hundreds of other newly created citizens in the Gleneagle arena – one of several back-to-back ceremonies that will confer citizenship on 7,500 people on Monday and Tuesday.He said the ceremony had been very moving and especially significant for him because of Ireland’s support for multilateral organisations, such as the international criminal court and the UN, and for “speaking truth to power”.“I have always felt Irish, Ireland will always be home to me and I’m so grateful for that,” he said. Ireland was showing real leadership in the world, he said. “It couldn’t come at a better moment for me so I am just so happy to be at this point, to be in even deeper connection with my homeland.”Critics of U2 say the band’stax arrangements, which route some income not generated in Ireland overseas, undermine its commitment to the country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “It is a great privilege to become a citizen of this country and obviously with it comes responsibilities and duties, and I think everyone who is taking on citizenship will be aware of that.”His comments came amid a growing backlash against immigration in the US andEurope, including Ireland and Northern Ireland.

The depictions of the 11 other apostles and four evangelists will be put back “in stages” according to theNotre Dameteam.The statues were designed by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc for his 19th-century overhaul of Notre Dame and made by the sculptor, Adolphe Victor Geoffroy-Dechaume.‘It was so fragile, we weren’t certain it wouldn’t collapse’: the architect who sketched Notre Dame’s ancient insidesRead moreInstalled in 1861, the apostles are each 3.4 metres (11ft) tall and arranged in four groups around the 96-metre spire, which was added by Viollet-le-Duc in 1858.In front of each group is a statue of an evangelist: a bull for Saint Luke, a lion for Saint Mark, an eagle for Saint John and an angel for Saint Matthew. All the statues look out over Paris except for that of Saint Thomas, the patron saint of architects, who looks toward the spire and is said to be modelled on Viollet-le-Duc.The statues have undergone a complete renewal, with damaged parts replaced and corrosion removed, returning them to their original dark brown colour. They have also been Teflon-proofed against damage from the elements. During the renovation, workers discovered bullet holes on the statue of Saint Mark thought to date back to the second world war.The statues will stand in their original places below the spire’s new golden rooster, a symbol of hope and faith and an emblem ofFrance. Installed last December, it houses cathedral relics and a sealed tube holding a list of almost 2,000 people who have worked on the cathedral’s reconstruction since the fire on 15 April 2019.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The temperatures rose significantly on Saturday, with Huron regional airport in South Dakota recording a high of 39.4C (102.9F), 13C above the average high in June for the region.In St Paul, Minnesota, the minimum temperature on Saturday night was 27.8C. This was 1.1C below the city’s highest night-time minimum for June, which was recorded in 1999.The heat then spread eastwards on Sunday with temperatures rising into the mid-30s widely across the plains, Midwest, mid-Atlantic and north-east. Temperatures in New York City are expected to reach 36C on Monday and Tuesday, which would set daily records, while in Washington DC, the temperature could reach 38C – matching or breaking records on both days.Boston will also experience temperatures well into the 30s Celsius, probably peaking on Tuesday with a high of 34C, just shy of daily records. Accompanying this heat will also be high levels of humidity, making it feel even hotter, with temperatures potentially feeling as high as 43C.Overall, 250 daily temperature records could be broken on Monday and Tuesday, including both record highs and record warm lows, making this heatwave particularly oppressive.View image in fullscreenTemperatures were considerably above average across western Europe before peaking on Saturday, with France recording close to 40C.Photograph: Mohammed Badra/EPAHot weather also hit westernEuropelast week, affecting numerous countries including France and the UK. Temperatures were considerably above average across western Europe throughout the week before peaking on Saturday, with France recording close to 40C.The 39C recorded in Tusson in south-westFrancebeat the highest June temperature at the location by 0.1C. Temperatures then fell across France and the UK on Sunday, with the heat moving further east across Europe into Germany.Despite Sunday’s respite, further high temperatures are expected in France this week, with high pressure expected to remain over the country. Temperatures could be as a high as 38C across central France as early as Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerFranceEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Shortly before the announcement, powerful explosions were reported in the Iranian capital of Tehran, according to Agence France-Presse.“CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE!” Trump wrote on the Truth Social platform. “It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE.”There was no immediate official response from Iran or Israel. A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Tehran had agreed to the US-proposed ceasefire.Hours earlier, it reported that three Israeli officials had signalled Israel was looking to wrap up its strikes on Iran soon and had passed the message on to the US. On Sunday, Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahusaid Israel was “very, very close to completing” its goals.The announcement came after the US joined the Israel-led campaign by striking Iranian uranium enrichment facilities early on Sunday morning, prompting Iran on Monday tolaunch a choreographed retaliatory strikeagainst a US airbase in Qatar. Trump had called the Iranian attack a “very weak response” and said he would renew efforts to negotiate a peace between Israel and Iran.The “END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World,” Trump added. “During each CEASEFIRE, the other side will remain PEACEFUL and RESPECTFUL. On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, ‘THE 12 DAY WAR.’”In an online post, Trump earlier thanked Iran for “giving us early notice” of a missile barrage against the US airbase in Qatar and said that no Americans had been killed or harmed in the attack.His remarks suggested that the Iranian response was carefully coordinated to allow Tehran and Washington an off-ramp after the US joined in Israeli strikes target Iranian uranium enrichment facilities in order to cripple Iran’s nuclear program before the country could produce a bomb.“Most importantly, they’ve gotten it all out of their “system,” and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE,” Trump wrote. “Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same.”Trump advisers privately said they believed Iran would accept the US president’s olive branch in order to avoid continued strikes by Israel, and because they had inflicted symbolic retaliation.The ceasefire announcement also appeared an effort to reframe the metrics for success for the US operation targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities, after it was unclear whether the deeply buried Fordow site had been destroyed.In a post on social media, Trump said the Iranian sites had been “totally destroyed”.But the UN’s nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, said: “At this time, no one, including the [International Atomic Energy Agency], is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow.”Trump advisers tried to suggest it did not matter if Fordow was destroyed because Iran had been forced to the negotiating table – even though that would mark a departure from what Trump said he was aiming for over the weekend.Still, the actual damage to the nuclear facilities remains an important question ahead of possible talks between US and Iran – expected to be led by Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff – as it would affect Witkoff’s negotiating leverage.Other senior administration officials claimed victory. Vice-president JD Vance on Monday evening claimed Iran was “incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it”.The US attack followed a wave of missile strikes between Israel and Iran, with Israelbombing the notorious Evin prison, and came afterTrumpraised the prospect of regime change in Tehran. But as of Monday evening, senior US officials had suggested that the Iranian attack on Qatar was designed to avoid a further escalation that could lead to an all-out war which could imperil the Iranian regime.Trump said 13 of the 14 missiles fired by Iran had been shot down and that one was allowed to hit its target because it was “headed in a non-threatening direction”.The Qatari defence minister told Al Jazeera television that the country’s defences had intercepted the incoming missiles, and that there had been no injuries. Al Jazeera showed footage of debris, reportedly from intercepted missiles lying on an unidentified street, surrounded by residents.A US defence official confirmed that Iran had targeted the Al Udeid airbase in Qatar, the largest US military facility in the Middle East, in “a retaliatory but largely symbolic response” to the weekend US strikes.The official said Iran launched medium-range ballistic missiles after communicating the move in advance to Qatari and US officials. There were no reports of US casualties.Tehran’s symbolic retaliation was similar to that following the assassination of Gen Qassem Suleimani, the powerful leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in 2020. After Suleimani was killed in a US drone strike near the Baghdad airport, Iran fired more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two Iraqi airbases housing US forces.In a statement posted on the X social platform while the missiles were in the air, Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said: “We neither initiated the war nor were we seeking it. But we will not leave aggression against the great Iran without answer.”Iranian armed forces said the barrage was not directed at Qatar itself, which it described as a “friendly and brotherly” regime.Qatar insisted it had the right to hit back.“We consider this a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of the State of Qatar, its airspace, international law, and the United Nations charter,” the foreign ministry spokesperson, Majed al-Ansari, said in a social media post.Emmanuel Macron expressed solidarity with Qatar, but he also warned that the US strikes against Iran had no “framework of legality”, adding that any regime change in the country should be a result of the will of the people, not of bombs.Earlier in the day, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced it was “intensifying the attack on the military capabilities of the Iranian regime” with sorties involving 50 warplanes. Some of Monday’s attacks were aimed at the Fordow uranium enrichment plant.An Israeli strike on Monday badly damaged the main gate to Evin prison in the north of the capital, used to detain political prisoners and ordinary criminals. Israeli bombs also targeted the headquarters of the Revolutionary Guards and of the Basij, a volunteer militia, which reports directly to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said the armed forces were “currently striking, with unprecedented force, regime targets and governmental repression bodies in the heart of Tehran”.Over the first 11 days of its attacks on Iran, the governing coalition of Netanyahu has repeatedly denied that regime change was a formal war aim, though the prime minister has said it would be a welcome outcome, and called on Iran’s people to rise up against the regime in Tehran. On Monday, however, members of his cabinet openly called for the overthrow of Iran’s theocratic regime.Thescience and technology minister, Gila Gamleil, a leading member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, wrote on X, according to a translation by the Haaretz newspaper: “As long as the Nazi ayatollah regime sits in Tehran, it has the potential to rebuild its destructive capabilities.” He added: “Therefore, we must continue the campaign until the conditions are created for revolution and the removal of the ayatollah regime.” He signed off with the slogan: “Next year in Tehran.”Iran’s judiciary confirmed the damage to Evin but, through its mouthpiece, the Mizan news agency, said: “The situation in the prison is under control and all means have been used to manage the prison complex.”A Washington-based group, the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran, said: “Many families of current detainees have expressed deep concern about the safety and condition of their loved ones held inside the prison.”Evin is not just used by the regime to incarcerate Iranian dissidents, but also foreigners and dual nationals who have been seized over the past several years for use as hostages and bargaining chips.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpIsraelIranUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

However, on Monday evening Qatar temporarily closed its airspace again asIranlaunched a missile attack on US bases in the country.The hiatus so far has been significant, given the airports involved are critical Gulf hubs in international aviation on routes where options have become limited and the geopolitical squeeze is getting tighter.The first job of the industry is to steer clear of unnecessary risk, with uncertain threats after the escalation of conflict in the Middle East, and the reach of modern drone and missile attacks. The aviation industry has long stressed that safety is paramount, but has been rocked by this month’sAir India disaster, the deadliest crash on a modern, scheduled airliner in many years.Flight diversions across Middle EastGlobal air traffic, certainly that looking to connect Europe and Asia, has already been forced into a tighter funnel: passenger planes have not flown over Ukraine since the Russian invasion three years ago, and most western airlines are banned from Russian airspace. That has already made, for example, London-Japan flights borderline unviable for airlines competing with Chinese carriers who can continue on a direct route over Russia, and many have trimmed back accordingly.The closure of Ukraine’s skies has compounded congestion within European aviation, with many operators complaining bitterly ofair traffic control delaysas they compete for safe passage. A similar scenario could unfold on the ever-tighter corridors now available in the Middle East, says the aviation analyst John Strickland of JLS Consulting: “The Gulf is a busy region, even for airlines who are not based there. The more it is restricted, the more challenging it is for airlines.”For now the route over Iraq as well as Iran remain off limits, and aviation inIsraelis restricted to a few rescue flights operated by El Al to bring nationals home. The European safety agency, EASA, has advised against flying over Syria, Jordan and Lebanon since 13 June, and parts of Egyptian airspace are regarded as a risk.In the swarm of planes plotted on tracking sites such as FlightRadar24, the growing no-go zones are clearly visible. Some airlines now route north via Georgia and over Afghanistan, while others are forced round the south-west to turn east over Saudi Arabia.The Gulf carriers continue to operate most services as normal despite the confines – Emirates’ only current cancellations are the services directly to Tehran and Baghdad.Singapore Airlines and Air France-KLM were among those who joined BA in weekend cancellations, while Finnair – boxed in more than most already by Ukraine and Russia – has put all flights on hold to Doha until the end of the month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in the longer term the schedules will also be dictated by dwindling profit margins from longer flights, and potential for more disruptive delays.“It is adding significant time to flights, which not only makes them late but more expensive to operate because they are burning more fuel,” Strickland says. “And if crews are on duty longer, they risk having to cancel flights due to restrictions on working hours and potential nonavailability of crew – as well as for reasons of safety and security.”Share prices in airlines have dipped to various degrees since Israel launched the first attack on 12 June. Airlines will also keenly be watching the rising oil price that has ensued – and the premium paid for jet fuel, which has risen even more sharply than the price of crude in recent weeks.The world has been keen to fly since the Covid crisis, and willing to pay a premium. Hedging means the oil price may not filter through into fares this summer, but with Ryanair already signalling thatfares would riseregardless this year, passengers may find themselves paying ever more for the privilege.Explore more on these topicsAirline industryMiddle East and north AfricaUS militaryIsraelIranIran's nuclear programmeanalysisShareReuse this content"

An Iraqi security official told the Associated Press that the Iranian missiles had targeted Ain al-Asad base where US troops are deployed in western Iraq.Iranian state media said that the missile launches were part of a retaliatory operation dubbed Victory Message. In a statement posted on the X social platform while the missiles were in the air, Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said: “We neither initiated the war nor were we seeking it.

Reuters quoted a Syrian security official as saying that the main residual US base in the north-east of the country, Qasrak, was on full alert. Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain closed their airspace, and the Bahrain authorities sounded air raid sirens and told residents to seek shelter.Saudi Arabia condemned Iran’s attack “in the strongest terms” offering to deploy “all its capabilities” to support Doha, with which it has had fraught relations in the past.Tehran presented its retaliatory strikes as a calibrated response to Donald Trump’s decision to participate in Israeli attacks, using the same number of munitions that the US used on Sunday. That attack on three nuclear sites included 14 bunker-busting bombs, 20 cruise missiles and other projectiles.The Iranian response, however, risked opening a new and uncertain chapter in the widening war. Donald Trump and his top officials had earlier declared that the US bombing sortie against Iranian nuclear facilities on Sunday would be the beginning and end of US participation in the attacks, unless Iran tried to strike back, in which case the administration threatened a devastating response.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump delivering an address to the nation after US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersIt remained unclear how much damage the US strikes had inflicted.

The United Arab Emirates was also reported to have closed its airspace.Iran has repeatedly threatened to carry out reprisals against the military bases and ships of any state seen as supporting the Israeli war effort.Earlier in the day, Israel bombed Evin prison and internal security forces sites in Tehran, deeming them “governmental repression bodies” as Israeli government ministers embraced regime change as the ultimate objective of its operation, Rising Lion.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced on Monday it was “intensifying the attack on the military capabilities of the Iranian regime” with sorties involving 50 warplanes. Some of Monday’s attacks were aimed at the Fordow uranium enrichment plant, which had been struck by heavy US bunker-busting bombs the previous day.The IDF Farsi spokesperson, Kamal Pinhasi, issued a warning to Tehranis to “stay away from weapons production centres, military bases, and security institutions affiliated with the regime”.View image in fullscreenAn ambulance burned by Israeli attacks in Tehran.Photograph: Majid Asgaripour/ReutersAn Israeli strike on Monday badly damaged the main gate to Evin prison in the north of the capital, used to detain political prisoners and ordinary criminals.

He said the strike on the gate had put them in danger and was “unacceptable”. Barrot also demanded information about their wellbeing and their immediate release from the Iranian government.On Monday, Israel’s security service, the Shin Bet, announced that an Israeli citizen was arrested last month on charges of spying for Iran.

Britain pushed for and secured a later date.Military chiefs are expected to welcome the announcement but officials acknowledged the 5% increase would combine traditional defence spending of 3.5% with a broader “whole of society” category worth 1.5% of GDP.Some defence officials have privately said the headline figure risks conflating military capability with investment already budgeted for by the Treasury. They pointed out that the target would be hit only after the next election but one.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had faced weeks of lobbying from pro-defence Labour MPs and military figures for a higher spending ceiling amid warnings that Britain risked falling behind its Nato peers.No 10 is presenting the commitment as a signal of seriousness before a meeting involving Nato leaders and the US president, Donald Trump, in The Hague on Tuesday. However, some MPs are concerned that the timing of the announcement gives the UK less leverage at the summit.The pledge, which comes before the publication on Tuesday of the government’s national security strategy, will formally split the 5% pledge into 3.5% for core defence and 1.5% for wider resilience, covering infrastructure, energy security, cyber defences and economic shock absorption.The strategy will include a long-awaited review of UK-China relations, which was part of Labour’s manifesto and was originally planned to be released in January.The government has promised to spend 2.5% of the country’s economic output on defence by 2027-28, with a further ambition to spend 3% at some point during the next parliament.Nato’s secretary general,Mark Rutte, has called on member states to commit this week to the target of spending 5% of GDP when Trump is rewriting his country’s role in global security.Europeans back higher defence spending amid Russia threat, poll findsRead moreThe US president, who has in the past threatened to walk away from Nato unless allies step up their contributions, has also urged them to reach 5%. The US spends 3.4% of GDP on defence.UK officials say the 5% ambition reflects the reality of modern threats – from supply chains and food prices to digital sabotage and economic coercion.However, the UK’s 2035 target is three years behind the 2032 deadline originally pushed by Rutte amid difficult negotiations and resistance from the Treasury.The prime minister will travel to The Hague “against a backdrop of global volatility”, No 10 said, citing Israeli and US strikes on Iran, the continued war in Ukraine and Russia’s intensifying aggression.While rising tensions in the Middle East may dominate the summit, Starmer is expected to use the occasion to argue that a “just and lasting peace in Ukraine is only possible if we continue to show strength” and that there will be “no letup” in British support.While officials are framing the 5% commitment as future-facing and economy-linked, it is unclear whether the package will meet Washington’s higher bar and harder definition of military readiness.Some of the UK’s allies have moved notably faster and more decisively. Germany, under chancellor Friedrich Merz, has eased constitutional debt limits to fund a €500bn (£425bn) rearmament programme and has pledged to reach 3.5% by 2029.Poland and the Baltics are already spending 4% to 5% of GDP. Spain has opted out entirely, striking a deal with Nato to keep its defence budget at just above 2%, arguing that it could meet its defence commitments with lower investment than allies.The UK currently spends about 2.3% of GDP on defence. A formal Nato review of progress toward the 5% goal is expected in 2029, by which point Starmer and Reeves will face renewed scrutiny over whether rhetoric has been matched by delivery.A No 10 spokesperson said the pledge marked a “generational increase in defence and security spending”, adding that it would “have a considerable impact on the strength of our alliance”, given the UK’s position as the second-largest economy in Europe and third-largest in Nato.Starmer said: “This is an opportunity to deepen our commitment to Nato and drive greater investment in the nation’s wider security and resilience.“After all, economic security is national security, and through this strategy we will bring the whole of society with us.”Explore more on these topicsDefence policyNatoMilitaryMark RuttenewsShareReuse this content"

It has also been signed by former cabinet minister Louise Haigh andVicky Foxcroft, who quit as a Labour whiplast week.They claim the amendment, to be published on Tuesday, is not intended to wreck the welfare bill but as many Labour MPs are uneasy about the government’s plans that could be the eventual outcome.“We all want the Labour government to succeed in getting people back into work and supporting those who can’t. We don’t want to defeat the government but we want the government to think again,” Hillier told the Guardian.“We are being asked to vote before consultation with disabled people and before impact assessments.”Ministers have argued that dropping, or even watering down, the welfare plans could leave a multibillion-pound black hole in Rachel Reeves’s attempts to balance the country’s books.But Hillier said: “We recognise that the financial situation is difficult. As the chancellor says governing is about choices. We don’t disagree that there is a need to reform welfare but it’s hard to deliver the proposed improvements in the proposed timescale. And disabled people must be protected.”Dozens of backbench MPs have signed the amendment. . Government whips have already beensteeling themselves for a rebellionon the welfare bill when it is first voted on next week.A senior MP said: “The government hasn’t listened to private concerns so now will have to address these very public ones.”The aim would be to pass a so-called “reasoned amendment”, which halts the passage of a bill. It means the bill would not pass its second reading, saying that provisions “have not been subject to a formal consultation with disabled people, or co-produced with them, or their carers”.It also says the bill should not pass until the Office for Budget Responsibility can publish its analysis of the employment impact of the changes this autumn. The amendment adds that most of the additional employment support funding will not be in place until the end of the decade.It notes the government’s own impact assessment estimates that 250,000 people will be pushed into poverty as a result of the provisions, including 50,000 children. It calls for an assessment of the impact of the changes on health or care needs and for the conclusion of other reviews.The amendment would need to be selected by the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and gain the support of opposition parties to pass, and there is no guarantee of either. But the symbolism of so many MPs signing the amendment would make taking the bill forward extremely problematic for Keir Starmer.The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, has addressed a private meeting of MPs at which she told them there was “no route to social justice based on greater benefit spending alone”.She said the cuts were about “ensuring the welfare state survives” and that the government would always seek to protect those with the greatest need.Some frontbenchers are believed to be considering their positions ahead of next Tuesday’s vote on cuts to personal independence payments and changes to the health-related element of universal credit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At least 170 MPs have expressed concerns about the bill in public interventions and private letters to party whips.Foxcroft, a former shadow disability minister,quit her post last weekas a government whip, saying she could not support the cuts, which could affect more than a million people.The changes, which are at the centre of a £4.8bn welfare cuts package, will mean even people who are unable to wash half their body or cook a meal for themselves will be denied the payments if they have no other impairments.Look at Labour’s cruel attitude towards disability benefits, then tell me Keir Starmer cares about ‘human dignity’ | John HarrisRead moreReeves denied earlier on Monday that the government would go any further to appease MPs, either by making tweaks to the changes or by delaying the vote. “There will be no U-turn. We’re voting on it next week,” she said.Speaking to MPs at the parliamentary Labour party meeting, Kendall urged them to support the government and emphasised the extra support it would be establishing.“The path to fairer society – one where everyone thrives, where people who can work get the support they need, and where we protect those who cannot – that is the path we seek to build with our reforms,” she said. “Our plans are rooted in fairness, for those who need support and for taxpayers.“They are about ensuring the welfare state survives, so there is always a safety net for those who need it. They’re about putting proper safeguards in place to protect the most vulnerable.“But above all they are about our belief that everyone can fulfil their potential and live their hopes and dreams when – collectively – we provide them with real opportunities and support.

The three liberal justices issued a scathing dissent.The Department of Homeland Security hailed the decision as a “victory for the safety and security of the American people”.“DHS can now execute its lawful authority and remove illegal aliens to a country willing to accept them,” spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Fire up the deportation planes.”In response to Monday’s ruling, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said: “The supreme court’s stay of a leftwing district judge’s injunction reaffirms the president’s authority to remove criminal illegal aliens from our country and Make America Safe Again.”In the dissenting opinion, justiceSonia Sotomayoraccused the court of “rewarding lawlessness” by allowing the government to violate the due process rights of the immigrants facing removal. She also charged that the conservative majority appeared more concerned by the “remote possibility” that the federal judge exceeded his authority than by “the idea that thousands will suffer violence in far-flung locales”.“In matters of life and death, it is best to proceed with caution,” she wrote. “In this case, the government took the opposite approach.”Boston-based US district judge Brian Murphy has faced sharp criticism from Trump and his allies over the decision – part of a pattern of targeting judges who impede the administration’s agenda. In a statement, the White House called him a “a far-left activist judge”.The case was brought by immigrant rights groups who filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of a group of migrants seeking to prevent their rapid removal to third-party countries – places where they did not hold citizenship and had no connection.In May, Murphy found that the Department of Homeland Security had “unquestionably” violated an earlier court order when it attempted to send eight men, all convicted of violent crimes in the US, to South Sudan, a country that the US state department has deemed dangerous for travelers “due to crime, kidnapping and armed conflict”.Murphyruledthat the Trump administration could not let a group of migrants being transported to countries that were not their own leave the custody ofUS immigrationauthorities.As a result, the plane landed instead in the east African nation ofDjibouti, where they have been held at a US military base ever since. The detainees came from countries around the world – Cuba, Mexico, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar. Only one was from South Sudan. Immigration officials have said that they were unable to return the men to their home countries quickly.Reuters also reported by that US officials had considered sending migrants toLibya– another politically unstable country previously condemned by Washington for its harsh treatment of detainees. Removing individuals without an opportunity to object would violate his order, Murphy clarified.In an emergency filing to the supreme court, the administration said the South Sudan-bound migrants had committed “heinous crimes”, including murder, arson and armed robbery.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe case is one of several legal challenges to Trump-era immigration policies to reach the supreme court since Trump returned to office in January vowing to carry out the largest deportation campaign in US history.In May, the supreme court let Trump endhumanitarianprograms for hundreds of thousands of migrants to live and work in the US temporarily. The justices, however, in Aprilfaultedthe administration’s treatment of some targeted migrants as inadequate under US constitution’s due process protections.Due process generally requires the government to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing before taking certain adverse actions.In March, the administration issued guidance providing that if a third country has given credible diplomatic assurance that it will not persecute or torture migrants, individuals may be deported there “without the need for further procedures”.Without such assurance, if the migrant expresses fear of removal to that country, US authorities would assess the likelihood of persecution or torture, possibly referring the person to an immigration court, according to the guidance.Murphy found that the administration’s policy of “executing third-country removals without providing notice and a meaningful opportunity to present fear-based claims” likely violates due process requirements under the constitution.Murphy said that the supreme court, Congress, “common sense” and “basic decency” all require migrants to be given adequate due process. The Boston-based 1st US circuit court of appeals on 16 May declined to put Murphy’s decision on hold.In his order concerning the flight to South Sudan, Murphy also clarified that non-citizens must be given at least 10 days to raise a claim that they fear for their safety.The administration told the supreme court that its third-country policy already complied with due process and is critical for removing migrants who commit crimes because their countries of origin are often unwilling to take them back.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS supreme courtUS politicsSonia SotomayorDonald TrumpSouth SudannewsShareReuse this content"

There are whole social mediaaccountsdevoted to egregious examples of it,campaignsfor change built around it, and, in Oz’s words, there is “violence in the streets” over prior authorization – an allusion to thebroad daylight killingof an insurance company CEO.Oz said repeatedly in a press conference on Monday that 85% of Americans or their loved ones had experienced a delay or denial of care thanks to prior authorization.Key RFK Jr advisers stand to profit from a new federal health initiativeRead more“The pledge is not a mandate, this is not a bill or rule – this is an opportunity for industry to show itself,” said Oz, who heads the enormous federal health insurance bureaucracy, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS). The agency oversees the health insurance of about 68 million seniors through Medicare and about 71 million low-income and disabled Americans through Medicaid.“It’s a good start,” said Oz, “and the response has been overwhelming.”Kennedy called the agreement “momentous” and said it would help make the health system, “work to make our country healthy again”.The announcement of voluntary measures echoed one made earlier in the year by Kennedy, who announced the administration had an “understanding” with food companies to phase out synthetic dyes. Food companies later told reporters there wasno agreement.Concurrently, Republicans are working topush a billthrough Congress that is expected to result in at least 16 million Americans losing health insurance in the next decade. The bill would addred tapeto Medicaid and, advocates say, “punish” states that expanded care to the low-income.With biblical references and a bullet point chart, Trump administration officials, two Republican members of Congress and even an actor who played a doctor on TV – Eric Dane of Grey’s Anatomy – laid out their hopes for insurers to implement this voluntary agreement that they said covered 275 million Americans.Should they do so, insurers would work to standardize the prior authorization approval and deliver decisions faster and near real-time (not over the course of, say, weeks). Additionally, insurers would reduce the number of procedures and drugs subject to prior authorization, honor existing prior authorization approvals in the event a patient switches insurers in the course of care and build a “public dashboard” of how the industry is doing which would allow “medical professionals” to review every denial.Notably, insurance companies made a similar pledge to doctors, hospitals and Americans in 2018, during the first Trump administration. In apress releaseannouncing that agreement, insurers pledged to work with doctors and hospitals to “eliminate” prior authorization for some procedures, “minimize care delays” and “protect continuity of care for patients”.By 2022, the American Medical Association (AMA), which signed onto that agreement, wasarguing publiclythat insurers failed to live up to their end of the bargain. A 2023 survey by the AMA of 1,000 doctors found 7% of physicians had a prior authorization lead to “a patient’s disability or permanent bodily damage, congenital anomaly or birth defect or death”.Trump administration officials did acknowledge that the practice could be egregious and warranted change. “A vaginal delivery” often requires prior authorization, said the Trump administration Medicare director Chris Klomp: “Why is that a question mark in this day and age?”The insurance industry often argues insurers “target its use” to prevent wasteful testing by doctors. However, prior authorization is known to be incredibly widespread: in 2023, a spokesperson for a lobbying group toldFierceHealthcarethat 93% of beneficiaries were in plans that required prior authorization for nearly a quarter of services.Beneficiaries of the federal privatization program Medicare Advantage, which allows private health insurers to manage beneficiaries of the public program Medicare (and is widely regarded asmore expensivefor taxpayers), issued about two prior authorization requests for every one of its 32 million beneficiaries in 2023, according to theKaiser Family Foundation.The practice has even spawned cottage industries: aProPublica investigationfound one company contracted by major insurers sold a product called “the dial” that used an algorithm backed by artificial intelligence to control denial rates.Unlike the federal government, some states have found the nerve to legislate. In just one example,New Jerseyrequired insurers to turn decisions around faster, required peer-to-peer conversations between doctors about the insurers’ decision and required insurers to share denial rates and reasons – at least some of which one Republican congressman at the dais said he wanted, but was not in the agreement.“I will say this being a surgeon: I’m a skeptic, the proof is going to be in the pudding,” said Dr Greg Murphy, a Republican from North Carolina, who added that he would be open to regulations, but questioned whether insurers would abide by the agreement: “Are they doing something to placate an audience?”Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrUS healthcareHealth insurancenewsShareReuse this content"

One person is still missing.A 27ft-long gold Chris-Craft vessel with 10 people aboard overturned Saturday afternoon after apparently being hit by a large swell near DL Bliss state park on the lake’s south-west edge, according to the US Coast Guard.Emergency services reported six people dead at the scene and two missing at the time. Two others were taken to a hospital in unknown condition, El Dorado county officials said. The seventh body was found Sunday evening, according to the El Dorado county sheriff’s office. Their names won’t be released until family members are notified, Sgt Kyle Parker said.The intensity of the thunderstorm surprised even forecasters, who had predicted some rain but nothing like the sudden squall that lashed the southern part of the lake at about 3pm, said meteorologist Matthew Chyba with the National Weather Service office in Reno, Nevada. Winds topped 35mph (56 km/h) and waves swelled more than 8ft (2.5m).View image in fullscreenA capsized vessel floats is seen near DL Bliss state park by Lake Tahoe.Photograph: Justin Smith/AP“We weren’t expecting it to be so strong,” Chyba said Monday. He said temperatures in the area were 15 to 25 degrees below normal for this time of year, which could have contributed to the unstable air mass.Eight-foot waves on Tahoe is “pretty significant”, Chyba said. “They were really rocking the lake.”Local witnesses toldSouth Tahoe Newsthat unusually high winds had struck the lake in the afternoon, raising waves and creating dangerous conditions. “It was a very, very tragic day on Lake Tahoe,” local boat captain Joby Cefalutold the outlet.Lake Tahoe is a popular summer recreation destination for boaters, kayakers and paddleboarders. The pristine lake with very cold water straddlesCaliforniaand Nevada and is one of the deepest in the country, second only to Oregon’s Crater Lake.Rescue crews and divers scoured the area Saturday evening for the remaining victims and resumed efforts Sunday morning before the US Coast Guard eventually called off its search. El Dorado county sheriff’s deputies continued searching on Monday with help from other agencies from California and neighboring Nevada, Parker said.The storm Saturday cleared out within about two hours.Chris Williams, a party boat operator with Tahoe Sports, was one of four company captains on the lake Saturday when the weather turned. He was stunned by the force of the storm and the size of the swells.“We braved the weather and came back during some severe wave heights that have never been seen on Lake Tahoe,” Williams told the San Francisco Chronicle. “We were pushing the vessels to their maximum capabilities while making sure to keep all clients safely aboard.”While all guests from Tahoe Sports charters returned safely, Williams said two boats from the company’s Tahoe Keys location broke from the pier and washed ashore.Video obtained by KCRA-TV showed moored boats at a nearby marina crashing into one another amid strong gusts.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

I think it’s going to be military retaliation on US, bases and/or trying to hit more of the Israeli civilian targets.”US stocks also rose slightly, with the benchmark S&P 500 up 0.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average up 0.5% in New York, on a broadly muted day of trading in the global equity markets.Other leading indices struggled for direction.

The company also wants a trial by jury and an unspecified amount in damages.A Zillow spokesperson said in a statement on Monday that the company believes the claims in the lawsuit are unfounded and that it will vigorously defend against them.“Our focus remains on creating a level playing field that serves the best interests of everyone in the home buying and selling journey,” the spokesperson said.The housing market is always competitive, but has become more fierce of late. Last month the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously occupied US homes fell in April, as elevated mortgage rates and rising prices discouraged prospective homebuyers during what’s traditionally the busiest time of the year for the housing market.Existing home sales dropped 0.5% in April, from March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. The sales decline marked the slowest sales pace for the month of April going back to 2009 in the wake of the US housing crisis. March’s sales pace was also the slowest for that month going back to 2009.Explore more on these topicsUS newsReal estatenewsShareReuse this content"

It would also settle potential claims from the FTC’s nascent investigation into possible coordination with media watchdogs who have been accused byElon Muskof helping orchestrate advertiser boycotts of the social media platform X.“Today’s settlement does not limit either advertisers’ or marketing companies’ constitutionally protected right to free speech,” said Andrew Ferguson, the FTC chairman.Spokespeople for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Omnicom entered the all-stock deal to buy Interpublic in December, creating the world’s largest advertising agency. In the US, the firm would become the largest media buying ad agency, the FTC said.Ferguson had previously criticized settlements that require companies to change their behavior, rather than spin off assets, calling them difficult to enforce.“The history of collusion in the market for media-buying services, and the increased potential for collusion post-merger, make this a rare instance where the imposition of a behavioral remedy is appropriate,” he said.Monday’s agreement would require the company to hand over related documents and file annual compliance reports for five years.The settlement requires final approval from the FTC, which is led by three Republican commissioners, after a public comment period. Two of the commissioners voted to enter the proposed settlement on Monday and one was recused.Explore more on these topicsUS newsAdvertisingnewsShareReuse this content"

Ben McDonald, from Bootle, set up the online pet health supplies business in February,the BBCreported.McDonald, who describes himself as “just a lad from Bootle” who had spent “every spare penny” launching the business, said his “whole world collapsed” when he received a letter from the brand demanding he stop using the word. He was given 10 days to take down his website or face legal action.His lawyer, Francis McEntegart, said: “My client is a small local business that is just starting out selling pet wellness products. It’s not going to interfere with the profits of Hugo Boss in any way.”A spokesperson for Hugo Boss said she was aware of the colloquial use of the word, but that the company needed to “protect our brand rights”.“We are aware that the English word ‘boss’ is one that is commonly used,” she said. “Nevertheless, it’s our responsibility to monitor and protect our brand rights globally and address unclear cases where needed.”“When we became aware of the registration, we have approached the business owner as the intended registration represents an overlap with our trademarks,” she added.“As an international fashion company, we need to – like any other corporation – take measures to protect our existing trademark rights. These measures apply to both of our brands, Boss and Hugo.”The German fashion house is known for fiercely enforcing its trademark. In 2020, the comedianJoe Lycett briefly changed his name by deed poll to Hugo Bossin response to the company sending cease-and-desist letters to small businesses and charities that had used the word boss in their names.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

And while nostalgia may have brought back some alcopops, the new wave of ready-to-drink (RTD) options look and taste noticeably different.It is not just the drinks that have changed, but drinking habits too, driven in part by more health-conscious consumers and demand for variety, according to Marten Lodewijks, the president of the drinks market analysts IWSR US.“A decade ago, hardseltzers, with less sugar and a lower ABV [alcohol by volume], appealed to a new, more health-conscious consumer that didn’t want quite as much sweetness. Lower calories also meant less flavour, however, and, as with any trend, a countertrend soon emerged,” he said.Companies responded with a “much wider range of ABVs, flavours, sweetness levels and even carbonation”.BuzzBallz, founded by a teacher and inspired by a snow globe, is among the newer arrivals tapping into that shift.View image in fullscreenBuzzBallz are one of the companies tapping in to shifting drinking habits.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThe instantly recognisable palm-sized spheres “climbed to become the number 18 RTD brand by volume in the UK”, Jess Scheerhorn, the vice-president at BuzzBallz, told the Drinks Business magazine, citing data from Circana, the US market research group.On a roll: the snowballing success of BuzzBallz pre-mix cocktailsRead moreThe growing popularity of RTD products reflects a shift towards more casual, convenient drinking, often outside traditional settings such as pubs, Alice Baker, a senior research analyst at Mintel, said.“Sales of RTDs have shot up from around £530m a decade ago to an estimated £970m in 2024,” she said, with many people buying them as “a money-saving alternative to cocktails in pubs and bars”.The drinks company Diageo is aiming to make its classic brands such as Smirnoff, Guinness and Captain Morgan relevant to gen Z drinkers, whom it suggests are wrongly perceived to be less interested in alcohol.Giles Hedger, its global consumer planning director, said: “A lot of people talk about gen Z being a cohort that is moving away from alcohol. Our data tells us otherwise. While they drink socially a little less frequently than other cohorts, they do so very enthusiastically.”In fact, “gen Z is super-committed to socialising”, he says, with alcohol a “very significant and enthusiastic part of that”.According to Diageo, whose data draws on 150 consumer experts around the world and reams of market research, gen Z do half their drinking in pubs and clubs and are fans of “three-hour-plus” occasions. They also “love spirits” and have a soft spot for cocktails.Diageo has revamped Smirnoff Ice amid runaway demand for pre-mixed drinks. The 00s alcopop has a new look and comes in a can, but according to the marketers it still has the “citrus flavour notes that people know and love”.Looks matter too – especially for a social media-savvy generation, Kiti Soininen, Mintel category director of UK food and drink research, said. “Our research shows that 73% of white spirits drinkers think that using visually appealing glassware makes drinking white spirits more enjoyable – which no doubt works in favour of BuzzBallz.”Explore more on these topicsAlcoholnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead we were treated to the most thrilling and unpredictable finals since LeBron James came through with his famousrejectionin 2016 – a bustling, punishing, seven-game exhibition of physical basketball whose outcome was genuinely unclear until the final quarter of the season. Denigrated and dismissed by a basketballing commentariat who’ve spent much of this season ruing the modern NBA’s dearth of charisma, Oklahoma City and Indiana played as if stung by the laugh lines, launching from both ends of the court with a kind of mad, symphonic intensity.If the finals of the past few years were about punctuating a dynasty (Golden State in 2022), letting Nikola Jokić be Nikola Jokić (Denver in 2023), and masteringa technocratic synthesisof all the elements of the modern game (the Celtics last season), this was a victory built on turnovers, flops, dives, steals, slingshot passes, and snap threes from distance. It was grubby at times, but it was all the more beautiful for its lunging desperation. At the end of it all, the team with the best regular-season record and the best player in the league emerged victorious. In years to come this stat line alone may confer a sheen of inevitability over the season. But Oklahoma City’svictory in Sunday night’s decider– like these finals and the playoffs generally – was anything but predictable. Even after star guard Tyrese Haliburton, who played through the finals with a calf strain, exited the court with a ripped achilles late in the first quarter, the Pacers would not give up.The $10bn LA Lakers sale proves sports have outgrown even most billionairesRead moreBy the time the triumphant Thunder players made it to the trophy podium, they seemed so drained by their accomplishment they didn’t know how to behave. With an average age of 25.6, these are the youngestNBAchampions in almost half a century – and at the moment of climax it’s fair to say their inexperience finally showed. “It’s your time guys, celebrate,” presenter Lisa Salter encouraged them as the TV formalities concluded. Draped in confetti, SGA, J Dub and the rest proceeded to do nothing, milling around the Larry O’Brien trophy like interns at their first summer networking event awkwardly circling the buffet. Never has a champion NBA team so comprehensively rebuked its cultural critics on the court while confirming the basic accuracy of their critique off it.With their love of group interviews, relentless positivity, andunfortunate penchant for barking, this vintage of the Oklahoma City Thunder often seems more like an a cappella troupe than a basketball team, a band of barber shop Harlem Globetrotters ready to pop up on the campus of our collective psyche at any moment and begin a relentless assault of harmonization and good vibes. Head coach Mark Daigneault is fond of describing them as an “uncommon” team – but what may be most uncommon about them is how supremely, relatably dorky they are. In a world of professional trolls, red-pilled everything and constant worry aboutthe state of Young Men Today, there’s something vaguely refreshing about a group of perky young dudes who carry themselves with the amiable, well mannered aspect of a wealth management professional talking you through reallocation options for your 401k. It also helps, of course, that they are very good at basketball – and these finals have offered a stunning, all-court demonstration of their versatility across the boards.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is, of course, the supernova, a player so richly accomplished – and syllabic – that at the underripe age of 26, he’s already earned the right, like MJ, CP3 and KD before him, to be known by his initials. SGA put together 15 30-point performances throughout this playoff run, a total exceeded during a single postseason by only Michael Jordan in 1992 and Hakeem Olajuwon in 1995. After Sunday night’s game, he is also the first player in 25 years to scoop all three of the regular season MVP award, the finals MVP gong, and the season scoring title. Not since Shaquille O’Neal was getting around the court inshortsbig enough to dress a king bed has there been a player as dominant across all the major awards categories over a single season.SGA’s rise is all the more improbable when you consider his relative softness from three point range, which is – or so the last decade would have us think – the route to glory in today’s NBA. Where other greats of the modern game dominate through power, speed, or precision, SGA’s great skill is variation: variation of pace in the paint, variation of the shooting angles he creates for himself, variation of the heights from which he detonates his lethal mid-range game. He’s as comfortable unleashing one inch off the floor as he is stepping back to gain elevation over an isolated marker, and with the ankle elasticity of prime Gaël Monfils his joints allow him to turn even the most improbable looks into routine buckets. The freakish and frankly slightly scaryvisionof Gilgeous-Alexander’s calves operating at 45 degrees to his feet has become a constant of these finals; at other times he’s shown his uncommon comfort with a game played at waist height, tucked in on himself, headband showing like a set of antlers, fending forward with a hyper-extended leg then snapping back to reel off another unsplashily effective jumper.This is a player so rich in mobility, so relentlessly and inventively productive, that it’s almost boring to catalogue his routes to the basket. Oneincredible sequenceduring a critical stretch of the fourth quarter in Game 5, right as the Pacers were threatening another madcap comeback, saw Gilgeous-Alexander steal the ball off a wayward Andrew Nembhard pass, vacuum up the court, assess two defenders, launch himself short of them, hang for what seemed like five seconds, then extend his left arm forward like a human selfie stick to sink the bucket of the glass, drawing a foul in the process. Poison at one end and caviar at the other: this is the Shai Gilgeous-Alexander guarantee, the recipe that allows him to cook so ferociously every time he steps on the court.View image in fullscreenShai Gilgeous-Alexander holds the Bill Russell NBA finals MVP trophy.Photograph: Manuela Soldi/EPAEach member of the Thunder supporting cast brings their own presents to the party: Chet Holmgren, the “unicorn” big that the Thunder nabbed with the second overall draft pick in 2022, offers a windmilling protection under the rim far more robust than his rope-like physique might suggest; Jalen Williams, at 24, has shown signs that he could match or even one day exceed SGA’s prodigious offensive stats; Alex Caruso plays the old hand (he’s 31, but that’s positively ancient by the standards of this team), calming the kids or jamming the opposition’s spokes as the occasion demands; Lu Dort, a four-fingered Florentine steak of a man, has the name of a 1980s action movie villain and the brawn to match. For all the individuality of these weapons, however, this is very much a team built in SGA’s image, all stretching and running. Relentless movement, positional interchanges, defense wielded as an offensive weapon, offense that flows seamlessly into defense, limbs that bend like liquid … Had I not already gone for an aquatic metaphor, it would be tempting to describe this as a cappella basketball – but even then the imagery doesn’t quite work, because the Thunder operate at a different level, exploding the rigidity of fixed harmonic divisions. No one in this team ever holds the same line; basses, tenors, and counter-tenors all merge, sharing each other’s music. When one Gilgeous is put down, an Alexander pops up; you might get pastJalen Williams, but then you have to deal withJaylinWilliams.Thirteen years ago the Thunder made it to the finals with their magical trio of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden. The rebuild since that near-champion team broke up has been long, and at various points – especially three years ago, when Oklahoma City finished the regular season with just 24 wins – it looked like it might all come to nothing. Now the reward for general manager Sam Presti’s patience is a young team of champions who stand a good chance of finally breaking the post-Warriors NBA’s cycle of parity. This Thunder roster looks likely to stay intact for the next few seasons – and who, legitimately, will stand in their way of a second ring? The Celtics’ hopes of another title to complement last year’s depend onJayson Tatum’s achilles; the Jokić-led Nuggets look a few players short of a champion roster; Ant’s Timberwolves aren’t ready; the Lakers have prime Luka but an aging LeBron, plus a loomingchange of ownership to contend with. Perhaps the Thunder’s stiffest challengers next year will be the ones they’ve just faced.A word, then, for the fallen. In their strutlessness, commitment, and lack of ego, this Indiana team resemble nothing so much as their vanquisher last night. As they put together their historic run to the finals – the franchise’s first in 25 years – they took on the air of a team of destiny, an ensemble for whom no deficit was too great and no amount of time to reverse it too small. For a brief moment last night, as 6ft 1in point guard TJ McConnell, asked to step up in place of the injured Haliburton, repeatedly blew past Holmgren, a man one foot his superior, and conjured a string of evading layups high off the glass, it seemed like the masters of the comeback were about to pull off their greatest heist yet. Instead the Thunder gradually reasserted control, Holmgren rediscovered the gift of his wing span, and as the final quarter began the fans at Paycom Center got the celebrations under way.In years to come the defining image of the night – and of this season – may not be of Gilgeous-Alexander accepting the finals MVP award with a rueful grin, or of Caruso pumping the home crowd when victory was all but assured. Instead it will be of a stricken Haliburton thumping the court in distress toward the end of the first quarter as he understood that his achilles, like his participation in the title decider, was done. The exit of the Pacers star, who started these playoffs saddled with the tag of the NBA’smost overrated playerand ends them widely hailed asarguably the most clutch playerthat basketball has seen since Kobe Bryant, robbed the spectacle of some of its tension, however valiant the Tyrese-eless Pacers’ resistance remained in the face of looming defeat. But their miraculous run to the finals will not be forgotten soon: the Thunder may have had the most complete season, but no team in this year’s NBA has produced better quarters than Indiana. Haliburton will be back, maybe even before the end of next season – and the Pacers will be restless to complete the last step of the journey begun with last season’s eastern conference finals appearance and this year’s advance to the big dance.Polite, young, considerate, and barkingly competitive on the court, these two teams seem set to define professional basketball for the next decade. The NBA has officially entered its nice guy era – and if it goes on to produce more postseasons as absorbing as this year’s, all the grumbles about the league’s lack of personalities and swagger, all the agita about the end of basketballing cool and American MVPs and Anthony Edwards being the sport’s only hope will, one imagines, fairly quickly fade into history.Explore more on these topicsOklahoma City ThunderIndiana PacersNBABasketballUS sportsNBA finalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The session was shorter than usual and staff tried to cool the squad down by putting fans and water sprays on the pitch.Fifa again under scrutiny for World Cup’s increased carbon footprintRead moreYet it remained impossible for Chelsea to do much physical work given that forecasters said the heat index, or “feels like” temperature, was at 41C (106F) owing to the humidity, with a heatwave covering much of the central and eastern areas of the US expected to become even more testing as the week progresses. Local authorities have urged people to avoid strenuous activity.“It is almost impossible to train or to make a session because of the weather,” Maresca said on Monday. “Now we are trying just to save energy for the game. This morning’s session has been very, very, very short. It’s been just about tomorrow’s game, planning for tomorrow, and that’s it. We are going to try to do our best. We will try to win tomorrow.”Predictions that the temperature will drop to 34C when Chelsea and Espérance, the Tunisian champions, kick off at 9pm local time on Tuesday will be counteracted by it being expected to feel like 40C. “We have the cooling break during the game which helps a little,” Maresca said. “Tomorrow will be our 60th game of the season. The ones who had international games had even more. We try to give them as much time as possible for recovery.”Chelsea need to respond after losing against Flamengo last Friday. They need to draw with Espérance to avoid an early exit and know that victory against the Tunisian champions will not be enough to top the group, meaning Maresca’s team are likely to face Bayern Munich in the last 16 in Charlotte on Saturday.Maresca rotated against Flamengo and will make more changes against Espérance. Reece James is a doubt after missing training through illness and Nicolas Jackson is suspended. Maresca said Chelsea are partly using the tournament to experiment with new ideas as they have a shortened pre-season but he insisted that the club’s owners have not spoken to him about the potential for the winners of theClub World Cupto earn £97m in prize money. “The owners just want the best for us and for the players, game by game,” the Italian said. “They are not talking about the final reward in terms of money.”Maresca’s comments come after critics warnedFifathat it should postpone the fixture on Tuesday between Bayern Munich and Benfica owing to the risks faced by players and spectators from extreme heat. The heat index when the teams walk out in Charlotte at 3pm local time is likely to exceed 41C, according to forecasts monitored by the organisation Fossil Free Football. “Fifa must act to protect players, fans and the future of its flagship summer tournaments,” a Fossil Free Football spokesperson said. “That means postponing this match but also dropping polluting sponsors, turning away from petrostate partners and stopping the endless expansion of its competitions.”The expanded Club World Cup has been beset by challenges related to hot weather, with players and coaches complaining about the conditions andfans reportinginsufficient shade and access to water at the Paris Saint-Germain v Atlético Madrid match, which was played in the uncovered Pasadena Rose Bowl at noon on the opening Sunday. According to data compiled by the Guardian, 12 of the tournament’s 32 teams have averaged gametime temperatures of 30C (85F) or greater, with every team having played two matches at the time of writing.The Group C match between Bayern and Benfica will be played at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is customarily used by the Carolina Panthers NFL team and offers no cover over the vast majority of its 75,000 seats.Asked about the prospect of playing in such high temperatures, Bayern’s striker Harry Kane said: “I’m not too bothered by the heat. In football, you have to adapt. For me and the other England boys here, this is really useful. We’ll be more used to what we’ll face next year, and I’m sure the conditions will be quite similar.”Fossil Free Football has criticised what it calls Fifa’s “business as usual” approach to the tournament. The governing body has introduced no new measures to deal with the prevalent heat and has not accepted requests by the international players’ union Fifpro to increase the number of cooling breaks for players or lower the temperatures at which they can be taken.A Fifa spokesperson said: “Fifa’s top priority is the health of everyone involved in football, and Fifa’s medical experts have been in regular contact with the clubs participating in the FifaClub World Cup 2025to address heat management and acclimatisation.“Fifa will continue to monitor the weather conditions in coordination with the venue teams to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.”Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025ChelseaFifaClub World CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The recovery time for a basketball player with a torn achilles tendon typically ranges from eight to 10 months.Thunder’s thrilling nerd juggernaut ushers in NBA’s nice guy eraRead moreWith five minutes left of the first quarter on Sunday, Haliburton pushed off his right foot to initiate a drive to the basket. But instead of maneuvering past Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, he fell to the floor in agony. As the Thunder went the other way for a dunk, Haliburton pounded the floor with his fist and was unable to put weight on his injured leg while being escorted to the locker room.Without Haliburton, the Pacers were outscored 56-43 in the second half as Oklahoma City won the championship with a 103-91 victory.“I could not imagine that happening in the biggest game of my life,” said Gilgeous-Alexander after the game when asked about Haliburton’s injury. “It is so unfortunate, it is not fair.”The 25-year-old Haliburton had been playing through a strained right calf, an injury he is believed to have suffered in Indiana’s Game 5 loss at Oklahoma City.The two-time All-Star averaged 14.0 points, 5.9 assists and 4.6 rebounds during the NBA finals, andmade several clutch shotsduring his team’s run through the postseason.Fellow All-Stars Damian Lillard of the Milwaukee Bucks and Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics are currently recovering from torn achilles. They, too, suffered their injuries during this postseason. Haliburton’s injury also recalled one suffered by Kevin Durant during the NBA finals in 2019 – Durant missed the entire next season.Haliburton averaged 18.6 points, 9.2 assists and 3.5 rebounds in 73 games (all starts) during the regular season. He has career averages of 17.5 points, 8.8 assists and 3.7 rebounds in 333 games (294 starts) for the Sacramento Kings (2020-22) and Pacers.Explore more on these topicsIndiana PacersNBA finalsNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The event will be played in a streamlined two-day format during the week before the US Open. Raducanu says they first got to know each other at Wimbledon in 2021 and forged a friendly connection during their respective breakout runs at the US Open that year.Alcaraz beats Lehecka to extend win streak and regain crown as king of Queen’s ClubRead more“I remember he beat Stef [Tsitsipas] in the third round and it was like a big win, his breakout win on a big stage and it was really cool to kind of go through that tournament together. We have a good relationship still. He’s obviously overtaken me a lot, but it’s nice we have that from a while ago.”A few days aftertheir partnership was announced, Raducanu opted to catch a glimpse of Alcaraz at Queen’s Club during his semi-final win against Roberto Bautista Agut.“I saw some really cool drop volleys and I was like: ‘Yes, let’s save some of that!’ But he’s got plenty of magic to bring to New York,” she said.For the time being, Raducanu has more serious challenges to focus on than a glorified exhibition event. Her solid start to the grass court season at Queen’s Club, where she reached the quarter-finals and re-established herself as the British No 1, was soured by further problems with back spasms, which have troubled her on numerous occasions this year. Raducanuwithdrew from the Berlin Openlast week.“It’s OK,” she said. “I’m still managing it, to be honest. I have good days and bad days with it. I trained a fair bit last week in London and it was good. I was getting a lot of treatment and then woke up pretty stiff at the weekend, took a day off and then trained yesterday and today, but it needs a lot of work and it is up and down. So I’m just trying to manage it as best as I can.”Raducanu, the No 7 seed, will face Ann Li in the first round at Eastbourne, her final tournament before Wimbledon begins next week.She says she is doing everything she can to ensure that she is in top physical shape and form for her biggest tournament of the year. “Needles, soft tissue, some ­muscle ­stimulation stuff, taping, everything,” Raducanu said. “It’s just ongoing, but it’s OK. It seems to be OK today.”Raducanu also thanked Wimbledon for stopping a man who had been stalking her from buying tickets for this year’s tournament. The man attended four events featuring Raducanu in February and she was in tears when she saw him in the stands at the DubaiTennisChampionships.

Atlético Madrid’s Jan Oblak, however, stretched out to keep the match scoreless.Chelsea training cut short due to ‘impossible’ heat in PhiladelphiaRead moreJulián Alvarez nearly gave Atlético Madrid the lead just before the half.

At Euro 2022Norway lost 8-0 to Englandand exited at the group stage while at the World Cup a year later the Barcelona star Caroline Graham Hansen was benched for the second game and came out swinging towards the coaching staff after the final whistle. They made it out of the group but lost meekly to Japan 3-1 in the last 16.It is a new start in many ways for this team: there is a new head coach, the Englishwoman Gemma Grainger, and she has implemented a new formation. More important, perhaps, she began in February 2024 to build a new, more harmonious culture. A year later she gave the captain’s armband to Ada Stolsmo Hegerberg, who is extremely motivated to lead Norway to success this summer.“It’s been a long journey with the national team for me,” Hegerberg said when she was appointed the team’s new leader, replacing Maren Mjelde. “Standing here and getting that trust from Gemma is a great feeling.”However, while spirits are high and the group seem to be working better together, they have struggled to find any rhythm on the pitch, especially going forward. In their six Nations League matches this campaign they scored only four goals and won only two of the games. Grainger is unconcerned, though. “It doesn’t worry me. It’s about winning matches and that’s what we’ve done,” she said after the 1-0 win against Switzerland that ended their campaign.It has been an awkward spring for Grainger with injuries hampering her selections. Most of them seem to have cleared in time for the tournament, though, with only the first-choice centre-backs, Mathilde Harviken and Guro Bergsvand, fitness doubts.NorwayThe coachGemma Graingergot off to a flying start with two wins and a combined scoreline of 8-0 against Croatia in the Nations League playoffs last year. The 42-year-old from Middlesbrough is a self-proclaimed football fanatic and most of her waking hours are spent watching or thinking about football. She’s already been a football coach for more than two decades; since the age of 19 Grainger has devoted herself to the occupation, with Silva Neid, the former Germany international and national-team head coach, as her idol. “She is the most successful female coach in history and has truly influenced how I am as a coach today,” she has said.Star playerIfCaroline Graham Hansen, technically brilliant and an artist on the pitch, can find her best form at the Euros, the vice-captain can take Norway a long, long way. At Barcelona she is usually seen on the right wing combining with Aitana Bonmatí, but for Norway she has more of a free role, finding space behind Ada Hegerberg. Last year the 30-year-old finally got the recognition she deserves, finishing second in the Ballon d’Or, being included in the Fifa Best team and winning Norway’s Kniksen award.One to watchThe way she has been playing this year, it wouldn’t be a surprise ifSigne Gaupsettook the Euros by storm. At the age of 20, she has utterly dominated the Norwegian Toppserien. The talented Molde native has a mature style of play and is adept at both defending and attacking, proving her worth every time she has been given the chance by Gemma Grainger. Despite interest from a lot of clubs abroad this winter, Gaupset extended her contract with Brann until the summer of 2027. It will be interesting to see how long they can hold on to her.View image in fullscreenSigne Gaupset (left) takes on Switzerland’s Smilla Vallotto during a Nations League match in June 2025.Photograph: Marius Simensen/Bildbyrån/ShutterstockProbable lineupView image in fullscreenStatus of domestic top-flightMore than 73,000 women and girls are registered as football players in Norway and it is the most popular sport for women in the country.

The league is still semi-professional with teams such as Vålerenga, Brann, Rosenborg and LSK Kvinner dominating both on and off the pitch. Encouragingly clubs in Norway’s second tier are increasing their financial support for their women’s team and are on the rise.Realistic aim in SwitzerlandThey will aim to win their group – and should do so.

They would have to pay around double that for Eze, who was one of the Premier League’s most eye-catching performers in the final weeks of last season. It has been reported that Eze’s contract contains a £68m release clause.The 26-year-old scored his first goal for England in the World Cup qualifying winagainst Latvia on 24 Marchand it was the trigger for him to finish the campaign in arguably the form of his career. He scored nine in 13 matches for Palace, including twoin the 2-0 league victory at Spursand then the winnerin the FA Cup final against Manchester City.Eze can play wide or as a No 10 while the England manager, Thomas Tuchel, even used him as a second striker in the friendly defeat against Senegal two weeks ago. Tuchel is a huge fan. Eze is represented by the influential CAA Base agency, which has a number of players at Spurs, including the captain, Son Heung-min, James Maddison and Pape Sarr.Son’s longer-term situation at Spurs is unclear. He has one year to run on his contract and will be 34 next summer.

Last season Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the eague, while Cunha managed 15.Meanwhile,Chelseaare weighing up whether to revive their interest in the United winger Alejandro Garnacho and include Christopher Nkunku a deal. The Chelsea head coach, Enzo Maresca, wants to sign a new wide player this summer. Garnacho was of interest to Chelsea in January and could become a target again if the club fail in their attempt to sign Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund. Bayern have entered the race to sign Gittens.Garnacho and Nkunku are out of favour at their respective clubs. Nkunku has struggled with injuries since joining Chelsea two years ago and has not been a regular under Maresca. The versatile France forward is an option for United, although sources have cautioned that they have other targets in his position, including Mbeumo.While no formal contact with United has yet been made regarding Nkunku, Chelsea are expected to do so. Last January the United head coach, Ruben Amorim, considered a move for the forward, although he was considered a stopgap option at that time.Nkunku was signed for £52m in summer 2023 but has managed only 43 appearances, scoring 14 times. The France international has played only six minutes at the Club World Cup – entering as a substitute in Chelsea’s 2-0 opening group game win against Los Angeles FC. On Monday Maresca, insisted: “Christo is with us. He is our player. He is doing very well in the last four or five days to be honest. So probably also we can think of giving him some chances.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 26-year-old is understood to be disappointed by the structure of Liverpool’s offer, with his representatives believed to be pushing for a higher basic wage after the offer was heavily based on meeting certain performance targets.Failure to agree a new contract with Konaté before the end of the summer would leave Liverpool with a dilemma given the furore over Alexander-Arnold’s move to Real Madrid. Although Liverpool eventuallybanked £10m for Alexander-Arnoldbecause of Madrid’s determination to sign him in time to play at the Club World Cup that fee is a fraction of his value.Andy Robertson is also about to enter the final 12 months of his contract, with Liverpool willing tosell him to Atlético Madridif the left-back wants to leave.

Funding has partly come from Arthur M Blank, who owns three sports teams in Atlanta, and executives are confident everything is on schedule for the doors to open in April.Those driving the project, which is expected to cost up to $250m, see it as a gamechanger for football in the US. They have travelled to Europe to observe other training centres and find out what works best. It helps that Matt Crocker, the technical director, previously worked at the Football Association. St George’s Park, home to England’s various national teams, is an obvious inspiration. Other sites visited by executives include Tottenham and Manchester City’s training grounds, Clairefontaine in France, the US Tennis Association and Olympics and Paralympics training venues.How the US men’s national team values diversity, even in the Trump eraRead more“I think it will be the gold standard,” says David Wright, US Soccer’s chief commercial officer. “It will combine sporting and non-sporting all in one facility. A lot of times it’s either one or the other, but to have everything consolidated to one location is also a unique point of difference for us.”View image in fullscreenDavid Wright of USSF answers questions at the Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center.Photograph: Jason Allen/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty ImagesCindy Parlow Cone, the federation’s president, has made building the NTC one of the defining features of her tenure. Much is made of having a single central hub for the country’s 27 national teams. It is less than ideal that the federation currently has to arrange a different location during every international break. “Right now we have 27 national teams,” Chelle Adams, US soccer’s chief financial officer, says. “Every time we have a camp for any of our national teams we have to go out, we have to source fields, hotels, transportation. We ship our equipment all over the United States – and internationally. Now we’re all underneath one location. It’ll provide consistency, so our teams know they’re coming here. We’ll be able to host multiple teams at one time as well.”The facility is a building site at the moment – health and safety regulations means proper tours are currently out of the question – but in the end there will be two beach courts, one futsal pitch, 13 grass pitches and three artificial pitches. Indoor facilities and plenty of locker rooms are other features.A lot of time and effort is going into making sure the grass is of the highest standard. The one surprise is there is no plan for accommodation facilities. There is also talk of developing players, coaches and referees.View image in fullscreenA rendering of what the blue locker room will look like.Illustration: USSFThe project has an aspirational aspect. There is excitement at youth players being able to mingle with members of the senior squad in the canteen. It is about building connections; about ensuring pathways remain open for development squads. “You’ve got youth fields set below the senior national team field,” Wright said. “You could be a youth player who has aspirations to play for the senior national team and you’re looking up saying: ‘I want to get there one day.’ That’s a great example of the attention to detail we serve as an inspiration.View image in fullscreenA rendering of what the exterior of the training center will look like.Illustration: USSF“I also think it’s going to be a heartbeat for the sport. We’ve got our national teams, but we also make them think about coaching education, referee certification. You’ll start to see this really become the hub and go to for all things soccer.”Atlanta is the self-styled epicentre of football in the States. Atlanta United, who play in the striking Mercedes-Benz Stadium, averaged crowds close to 45,000 for their Major League Soccer fixtures last season. Having the NTC nearby makes sense. “We did a very comprehensive study that looked at dozens of markets throughout the country,” Wright says. “But when you factor in the climate, proximity to Europe for ease of player transportation, corporate support and a host of other factors it became pretty clear that Atlanta made sense.”Adams points out that the NTC will help the local economy. Hundreds of staff are relocating from the federation’s offices in Chicago and no one is complaining that the grand opening will come just before the World Cup. “I think it should come as no surprise,” Wright says. “The timing is perfect. There’s this crescendo behind this work.“Clearly there’s some connectivity there. But I think it’s more from a macro perspective. We think about where the sport’s going and this is just one of many indicators of the growth of the game.”Explore more on these topicsUSAUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The bancontains an exemptionthat could apply to players, staff or associated families with teams at the 2026 Fifa World Cup.Iran, who faced USA in the group stage of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, qualified in March for their fourth consecutive World Cup. Although 2026 is also being hosted by Canada and Mexico, only by being given a specific slot in group A couldIranavoid playing in the US, with their matches then taking place in Mexico.Fifa again under scrutiny for World Cup’s increased carbon footprintRead moreIf Iran won that group they would stay in Mexico for their last-32 game and any last-16 match. Should they go further – and they have never reached a World Cup knockout game – they would then play in the US.Fifa did not respond on Monday to a request for comment from the Guardian and will likely be considering its options before the World Cup draw, which is due to take place in December. The decision will be a difficult one for its president,Gianni Infantino, who has associated himself closely with President Donald Trump, who authorised the use of US bombs on Iranian nuclear sites last weekend.Infantino and theFifaCouncil will have the final say on inclusion in the competition and the makeup of the draw, but the organising committee for Fifa competitions will be expected to have input. The committee has members from Canada, Mexico and Iran, and its chair is Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin. In 2022, his organisation announced that Ukraine and Belarus would be kept apart in Uefa competition draws, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and his action may provide an example for Fifa to follow.Before the World Cup draw in Qatar, the agreed draw constraints included limitations on where teams could be selected but this related only to a “general principle” that no more than one team from each confederation (excluding Europe) should appear in a given group.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026IranWorld CupFifaGianni InfantinoFootball politicsTrump travel banShareReuse this content"

In a move that could be a major boost to Palace’s hopes of playing inthe Europa League next season, it is understood thatJohnson’s offer of £190mfor Textor’s 44.9% stake was signed on Sunday evening in the US.The 78-year-old, who has owned the Jets since 2000 and missed out on buying Chelsea in 2022 after making a $2bn offer, must pass the Premier League’s owners’ and directors’ test before he can complete the purchase. But it is understood that, with Palace under pressure from Uefa to comply with its regulations on multiclub ownership, the league is expected to act swiftly to aid their cause.‘A perfect storm’: multi-club ownership, Crystal Palace and a looming court threatRead moreA decision on the FA Cup winners’ participation in the Europa League is due this week, although it is believed this latest development will be looked on favourably by Uefa. ­Textor has come under ­increasing pressure from Palace’s chair, Steve Parish, and the other co-owners – ­Textor’s fellow Americans Josh Harris and David Blitzer – to complete the sale as quickly as possible.The four Palace co-owners were part of the delegation that attended a meeting at Uefa’s headquarters in Nyon this month and argued that Textor, the majority shareholder in the French club Lyon, who have also qualified for the Europa League, does not have a decisive influence at Selhurst Park despite being the largest shareholder. It is expected that Johnson’s arrival should clear the way for Oliver ­Glasner’s side to take their place in the league stage.It remains to be seen whether the former US ambassador to the UK, who has made no secret of his desire to buy an English football club, has his sights on a full takeover. Harris and Blitzer, who bought stakes worth a combined 36% in 2015 and have portfolios of investments across a number of sports, are believed to be willing to sell, owing to concerns about the ballooning costs of ­building a new main stand which some sources are predicting could reach up to £240m.Textor, who failed withan audacious attempt at a takeoverof ­Palace in May in a last-ditch attempt to assume control, is understood to have been reluctant to leave the club in which he has invested about £180m since buying a 40% stake for almost £90m in August 2021. Yet he had a major falling-out with Parish, who owns just over 10% but is the executive chair of the managing company in charge of Palace and retains the casting vote, over ­resistance to embracing his Eagle Football network that also includes the South American champions Botafogo and the Belgian side Daring Brussels.View image in fullscreenJohn Textor has come under increasing pressure to complete the sale.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersTextor is expected to turn his attention to another English club. The former Palace owner Simon Jordan has revealed that he recommended to Textor buying the Championship side Sheffield Wednesday, who were last week hit with aban on transfer spendinguntil 2027 for the repeated failure to pay players’ wages. “I was talking to John Textor the other day, and if he comes out of Palace, I was saying to him that is the football club you should be buying if you want to buy another English club,” said Jordan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Should they reach their target it would be the highest successful run chase at Headingley – or for that matter anywhere in England – for 77 years, beating by nine the 362 they scored inthe extraordinary Ashes encounter here in 2019.KL Rahul, the anti-Pant, torments England with precision of a maths nerd | Simon BurntonRead more“We’re really confident,” Tongue said. “If you look at our batting lineup it’s obviously very strong. We play a positive brand of cricket. So I think chasing 371 is going to be a good thing for us to do. I feel like with that batting lineup we can chase down anything. Their bowlers are obviously going to bowl well in periods of the game. It’s just soaking up that pressure and then reapplying it back on to them.“We’ll go for the win. That’s the clear message in the changing room. It’s just being as positive as we can. I don’t see why we can’t chase that down.”Tongue said of the wicket that “when they were batting it flattened out”, but KL Rahul, one of two Indian centurions alongside Rishabh Pant, said that had not been his experience across 247 balls at the crease. Forecasting “a blockbuster finish”, he warned England that their aggression could be their undoing.“There’s definitely going to be a result. That’s what England have said very openly and their style of cricket suggests that,” he said. “That gives us a good opportunity to pick up 10 wickets. It was a very tricky wicket – I spent a lot of time batting out there and I didn’t feel set at all at any stage. With this wicket you never know what to expect.”Though both enjoyed considerable success Rahul’s precise strokeplay contrasted markedly with the charismatic and unconventional approach of Pant. “You just stand there and admire and sometimes scratch your head about the shot selection and the cricket that he plays,” Rahul said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ben Stokes and his side need 350 more runs to beat India and, with 10 wickets in hand, will no doubt believe another miracle is possible on a ground withsomething of a reputation for them.And yet a target of 371 to win, set up by a pair of wonderful centuries fromKL Rahul with 137and Rishabh Pant with 118, may also put to the test their long-held contempt for the draw. ­Jasprit Bumrah is eyeing three out of the five matches in this series and dodging defeat in one of those he plays would surely be a ­positive outcome.‘We can chase anything’: Tongue bullish as England look to overhaul India totalRead moreBy the same token, India will be desperate to cash in on Bumrah’s presence here and with England needing the second-highest successful chase in their history – albeit with No 1 coming against Indiaat Edgbaston three years ago– the tourists are clearly strong favourites. No wickets fell before stumps on day four as Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley reduced the target by 21 runs. The task, however, remains significant.If there was encouragement to be found for England beyond some possible showers, it was that the surface remained relatively good for batting on day four. Until a late rush of wickets during the hunt for quick runs, India had been largely untroubled en route to 364 all out, with Pant becoming just the second wicketkeeper in history after Zimbabwe’s Andy Flower to make twin centuries in a Test.Albeit this may in turn have said something about England’s attack, which has toiled in the main and may well need a rejig before the ­second Test. All eyes will be onJofra Archer’s continuing exploitsin ­Chester‑le‑Street, even if it would still be a gamble to throw the fast bowler into his first Test for four years after a solitary county outing.Perhaps the biggest question before the series moves to Edgbaston next week is how exactly they stop Pant scoring. The left-hander may play in an unorthodox way that tricks bowlers into thinking a chance is just around the corner but he now has three centuries and two fifties from his past five innings in this country.He was at it again here, ­striding out after Brydon Carse had ­castled Shubman Gill for eight with the ­seventh ball of the morning and ­starting out like a man with itching powder in his slacks. But whether taking on Rahul’s calm by osmosis, or simply regretting an early hack that flew over the slips, Pant silenced the devil on his shoulder and set about constructing his half of a critical fourth-wicket stand worth 195 runs.View image in fullscreenRishabh Pant tries to scoop the ball during his second century of the match.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAIt was initially the kind of slow grind to which England are themselves largely averse, India adding just 28 runs to their overnight 90 for two in the first hour as they saw off a probing initial burst from Carse and Chris Woakes. Pant was heard on the stump microphones telling himself to calm down, while Rahul was kept honest by a couple of deliveries that spat up from the seamers at the ­Kirkstall Lane end.There was one chance that came and went before lunch – the latest sliding doors moment in a Test riddled with them – when Josh Tongue produced some extra lift and Rahul, on 58, guided it high to gully. But Harry Brook could not cling on above his head and the partnership continued to swell, rolling into an afternoon during which the odd edge flew through vacant slips and both batters secured personal milestones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWith Pant breathing down his neck from what was a standing start, Rahul was first there as a driven two off Shoaib Bashir turned his overnight 47 into an eighth Test century away from home. The 33-year-old celebrated as he played overall, coolly removing his helmet and acknowledging the ovation his patience had earned.For Pant, the chief question was whether he might bring out the ­forward somersault witnessed in the first innings. But despite being urged to do so by Sunil Gavaskar from the pavilion – the former India opener was among his harshest ­critics ­during the tour of Australia last ­winter – Pant kept it low-key, overcoming a bit of cat and mouse in the nineties and marking the moment with a look to the heavens.Having crashed three sixes to make it a record nine struck in a Test in England, Pant eventually holed out off Bashir and India reached 298 four at tea. Thereafter something of a collapse unfolded, the tourists losing six for 31 to the second new ball including three in four deliveries for Tongue. Among these was Mohammed Siraj via a glove behind, the fast bowler walking off wringing his hand in pain.Any Indian fears – or English hopes – that this might impair Siraj with the ball were soon dispelled, however, when he fizzed down two of the six overs before stumps. Besides, if England are to pull this one off, Bumrah is the quick who must be tamed.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Red-ball cricket had been waiting for Jofra Archer for 1,501 days but theSussexcaptain, John Simpson, was playing by his own timetable. He threw the new ball to Ollie Robinson – another bowler with an England shadow stuck to his boot – and Gurinder Sandhu. It was half an hour before Archer was called up from long leg to take onDurham.For those whose memories of Archer are forever Lord’s 2019, Smith down on the burning deck, his first spell back was nothing more than solid. A couple of maidens, a handful of bouncers: 4-2-11-0. His second spell, after lunch, once he had checked that everything was in full working order, was spicier. Will Rhodes survived a toe-crusher, before Emilio Gay’s luck ran out and he was lbw to a rapid rasper low on the pad. Colin Ackerman was greeted with a snorter and there were a couple of those missiles that hone in on the body. One further spell made it 14 overs and one wicket for the day, and a nod of approval from Headingley.On the other side of the country, Jimmy Anderson grabbed a couple of early wickets at Blackpool where the wind ran up the trouser leg and scampered out of the collar.

He endured a torrid comeback, twice dropping the ball before he was sent to the sin-bin for his clothesline tackle on the French fly-half Antoine Hastoy, his yellow card subsequently upgraded to red.Lions warn Joe Schmidt over Wallabies player release for tour matchesRead moreOn Sunday, Feyi-Waboso was handed a three-match ban, which will be reduced to two provided he completes “tackle school”. As a result, the 22-year-old wing misses the two Tests against Argentina next month but is available to face USA in Washington.If his inclusion in the 36-man squad – co-captained by Jamie George and George Ford – is a ­surprise, it demonstrates just how important a playerSteve Borthwickconsiders Feyi‑Waboso to be. Before Saturday he had not played since December because of a shoulder injury after his return was delayed amid confusion as to whether he would undergo surgery.It is understood, however, that Borthwick sees value in having Feyi‑Waboso with the squad in Argentina with an eye on the future as well as to provide competition to the other wings in training with Will Muir, Cadan Murley and Tom Roebuck selected. Feyi-Waboso’s inclusion means he will stay fresh should the British & Irish Lions come calling but, as things stand, his ban does not expire until after England’s second Test against Argentina on 12 July, a week before Andy Farrell’s side play their first Test against Australia.Feyi-Waboso was handed an enhanced contract by the Rugby Football Union last October and is sure to be on the list that Borthwick names after the summer tour. That England do not have their usual week’s training camp before their autumn Tests may also explain why the head coach believes Feyi-Waboso warrants a place in the summer squad. Elsewhere, Borthwick has made two changes to the squad that was announced last Monday to prepare for the fixture against the France XV. Ben Curry comes in for Jack ­Kenningham while Raffi Quirke is replaced by Harry Randall. Both Curry and Randall were with the squad for rehabilitation last week but have been deemed fit to make the touring party. George Furbank and Fraser Dingwall were also rehabbing last week but have not been considered for selection.In total, Borthwick has selected 10 uncapped players with Muir joined by Bath teammates Max Ojomoh and Guy Pepper. The Gloucester trio of Seb Atkinson, Charlie Atkinson and Arthur Clark are also selected along with Oscar Beard, Joe Carpenter, Luke Northmore and Emmanuel Iyogun.“The three-Test series is a huge challenge and a valuable opportunity for the continued development of this squad,” Borthwick said. “For some of the younger players, this will be their first experience of touring overseas with England. Travelling together helps strengthen team bonds and offers a valuable chance for new players to integrate into our environment.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The squad had to call off their post-arrival recovery dip in the Indian Ocean – a letdown for local news crews and the lurking sharks off Cottesloe beach – because of incle­ment weather and the first media squall of the trip has also blown in.The Lions chief executive, Ben Calveley, has made clear the ­touring side expects Joe Schmidt, the Wallabies head coach, to make hisnational players availablefor their Super Rugby teams before the Test series commencing next month and the host nation has been gently reminded of that contractual detail following the Lions’ arrival in Australia.“The agreement is very clear; it says that Test players have to be released to play in fixtures leading into that series,” Calveley said at the Lions’ official welcome overlooking the Swan River. “That is our expec­tation. It’s really important that these games are competitive.Andy Farrell’s Lions land in Australia aiming to revive the spirit of SydneyRead more“It’s not just for a performance standpoint – the players do want to test themselves and build towards the Test series – but it’s also right for the fans, partners and broadcasters who are all expecting competitive fixtures, and for the rugby-loving public. That would be their expectation as well.”The opening game against ­Western Force should fulfil that criteria with Nic White, Darcy Swain and Nick Champion de Crespigny all ­potentially available to face the Lions on Saturday. But another couple of ­Wallaby squad members, Carlo ­Tizzano and Ben Donaldson, have been retained in camp by Schmidt before Australia’s warm-up Test against Fiji next week and it remains unclear how many will represent the Lions’ next clutch of opponents.“We’ll see a competitive fixture at the weekend and that’s what we’re looking for,” Calveley said. “We want to make sure our guys are ­battle-hardened when it comes to that Test series against the Wallabies.”Following the Western Force game, the next three fixtures are against the Reds, the Waratahs and the ­Brumbies, and the Lions tour manager, Ieuan Evans, is similarly keen to encounter the strongest possible opposition. “I think what’s clear is that we are an elite sporting touring team and we need to be challenged and tested in our preparations towards the Tests,” Evans said.Discussions, accordingly, will continue with Australian officials, although the requirements of the ­Australia-Fiji game in Newcastle will clearly complicate the situation. The Lions, meanwhile, insist there are no plans to divert from their traditional tour rota but Calveley did say he was potentially open to the idea of the Lions touring other countries such as France in future. “You can certainly understand why people would get excited about that sort of concept. We would as well,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The veteran midfielder is a target for Galatasaray withPep Guardiola having hinted he could be allowed to leave.Yet the 34-year-old said: “I have one more year left on my contract and I’m very happy here – I think everybody knows that. I am enjoying my football. I still believe I have several years in me at the highest level by taking good care of myself. I’ve proven last season when I didn’t miss a game. I’m available, I’m fit, I want to play at the highest level for much longer.”Manchester City open to letting Ilkay Gündogan join GalatasarayRead moreGundogan scored twice in Sunday’s 6-0 win over Al Ainat Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The victory secured Manchester City’s passage to the last-16 but Juventus have to be beaten if they are to top Group G and probably avoid Real Madrid in the first knockout round.Gundogan said: “At the end if you’re not able to beat Juventus then they might deserve it [win the group]. A seventh goal would have given us a higher probability but it also doesn’t matter: we need a good performance against Juve and to win the game. That is not going to change the way we approach it.”The German was unhappy at how City performed as the break neared. “There were short periods where we were not that precise in terms of our passing and the way we played.“It’s something we need to observe and get better at because at the highest level you should not allow yourself to be not good for such a long time. It felt quite long to be honest. It felt at least five or 10 minutes too long in terms of the standards we have.“Unfortunately, we didn’t start the second half good enough [either]. We were a bit slow and it felt a bit that it cost us that one goal at the end that we needed.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gritty draws achieved by Palmeiras against Porto and Fluminense against Borussia Dortmund at theClub World Cupwere enough to start a conversation. But the underdog heroics of Brazil’s other two clubs have shaken up how we see club football across the world.For the first time sinceCorinthians shocked Chelsea in Yokohama in 2012, when some Brazilian fans sold their homes and vehicles to make the trip, the reigning Copa Libertadores champions have beaten the Champions League winners. Igor Jesus, who has been strongly linked to Nottingham Forest, scored the only goal of the game as Botafogo beat Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, a special setting for Brazilians given it is where they won the World Cup in 1994 and honoured the recently deceased Ayrton Senna.Not to be outdone by their Rio rivals, Flamengo erased some of the hurt of losing to Liverpool in 2019 – when the Brazil forward Roberto Firmino scored the winner – by beating Chelsea 3-1 to guarantee a place in the knockouts. It was also the first time a Brazilian club has beaten a European side by two goals sinceVasco da Gama embarrassed Manchester United in 2000.“It was a remarkable victory, against a team that needs no introduction,” said Flamengo No 7 Luiz Araújo afterthe win against Chelsea. “It has a special flavour not only because of the size of the opponent, but also because of all our preparation and dedication up until now. We deserved the result and we want more.View image in fullscreenIgor Jesus celebrates after scoring for Botafogo against PSG.Photograph: Gregory Bull/APOld heads will be quick to remind us that this is the usual order being restored. Throughout the 20th century, Brazilian sides regularly got the better of those from the Old Continent. Pelé scored five goals as Santos beat Benfica 8-4 over two legs in the 1962 Intercontinental Cup final; he scored four in the final the following year as Santos saw off the mighty Milan. In 1981,Flamengothrashed Liverpool in the final; and in the 1990s São Paulo beat Barcelona’s “Dream Team” in 1992 and then dispatched the great Milan team of the era the following year.There were valid arguments for the Brasileirão being the strongest domestic league in the world. At the Club World Championship in 2000 – a similar tournament to the one in the United States this year – the best European sides visited Brazil and were soundly beaten. Manchester United, fresh off winning the treble, and Real Madrid did not qualify from their group. Two Brazilian clubs – Corinthians and Vasco da Gama – contested the final.Despite the odd recent victory for Brazilian clubs – such as São Paulo beating Liverpool in 2005, Internacional overcoming Barcelona in 2006, and Corinthians winning againstChelseain 2012 – the tide has turned against them in this century. A generation ago, when Brazilian clubs were under less pressure to sell their stars, players such as Rivaldo and Roberto Carlos did not move across the Atlantic until they were well into their 20s, keeping the league strong. Now, however, the clubs are financially mismanaged and have to sell their best talents for a relative pittance when they are teenagers. On top of that, TV rights money in Europe and the financial doping of state-run clubs provided further disparity.‘Sorry, sorry, sorry’: Jackson apologises for red card as Flamengo stun ChelseaRead moreAt the Club World Cup, however, matters are being decided between the white lines and away from the boardroom. “Football is played on the pitch, 11 against 11,” says Araújo. “We have great teams in Brazil who are all capable of facing any team in the world. Flamengo always goes on the pitch to win, regardless of who is on the other side.”The facts don’t lie. The four Brazilian teams are unbeaten in the tournament and top of their groups, having scored 14 goals and conceding just four. “The victories show the strength of Brazilian football,” saysFluminensemanager Renato Gaúcho, who dismisses the argument that European sides are tired after a long season. “If a Brazilian club loses, they say: ‘Ah, Brazilian football can’t measure up to European football’. If they win, they say: ‘Ah, European football is coming back from holiday’. That doesn’t exist in football!”He points out that the teams usually meet at the end of the calendar year, when Brazilian clubs are coming off an even more exhausting season. “When European football catches Brazilian clubs having played between 70 and 80 games a year, nobody makes that excuse. Nobody says: ‘Ah, the Brazilian team is tired’. When the European team crushes them, then they say: ‘Ah, we really can’t measure up to them.’ Brazilian football has been having a great Mundial, overcoming powerful opponents and achieving results. This shows that money alone does not always win matches.“Yes, there is no way to compete with the Europeans in terms of finances; they can sign great players and form very strong teams, but football is decided on the field. And, on the field, today, Brazilian football and the Brazilian people have to be very proud of what Brazilian clubs have been doing. When many people didn’t believe this would happen, it is happening.”Palmeiras boss Abel Ferreira has also balked at the idea that European clubs are tired, saying the number of games “excuse” is “a lie” – and something that Brazilian clubs have had to cope with in the past. “When we go to the Mundial, we’re also at the end of the season. Porto has 50 games;Palmeirashas 36 already. And when we go to play in a Mundial, we’ll have more than 70 games. These are excuses.”View image in fullscreenFlamengo fans enjoy their 3-1 win against Chelsea.Photograph: Will Oliver/EPATo their credit, Luis Enrique and Enzo Maresca did not make excuses and were very gracious in defeat. But not everyone has been as generous.Marc Cucurellasaid Chelsea struggled in the heat and the Borussia Dortmund substitutes ridiculously sat inside the dressing room for the first half against Mamelodi Sundowns when the temperature was just 30.5C.Mauro Cezar, a hugely popular pundit in Brazil, says the European teams showed “a certain arrogance” in not giving the tournament due respect. “European teams entered this tournament without taking it as seriously as those from other continents. Of course, the heat is a hindrance for them, as is the fact that it’s the end of the season. But if they have more money, better players and better coaches, they should compensate for these negative points by playing the minimum to overcome opponents who did not cause much concern, at least until the competition began.“These arguments are valid, but they do not justifyParis Saint-Germainbeing unable to score a goal against Botafogo and barely threatening; Monterey drawing with Inter; Borussia Dortmund almost losing to Fluminense and conceding three goals to a South African team; Porto being dominated by Palmeiras; and Flamengo crushing Chelsea for practically the entire time. Claiming that the competition is not important does not justify this sequence of results against teams with much lower investment. Not facing this reality is yet another sign of arrogance.”Araújo, who saw the Chelsea players close up on the field, pushes back on the idea that they do not care about the tournament. “No one goes on the field to lose; everyone wants to win,” says the Flamengo forward. “The game against Chelsea was very competitive. Everyone defends their family, their shirt and the fans who are in the stands cheering them on.”View image in fullscreenLuiz Araujo in action against Chelsea.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersThe Flamengo manager Filipe Luís, who spent most of his playing career in Europe at Atlético Madrid, Chelsea and Deportivo, believes that Brazilian clubs have rebalanced the scales at the tournament but cannot compete with the very best “eight or 10 clubs” from Europe. “Apart from this elite, Brazilians are at the same level as the second European tier because of how we compete, how we understand the game, how we adapt to the climatic and field conditions. This elite is superior to us, but on the field anyone can win.”As Cezar points out, the “big difference between Europe and South America is money”, with Chelsea alone investing €1.5bn in their squad. “This amount is equivalent to the combined debts of several Brazilian clubs; the disproportion is enormous. Since the European leagues have more global visibility and money, they naturally attract the best coaches and players. Consequently, they are more tactically, technically and even physically developed in some cases. However, when a Brazilian club, like Flamengo, which defeated Chelsea with authority, organises itself financially, with good players within the South American reality, and has a coach with a modern mentality, although very young and without much experience, the result is what we saw in Philadelphia.”We are only at the group stage of the Club World Cup but, whether it’s merely a Fifa cash grab or a holiday camp for the European teams, the tournament has served an unexpected purpose for Brazil. It has allowed Brazilians to take pride in the idea that not everything is always better over the water.This is an article byTom SandersonandJosué SeixasExplore more on these topicsClub World CupGuardian Sport NetworkClub World Cup 2025US sportsBotafogoFlamengoPalmeirasFluminensefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Agyemang touched the ball past goalkeeper Johny Placide and slotted into an open net for his fifth international goal and second of the tournament.The US, who opened with victories over Trinidad and Tobago and invited guest Saudi Arabia, won their group for the 17th time in 18 Gold Cups. The Americans have 43 wins, one loss and five draws in Gold Cup group play, going 3-0 for the seventh time.Using largely a B team in the tournament, the Americans already had clinched a spot in the quarter-finals against Mexico or Costa Rica next weekend.Haiti finished third on goal difference ahead of Trinidad and Tobago, who were eliminated when they wasted a lead in a 1-1 draw as the Saudis.The Gold Cup is the last competitive test for the 16th-ranked Americans before the World Cup. As co-hosts, the US, Mexico and Canada get automatic berths.In front of a sparse crowd at the 80,000-seat home of the Dallas Cowboys, one of next year’s World Cup venues, Tillman scored his third goal of the tournament when he headed the ball inside the far post from Brenden Aaronson’s cross in the 10th minute.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sometimes she would stand in the corner of the soundstage, says Allison Williams with a nervy laugh. “The dilemma is: do you turn her around so she’s facing the wall, or do you let her face the room? Both answers are wrong.”In the sequel to the sci-fi horror M3gan, Williams resumes her role as Gemma, a roboticist who has become a crusader against rampant and reckless AI development after her creation – developed for her orphaned niece – became murderous. (She is also a producer on the second film.)Acting opposite M3gan was unsettling, says Williams, speaking over a video call from a hotel room in New York. Sometimes she was played by the 15-year-old dancer Amie Donald, but often she was a robotic doll, animated by a small team. “When she’s been working for a while, her eyelids can get sticky,” says Williams. M3gan’s handlers would paint lubricant on to her eyeballs with a brush and Williams would have to catch herself: “She’s not flinching and for a second you’re like: ‘Ugh.’ Then you remember: this is not a live thing.”Still best known for her first role as Marnie inLena Dunham’s landmark TV series Girls, Williams has gravitated towards comedy-tinged horror in recent years. Her first post-Girls film role was in the Oscar-winning dark comedy horrorGet Out. It and M3gan were relatively low-budget projects that became cultural phenomena – Get Out for its commentary on racial politics, M3gan for what it says about the dangers of AI (as well as the uncanniness of M3gan herself).Watch the trailer for M3gan 2.0 – video.Williams has long been interested in AI – she knowsSam Altman, the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, which created ChatGPT, who put her in touch with robotics experts when she was researching the role of Gemma. The film raises questions not only about the danger of rogue AI, but about the ethical concerns –including how we should feel about the “rights” of devices. “It’s easy to imbue anything that has AI in it with humanity. Like our little robot vacuum we have at our house; I often feel it’s doing all this labour and being overlooked.”Does she worry that her job will be taken by AI in the not-too-distant future? She laughs. “If you ask me any question that starts with: ‘Are you worried?’ the answer is always yes, because I have an endless capacity to be worried about things.”But it’s possible, she says, that humans in acting, or any other job, are not special or unique and that “we will all be seamlessly replaced. But so far, especially in the arts, I haven’t yet had an experience that’s supposed to mimic a human output that has felt seamlessly human to me – and who knows if that’s going to be true for ever. For now, it’s towards the bottom of the list of things I worry about.” She smiles. “But it’s notnoton the list of things I worry about.”M3gan raises questions about the tech to which we expose our children. “You wouldn’t give your child cocaine,” says Gemma in M3gan 2.0. “Why would you give them a smartphone?” Williams’ son is three and she is wary of it. “He has so many questions and they’re incredible; I often don’t know the answers.” The other day, she says, she used ChatGPT to answer one about rocket launches. “Watching what happened to his face was like when Gemma sees her niece interacting with M3gan. Like, I have connected my kid to a drug, this is so immediately addictive and intoxicating.” She quickly put her phone away and made a mental note to go to the library next time to get out a book. “I can’t justify it, logically,” she says. “It just felt like an innate instinct.”View image in fullscreenCultural phenomenon … with Daniel Kaluuya in Get Out.Photograph: Justin Lubin/PAParenting is the central theme of the new podcast Williams launched this month with two friends, Hope Kremer, an early childhood educator, and Jaymie Oppenheim, a therapist. It came out of a group chat in which just about everything to do with motherhood, ageing and life in general was discussed. A future episode is about the guilt many mothers feel, which is also a theme in M3gan 2.0. Will our expectations of mothers ever change? “Oh God, I hope so,” says Williams. “The guilt, I think, is most potent in the absence of a community where you can voice the things that you feel guilt about. I think the guilt around what kind of parent we all are is something that only survives as long as we hold each other to insane standards and expectations.”She is, she says, “filled with rage about the majority of Instagram and TikTok ‘mom content’ – the aspirational version of it, anyway. I think it’s poisonous [and] it really only exists to make people feel bad about themselves, maybe under the guise of wanting to motivate people, but the impact is so painful.”She laughs as she describes the dishonesty of an influencer making a perfect packed lunch, filled with nutritious food – because it’s actually 4pm, perhaps, or because they have nannies – that makes other parents, primarily mothers, feel as if they are failing. “I would be in a puddle on the ground if we didn’t have the nanny that we have, who is the reason my husband is shooting in London right now and I’m here,” says Williams. “None of this is possible without her, and we’re so grateful. I’m just like, show your work. Show me a clock. Like, what day was this filmed?” She is laughing, but she is on a roll. “I cannot stand artifice about creating an expectation of what someone should be able to achieve that is totally unreasonable. Who is that helping?”View image in fullscreen‘We were easy targets’ …(from left)Lena Dunham, Zosia Mamet, Jemima Kirke and Williams in Girls.Photograph: PR Company HandoutOn another episode, she says, they discuss ageing and unrealistic beauty standards: “I talk about my love for Botox when I’m not filming, because, you know, you need to make facial expressions when you’re shooting.” She laughs. “But, right now, there’s not a ton I can do with my forehead. But the idea that someone would look at me and be, like: ‘I should be capable of that forehead.’ No, you shouldn’t! I’m not better than you because I have no wrinkles there, I just paid to put chemicals in my face. Let’s be real about this.”I always think it’s quite an achievement for famous people to hang on to pre-fame friends, once acclaim and money start getting in the way. Is it important to have “normal” friends? “I don’t walk the world and feel like a celebrity,” says Williams. “I think I did in my 20s, shooting and living in New York. But that isn’t how I feel dropping our son off at preschool; I feel like a person among people. My job is public, and that’s unique and weird, and our culture thinks it’s more important than other jobs, for sure. But, in our friend group, we celebrate what everyone’s up to and that has been such a stable, steady source of nourishment in my life.”Williams noticed recently that her son is about the same age she was when she realised acting could be a job and that she might one day do it (his father, Alexander Dreymon, is also an actor; Williams and Dreymon met on the 2020 thrillerHorizon Line). She watched bits of The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins and it dawned on her that the woman in both films was the same. “Julie Andrews was like a goddess to me,” she says.Her parents, the former NBC news anchor Brian Williams and the producer Jane Stoddard Williams, insisted she get an education, which she did (English at Yale), rather than become a child actor. “I’m grateful that my parents didn’t cave and that I didn’t make my way into this business any sooner than I did, because already, at 23, whenGirlscame out, that was a lot to process.”I’m not better than you because I have no wrinkles in my forehead, I just paid to put chemicals in my faceIn a way, Williams had the reverse experience – her parent was famous. At a time before media was so fragmented, being an NBC news anchor meant Brian Williams reached millions of people. His reputation took a battering in 2015, when it was revealed he had embellished – mistakenly, he said –a story about being shot down in a helicopterwhile covering the Iraq war. He was suspended for six months and left NBC shortly after.What was that like to go through as a family? “Anything that feels loud, like people are talking about you and all of that, is horrible,” says Williams. “I think it’s the underbelly of the media – it happens all the time, they eat their own. Everything just goes back to its fundamental priorities – family, friends, people who matter.”In the recent criticism ofnepo babies, Williams has always been admirably upfront and unguarded about her advantages. “Aside from all the many layers of privilege, high on the list is the fact that I could pursue a career in acting without being worried that I wasn’t going to be able to feed myself. I had been surrounded by people who did what I wanted to do.” It didn’t seem like an unreachable dream when Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, were family friends. When she was still at high school, she got a summer job as a production assistant on Robert Altman’sA Prairie Home Companionand got to be around its starry ensemble cast, which included Meryl Streep. “Having had that experience gives you a leg-up when finally it’s your turn and you have to know how to be on a set and how it all works.”Gratitude seems to be a defining theme in Williams’ life. She is happy she is not starting out now. There was huge hype around Girls during its six-year run, which ended in 2017, but she can’t imagine what that would be like with social media now. (Williams came off Instagram in 2020 – a time, she felt, when the platform was becoming more cynical and toxic.) It was, she says, as if there were “a gazillion think pieces about every episode that we did – and most thought we all took ourselves too seriously. We were all pretty privileged people who were the leads of this HBO show that was definitely skewering our own, but we weren’t given credit for that, or for being in on it.”View image in fullscreen‘When she’s been working for a while, her eyelids can get sticky’ … Gemma (Allison Williams) and Cady (Violet McGraw) with M3gan in the original film.Photograph: Geoffrey Short/Universal PicturesSome of the criticism was valid – it was set in New York, yet was overwhelmingly white – but much of it was misogynistic and more. “The shame is that, when it is coupled with misogyny and fatphobia and everything, the valid criticism gets lost.” Some of the coverage was so mean, she says with a laugh, especially on Gawker, which didn’t describe the lead characters by their names, but as the daughters of the famous parent each actor had. “We were easy targets, I get it.”For a while, Williams struggled with people assuming she was inseparable from her character, Marnie, a narcissist verging on sociopathy. “I really desired to put distance between us, because I thought that was the kind of acting everybody respected – like, I’m wearing a prosthetic nose and I gained 40lbs, or whatever. And here [our characters] were, who looked basically like we looked and sounded like we sounded, but crucially said and did things that we would never do. It always felt weird that, since we didn’t transform ourselves in some way, people weren’t buying us playing characters.”Mostly though, she says, it was an amazing experience. Will there be a reunion? “I would love it,” says Williams. “I know that Zosia [Mamet, who played Shoshanna] has been pushing for a spin-off, which I would voraciously consume and try to elbow my way into. I kind of want us all back together. It was so fun and it was the beginning of my career, so I didn’t have the perspective I have now on just how lucky we were, or to know how unusual a creative experience it was.”For those of us who loved Girls, I can think of nothing better – four hilarious, horrendous humans, no scary AI doll in sight.Allison Williams’ podcast,Landlines, is available now.

It’s a question you will ask yourself on many occasions during the second instalment of Hideo Kojima’s hypnotising, mystifying, and provocatively slow-paced cargo management simulator series. First, because during the many long and uneventful treks across its supernatural vision of Mexico and Australia, you have all the headspace in the world to ponder its small details and decipher the perplexing things you just witnessed. And second, because the question so often reveals something profound.That it can stand up to such extended contemplation is a marker of the fine craftsmanship that went into this game. Nobody is scribbling down notes to uncover what Doom: The Dark Ages is getting at or poring over Marvel Rivals’ cutscenes for clues, fantastic as those games are. It is rare for any game to invite this kind of scrutiny, let alone hold up to it. But Death Stranding 2 is a different kind of game, one with the atmosphere and narrative delivery of arthouse cinema, light of touch in its storytelling but exhaustive in its gameplay systems, and the tension between the two makes it so compelling. At first you brave one for the other; then, over time, you savour both.For anyone who missed the first Death Stranding, yes, this really is the second in a series of games about moving cargo between waypoints, on foot or by vehicle; delivering packages of food, tech and luxury items, like a post-apocalyptic Amazon driver. A mysterious event fundamentally changed the world at the start of the first game, allowing the dead to return to the realm of the living as spectral entities known as Beached Things (BTs). When a BT kills a human, it creates a disastrous event called a “voidout”, a kind of supernatural nuclear bomb explosion that leaves behind nothing but a vast crater.View image in fullscreenA screenshot from Death Stranding 2: On the BeachWith humanity fragmented and sequestered in underground bunkers, protagonist Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus) was entrusted with connecting the remaining pockets of civilisation in the US to a global tech infrastructure called “the chiral network”, restoring hope for a better tomorrow. He managed it, too, making it across the entire continent with a sort of supernatural infant, Lou, carried in an artificial womb. As this sequel begins he is enjoying a secluded life in Mexico with Lou, now a toddler.And believe me, those are the scantest cliff notes possible. Death Stranding 2 begins with six solid minutes of cutscenes that attempt to convey the strange world of sci-fi and poetic metaphors that Kojima has constructed, and even that feels like a cursory summary. Decrypting the mysteries is half the fun here (the other half being the box-shifting) but even if you don’t engage that deeply with the world, it follows its own kind of dreamlike logic and starts to make intuitive sense. It is not clear whether Death Stranding 2’s Australian once looked like the one we know, for example, or whether it was always a patchwork of Icelandic tundra, snowcapped mountains and multicoloured desert. What matters is that it feels consistent.Meditative it may be, but this isn’t a game about watching Sam enjoy retirement and fatherhood for 50 hours. He is inevitably called back into action, this time reconnecting the Mexican and Australian populations to the chiral network for an outfit called Drawbridge, a logistics company funded by an unknown benefactor and headed by returning character Fragile (Léa Seydoux). If that sounds a bit dry, what if I told you that Fragile wears a pair of long Greta Garbo gloves around her neck, which she can move like a second set of hands?View image in fullscreenElle Fanning in Death Stranding 2.Photograph: Sony Interactive EntertainmentA swashbuckling gang of assists Sam on his mission, following him around on the DHV Magellan, a ship with more A-listers on board than a Cannes red carpet. Seydoux, George Miller, Guillermo del Toro, Nicolas Winding Refn, Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna all give brilliant performances, as does veteran game actor Troy Baker as chief baddie Higgs. The major characters exist primarily as poetic devices and morbid metaphors: Rainy (Kutsuna) is an ostracised optimist who makes it rain whenever she goes outside; Tarman (Miller) lost a hand to supernatural tar, and can now use it to guide the ship through its currents; Heartman (Darren Jacobs) dies and is reborn every few minutes. By rights, they should all be simply too strange to invoke pathos, but there are rare moments when the allegory is dialled down and they interact in human and poignant ways. If you don’t feel a lump in your throat watching Rainy and Tomorrow (Fanning) sing together, it’s not just Deadman who is dead inside.Package delivery is, strangely, depicted to the highest of gameplay standards. It sounds boring, but you can’t help get pulled in by the magnetic draw of these detailed systems. In the last game, combat felt like an afterthought, but there is more of it this time as missions bring you into conflict with both BTs and other humans, and it is supported by typically slick mechanics that make launching a grenade or snapping a neck feel equally gratifying. You can fabricate tools to take with you – ladders and climbing ropes for mountainous routes, assault rifles and grenades when a fight is likely. The pleasure is as much in the preparation as it is in the action; it feels good to impose some order on an otherwise chaotic and unknowable world. That’s probably why we all baked so much banana bread during lockdown.Kojima had a draft for Death Stranding 2’s story before the Covid-19 pandemic, but rewrote it from scratch after being locked down along with the rest of the world. You don’t have to look too hard to see the influences – a population that is too scared to go outside, governments that promise to save you by putting an end to travel and physical contact, the profound loneliness of Sam’s job as a porter travelling solo across barren landscapes.Fittingly, you can interact with other players, but only at a distance, sharing equipment, building structures and leaving holographic signs and likes for other players in their own games. This ends up being a biting piece of lockdown satire – as time goes by the world becomes clogged up with flickering icons, and as more structures appear you are confronted by constant “like” symbols. It feels like the mind-numbing attention spam of social media, and there’s no way this is an accident.The first game had the advantage of surprise. Death Stranding 2 does not. Much of what is good – and what is tedious – about this game was also true of the last, but at the same time it has refined each bizarre element. Combat feels punchier, the world map more hand-crafted, missions more varied. Asking you to do all of that schlepping about all over again in a whole new game should feel like a practical joke, but it is so mechanically rich and loaded with meaning, you just nod and don the backpack a second time.Of the many things Death Stranding 2 is trying to say, the message that comes to the fore is: you are never truly alone. Global disasters, big tech, even death itself – these things might abstract the way we connect to one another, but they can’t sever the connection altogether. Not bad for a game about delivering boxes.Death Stranding 2 is released on 26 June, £69.99/US$69.99/A$124.95Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5SonyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fast-moving as in totally suboptimal. Fast-moving as in completely out of his control. Fast-moving as in he would rather have pulled the duvet over his head and pretendedthe whole thinghad been a bad dream. That he could go back to sleep for a while and wake up to the world as it was.Maybe we all wish we could do that. These are the days that many of us would rather had never happened. Does the world feel any safer to you today?Then there is no accounting for Donald Trump. There has never been a more capricious US president. Even The Donaldhas no idea what The Donald is going to do next. The only certainty is uncertainty. A man who lives almost entirely in the present. No sense of the past. No sense of the future. Just a collection of unpredictable neurons desperately trying to fire across the synapses.Just last week,Keir Starmerfelt able to sign a communique with other leaders of the G6 – Trump had long since got bored and gone home – which talked of finding a diplomatic solution in the Middle East.There were hopes that The Donald could be talked out of the military option. That his macho posturing was just that. Hell, even Trump was talking of givingIrantwo weeks to come good on reaching a nuclear deal acceptable to the west. There again, the president often says things will happen in two weeks. It’s almost a Pavlovian response. Almost as if he has no idea how long two weeks is. Could be a day. Possibly two.Maybe it was the Taco label that got to The Donald in the end. Trump Always Chickens Out. But sometime between sunrise and sundown on Saturday, The Donald decided he knew better than his own director of intelligence services and ordered stealth bombers tounload their bunker busterson three of Iran’s nuclear facilities.Trump had asked himself: “Do you feel lucky, punk?” and had decided that, on the whole, he did feel very lucky. Hell, that Nobel peace prize wasn’t going to win itself, was it?The reaction was everything the Donald would have hoped for. Total confusion. Chaos. Trump’s speciality. The US secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, immediately declared the operation atotal success. The greatest military raid the US had ever done. No other president could have been that visionary.Iran’s nuclear capability had been totally destroyed, Pete said. Just as the rest of the world was saying there was no real evidence yet to support that. Maybe Iran’s nuclear facilities were still in the game after all. But don’t worry, Pete added. Everything was going to be just fine. This was just a one-off. Regime change had never been part of the plan. Hold my beer, The Donald chipped in.Back in Blighty,David Lammywas trying to play catch-up. Trying to look as though he had known about the military operation all along, when he had been just as blindsided as the rest of us. That he had got the call from the president when the planes were about an hour out of Iran and been presented with a fait accompli.Even now, he was still unsure whether it would have been better to be in on the plan – part of the inner circle – or to have the legitimate deniability of the outsider.Come Monday morning,Lammy was in entirely defensive modeon Radio 4’s Today programme. Refusing to answer any questions about whether the US action had been lawful. “We weren’t involved,” he said, time and again when Justin Webb pressed him.Which wasn’t really the point. The UK was certain that other wars in which we were not involved were unlawful. So if we could pronounce on their legality, how come the foreign secretary was so reluctant to give a view on the US bombing Iran? A simple yes or no would have cleared things up.Things were no clearer when Lammy gave a statement to the Commons in the afternoon. Iran couldn’t have nukes, he said. It had failed to reassure the west. So … it had sort of had it coming. Not that we Britons would have gone about things that way, but the Americans quite liked the smell of napalm in the morning.Now things got even more confused. Because although the escalation had been one of those things that just happen from time to time, it was now time to de-escalate.And it was up to Tehran to dial things down a bit. Run that one past me again, Dave. Iran was the one that had just been attacked and it was somehow their fault. They were the ones who needed to come to the negotiating table. Clearly different rules apply in the Middle East.We need a diplomatic solution, said Lammy. Though he couldn’t rule out a little more recreational bombing in the days ahead. “What happens next is hard to predict,” he concluded. Code for “HELP”. “RUN FOR THE HILLS.”This was to be a session of firsts. Because in reply, Priti Patel said she wanted to work constructively. Something she has never before done in her life. Mostly, though, she was just sad that she wasn’t foreign secretary andcould have launched a few bombs of her own. There’s no way she would ever have been left out of the loop. Please, please, she begged, if there is to be a second attack, please can she join in? Possibly even flying a plane.Other people saw things differently. Emily Thornberry observed that the only way to end the crisis was with a deal and at present she could see the US had no clear objectives. Negotiations could only be successful if there was mutual trust. And bombing wasn’t generally conducive to trust. Wimp, muttered Priti Vacant. Constructive to the last.Explore more on these topicsDavid LammyThe politics sketchDonald TrumpIranKeir StarmerNuclear weaponsIran's nuclear programmeForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

That the wealthy are worried shows it’s workingMon 23 Jun 2025 13.57 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 14.08 EDTShareTheZohran Mamdani phenomenonshould not be happening, if received wisdom is a reliable predictor of events. He’s the 33-year-old Muslim leftist and Queens assemblyman running for the New York mayoralty with the support of the Democratic Socialists of America, and the vitriolic campaign against himsuggests his momentumhas caused panic in gilded circles. His chief opponent for the Democratic nomination, Andrew Cuomo, could not scream party establishment more loudly: he’s New York state’s former governor – just like his father was – and a former cabinet secretary. He married into that classic Democratic royalty, the Kennedys; his endorsements include the former president Bill Clinton; and billionaires such asMike Bloomberg are pouring millionsinto his Super Pac.In another age, someone like Mamdani would have been a no-hoper. What changed was the 2016 presidential campaign of the long-marginalised socialist senatorBernie Sanders, which re-energised the US left. But Donald Trump’s recent victory on a more extreme platform led to predictions of a general rightwing lurch in US politics, with progressive positions scapegoated for the Democratic loss (even though Kamala Harris ran on a squarely corporate, “centrist” ticket). I was scheduled to interview Mamdani on the night of the US presidential election, but his campaign asked to postpone as results started to come in suggesting a Trump victory was likely. Presumably, they wanted to reassess strategy in the coming US political winter.But just a few months later, Mamdani is surging, and his campaign offers lessons for the western left in an age of chronic economic insecurity, rising far-right authoritarianism, war and genocide. The primary election vote is tomorrow, buta poll released during crucial early votingshows Mamdani overtaking Cuomoin “ranked choice” voting: it’s within the margin of error, but five months ago the insurgent candidate was polling only 1% support.In only a month, Mamdani hasleapt from 22% to 32%, particularly powered by a 2:1 lead among the under-50s.Why establishment Democrats still can’t stomach progressive candidates like Zohran Mamdani | Arwa MahdawiRead moreYes, the millennial has been helped by Cuomo’s chronic liabilities – theformer governor resignedin disgrace afteran investigation by the state attorney general found that he had sexually harrassed several women – but rival candidates with bigger profiles and more political experience could have gained from that instead. The New York Timespleaded with readersnot to rank Mamdani in the preferential voting system,rich New Yorkers are threateningto flee the city if he wins, he’s been attacked for inexperience, and smeared over his championing of Palestinian rights. “Zohran Mamdani is a public menace,” screeches rightwing magazine the National Review.So what’s the universal lessons for the western left? Three Ms are key: messaging, medium and movement. Grace Mausser is the co-chair ofNew YorkCity Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). When I suggested that Mamdani’s campaign would surely originally have been driven by revitalising the left, rather than the prospect of an actual election victory, she disagrees.“When we started, we knew the path to victory was narrow,” she conceded. But, she emphasised: “We don’t run races for purely moral reasons or to make a point like the Green party in the US which has failed in their project.” Indeed, the DSA played a pivotal role in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’sshock defeat of another Democratic luminary, the former chair of the House Democratic Caucus Joe Crowley back in 2018. In turn, Ocasio-Cortez has bolstered Mamdani with her endorsement, underlining how progressive victories feed off one another.“Super-clear messaging” is how Mausser sums up the Mamdani strategy. The early campaign settled on three main messages: “Fast and free buses, freeze the rents, free childcare. That’s so easy to remember. People know it, and it’s said over and over and over again.” Mamdani has other pledges, too – such as launching publicly run grocery stores – but key to his success are core, endlessly repeated commitments focused on a cost of living crisis triggered by a broken economic system.This strategy is essential in combating a “culture war” designed to force leftists into a defensive posture. It doesn’t mean abandoning marginalised minorities – Mamdani has unequivocally committed to transgender rights, for example. It just means emphasising unifying economic messages. Anger is redirected from the disenfranchised to thriving economic elites, whom Mamdani seeks to tax to fulfil his pledges. The campaign has settled, too, on not backing down to bad faith attacks: Mamdani has not given an inch in his pro-Palestinian advocacy.View image in fullscreenPeople attend a Zohran Mamdani rally in Manhattan, 14 June 2025.Photograph: Laura Brett/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockThen there’s the medium. What Mausser calls “high-quality video production” has been pivotal. Across the west, the far right has proven adept at using platforms such as TikTok to radicalise supporters, with the left mostly not even playing catch-up. Mamdani’s campaign made slick videos that are witty, sassy and snappy, communicating its messages to wide audiences. “All the conversations after the election [were] about needing a ‘Joe Rogan of the left’, how people aren’t getting their news from traditional media, how they’re getting their news from TikTok, Instagram and YouTube,” says Democratic strategist Waleed Shahid. “And that is exactly the story of Zohran.”When Sanders endorsed Mamdani, he declared how he was “very impressed by the grassroots movement that he has put together”. Mamdani’s campaign has an army of door-knockers, often visiting districts traditionally ignored by Democratic machine politicians. For many of these canvassers, this is their first political experience. Mausser reports: “If you ask them, ‘How did you hear about Zohran?’, it’s like: ‘Oh, I saw his video on Instagram or TikTok.’” The message and the medium raised an army. There’s another factor, too: Mamdani, like Ocasio-Cortez, is charismatic and telegenic. It’s not fashionable to discuss this on a left which prioritises the collective over the individual, but we need compelling communicators who look the part.Mamdani may not win the Democratic nomination. Even if he does, Cuomo will stand as an independent candidate, although the socialist challenger may do this, too. His campaign’s weaknesses reflect those of the wider US left: too little inroads among Black and older voters, as well as those with little online political engagement. But Mamdani’s against-the-odds success underlines why the far-right surge doesn’t have to weaken the left – far from it. Indeed, Mamdani positions himself as best-placed to resist Trump, rather than kowtow to his agenda. When the Republicans won, one of Mamdani’s first viral videos was visiting local districts where Trump enjoyed his biggest swings.Whatever happens, Mamdani shows that the US left lives on after what Shahid calls “a shitty year”: along with Trump’s triumph, there have been dispiriting primary defeats of progressive representativesJamaal BowmanandCori Bushat the hands of notorious pro-Israel lobbyists Aipac. Mamdani has built a movement in New York, but his campaign has also given a shellshocked western left a gift: a strategy to take on the establishment even in adverse circumstances.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This latest gambit appears less a strategic gamechanger than a desperate bid to regime-change Iran and prop up a rickety regional status quo built around unchecked Israeli dominance.The timing of Israel’sinitial surprise attackon 13 June was no coincidence. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu – who has long sought to sabotage any prospect of US-Iran detente – appears to havesteamrolled Donald Trumpinto the escalation he has always wanted. The result looks like a trap: Trump, once again, manoeuvred into a destabilising Middle East conflict that serves Netanyahu’s agenda far more than the US’s.Although the joint strikes have caused significant damage, they have also provoked a swift response. Iran’s missile barrages are piercing Israel’s vaunted defences, sending millions into bomb shelters day and night, and exposing strategic vulnerabilities previously thought secure. Crucially, Tehran appears to have anticipated the US attack on the Fordow uranium enrichment plant over the weekend –reportedly removing sensitive equipmentand sealing the site’s entrances ahead of time. Even senior US officialsnow concedethat Fordow was not destroyed. Instead,they’re signallinga return to negotiations as the only viable path for addressing Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile – an implicit admission that there is no military solution to this problem.The episode underscores a deeper reality: Iran’s nuclear infrastructure is designed to withstand precisely this kind of attack. Its dispersal, depth and scope mean that meaningful and verifiable destruction would require a full-scale ground invasion – repeating the catastrophic miscalculations of Iraq. Far from eliminating the threat, military escalation risks pushingIrancloser to weaponisation, while foreclosing the only durable solution: diplomacy.No matter what Trump says, the US has gone to war – and there will be profound and lasting consequences | Simon TisdallRead moreWorse still for the US andIsrael, the strike has failed to ignite mass revolt and regime change. Despite years of repression, many Iranians – secular and religious alike – now view their sovereignty, national identity and territorial integrity as under direct assault. A rally-around-the-flag effect is taking hold – not in support of the Islamic republic per se, but in defence of Iran as a nation confronting foreign aggression. The government, for its part, appears unified across political factions, emboldened by the belief that it has weathered the worst and can emerge more resilient.Netanyahu’s bid to prop upReza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former shah, has only underscored the incoherence of the regime-change project – Pahlavi is seen as an out-of-touch relic of a bygone era.Bombing Iranian media outletsandcivil infrastructurein a clumsy attempt to incite rebellion has only further discredited the effort.The US, too, now finds itself at a crossroads. Trump’s national security team is split. Some advisers, such as the vice-president, JD Vance, have signalledopenness to renewed talks, even suggesting negotiations over Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile. This is an implicit admission of failure – that coercion has reached its limit, and that diplomacy is the only viable path forward.But diplomacy cannot succeed under the shadow of airstrikes and assassinations. Nor can it be sustained if the US continues to outsource its Iran policy to a militaristic Israeli government intent on perpetual confrontation – one whose core aim is to keep the US locked in endless conflict in the Middle East on its behalf.Too often, US understanding of Iran’s nuclear behaviour remains filtered through the lens of alarmism, ignoring the strategic logic behind Tehran’s decisions. Iran’s nuclear programme is best understood not as an ideological crusade for the bomb, but as a calibrated instrument of deterrence and leverage. Iran has deliberately positioned itself as a threshold nuclear state – developing the infrastructure, enrichment capabilities and scientific knowledge needed to produce a weapon, but stopping short of actually doing so. This ambiguity was viewed as serving multiple purposes: strengthening Iran’s hand in negotiations; raising the costs of any attack; and maintaining strategic flexibility without crossing the line into open proliferation.Indeed, Iranian officials have positioned their nuclear programme as a bargaining chip, not necessarily as an end towards nuclear weapons. At key moments, including during the negotiations at the 2015joint comprehensive plan of action(JCPOA), they have demonstrated a willingness to place verifiable limits on their nuclear programme in exchange for credible security guarantees and economic relief.The time has come for a sober reassessment of US policy in the Middle East – one grounded not in maximalist illusions, but in strategic balance. Iran is not a problem that can be bombed into submission. Decades of pressure have failed to produce compliance or collapse. Instead, they’ve entrenched resistance and accelerated Iran’s nuclear capabilities. Any strategy that assumes coercion alone will yield stability is not just flawed, it’s self-defeating.Just as critically, Washington must reckon with the growing strategic costs of deferring to an increasingly uncompromising Israeli government. Rather than serving as a stabilising partner, Israel’s posture under its current leadership has become a liability – fuelling cycles of escalation, derailing diplomacy and entangling the US in conflicts that distract from pressing global priorities. A durable US strategy must prioritise regional equilibrium over unconditionally underwriting any one side, and reclaim decision-making in service of long-term US interests.This moment demands a shift – not in tactics but in strategic vision. The Middle East cannot be remade through bombs and genocidal wars. If the US truly seeks stability, it must abandon the illusion of managing the region through Israeli supremacy, propping up pliant dictators and trying to regime-change rivals. That project has failed and the current war shows no sign of changing this. What comes next depends on whether Washington is finally ready to choose realism over fantasy.Sina Toossi is a senior non-resident fellow at the Center for International Policy, where his work focuses on US-Iran relations, US policy toward the Middle East and nuclear issuesDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why now? The answer is political opportunityMon 23 Jun 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 14.52 EDTShareThe United States hasbombed Iran.Donald Trumpannounced on Sunday that B-2 bombers attacked three nuclear sites including the Fordow nuclear site, sometimes referring to as the crown jewel of Iran’s nuclear program.As the world waits for Iran’s response, it is worth revisiting events since 12 June, when Israel, with US support, attacked the Islamic Republic. The official reason is nuclear weapons. The real reason I contend is the elimination of the Iran-led Axis of Resistance and establishing Israeli regional hegemony over the Middle East with tacit support from Arab autocrats.According to American and Israeli leaders, Iran was about to construct a nuclear weapon. Israel was forced to engage in a pre-emptive attack by way of response. “Israel’s very survival” was at stake according to Benjamin Netanyahu, while Trump claimed Iran was “very close to having a weapon”. Tulsi Gabbard, the US director of national intelligence, has now fallen in line. Weeks after testifying before Congress that Iran was not pursuing a bomb, thus undermining Trump’s stated position and embarrassing him politically, she nowclaimsIran could get a bomb “within weeks”.No serious analyst of Iran’s nuclear program believes this to be true. As the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency hasaffirmed, there was no indication of a “systematic program in Iran to produce a nuclear weapon”. CNNreportedlast week that according to US intelligence assessments, “not only was Iran not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, it was also up to three years away from being able to produce and deliver one to a target of its choosing” When Secretary of State Marco Rubio wasaskedthe day after the US attack if he had seen evidence that Iran was about to weaponize its nuclear program, he responded that the question was “irrelevant.” When pressed further he said “forget about intelligence.”If Iran’s nuclear program was not an imminent threat, what motived the US-Israeli attack? Why now? The answer is political opportunity.First, the Islamic Republic of Iran has never been weaker. Decades of economic sanctions and government corruption have impoverished the average citizen while enriching the ruling elite. Official poverty figures reveal that roughly one-third of Iranians live in poverty, and the real figure is believed to be much higher. Early this year, for example, the state run Mardomsalari newspaper had front-page headline: “The 400% Drop in Wages Over a Decade”. Iran’s economy is broken, and its citizens are struggling to survive.Internally, the Islamic Republic suffers from a crisis of internal legitimacy. This was on full display after the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022 that saw the birth of the “Women, Life, Freedom Movement” that rocked Iran and shone a global spotlight on its sordid human rights record. Over 60% of Iran’s population is under the age of 30. They have no memory of life before the 1979 Revolution. Their moral reference point is religious authoritarianism and clerical rule which they overwhelmingly reject. If there was a referendum in Iran today, no serious Iran expert doubts that the Islamic Republic would lose the vote by a wide margin. While the recent bombing of Iran has produced a rally-around-the-flag effect it is too soon to make any conclusive determination on how widespread this phenomenon might become.Regionally, Iran has never been weaker. The loss of its main regional ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah was a huge blow to Iran’s regional influence and its national defense doctrine. A core reason why Iran has supported and armed Hezbollah was for a moment like this. In the event of a direct Israeli or American attack on Iranian soil, it was assumed that Hezbollah would open a second front against Israel. This is no longer an option after Israeli’s sophisticated attack on Hezbollah last summer effectively neutralized this organization. The toppling of the Assad regime in Syria and the weakening of Iran-backed militias in Iraq contribute to this overall picture of Iranian geostrategic weakness. This has produced a golden opportunity for Israel to press ahead in the hope of delivering a blow to its chief regional rival.Israel seeks to be the regional hegemon and for a long time Iran stood in its way. The real threat Iran has historically posed to Israel, rhetoric aside, has never been existential but rather strategic and ideological. As we are seeing today, there is a vast power imbalance between the two countries measured in terms of military hardware, intelligence capabilities and international support. They all strongly favor Israel. Iran cannot protect its top military leaders and nuclear scientists. It cannot even protect its own airspace.The real Iranian threat to Israel is rooted in Iran’s ideological opposition to Israeli and American policy in the region. Its “Axis of Resistance” has sought to actively challenge, both in words and in deeds, western influence in the region. Iran and its allies have also sought to rally popular opinion in the Arab-Islamic world around this anti-imperialist theme. This is the real Iranian threat that the United and Israel seek to eliminate.During the cold war in Latin America, a similar situation existed. The enemy back then was Fidel Castro and Cuba. Regional instability was frequently blamed on communist insurrection orchestrated by Cuba and after 1979 by Nicaragua. Like Iran today, Cuba’s regional destabilizing role was grossly exaggerated in American foreign policy circles, and it was demonized in similar ways and for identical reasons. The Cuban threat, like the Iranian one today, was that these countries had foreign policies that were outside US influence and control. This is the primary reason why they were attacked and portrayed as enemy states.Iran’s threat is not nuclear weapons. Recall, Iran’s ability to weaponize its nuclear program was effectively curtailed in 2015 when it negotiated a deal with the Obama administration. At the urging of Netanyahu, Trump tore up that agreement three years later which set the stage for today’s crisis. The real Iranian threat is that it has an independent foreign policy. This does not mean Tehran has a good foreign policy on normative or ethical grounds; far from it. It simply means Iran operates independently as an actor in the Middle East challenging American and Israeli hegemony. This is the real Iranian threat that the US and Israel seek to eliminate.Nader Hashemi is associate professor of Middle East and Islamic politics and director of the Alwaleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at the Edmund A Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown UniversityExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionDonald TrumpUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

The feeble response from mainstream liberal parties is entirely dissonant with the gravity of the moment. As theUS joins Israel in attacking Iran, and the Middle East heads toward a calamitous unravelling, their inertness is more disorienting than ever. They are passengers in Israel’s war, either resigned to the consequences or fundamentally unwilling to even question its wisdom. As reality screams at politicians across the west, they shuffle papers and reheat old rhetoric, all while deferring to an Israel and a White House that have long taken leave of their senses.At a time of extreme geopolitical risk the centre presents itself as the wise party in the fracas, making appeals for cool heads and diplomacy, but is entirely incapable of addressing or challenging the root cause. Some are afraid to even name it. Israel has disappeared from the account, leaving only a regrettable crisis and a menacing Iran. The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, hascalled for de-escalation. But he referred to the very escalation he wishes to avoid – the US’s involvement – as an alleviation of the “grave threat” posed by Iran, all the whilebuilding upUK forces in the Middle East.The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen,underlines the importance of diplomacywhile making sure to assert that Iran is the “principal source” of instability in the region. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, had seemed to be inhabiting the real world,warning against the inevitable chaosthat would be triggered by regime change in Iran and in repeating the mistakes of the past. But by SundayFrance hadfallen into line, joining the chorus calling for de-escalation and restraint in vague general terms, and reiterating “firm opposition” to Iran’s nuclear programme.No matter what Trump says, the US has gone to war – and there will be profound and lasting consequences | Simon TisdallRead moreIf this seems maddeningly complacent to you, let me reassure you that you are not, in fact, missing something. The war with Iran is very bad news, and introduces a number of profoundly destabilising scenarios: regime change with no day-after plan, leaving a large cadre of armed military and security forces in play; the amassing in the region of western military forces that could become targets and flashpoints; or simply a prolonged war of attrition that would seize up the region and open a large festering wound of anger and militarisation. It’s also – and this is something Israel’s assaults have inured us to – killinghundreds of innocent people. To say nothing of the fact that it is, above all the extant risks, illegal.But most western leaders continue to treat it as just another chapter of unfortunate but ultimately fixed realities of the world to manage. And here is the sinkhole at the heart of the entire response to Israel over the past year and a half – a vacant centre. Trump is Trump. No one is expecting him to have a coherent, brave and stabilising response to Israel. But the problem predates him: a political establishment of ostensibly liberal, reliable custodians of stability that has no moral compass, and no care for the norms it constantly claims to uphold. Under its watch, international and human rights law has been violated again and again in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and now Iran. Its answer has been to get out of Israel’s way at best, and arm it and provide it with diplomatic cover at worst. Joe Biden’s administration set the tone, and European governments followed. Collectively, they have clung on to a status quo of unconditional support for Israel and, in doing so, shattered the legal and moral conventions that imbued them with any measure of integrity or authority.And yet they still carry on amid the wreckage. Their pronouncements about the importance of diplomacy sound like echoes from an era that has long passed – one before a livestreamed genocide demolished any semblance of a coherent system of international law. What the current moment has revealed is a cohort of regimes fundamentally unsuited to crisis, fit only for management; a crop of politicians whose very role is not to rethink or challenge the way things are, but simply to shepherd geopolitical traffic. Their mandate is indeed to stabilise, but only in the sense of locking in a world order offailing assumptions and hierarchies. It is not to make the world a better place, but to cast a veneer of credibility over why it is necessary that we live in this worse one.This is not to be confused with “pragmatism”. Pragmatism implies a lack of position or vested interest. What is obscured by the language of reluctant engagement is that it is underpinned by beliefs that are defined not by values, but by tribal supremacy. Iran is a country which, in the eyes of a liberal establishment, is never fully sovereign because it has diverged from western interests. It has no right of response when attacked (and in fact,must show restraintwhen it is). Its people have no right to expect a careful consideration of their future, or indeed the entire region’s. Israel, on the other hand, is a super sovereign, and never culpable.This default position is so naked in its hypocrisy, so ignorant and parochial in its worldview, so clear in its disregard for human life, that it represents a colossal erosion of sophistication in political discourse, and a new low in contempt for the public. Support for Israel can only be defended by facile, logic-defying references to its right to defend itself even when it is the aggressor, and Iran’s “threat to the free world”. Forgive me, but is that the same free world that backed unilateral attacks on four Middle East territories by Israel, a country whose leader iswanted by the international criminal court? At this point, the biggest threat to the free world is itself, which will sacrifice everything to ensure that not a single challenge to its power is allowed to pass.The end result is that such leaders are not only irresponsible, they are unrepresentative, unable and unwilling even to manufacture consent any more. An accelerating nihilism has taken hold. Mandates fray as centrist governments and political parties stray further and further from the public, which in Europe declares ahistorically low level of support for Israel. In the US (including Trump supporters), a majorityopposes involvement in war with Iran. And so the gap between a detached politics and bloody reality widens even further. The managers of western hegemony hurtle into the void, taking all of us with them.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionIranPalestinian territoriesTrump administrationDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricaEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

Its lasting harms are wide-ranging, complex, amorphous, generational.In Australia, one in five boys and one in three girls are sexually abused before the age of 18. One in 10 men have a history of offending against children, online or offline. The most common adult perpetrator is a caregiver in the home. Child sexual abuse accounts for at least half of prosecuted sexual offences in this country. If you aren’t a victim-survivor, perpetrator or both, the chances are you love someone who is.Eight years ago, the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse made a gamut of recommendations to address the problem from every angle. Among them was provision of national support services for non-offending family members of child sexual abuse offenders, who are typically left devastated and traumatised once the offending is revealed, as well as an early intervention service for people concerned about their sexual interest or behaviour towards children. Both measures feature in the 2021 National Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Child Sexual Abuse and its corresponding national action plan, overseen by the National Office for Child Safety (NOCS) – which falls within the Attorney-General’s Department.These services are designed to fill major gaps in the Australian response to child sexual abuse. And although tenders for these services were supposed to go to market in 2022, they weren’t opened until a year later. They closed in February 2024. As of today, no contract has been signed for the delivery of these vital services. The process has been so protracted, unethical and mishandled that it warrantedan independent auditconducted by the Australian National Audit Office (Anao).Ballarat’s history of sexual abuse is an enduring wound. How can we heal together?Read moreThe Anao report, released last week, found that the Attorney-General’s Department is failing in its duty to deliver essential services to prevent sexual abuse before it occurs and support affected families. The procurement process was found to be flawed in multiple ways. Perhaps most alarmingly, the highest scoring tender for family support services was inexplicably struck out in favour of the second ranked tender. Out of 11 tenderers, seven failed to comply with one or more of the assessment criteria. In sourcing consultants for the procurement process, the department was found to have engaged in non-competitive practices, contravening its own commonwealth procurement rules.Despite these shortcomings, the Attorney-General’s Department is insisting that the audit will not change the outcome of the tenders. While the department’s excuse for the delays is that these are “complex” services, it is demonstrably unfair to apportion blame to the sector. The problem isn’t an absence of services or experts able to manage complexity, it’s government incompetence and insufficient funding.More to the point, regardless of the reason, the dire consequences of the delays extend far beyond the service providers and traumatised consumers in need. There is an unknown but guaranteed number of children who have suffered otherwise preventablesexual abuse as a result.In any other area of national crisis and priority, the contracting and delivery of critical services is unlikely to be so drawn out and poorly handled. How could something so widespread and urgent be treated with such blatant disregard? Because child sexual abuse is ugly, uncomfortable and impossible to sanitise for the mainstream.The bleak reality of child sexual abuse is that it cannot be easily communicated in glossy advertising campaigns or public education programs. The fact is, people with a sexual interest in children need options to stop them before they offend, because the moment they take that step, they leave behind a trail of destruction that includes not just their victims and their families, but their own devastated partners and children.The need for robust, specialised child sexual abuse intervention and prevention services could not be more apparent. Australia has had no national support for non-offending family members of child sexual abuse perpetrators for more than two years. After a police raid removes every device from a family home, who supports the mother? What does she do with her trauma? How does she care for her children? Who do the children of parents who’ve offended call?The service models that Australia needs already exist. They’ve been built by experts, refined over years, and proven to work. Hope lies there, and with the stalwart frontline workers and advocates across the country who will keep fighting for funding because we believe that preventing child sexual abuse is a worthy and achievablegoal that benefits all of us.In Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

They – or, I should say, we – were raised on a diet of The West Wing and closely follow the twists and turns inside the Beltway coming from American media. This obsession has an effect on the real world: what happens in the US shapes British politics. Long ago this was seen in the parallels between Bill Clinton and Tony Blair’s “third way”; and this time last year Keir Starmer’s Labour party was looking to Joe Biden’s Democrats.Biden went all-in on reforming the US economy. Through theChips and Science,Infrastructure Investment and JobsandInflation Reductionacts, he spent billions hoping to build more at home, boost growth and grow wages. It worked. Public investment led tomore than $1tn(£750bn) of private sector spending, and real wagesgrew by $4,000a person, with more for the worst off. Even with the pandemic, economic growth averaged 3% a year under Biden.This is an economy the Labour government would die for and is one of the reasons it embraced its own version of Biden’s plans. Theindustrial strategyreleased today is the most concrete expression of Labour’s “securonomics” that it has given in government, after Rachel Reeves unveiled the strategy in Washington in opposition.But for all Biden’s economic success, the Democrats did not win the election in 2024. Immediately commentators turned on the former president’s economic platform, arguing that long-term reform was a waste of time. Only one thing mattered when it came to votes:the price of eggs.Labour hasn’t jettisoned its industrial strategy based on Biden’s loss, despite many urging it to. But for the strategy to be successful and to last the 10 years that Labour intends it to (not thethree yearsthat the Inflation Reduction Act did) the government will need to learn from Biden’s mistakes.To understand how, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), where I work, spoke to more than 40 people in Washington, including many former senior White House officials. Here are two key lessons.First, long-term reform is crucial but will always be slow. Expecting it to win votes now is a recipe for disaster. One former official put it this way: “Industrial policy achieved its goals … but nobody cares, we delivered on stuff they didn’t care about.” The problem was that even in the White House there wasn’t agreement on the purpose of industrial policy. While those running the policy were trying to make long-lasting clean energy investments, it was sold to the Democratic party as the way to beat Trump.The interim effect was the same – money went to predominantly Republican districts (more because of their cheaper labour than a deliberate strategy). But building a factory, hiring people and eventually building things is a decade-long project. As one official said: “[Industrial policy] wasn’t going to transform the map in two years after 50 years of deindustrialisation.”While Labour is explicit that this is a 10-year growth strategy, it can speed things up – planning reform will help. It must also address Britain’s workforce shortages now, not just think about skill development in the future. Rebuilding capability inside government is also vital. The US government was engaging for the first time in facilitating the production of new, rapidly developing technologies such as clean hydrogen. Creating policies such as thehydrogen tax credittakes time and expertise. Officials in the British government are going to need to get to grips with the intricacies of37 new high-potential subsectors.The second lesson: to give long-term policies the space to succeed, governments need a short-term economic improvement to people’s lives. This is crucial: battery manufacturing projects are now being cancelled across the US because Democrats didn’t win a second term to protect them.Biden’s team had wanted a broader economic story that spoke to inflation. But things that would actually help – cheaper childcare or tax provisions for working-class Americans – were cut out of legislation by the Senate. This was at a time when Covid-era support was expiring. Defending the imperfect Inflation Reduction Act and championing investments rang hollow with the public, who wanted to hear about prices coming down.Labour has space to address this. The IPPR has conducted polling that tells us energy prices easily top every other economic issue as the public’s economic priority. Of those surveyed, 47% said they would prefer the government to focus on lower costs even if this meant stagnant wages (something the British public is well used to), as opposed to 12% who would take a wage rise even if costs went up too.A final point is that the world is much bigger than the US and there are lessons to be learned elsewhere.In Spain, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has overseeninvestment of €163bn(£140bn) in the green transition – but rather than relying solely on this, his government has also acted on the rising cost of housing bycapping rent increases. Anthony Albanese last month won a second term in Australia for the Labor party for similar reasons. HisAUS$22.7bn (£10.8bn) investmentin a future made in Australia – predominantly in clean energy – came withenergy bill relief, rent assistance and cheaper medicines.So rather than sitting down for another rewatch of The West Wing, perhaps it would be a better strategy to examine how similar-sized countries elsewhere have given themselves the chance to make long-term industrial strategies work.Sam Alvis is associate director at IPPR and a former political adviser to the Labour partyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Australia’s smallest state is marketed for its “clean and green” environment and produce, and the government runs tourism campaigns with the tagline“come down for air”that lean heavily on its stunning landscapes, coastlines and wildlife.But it also has a reputation for backing environmentally damaging industries that grab national, and sometimes international, attention: hydroelectric dam expansion,logging of old-growth forestsand, most recently,salmon farming.The response to criticism of these industries often includes a reference to more than half of the state being protected in either public or private reserves. It’s a good line, but one that doesn’t survive much scrutiny. The Tasmanian world heritage wilderness covers about 20% of the state, but development, logging and mining are allowed in some areas counted as protected.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterWhere the line is deployed, it is mostly to suggest that nature already gets a pretty good run and environment protection should be reduced. The Liberal state government used it to defend a yet-to-be-delivered policy ofopening up nearly 40,000 hectares of protected forests for logging– a step that would reduce the amount of the state that is in protected reserves to less than 50%, and that even some members of the timber industrysay makes little sense.On Saturday, the Tasmanian Labor leader, Dean Winter, rolled out the line as he launched an equally remarkable policy before the state election on 19 July: that the state’s industries should not have to answer to Australia’s environment laws.Is eating farmed salmon worth snuffing out 40m years of Tasmanian evolution? | Tim FlanneryRead moreTo be fair, that’s not how he put it. Winter said he would make a case to the federal environment minister, Murray Watt, that industries including salmon farming, energy and mining should be granted a similar exemption from the national Environment Protection and BiodiversityConservation(EPBC) Act that has been granted to native forestry.In his view, it would allow industries to be assessed through a “streamlined single regulatory framework”. He said it would not mean that laws were bypassed, only that environmental assessments weren’t duplicated.In an interview with The Australian, Winter said this approach “works well” for forestry. He suggested it would have led to faster approvalson some long-running contentious proposals, including a windfarm planned for an environmentally sensitive island used by migratory birds, a tailings dam on the edge of the Tarkine wilderness, and salmon farming in Macquarie harbour.The Liberal government, led by premier Jeremy Rockliff, pumped out a press release saying it also wanted faster approvals, accusing Winter of stealing a policy it released earlier this year.Both parties have a point. It is widely acknowledged that the EPBC Act is not fit for purpose. Decisions on some developments have taken longer than necessary.On the other hand, some developments are problematic and shouldn’t be approved quickly, or at all. It says something about the debate that this even needs saying, but: environment laws should protect the environment.A 2021 five-yearly state of the environment report found that wasn’t happening – that nature wasin poor and deteriorating health, in part because forest and other vegetation has continued to be knocked down without proper oversight.Where do Winter’s claims about native forest logging fit into this? Awkwardly, at best.The exemption for logging in the EPBC Act is included in regional forest agreements signed between the commonwealth and individual states. Small problem: the states have not always lived up to their commitments.In 2006, then Australian Greens leader Bob Brown won a federal court case against Forestry Tasmania over its failure to protect three endangered species. It didn’t last - the wording of the agreement was changed to prevent further challenges, and the judgment overturned - but more cases followed. In 2020, a landmark judgment found VicForests hadbreached a forestry agreement’s code of practice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He concluded there were “fundamental shortcomings” in how the system was working and significant change was needed. He called for the introduction of national environmental standards – benchmarks against which major operations, including logging, would be measured – and an accreditation system that included “strong commonwealth oversight”.In other words, Samuel found the current system wasn’t actually “working well”. The former federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, agreed that a revamp of the EPBC Act should include national environmental standardsbeing applied to regional forest agreements.5:03Bogong moths and the traditional owners scaling mountains to track them – videoThat revamp is still yet to happen. The work to rewrite the laws was delayed in the last parliamentary term, and is now starting again under the new minister.It is too soon to know where Watt will land on the forestry exemption, and a range of other issues. For the moment he is sticking to federal Labor’s mantra – that a deal can be reached to satisfy industry and conservation advocates.Quite how that will happen, given the evidence of environmental decline and the extent to which it is disregarded by some who wear being anti-green as a badge of honour, is difficult to imagine. Not impossible. But difficult.Speaking before he met interest groups last week, Watt says he thought environmental standards would be a necessary part of it, but he had an open mind. The Tasmanian debate is playing out in parallel to this, but an air of unreality hangs overwhat most people agree is an unnecessary early election.Neither major party has explained why they implicitly disagree with Samuel on regional forest agreements. Neither has levelled with the public about the economic decline of the native forestry industry, other than to promise they will support jobs in what Winter calls “traditional industries”. Meanwhile, nearly 90% of Australian timbercomes from plantations.Both parties say they won’t deal with the Greens, who go into the election with five out of 35 MPs and a good chance of again being a key balance-of-power player. And aTasmanian state of the environment reportreleased last year gathers dust.It told a similar story to the national report – that, on a majority of indicators, nature in the state was in poor or declining health. The Liberalsaccepted only six of the report’s 16 recommendations in fulland announced no new policies to address the problems identified. Labor didn’t respond at all.Explore more on these topicsTasmaniaClear airTasmanian politicsConservationTrees and forestsDeforestationLaw (Australia)Labor partycommentShareReuse this content"

Which presumably, for people whose income is directly linked to their ability to make you feel stuff using their faces (also known as “acting”), must be a serious setback.I’m no actor, but as someone plagued by a “face that gives it away”, I am delighted to hear it being said that facial expressions are, in fact, quite great. Beautiful. Powerful. Worth having in the round, even if there are downsides, like getting you in trouble at every karaoke night (“You look like Wallace smiling at Gromit,” said a friend of mine about my “pretending to enjoy this!” face. ) Or in the case of the Hollywood set, looking a little older. (“You need movement in your face,” said Cox. “Those aren’t wrinkles, they’re smile lines. I’ve had to learn to embrace movement.”)I really do think this bears repeating: facial expressions are ace! Our superpowers, really. Remember how your parents just had “a look” that said “stop that right now”? Magic. And what about crow’s feet? Surely, they’re the ultimate lie detector: they only appear when you’ve really – properly – made someone laugh. How wonderful are these meek crevices that convey emotion as deep as the sea? Tiny but mighty. And they only get better over time. Grande agrees. “I want to see my well-earned cry lines and smile lines,”she said in 2023. “Ageing can be such a beautiful thing.” (Did I mention she was in her 20s then? I’d recommend a pillow if you need something to scream into.)View image in fullscreen‘I want to see my well-earned cry lines and smile lines.’ Ariana Grande at the Screen Actors Guild awards in Los Angeles on 23 February 2025.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/ReutersPerhaps it is ridiculous to spell all this out. A bit obvious, maybe. But we would all miss facial expressions if they disappeared from our screens. Just ask Erika Jayne, one of the stars of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, who was caught up in a controversy when she broke down on TV about filing for divorce, mascara streaks running down her face. Fans said this was contrived, given she famously wears waterproof mascara, but when you can’t move your face, what else can you do? A clever turn from the makeup artist, if you ask me.For clarity, none of this is to say that Botox and injectables are bad, even if the way we talk about them is. Our conversations are fraught, and any critical point about these products must be caveated with “I ACCEPT OTHER WOMEN’S CHOICES” repeated at volume, lest you be accused of being a bad feminist. Or it descends into prudish hectoring of women for having a bit of fun or choosing to improve their prospects in an image-obsessed world which they did not create, but have to live in. But it is possible to defend women’s rights to do whatever they choose with their bodies while also questioning this seismic cultural shift, ideally while giving side eye to the capitalist machine working to sell these treatments despite no one knowing the long-term impacts. (Though whether that side eye has had a hyaluronic acid filler to combat bags is irrelevant because WE ACCEPT OTHER WOMEN’S CHOICES.)But this is not about that. This is a simple love letter to the forehead crease. A paean to the smile line. Change is inevitable, as are some things being lost along the way. Can we imagine a world where every groove and crinkle being smoothed out is as standard – as basic – as combed hair and brushed teeth? It’s not inconceivable. Nor is it inconceivable that, when the cost gets too high and the headspace too big, all of this falls away; no more than a passing trend, like getting a tattoo in Chinese. And maybe, just maybe, this all leads to a massive societal overhaul where some fabulous female revolutionaries overthrow The Man by thwarting facial recognition cameras by literally having the same face. Well, itcouldhappen, though maybe I’m getting carried away.Who knows what the future holds and how quickly we will see it? For now, perhaps it’s one to watch, to raise an eyebrow at or furrow our brow – and to enjoy doing it, while we still can.Coco Khan is a freelance writer and co-host of the politics podcast Pod Save the UKDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This has to changeMon 23 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 13.03 EDTShareThere was nothing about giving birth that didn’t feel personal, from the agony of my 30-hour induced labour to my eventual journey to the operating theatre where my son was delivered by emergency caesarean section. At that point, I had no idea that I was part of an upward trend in the number of C-sections. Rates of the procedure are rising globally, but it is particularly stark in the UK. When I gave birth in 2017, 29% of births in England took place by C-section. In 2025, that figure stands at 42%.Why is this happening? There are leading voices within obstetrics, some of whom I spoke to while researching, who put it firmly down to rising levels of obesity, and the increased risks that come with it – including being more likely to need a C-section. But obesity intersects with other risk factors for pregnancy and birth complications, such as social deprivation. And then there is the fact that so many of us are having our babies later than previous generations – age being yet another risk factor for complications during pregnancy and birth, including a higher likelihood of having a C-section. Evidently, it’s a complex picture, and there is not one clear answer.But our maternity services also play a role. Until the end of the 19th century, the C-section was a feared, last-resort option for obstetricians. It wasn’t until the turn of the 20th century that it began to be seen as relatively safe. The 1960s and 70s saw birth become dramatically more medicalised and monitored. While previously an obstetrician would have looked to the mother, the information relayed by her body, and their own expertise and instinct for guidance during labour and birth, they could now look to machinery.Parents, too, were offered a tantalising, otherworldly glimpse of their child still in utero with the introduction of ultrasound technology. Along with the awe, and undoubtedly useful information, the new reliance on technology was accompanied by a surging sense of anxiety and hypervigilance among expectant parents and health professionals. For the first time, C-section rates began to rise in many parts of the world. They have never stopped.Obstetric norms, naturally, have changed enormously. Obstetricians of the past relied on a plethora of (often risky) manual skills and tools to coax a baby out during a difficult birth. “Footling” birth, for example, would have involved specific methods; nowadays, it’s practically a given that if your baby is breech, you will deliver by C-section. Far from being surgery’s bete noire, the C-section has replaced once common skills, becoming the norm in their place. That’s not a bad thing: there is a reason this “deskilling” has happened – C-sections undoubtedly save lives. Lives that in previous generations were regularly lost during childbirth, and in some parts of the world still are.It’s not just the logistics of obstetrics that feed into a person’s birthing experience. Their emotional response to the culture of maternity systems has a huge impact too.Our maternity systems are deeply imperfect, for all the incredible work done by the individuals within them. They are understaffed and under pressure, and continuity of care is extremely rare. This is supported by a string of damning reports on the state of our maternity services in recent years. The report of thebirth trauma inquiry, published last year, showed a culture of women not being listened to, their pain and fear dismissed. The Ockenden and Kirkup reports revealed pervasive and harmful ideologies around “natural birth”, with individuals overlooked in favour of hospital statistics and dogma.While C-sections continue to rise, there is considerable pressure within maternity services for women to pursue a “natural” or vaginal birth, at times against their instincts, and sometimes with tragic results.For some of us, perhaps a C-section offers some control in a frightening situation where we do not trust our system of care. But you don’t have to work hard to find anecdotes that suggest it’s still not easy for women to reliably access a C-section if they want one, but their obstetrician or midwife doesn’t agree with their choice. The BBC’sVictoria Derbyshire programme reportedin 2018 that women at 75% of UK maternity units were being denied their right to choose a C-section.The punishing but enduring “too posh to push” fallacy still circulates and judgment abounds. Arecent surveyshowed that almost 80% of respondents would choose either what it called a “natural” or home birth. That’s a lot of disappointment, framed against the reality of actual birth outcomes, with 42% of us giving birth not “naturally”, or at home, but in theatre, by C-section.Our maternity systems need to change. And in several key ways.Birth inevitably involves risk. That risk is not currently shouldered equally. There are racial and social inequalities within our systems that mean women of colour, and those with less money, carry a heavier burden. Not only does social deprivation mean you are more likely to have a C-section, butBlack Caribbean-British women are more likely than white women to undergo an emergency C-section.These inequalities must be faced up to by our health service, as it grapples with understanding what is behind this rising number of C-sections.Delay in improving NHS maternity care ‘costs lives of hundreds of babies a year’Read moreOur maternity services must consider how they speak to pregnant women about their care and the options available to them, so that they can make confident, personal choices. Faced with various obstetricians (never the same one), who tended towards scaremongering language and almost pathologically insensitive manners, I found myself turning to my kinder midwife, who favoured fluffy, euphemistic language, describing induction as “a little jump start”, and my ideological hypnobirthing teacher, who assured me that my body had this under control. This was, frankly, disastrous. When my labour took a different path to the one set out in my prettily illustrated birth pack, I was left with a choking sense of failure, not to mention betrayal. I was entirely unprepared for an emergency C-section, left flailing for answers.Women deserve clear, compassionate and detailed information, free of personal ideology, so that they can make confident choices as they navigate pregnancy and birth.Perhaps the most important thing our maternity services can do is to listen to women and birthing people, to their hopes, fears, anxieties and realities. There is so much research that shows when women feel listened to and supported, they feel more positively about their births, whatever path it takes. But sadly, in the UK, too many of us feel dismissed and unheard.Hannah Marsh is the author ofThread: A Caesarean story of myth, magic and medicineExplore more on these topicsChildbirthOpinionWomen's healthHealthHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

The irony is not lost on anyone, except perhaps Australia. In an especially anodyne statement, a spokesperson for the Australian government echoed American claims that “Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile program has been a threat to international peace and security”, and backed in Trump’s admonition that “now is the time for peace”.Little Sir Echo whimpers again, this time through a mouthpiece.Steering a careful course between the prevention of nuclear proliferation and full-throated endorsement for attacking Iranian nuclear facilities, the government has now said Australia supports the US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, maintaining that Iran must not be allowed to possess atomic weapons. “The world has long understood we cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. This action is being taken to prevent that. So, we support action to prevent Iran getting a nuclear weapon,” the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said.PM backs Iran strikes but says Australia is ‘deeply concerned about any escalation’Read moreFor all their sermonising and sanctimonious moralising, successive Australian governments are selective in their advocacy and support for the “international rules-based order”. The rules really matter when Russia attacks Ukraine. They don’t seem to matter as much when America launches a massive “shock and awe” airstrike against Iraq, as it did in 2003, or assembles125 bombers and supporting aircraftto obliterate alleged strategic targets across Iran, as it did just two days ago.The UN Charter established a new international constitutional order after the appalling genocides and slaughter of the second world war. It ordained that security is a function of law – law based on the axiomatic proposition that human beings have value and dignity by virtue of their shared humanity. Agreements, conventions, treaties and a variety of other instruments enshrine the rules to which nations adhere that value fundamental human and political rights as the bedrock for both prosperity and security. There’s not much of either in the Middle East right now.Nor is there much legality.Claims of “clear and present danger” are easy to make. They are significantly more difficult to prove, as President George W Bush discovered in 2003, and as the US director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, and President Trump have demonstrated once again. Faith is no substitute for fact.Let there be no mistake: Iran’s leadership is dangerously inflexible and stubborn, destabilising the Middle East for generations through the calibrated use of proxies expert in terrorism and other forms of asymmetric warfare. Israel’s leadership, particularly under Prime Minister Netanyahu, is equally inflexible and stubborn, combining irregular warfare – assassination in particular – with the more conventional application of military force. As the destruction of Gaza amplifies daily, it does so seemingly without compunction or respect for the basic rights of Palestinians.And in all of this, America perseveres with its longstanding preference for brawn over brain, destruction over diplomacy.“Israel has the right to defend itself” is the mantra that both legitimises and normalises indiscriminate slaughter. Iran, it would appear, does not have quite the same right. Whereas Israel, a nuclear weapons state with the delivery systems to match, acts pre-emptively and opportunistically against its perceived adversaries – Palestine, Lebanon, Syria and Iran – its neighbours enjoy only the right to sue for peace. And in the case of Iran, Trump called for “unconditional surrender”, though to whom was not quite so clear.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Casuistry excepted, there is not a shred of legal argument for America’s actions. That reflects a fundamental dynamic that underpins the maelstrom that is now the Middle East: it is a battle of wills conducted by pig-headed narcissists obsessed by power and their own personal political survival at the expense of their nations’ security.So the seeds have been sown for self-perpetuating instability and irreconcilable difference in the Middle East until the inevitable conflagration forces whoever might survive to the negotiating table to establish new constitutional arrangements.

From deadly heatwaves and devastating floods to rising inequality and health crises driven by air pollution, the costs of inaction are not theoretical; they are measured in lives taken, homes destroyed andbusiness revenue lost.Ten years ago, theParis agreementwas signed, marking a turning point in the global fight against climate breakdown. But today, progress is being undermined by a deeply concerning threat: asurge in climate deniersand delayers spreading virulent disinformation. We mustn’t let this hope disappear as the world gathers in Belém at the end of 2025 for Cop30.This is not just a difference of political opinion or healthy debate. It is a coordinated, well-funded campaign to delay action, erode trust and protect the profits of the fossil fuel industry, which profits most from the status quo. These narratives find fertile ground on social media, where algorithms prioritise outrage over facts. They also thrive in moments of crisis and confusion, playing on existing frustrations among communities who don’t feel their voices are heard by those in charge.In Paris, online disinformation campaigns have repeatedly targeted efforts to promote active travel, reduce air pollution by reducing car use and expand clean energy. These attacks don’t only come fromanonymous online accounts; they are often amplified by populist politicians and partisan influencers. As a result, policies designed to clean the air and protect public health have been distorted into culture war flashpoints. For example, pedestrianising the Seine’s riverbanks was opposed by powerful lobbies, but the results speak for themselves: since 2011 air pollution from cars has been reduced by 40% in the city.In London, the expansion of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), a policy proven tocut pollution and save lives, was relentlessly targeted by disinformation campaigns. These messages were seeded by anonymous accounts, supercharged by bots and then repeated across partisan media. The campaigns combined existing fears about the cost of living with more sinister and racially motivated tropes, leading to a surge in attacks onlineagainst politiciansand supporters,abuse of TfL staffdoing their jobs installing Ulez cameras, and eventually dangerous anddestructive acts of vandalism.In the face of this tide of disinformation we will not be intimidated. Cities such asLondonand Paris continue to show that fair, fast climate action can improve daily life: making streets safer, air cleaner and homes more affordable to heat. But if we are to protect these gains, we must tackle climate disinformation by ensuring everyone understands and feels the benefits of these success stories.That’s why, as leaders of C40 Cities and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy (GCoM), we are committing to tackle disinformation not just with facts but with fairer, better policies rooted in people’s everyday realities. We are building capacity across city networks to support trusted messengers, train local leaders and develop new tools to proactively counter misinformation. But we also need others to act.We are calling on national governments, journalists, educators and tech companies to step up.We welcome efforts such as the EU’s Digital Services Act, which requires online platforms to counter the spread of illegal content, including disinformation, and lays the groundwork for holding platforms accountable. But much more is needed. For example, the UK’s Online Safety Act could be strengthened by explicitly recognising climate disinformation as a form of harmful content.Social mediaplatforms are publishers and should be held accountable for hate speech and libel, as well as tackling the abuse of their platforms by anonymous bots giving a false impression of grassroots support.From LA to Paris, the populist right hates cities – and it’s fuelled by a sense of bitter defeat | Andy BeckettRead moreWe also need school leaders to ensure that media literacy and climate science are taught hand in hand, so the next generation is equipped to spot falsehoods and demand action. And we urge journalists and editors to prioritise evidence-based reporting on climate policy impacts, not just the politics surrounding them.Disinformation flourishes when trust breaks down. Ultimately, fighting disinformation is not only a matter of public relations, it is about public leadership. We must rebuild the foundations of trust. That means listening to communities, addressing concerns head on, and showing through action that climate policy can improve lives today, not just decades from now.The fightback against climate disinformation is gaining momentum. Brazil’s Cop30 presidency and the UN have made information integrity a top priority at the upcoming summit in Belém. Now it’s time for cities and national governments alike to lead.Just as the last 10 years of climate action was forged by theParisagreement, the next decade will be defined by how well we protect the information systems upon which our democracies depend. To do this we must prove to everyone that the action we are taking is worth it. Cities are where that trust can be built.Sadiq Khan is mayor of London and co-chair of C40 Cities.

While some viewers loved the dialled-up-to-11 intensity of everything – more characters, more drama, more staggering brutality – others found the tone relentlessly bleak. And this was a show whose original concept – a cabal of rich benefactors recruit poor people to compete in bloodsports for cash – was already plenty dark. Anyone hoping the show’s third and final season, arriving this week, will provide a reprieve should probably just rewatch Emily in Paris instead.“The tone is going to be more dark and bleak,” says series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk, through an interpreter. “The world, as I observe it, has less hope. I wanted to explore questions like, ‘What is the very last resort of humankind? And do we have the will to give future generations something better?’ After watching all three seasons, I hope we can each ask ourselves, ‘What kind of humanity do I have left in me?’”Characters die in creative ways, like being pulled off a ledge in a gigantic tug of war gameThat’s a lofty ambition for what has become a flagshipNetflixshow – one of the defining cultural products of the 2020s, which seemed to hold a mirror up to a new era of desperation and savagery. The first and second seasons set global viewership records for the streamer – remarkable for a show that’s not in English – and in 2023, it released Squid Game: The Challenge, a reality show based on the series, which saw contestants competing for a $4.5m prize. All this in spite of the fact that Squid Game is also one of the most extraordinarily violent shows ever aired, featuring all manner of brutal, disturbing death scenes. Watching the show can be a gruelling experience: in nearly every episode, several characters are pushed to their limits before being unceremoniously shot by one of the show’s pink-suited guards.Because of Squid Game’s outsized success, it is surprising the show is ending after only three seasons in four years. By the time its finale airs, Stranger Things, another Netflix hit, will have run for five seasons over nearly a decade. Lee Jung-jae, who plays hapless hero turned vigilante Gi-hun, says Hwang’s vision initially didn’t even allow for a second season. “He told us Squid Game was a limited series,” he says, also through a interpreter. “But because it was met with so much love from across the world, he had to do subsequent seasons.”View image in fullscreenAttention-grabbing … Park Gyu-young as No-eul.Photograph: ./NetflixThe fact that Squid Game was conceived as a one-and-done hasn’t lessened the show’s impact. After a shocking first season that played up the contrast between the children’s playground aesthetic and the copious amounts of blood and betrayal, season two raised the stakes with complex, attention-grabbing new characters. The purple-haired rapper Thanos, played by the rapper TOP, was a bizarre pill-popper with a proclivity for violence and speaking in a strange version of English, while Park Gyu-young played Kang No-eul, a North Korean defector who becomes a guard.While he is aware of criticisms of the second season, Lee says there was no opportunity to change season three, given that the two seasons were filmed back to back. And besides, fan response was not the chief consideration. “The messages of Squid Game are very important,” says Lee. “Instead of ‘fixing’ the narrative, we just wanted to make sure the message was conveyed. And of course it’s a TV show – you have to provide entertainment. In season three, we have new games, new characters, twists and turns. It’s going to be very entertaining – but with a message.”That message – about humanity’s capacity for violence, and the danger capitalism puts people in – has been consistent throughout, but in season three, ideas of vengeance and retribution are given a lot of airtime, and the show leans into moral ambiguity even more.This darkness is at odds, Hwang suggests, with what most viewers are looking for. “People like a happy ending,” he says, “I’m like that too. But some stories, by nature, can’t have one. If you try to force one, the essence is compromised. If a story is holding up a mirror to something, then it’s not always a happy ending. Squid Game is no exception.”As for whether loyal fans will be satisfied with the ending, Lee remains tight-lipped about what we will see, but is philosophical about its effect. “The finale was something even I didn’t expect,” he says, “so I’m sure a lot of fans will not see it coming. I think a lot of people will have different reactions. It’s definitely going to spur a lot of conversation. I’m looking forward to listening.”For Lee, making two seasons back-to-back was challenging. “It was non-stop filming for about a year and two months,” he says. “So it was draining, physically. But I could really immerse myself in Gi-hun. When I’m stressed out or physically drained, I usually have really good food and that cheers me up. But I was on a diet. There was no way to release the stress!”Lee is a veteran of the South Korean screen but he finds playing Gi-hun – who goes from wet-blanket nobody to hardened hero – endlessly exciting. “Gi-hun is constantly pressed,” he says. “He’s very frustrated, because whatever he tries to do is just not working. If someone is pushed to that extent, even a good guy can change. It was intriguing to play a character who goes through so much change.”Sometimes the show’s intense brutality – characters die in horrifying and creatively violent ways, such as falling through glass panels or being pulled off a ledge in a gigantic game of tug of war – can feel almost desensitising, which Lee says isn’t the intention. “I really hope that people don’t become desensitised,” he says. “All these characters have very tragic backstories. I hope people will focus on that and mourn their deaths.”Squid Game’s anticapitalist sentiment is so strong that it is strange to see the number of promotional tie-ins Netflix has set up, with companies ranging from McDonald’s to Uber – many of which have been accused in the past of putting profits before employee wellbeing. Hwang says that, at the end of the day, Squid Game exists in a capitalist system.View image in fullscreen‘Fans won’t see it coming’ … Squid Game season three.Photograph: Noh Ju-han/Netflix“For me and Netflix,” he says, “we started out wanting to create a commercial product. It would be too far a stretch to criticise wanting to profit from something that criticises the capitalist system. No studio is going to want to create a story that’s too critical of society. Having said that, if I felt [the partnerships] were too excessive, to the point where I felt it was damaging the spirit of the show, I might feel differently. But it wouldn’t be right for me to tell Netflix not to do something. I don’t have the legal grounds for that. I have had certain feelings about certain things, but I do not think it would be right for me to say exactly what, or to express my negative feelings.”Perhaps that’s because Hwang is already thinking about what a Squid Game sequel might look like. “There’s no saying we’ll never do something again,” he says. “I don’t want to close the door – there are some threads left untied. If I were to come back to the Squid Game universe, I think I would come back with a spin-off. Narratively, there’s a three-year gap between seasons one and two. While Gi-hun was on the search for the Front Man and the Recruiter, what were those villains up to? What do the pink guards do outside Squid Game? Those would be fun ideas to explore.”‘I didn’t sleep for days’: readers on the TV shows that went way too farRead moreThere’s also the matter of the show’s US remake, which is reportedly being developed by David Fincher, director of Gone Girl and The Social Network. Hwang says he hasn’t had any confirmation, but he looks forward to seeing Fincher’s take. “I am a big fan – I watched a lot of his works when I was studying film. So if it’s true, I welcome it with all my heart.”Until then, Squid Game fans have the show’s final season, which seems destined to spark as much hullaballoo as the previous two. “People have been so curious. A lot of them come to me asking for spoilers. I keep telling them that if you want to have fun watching season three, you just have to hold still. It’s coming.”Squid Game season three is on Netflix on 27 JuneExplore more on these topicsSquid GameTelevisionNetflixDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

No one would say, “Better not put the kettle on in case somebody wins a quid”’Interviews byRich PelleyMon 23 Jun 2025 09.57 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 16.02 EDTShareDavid Liddiment, ITV director of programmes (1997-2002)I was responsible for the schedule. I’d listened toChris Tarrantdoing this game on the radio – Double or Quits – which was brilliant. I was intrigued by its TV version, called Cash Mountain, because it was well known in the industry that various people had turned it down. I invited the producer, Paul Smith, to pitch the full idea to me and Claudia Rosencrantz, ITV’s controller of entertainment.My main worry was: how likely was it to bankrupt the network? Four multiple-choice answers seemed too easy. I played the game with Paul in the office, with Claudia as my phone-a-friend, and quickly realised that as the amount of money at stake got higher, more and more doubt crept in. “We’re not going to call it Cash Mountain. I think that’s a terrible name,” I said. “Let’s call it Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” It’s the title of a song written by Cole Porter for the 1956 film High Society.I agreed to commission it, so long as we could do a non-broadcast pilot. It was clear that the quiz never really drew to an end: one contestant would win or lose, then another comes on and does the same thing. There was no natural climax. So I thought we should launch it as a strip – on every night – to maximise the drama. Initially I was going to schedule it at 7pm, but I already had Emmerdale working well at five times a week at 7pm, so I decided to go for broke and play it at 8pm, in the hope that the tension of someone potentially winning a million quid would create gripping prime-time drama.Rather brilliantly, it did very well and became a hit within its first week. Because everyone was talking about it, the ratings got bigger, and we had a phenomenon on our hands. Then the whole world recognised that what was happening in Britain was quite extraordinary – and everybody wanted their own version.Chris Tarrant, presenter (1998–2014)I was at Capital Radio presenting the breakfast show, and also doing the clip show Tarrant on TV. David Briggs, my former producer at Capital, had left to seek his fortune on TV. We’d done a game on the radio called Double or Quits, where your pound doubled with every correct answer. Briggsy said over a lunch one day: “I’m trying to turn it into a TV format.” I was so bloody busy, up at 5am, I only did the pilot as a favour.We shot it in July. The producer Paul Smith said: “It needs more menace.” Composers Keith Strachan and his son Matthew were given 24 hours to rewrite the music, all those stings and “Da da das …” so we could shoot a second pilot straight away. We knew the prizes had to go up fast. Nobody would say: “Better not put the kettle on in case somebody wins a quid.” It was my job to add tension. The prize was a cheque, so I’d say: “We don’t want to give you that …”My screen didn’t show the answer – and if I knew it, I’d do this really gormless faceThe pauses were added to really milk the tension. The show was filmed the day before, with rough spots where we needed to break to the adverts. I’d deliberately choose the most dramatic places to cut to commercials, usually between the contestant giving their final answer and me saying whether it was correct. I always wondered if, when the first person played for a million, I’d still have the guts to say: “We’ll take a break.”But I did when Judith Keppel was on her way to winning the first million, and she looked at me like: “You bastard!”Briggsy said it was about the shoutabilty: people shouting at the television. My screen didn’t show the answer. Even if I did know the answer, I’d taught myself to do this really gormless face, not even raising an eyebrow. I remember one contestant, this really nice guy, a fireman. His £500,000 question was: which of Henry VIII’s wives did Holbein paint a portrait of? It’s weird what you remember from school. I was thinking: “For fuck’s sake, just say Anne of Cleves.” He didn’t answer and settled on £250,000. I’d have bet a million quid I was right.The press thought winning such high amounts of money would ruin people’s lives. We had therapists on standby, but no one who won £500,000 said: “Take me to my therapist.”Before the first show, I was in my dressing room with my wife and manager. I said to them both: “Do you mind giving me 10 minutes?” I must have thought: “You better take this one seriously, mate. It might go big.”Jeremy Clarkson, presenter (2018-present)The Grand Tour had just gone from weekly to two specials a year, freeing up a lot of time. Wayne Garvie, president of Sony PicturesTelevisionand an old mate from the BBC, had worked out he owned the rights to Millionaire, and asked if would I like to host it.Kevin Lygo, the managing director of ITV Studios, said: “That sounds like good idea.” I signed on the dotted line right there. We went through a couple of runs on a laptop in my office. Before I knew it, I was learning how to use the Autocue in the TV studios in Manchester. The main problem is that the Autocue is so far away, I’ve had to start wearing spectacles.View image in fullscreen‘Unbelievably cool’ … Jeremy Clarkson with £1m winner Donald Fear in 2020.Photograph: Stellify Media/PAI didn’t think I needed to stamp my personality on the show. I thought: “Chris Tarrant did a pretty good job. I just have to do what he was doing.” One of the new things was the “Ask the host” lifeline. I don’t think there’s any shame in not knowing about Greek mythology or tiramisu. Sometimes you luck out. I was asked: “What was the first American spaceship to orbit the Earth?” I knew it was Friendship Seven, and thought: “I’m going to look like an absolute genius.” Other times you’re asked, “What’s a four-legged animal that barks?”, don’t know the answer, and feel like an idiot.Donald Fearis the only person who has won a million on my watch. He was unbelievably cool. The million-pound question was something about pirates that I didn’t know, even though I’d just done a programme about pirates, but he knew it was Blackbeard.I’m supposed to wear hearing aids these days – I’m deaf as well as blind – but people would assume it was an earpiece and I’m feeding people the answers, so I thought I’d better not. These days you can even get spectacles that translate any language in real time. Presumably you could use similar technology to help you answer various questions, but they have an independent adjudicator to spot any anomalies like that. How the coughing thing ever happened was incredible. When you watch it, you think: theymusthave known something odd was going on.It’s a show I really look forward to. I get up with a spring in my step when I think: “I’m off to ask people what the capital of Ecuador is.” It’s great. I get to sit in a nice, warm chair and make people happy. You can’t ask much more than that.Explore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeTelevisionChris TarrantDavid LiddimentJeremy ClarksonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the early 2000s, 28 Days Later became the most popular and influential zombie movie in decades, with its fast-moving, virally infected, not-quite-undead marauders rampaging through a post-apocalyptic England. Now Boyle and Garland have reunited with28 Years Later, easily the most talked-about horror movie sinceSinners, and the biggest zombie movie since the PG-13 dilutions of World War Z back in 2013. Compared with the countless familiar zombie movies and TV shows that have popped up since the original movie, 28 Years Later is a thorny, challenging, unpredictable work, which means there’s plenty to discuss now that it’s spent a well-attended weekend in wide release. Here are some major spoiler-heavy topics related to the film’s style, themes, sociological implications and, of course, that ending.28 Years Later review – sprinting zombies take evolutionary leap forward in badass threequelRead moreZombieevolutionThe original 28 Days Later is notable for its zombie efficiency. Rather than the slow shuffling and gradual, varying levels of undead decay often seen in zombie classics from George A Romero (and the many movies influenced by his films Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and so on), these zombies aren’t technically zombies at all. They’re victims of a lab-leaked “rage” virus (with the hilariously dodgy origins of … showing monkeys violent news footage?!) that seems to be spread by virtually any exposure to an infected person’s blood or saliva. Within a minute or two, the newly infected will be vomiting blood and attacking anyone around them in a deranged frenzy. The victims are analogous to zombies because of their seeming thirst for human carnage (though it’s never clear whether they’re truly “feeding” on humans) and the mindlessness with which they pursue it, but they’re a less supernatural variation than some of their ancestors. The same was true for the 2007 sequel 28 Weeks Later.That’s still the case in 28 Years Later, but with the passage of time built into the story, Boyle and Garland introduce new variants on the post-viral populace. There are still mobs of rage-virus victims, often in rags or no clothing at all, roaming the countryside, which remains confined to the United Kingdom. But 12-year-old Spike (Alfie Williams) and his dad Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) also encounter infected who have been grotesquely swollen by the virus, and now lurch belly-down around in the dirt, often subsisting on worms. On the other end of the spectrum, our heroes are also menaced by an “alpha” zombie who is bigger, stronger and craftier than the others. He also seems capable of reproducing, and not just because of his, ah,endowments. Later in the film, Spike and his ill mother Isla (Jodie Comer) encounter a woman who is both infected and pregnant – and is even distracted enough by the imminent arrival of her baby to allow Isla to lend a helping hand in the birth. Perhaps most surprisingly, the baby is born healthy, seemingly not infected with the virus. (The idea of an asymptomatic carrier, as seen in 28 Weeks Later, goes unmentioned, but it’s a fair bet that if the baby were infected, the humans who carry her around for the next day-plus would probably get sick at some point, too.)The movie’s resident philosophical doctor-recluse Ian Kelson (Ralph Fiennes) chalks this up to the miracles of the human placenta, which seems … oversimplified. But these zombie variants raise a lot of interesting questions. Are the alpha zombies evolving closer to what we think of as humanity, regaining some of their intelligence while maintaining a capacity for brutal violence? (He’s seen multiple times pulling off heads in tandem with spines, like something out of a Predator movie.) It’s vaguely implied that the alpha is the father to this newborn, suggesting that the zombies procreated post-infection, which is something these movies (or any movies? Surely there must be one with zombie sex, but it’s not a typical feature of the genre) haven’t shown before. Zombie reproductive rates must still be low; Dr Kelson points out that a human baby can’t really survive for more than a few days without milk, and if infected women can still breastfeed at all, it’s hard to imagine how that would work on a practical level, especially in terms of not spreading the virus. Maybe this baby, saved by Isla and Spike, is the first zombie-born human to survive.Thematically, the baby’s arrival fits with the complication of the seemingly functional isolated community where Jamie and Isla have raised Spike. The baby, who Spike ultimately delivers back to the community before striking out on his own, implies that the world that they’ve understandably cut themselves off from nonetheless keeps turning, and may even produce new humans without the easiest and most comforting signs of renewal. Quite the opposite: the zombie variations give that outside world its own strange new shape, rather than showing the virus simply burning itself out in quarantine. Viewers will probably be split on whether dirt-crawlers or alphas are too cheesy, too reminiscent of other zombie pictures, too far afield from the relatively grounded viral origins of the first film. But in a movie that some audiences will probably also find short on traditional thrills, these elements keep the landscape strange and unpredictable.DigitalrevolutionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Miya Mizuno/APAs a director, Boyle has long been known by a certain degree of flash;28 Years Laterevolves his style even further. The original film made innovative use of early digital video, which has held up remarkably well even as the tech itself has degraded; few movies have reproduced the grimy low-res immediacy that sometimes smears into a kind of poetic abstraction. For the sequel, Boyle and returning cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle haven’t reproduced this look, either. Instead, they’ve updated it, using inventive multi-iPhone rigs to capture similarly bracing images. Boyle and Mantle use this technology to shoot from Boyle’s trademark extreme angles and unexpected vantages, add micro-freeze-frames to scenes of particularly tense action, and deftly utilize real locations, adding up to one the most distinctive-looking movies of the year and a major triumph for Mantle. For all of its wild swings, his work never feels overloaded or sensationalized. Instead, the visuals guide the audience through a series of expectations-bending shifts, including passages where the movie feels more akin to a dark fairytale (with the alpha looming in shadow on the horizon) than a traditional horror picture. As with 28 Days Later, it’s easy to see how other film-makers might imitate some of these techniques on a superficial level. It’s also hard to picture others bringing them together with such virtuosity. Digital cinematography is now the norm; Boyle belongs with Michael Mann, Steven Soderbergh and David Fincher as some of the few mainstream directors who are able to embrace its differences from celluloid, rather than trying to hide them.23yearslaterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc./PA‘You’d never make Slumdog today’: Danny Boyle on risks, regrets and returning to the undeadRead moreSomewhat more time has passed in the world of the movie than in our world; technically, they’re five years further into the future than we are. In terms of release dates, the movies have taken us from an immediately post-9/11 world to one that still bears the scars and hears the echoes of the Covid pandemic, a rise of authoritarianism, and countless post-9/11 armed conflicts, including one unfolding in the Middle East right now. Boyle has specifically mentioned Brexit as a touchpoint in the development of 28 Years Later, which indeed sees Britain isolated – by force, rather than by choice – and festering. Though the movie doesn’t underline any Covid parallels too boldly, it could be read as a post-pandemic allegory, with Spike’s desire to rejoin the world, regardless of how it’s been altered from what his parents knew, conflicting with the strictness of the community he was born into – essentially a quarantine within a quarantine. Dr Kelson, in the meantime, is determined to memorialize the dead with his towering bone temple of skulls, rather than using his resources to move on or fortify his defenses (which also sets our sympathies apart from outright Covid denialism or the anti-vaccine crowd). It might be surprising for a sequel to a movie that came out in the shadow of 9/11 to traffic in messaging that could amount to “never forget”, but Boyle and Garland turn that mantra around to grapple with how we, as the collective human race, are expected to proceed as survivors of so many contemporary disasters. How many of those disasters came to pass in the rest of the world, which we’re told has been cleared of the rage virus, is another one of the movie’s enticing open questions.Whatwasthatending?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Miya Mizuno/APOn paper, 28 Years Later ends on an infuriating sequel tease that leaves the movie largely unresolved. The reality is a bit more complicated than that. The film actually reaches a highly satisfying, if thoughtfully elegiac and open-ended, conclusion. After Dr Kelson makes an approximate diagnosis of terminal cancer for Isla, she asks him to be euthanized, and her son places her newly polished skull at the top of Kelson’s monument. Eventually, Spike returns to his island community alone – but only long enough to drop off the infant and a note for his father. He then heads back out into the unknown, alone. This both continues the coming-of-age thread at the beginning of the film, when Spike makes his first trip to the infected-heavy mainland with his father, and rejects it, via Spike not just dabbling in zombieland for some real-life target practice, but deciding to actually explore the country at length. He has prioritized a less regimented, prescribed life over the ritual and safety that he’s known, having accepted (at least to some degree) the role of death in life itself, through the loss of his mother.Then a bunch of chavs called Jimmy show up.The final scene of 28 Years Later actually picks up from its opening, set during the original rage outbreak, where a young lad named Jimmy escapes the zombies as his vicar father welcomes them, seeing the hordes as a harbinger of end times. Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s Jamie is close enough to a homophone of “Jimmy” to maybe mistake him as the grownup version of that survivor, but no: an adult version of the real and now tracksuited Jimmy (Jack O’Connell, who also played an interloper in Sinners) pops up to save Spike from another group of zombies. He’s commanding a mini-army of imitators and seeming acolytes who gleefully, athletically dispatch the infected as if they’ve just run in from a Guy Ritchie movie. Then the movie ends, not exactly on a cliffhanger, but leaving the audience hanging on what’s next for Spike and the Jimmys. This also involves a cultural touchstone most American audiences will miss, making the whole thing seem even more inexplicable: Jimmy and his gang are dressed like Jimmy Savile, a once-ubiquitous British TV presenter posthumously accused of widespread sexual abuse, including of children.Jimmy Savile died in 2011 and the allegations against him became well-known afterward, which means this Jimmy wouldn’t be aware of his namesake’s crimes. In the world of 28 Years Later, there’s a good chance they never came to light at all. But for 2025 viewers (at least those aware of Savile), the surface goofiness of this sequence gives way to discomfort, and more thoughts about what gets preserved in a fallen world. Is this apparent religious cult formed around the image of a Top of the Pops host a grim joke on the accidental whitewashings of history, or are there more sinister parallels to be mined? Alongside that question, there’s also some bonus confusion: the lead character of 28 Days Later, played by Cillian Murphy and unaccounted for in this film (and supposedly a lead in the as-yet-unfunded third film) is also named Jim.What’snext?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Miya Mizuno/APWell, Guy Ritchie hasn’t directed 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple – and neither has Boyle. Nia DaCosta, who made the 2021 Candyman reboot as well as The Marvels and Little Woods, directed the already-filmed Garland-penned sequel, which is supposedly out in January (though sometimes ultra-short-gap sequels wind up pushed around the schedule, fearful of going out too soon). Its subtitle refers to something that’s already been unveiled: Dr Kelson’s monument, which the movie seems to have left behind as Spike makes his way in the world. The second film could well circle back to follow Dr Kelson, and leave the Jimmys for whatever Garland and Boyle have planned for the third movie with Murphy; that would certainly fit the new movie’s repeated narrative swerves refocusing the who/what/where/when of survival. But Boyle and Garland have said that the Jimmys sequence does set up the second movie, and that Murphy will appear in a similar capacity to set up the third, so it’s fair to assume Spike will remain the lead character for that installment. (This would make him, and whoever joins him, the first 28 Days Later series character to really carry over, as Days, Weeks and Years all followed different groups of people.) Maybe the Bone Temple is more of a symbolic reference than a literal one, referring to how Spike carries awareness of the dead with him on his journey, which seems like a pointed contrast to the uniform joviality of the Jimmys. One thing is clear: Boyle and Garland have set up a sequel not by obviously holding over-many characters and stories back for another movie, but by overflowing this post-apocalyptic world with ideas.Explore more on these topics28 Years LaterNow you've seen itJodie ComerRalph FiennesDanny BoyleJack O'ConnellZombiesHorror filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She takes in the enormous raggedy hide and the strangeness of the wild creature stomping through her streets. Up ahead, a giraffe peeks warily through a first-floor window as a zebra skitters backwards from a growling dog. “Kudu, washa!” The instruction comes through my radio. We turn away from the child and hurl our hefty creature forwards. The crowd scatters. We thunder through the narrow alleys to catch up with the rest ofThe Herds.In 2021,Little Amal, the puppet of a refugee child almost 4m tall, walked from the Syria-Turkey border to the UK. The Herds, from the same team, is even more ambitious. This new theatrical mega-marathon is shepherding a pack of life-size animal puppets a distance of 20,000km, from the Congo Basin to the Arctic Circle. More than 1,000 people will take part in creating the odyssey and, as the animals march into Marseille, I become one of them – as a volunteer puppeteer – for a galvanising (if sweaty) week.The rich societies are not immune. Hunger is comingThe idea for The Herds was sparked when Little Amal reached southern Italy. Artistic directorAmir Nizar Zuabibegan to hear stories from climate refugees who had come to see the little girl walk. “They had left their countries because of droughts and failing crops,” Zuabi explains. “As a Palestinian, it felt familiar: the world has collapsed on me and now I need to leave.” The climate crisis is predicted to create1.2 billion refugeesby 2050. “It unites us,” Zuabi says. “The rich societies are not immune. Hunger is coming.” With the movement of animals often proving a warning sign to the rest of us, The Herds disturbs our easy indifference, forcing us to pay attention.View image in fullscreen‘My arms start to quake’ … Kate Wyver in Arles, France.Photograph: Danielle Hassanali“Lots of this hasn’t been done before,” says line producer Annika Bromberg as we puff up a hill to my first rehearsal, “so it has to be invented.” The team sprawls across continents, with producers including former artistic director of the Young VicDavid Lan, and executive producer Sarah Loader, who spends her days quenching one logistical fire after another. They work alongside local producers at each stop. While Little Amal was animated by professionals, the puppets in The Herds are animated, in large part, by volunteers like me. In each city, up to 100 participants train and perform over the course of a week.When I arrive at the rehearsal, the animals are scattered sleepily across a sports hall: minuscule vervet monkeys, bulky gorillas and elegant zebras. Made from recyclable materials, there are wooden hooves, ragged cardboard mimicking the rough texture of pelts, and iron structures inside the biggest beasts. My group of 40 are in the expert hands of the South African puppet-building collective Ukwanda, who made these complex, delicate creatures. “Breathing is the language of puppetry,” says puppet designerSiphokazi Mpofu, as she gently tends to a gazelle. “The animals have to smell, they have to graze.” Her gazelle snuffles at the floor so realistically it wouldn’t be surprising to see it gambol off on its own.I am in a trio with Bastien Bangil, a comedian, and Virgile Lancien, a student. They have been learning how to manoeuvre the kudu, a towering African antelope that is the heaviest animal in the room after the giraffe (the elephant is so weighty it rarely comes out in rehearsal). I am assigned the head, holding it above my own until my arms start to quake and fingers blister. Making these creatures seem real and alive is hard, grubby and surprisingly moving work. “You have all these humans contorting themselves,” puppetry director Craig Leo says as he fixes the hind leg of a lion, “to present these fragile creatures to the world.”If an animal breaks it is taken to hospital – it’s not just a puppet, it’s a lifeWhen a puppet gets broken, the team, referred to as doctors, speak of it as an injury and mend it in their hospital. One day when we step out of our kudu, his head falls off and a stick flies out of his thigh. “I’ll be gentle,” says Ukwanda’s Sipho Ngxola, wielding a drill. “It’s not just a puppet,” says technical director Muaz AlJubeh, explaining the level of care they take. “It’s a life.”As The Herds moves across borders, new animals will be added, with puppet-making workshops formed along the route, from Stockholm to Wigan. By the time the production reaches the UK, where it will rampage through London and kick off theManchester international festival, the pack of puppets will be 100-strong.Alongside the volunteers, the troupe includes 42 young artists from 19 countries. Known as E-Co (Emerging Company), they have been recruited to hold the production together, and are travelling, learning, performing and helping Ukwanda teach participants across the European leg of the journey. Ochai Ogaba, a Nigerian choreographer who guides our herd’s other kudu with enviable ease, is one of them. “I come from a place where climate change is not talked about,” he says. “Being a part of this project has unlocked my responsibility to look after this world.”When the rest of us are steady on our hooves, the Ukwanda puppeteers teach us a few words in the South African language Xhosa. These become the instructions we follow while performing, fed through headsets: when to stop, go, be alert, retreat, turn. And the most exciting, “washa”, meaning to act with fire: to gallop. When we run together, it feels like a stampede.In each city, the animals trample alongside local artists. These beautiful beasts have kicked up swirls of dust in Dakar and stamped with flamenco dancers in San Fernando (in the Spanish province of Cádiz); Ogaba’s company danced in tandem with the animals in Lagos. Our first performance is in Arles, where we appear with local aerial artistsGratte Ciel, the air fizzing with pyrotechnics and dry ice. Everything moves at such speed in this production that we are frequently navigating on trust alone, awaiting Zuabi’s next instructions. “Get ready to sweat,” he warns.Suddenly the quiet roads are packed with people, elbows and cameras jostling to the front. Where the response to Amal was one of continual welcome, The Herds creates a buzz of uncertainty. Peel back the beauty and awe and there is a sense of wrongness at having these wild animals walled in on urban roads. Ogaba’s kudu leads the pack. We nuzzle through the crowd to drink from the historical centre’s fountain, Zuabi reminding us to keep our animals agitated and afraid in this unfamiliar environment.View image in fullscreenMane event … a lion in San Fernando, Cadíz, Spain.Photograph: Tony-san/Ayuntamiento de San FernandoThe Ukwanda team stay close throughout, on hand for any injuries (puppet or human). Our walk finishes by the river, where Gratte Ciel’s topless artists stand on swaypoles, red skirts sweeping in the wind. To a soaring soundtrack, they start to bend, the giraffe’s neck tilting upwards towards these strange creatures moving in the sky. Knackered, our kudu limps to the finish line. Bangil and Lancien emerge from its wooden body with matching exhausted grins. “Tomorrow,” Bangil jokes, “the elephant?”Catching our breath, we have a moment to watch the end of the show. The aerial performers’ movements become more violent, their bodies now swaddled in flowing plastic sheets that swim through the air like clouds. The animals lower themselves to the ground. “Nothing dies like a puppet,” Leo told us in rehearsal. “You know that when the curtain closes, it won’t get up and walk off. But it also always holds the potential of life.” The remaining puppeteers abandon their creatures in the street and walk away to rapturous applause.“This won’t stop the climate crisis,” says Zuabi before the next day’s event. “It is not trying to be successful. It is asking: how do you fail responsibly? We need to rewild nature, but we also need to rewild our imagination, rewild our political systems.” By placing these animals on our doorsteps, made internationally and held by local hands, The Herds makes all of this belong to us: the beauty of nature, the potential of life, the choice to take action or continue to look away.The Herdsis in London 27–29 June, and across Greater Manchester 3-5 July, as part ofManchester international festival.

Yet the bill is such a stylistic mixed bag that it’s hard to draw many conclusions besides the simple truth that some have aged a lot better than others.Manchester’s ultimate cult band the Chameleons’ gnarled angst and integrity remains intact, particularly on the mesmeric paranoia of Soul In Isolation. So does the doomed glamour and brittle cool of the Bowie-indebted Psychedelic Furs, with suave showman singer Richard Butler increasingly resembling a louche rock’n’roll Peter O’Toole.“If this is shit, it’s your fucking fault!” declares the mohawk-sporting John Lydon, clad in a clown-like oversize blue checked jacket, as he arrives to begin Public Image Ltd’s set. He reconsiders, and concedes that at least a little of the blame may be his: “My voice is a bit squeaky because I’ve been on a three-week bender … in 12 hours.”Thankfully, PiL are not shit. Lydon’s attitudinal irony hangs from every note and word yet their throbbing dub excavations are thrilling, especially on a surprise revisit of Open Up, Lydon’s 1993 club collaboration with Leftfield. He quits the stage with a sneered swipe at absent ex-friends: “I apologise for nothing … except the karaoke Sex Pistols!”View image in fullscreenAttitudinal irony … John Lydon of Public Image Ltd.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesThe amiableJohnny Marrappears to be on a mission to refocus minds on the beauty of Smiths songs such as Panic, This Charming Man and How Soon Is Now? rather than on Morrissey’s current toxicity. Billy Idol is equally keen to restress his status as a punk-pop cartoon, spinning Frisbees into the crowd during a comedic new anthem, Too Much Fun.Technical issues bedevil the second stage. Happy Mondays have to cut their set short – mercifully so, on this wretched form – and the Damned and theJesus and Mary Chainare also curtailed, with the latter’s singer Jim Reid’s earnest apology – “Sorry it was so short!” – ironic for a band who, in their earliest days, regularly delivered 15-minute sets.The The tellingly open their set with Sweet Bird of Truth, their 1986 song about American bombing raids on the Middle East. Armageddon Days Are Here (Again) is infused with a similar doom-laden topicality, but the crowd notably warm far more to the sweet synth-pop alchemy of their early hymns to adolescence, This is The Day and Uncertain Smile.Everybody else is running late butKraftwerkinevitably line up behind their four onstage keyboards at the exact second they are due. Electronic music’s ultimate pioneers, they deliver music that sounds as sacred as school hymns: from Autobahn to The Model, they spiel out exquisite techno-symphonies, with peerless melodies to die for, in front of incredible 3D visuals. Playing songs close on half a century old, while headlining a retro festival, they don’t sound remotely dated: forever now indeed.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockIndiePunkJohnny MarrJohn LydonPublic Image Ltdlive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Will the happy couple go and see it?Brian LoganMon 23 Jun 2025 03.01 EDTShareThe benefits of hosting Eurovision are contested. But Liverpool has that song contest to thank, improbably enough, for wooing an exiled writer back to her native city. Helen Serafinowicz is the co-writer of BBC sitcomsMotherlandand, more recently,Amandaland. The world of TV, you might think, is at her feet – but instead she’s returning to Merseyside with a debut theatre show, a swords-and-sorcery pastiche about the relationship between Wayne and Coleen Rooney, rejoicing in the title The Legend of Rooney’s Ring.“I’ve started reconnecting with Liverpool recently,” says Serafinowicz, scouse accent unmistakable as she dishes up a cuppa at her home in Norwich. “And I was invited to the Eurovision song contest in the city a few years ago.” While there, she went to see her friend, the actor Keddy Sutton, in a Jonathan Harvey play calledA Thong for Europeat the Royal Court theatre. This was where teenage Helen used to watch heavy metal bands: elitist middle-class theatre the Royal Court is not. “It seems to have opened itself up to everyone.” And the play? “It was mad, but very funny. It showed that you can be very silly and true to Liverpool without taking the piss. That unlocked a lot of stuff for me. I began to think I might have some ideas.”It's a love story. I'm not making fun of themThe one she went with involved “a legend that exists in Liverpool of Wayne andColeen Rooneyhaving this massive argument in their car, and her chucking her very expensive engagement ring out of the window. The next day, everyone in town went out with their metal detectors, looking for it.” Local history? Urban myth? Or pretext for a sub-Game of Thrones summer panto with pop songs and a cameo for Donald Trump? “Coleen is a princess and her parents are queen and king, and Wayne is a warrior. They get together, they split up, she’s broken-hearted and he goes on a quest to find the ring and re-propose to her.” She pauses. “The theatre says they’ve never done anything like this before.”View image in fullscreen‘Some of their family go to that theatre and might come’ … the Rooneys at Aintree in 2012.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesIt is, she says, “a love story. I’m not making fun of them. There’s no Rebekah Vardy in it. I could have really gone for Wayne with some of the things that have stuck with him from previous news stories. But I don’t want to do that.” And as for Coleen: “She’s clever, she’s cool, she’s just a really interesting person.” She’s invited the Rooneys via their agent (no response so far) – and “I know that some of their family go to that theatre and might come.”Maybe that’s why the 51-year-old professes herself “a bit nervous” about the show. Or is it because the theatre, and writing by herself, are outside her comfort zone? The unglamorous-parenting comedy Motherland was co-written withSharon Horgan, Holly Walsh and Barunka O’Shaughnessy; so too its recent sequel Amandaland, about which Serafinowicz was “really not sure,” she recalls. “Because spin-offs don’t have a great record, do they? I was so surprised when we got those brilliant reviews.” Collaborating is tried and tested, then – but “being on my own is great too, to stick the blinkers on and delve into it”. And as for writing for the stage: “I just wanted to see if I could.”It’s like exposing yourself – like streaking at a football matchSo has she caught the theatre bug? “I would do, if the bug had a little bit of money attached to it!” Perhaps writing a local show for local people in Merseyside wasn’t the shrewdest way to capitalise on TV success. But it’s still pinch-yourself territory for a woman whose primary professional concern until recently was selling vintage furniture. “I had a shop here in Norwich. It’s what Hygge Tygge in Motherland was based on. I bought a lorry-load of mid-century German furniture from this guy selling it at £30 a piece. But the day I signed the lease on my shop was the day Motherland got the nod from the BBC. So I used it as an office. Customers would disturb me while I was on Zoom. It was a strange situation.”Back then, the most famous sitcom writer in Serafinowicz’s family was her then-husbandGraham Linehan (The IT Crowd; Father Ted), from whom she has since separated. Her brother, meanwhile, is actor, comedian – and host of Netflix’s recent Million Dollar Secret –Peter Serafinowicz. But now it’s Helen who’s hot telly property. “I’m in a really good position,” she admits. “People will look at my stuff. There are a million things I want to do, and not enough time to do them.”But first, Rooney’s ring. Might it be, in Eurovision parlance, her Waterloo? “I had a dream that I won a Tony award for the script. Oh, God!,” she groans, tea cups drained. “It’s like exposing yourself, like streaking at a football match. This is just what has come out of my head. I’m really interested – no, not interested, terrified – to see how it goes.”The Legend of Rooney’s Ring is at theRoyal Court Liverpool, from 18 July to 23 AugustExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Wayne RooneyColeen RooneyLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The energy in the room is overwhelming, overcoming any misgivings about performing to a seated crowd.Songs of contrasting styles are played one after the other, to highlight the malleability not only of Simz as a performer but of the combination of the live band and orchestra. Young, with post-punk production and Mike Skinner-esque rapping, topples into Free, which is soulfully stripped back. The string players create a frantic, horror-film atmosphere for Thief and Flood, but immediately after, serve to make the “I love you” on Two Worlds Apart far more tender. This extends to word painting: on Introvert, the flutes invoke a choir (“I see sinners in a church”); vibrato strings mimic a voice trembling and breaking on Lonely, the raw, vulnerable track about her internal struggle with producing new album Lotus.Joining her are Miraa May for Peace, longtime collaborator Obongjayar for Lion and Point and Kill, and Wretch 32 and Cashh for Blood. For the latter, Wretch emerges from the crowd and walks down through the stalls, clever staging since the song is structured as a phone conversation, forcing the audience to look between the two rappers like watching a tennis match.At points, Simz feels larger than life, spectacular, replacing conductor Chris Cameron at the helm of the Chineke! Orchestra during Venom, rapping while facing the ensemble until the chorus, to frantic lights. Yet she’s chatty between songs, strolls the aisles during Heart’s on Fire, and stands beaming like a schoolgirl soaking in minutes-long applause. The whole experience is perfectly orchestrated – in every sense of the word.Explore more on these topicsLittle SimzRapHip-hopMeltdown festivalFestivalsMusic festivalslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

It was a far cry from Twinkle the snarky dinner lady from Victoria Wood’s sitcom Dinnerladies, but not the first time she portrayed a real-life person. She played Myra Hindley in the 2006 ITV drama See No Evil: The Moors Murders, and the titular 19th-century Yorkshire lesbian landowner in the 2010 BBC period drama The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister.Peake has done a ton more TV: she played Veronica Ball in Channel 4’s Shameless, Martha Costello in BBC One legal drama Silk, and Grace Middleton in BBC One drama series The Village. She’s in that really weird (even for Black Mirror) black and white episode about the robotic dogs. She wrote and starred in a BBC Radio 4 play about Anne Scargill, who was married to Arthur. She used to play rugby for Wigan Ladies. And she pulled on a pair of hoseto play Hamlet.Back on the big screen, the Bolton-born Peake was the lead in2017’s Funny Cow, where her performance as a northern 70s stand-up was described as “magnificent” by Mark Kermode in the Observer. She’s inMike Leigh’s historical drama Peterlooas radical working class mother Nellie, and plays Samuel Beckett’s bit on the sidein 2023 biopic Dance First.Now, in Words of War, she takes on the role of journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya, who was murdered in Russia in 2006.In this very publicationPeake described her as “a woman with immense courage and integrity who, despite numerous threats to her life, continued to be a blazing beacon of truth in a time and place where speaking truth was extremely dangerous”.

Consider me a convert!Rebecca NicholsonMon 23 Jun 2025 17.05 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 21.31 EDTShareThe Gilded Age is a curious, unwieldy thing. It is rich in qualities that I love, such as Broadway stars of a certain pedigree and truly extravagant hats. But, for a series that clearly takes a great effort to make, at what appears to be an enormous expense, it is oddly slight. The events of New York society in the late 19th century glide on by, as women dressed in fine, frilly clothing dip in and out of dramas that are sometimes important, sometimes entirely trivial, but almost always afforded equal weight, regardless of how much they matter. To watch it is to sink into a comfortable fugue, and think mostly about the hats.The household of the sisters Agnes Van Rhijn (Christine Baranksi) and Ada Forte (Cynthia Nixon) has undergone a significant shift in power. After their nephew Oscar (Blake Ritson) almost ruined the family by losing Agnes’s fortune, the crisis of impending poverty was averted at the last minute by the revelation that Ada’s husband, the Rev Luke Forte, who died not long after they were married, was actually stinking rich thanks to a profitable textiles business, leaving Ada a fortune. Fancy that! The Gilded Age can be so soapy that the suds practically foam on the screen.The previously timid Ada is now funding the household, while the more domineering Agnes is struggling to adjust to her new position as a dependent. When Ada is drawn towards the temperance movement, her attempts to get the staff and her family to join her crusade against the evils of alcohol get short shrift. This goes on for some time. Nixon and Baranski are great, and I suspect that at least 80% of their scenes are contrived simply so we can watch them thesp, if thesping may be used as a verb. (On the evidence of The Gilded Age, it absolutely must be.) Baranski gets to deliver the Maggie Smith lines, such as responding to claims of an unhappy marriage: “Unhappy? What is this babble?”View image in fullscreenGiving it some thespian welly … Ashlie Atkinson as Mamie Fish and Carrie Coon as Bertha Russell in The Gilded Age.Photograph: HBOThe nouveau riche Russell household, preposterously showy even by Gilded Age standards, is undergoing a similar power shift. At the beginning, George Russell (Morgan Spector) is out west, buying mines, making money and plotting to build a railway across the US. This leaves his wife, the imperious Bertha (Carrie Coon, also giving it some thespian welly), in charge in New York, and being in charge is a position she relishes. She spends much of this season pondering how to rule the roost, and meddling in the romantic prospects of her son Larry (Harry Richardson) and daughter Gladys (Taissa Farmiga), who are hot tickets on the New York marriage scene.In the previous seasons, it could be hard to work out whether the creator,Julian Fellowes, had been too constrained by what he was supposed to be making, or too free to make exactly what he wanted to make. Whole episodes would go on, and on, as the stakes dwindled away like a candle burning down to a stub. At least in Downton Abbey, he let rip the onset of Spanish flu; here, it’s mostly society snubs, as women in big hats say things such as, “I hate to pull rank, but my grandfather signed the Declaration of Independence,” and, “What a ghastly gathering.”But it’s a lot more fun this time around. Modernity is coming, through the railways and commercially viable small clocks. Money comes and goes. Divorce rears its reputation-destroying head. Marian (Louisa Jacobson) announces she has taken a job at an ordinary high school. “But won’t she need a bodyguard?”, asks aunt Agnes. Peggy (Denée Benton), one of the least tiring characters on the show, has been destined for greatness, but now we finally get to see her on the verge of achieving it.There is romance everywhere. The debate over whether to marry for wealth, security or love, and whether these ambitions are mutually incompatible, is played out in various relationships, over different social plains. There is even the prospect of international fame, amid some boo-hiss villainy from English society, as the old ways butt heads with blunt American forthrightness.The Gilded Age has become not just grand, but silly too. Instead of joylessly pompous, this show is nowjoyfullypompous.

I do this with a heavy heart: one of the pleasures of this book is the jaw‑dropping coup de théâtre that comes halfway through. Until that point, Endling offers its readers the pleasures of a more or less conventional novel.The central character is a misanthropic obsessive called Yeva who drives a converted campervan around the countryside of her native Ukraine, rescuing endangered snails. She’s hoping to get them to breed, but some turn out to be endlings – the last living member of a species. First coined in the 1990s, the word was unknown to me before I read this book, but the tragic biological checkmate it describes is older than history. Aurochs, dodos, quaggas, mammoths and Tasmanian tigers must all have culminated in an endling.Instead of engendering new life, Yeva ends up being a hospice nurse for entire species as her charges become extinct. Her obsessive death-watch would be unbearably grim if it weren’t so funny. Here she is, indignant at the way her beloved snails are overshadowed by more glamorous species:Snails weren’t pandas – those oversize bumbling toddlers that sucked up national conservation budgets – or any of the other charismatic megafauna, like orcas or gorillas. Snails weren’t huggy koala bears, which in reality were vicious and riddled with chlamydia. Nor were snails otters, which looked like plush toys made for mascots by aquariums, despite the fact that they lured dogs from beaches to drown and rape them.Bearing constant witness to annihilation, Yeva finds her mental health is hanging by a thread. She’s also short of cash, so funds her mission by working for a company that runs so-called “romance tours”. Still reeking of her grotty campervan, Yeva turns up to swell the numbers at events to which foreigners have been lured by the comically specious promises on the agency website: “the secret of the Ukrainian Woman may be genetical. Invasions and wars led to fruity intermixing … Imagine an entire country of beautifulandlonely women! … This is where you, Western Man, enter.”It’s through the marriage agency that Yeva encounters the two characters who catalyse the plot of the novel: sisters Nastia and Sol. Inspired by their mother, the founder of a group of feminist activists, they want to draw the world’s attention to the patriarchal assumptions of the bridal industry. In order to do this, they’re planning to kidnap some of the foreign bachelors and hold them hostage in Yeva’s van. One of the bachelors, Vancouver-based Ukrainian émigré Pasha, completes the quartet of human characters at the novel’s heart. Pasha has returned to the land of his birth not only to find love but in order to fulfil a vague sense of artistic destiny.For roughly 100 pages or so, Endling barrels along, effortlessly resonating with larger ideas, sustained by humour and a sharp and empathetic intelligence. The book is shaping up to be an engaging comic heist: an eastern European Coen brothers caper, inflected with a feminist sensibility. And then Russia launches its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The shock of this event is so huge that it doesn’t just affect the lives of the characters, it breaks open the entire novel. It’s like one of those moments in the theatre when someone shuffles on to the stage to share the news of a terrible event behind the scenes: a fire or a flood.The scale of this disruption is acknowledged formally in the book. Reva does the novelistic equivalent of running the credits. The story we’re reading appears to conclude on page 136, complete with acknowledgments page, author biography and a note on the typeface. Then, overleaf, an alternative version of the novel resumes.We learn in this section that after the critical success of her first book, the short story collectionGood Citizens Need Not Fear, the author began and then abandoned a version of Endling. “Even in peacetime,” we overhear her telling her agent, “I felt queasy leaning into not one but two Ukrainian tropes, ‘mail-order brides’ and topless protesters.” A Canadian citizen of Ukrainian descent, she finds herself struggling to write, stricken with guilt, worrying about her grandfather who is living near the frontline in Kherson. She’s chastised by a ruthless inner voice that accuses her of opportunism. “Fourteen dead, ninety-seven wounded. But don’t let us interrupt. By all means, sink into those high-thread-count sheets.

Something deepens in the relationship between reader and author. We all have skin in the game at this point. Sitting in the theatre, with the smell of smoke rising from behind the curtains, the reader wonders, among other things, what on earth is going on? How is she going to pull this off? What’s going to happen to the central characters? Are the Russians going to bomb all of us?In this second half of the book, we return to the story of Yeva, Nastia, Sol and Pasha, as it unfolds in the days after the invasion. A possible mate has been sighted for one of Yeva’s lone snails. Yeva has to decide between driving the kidnapped bachelors to safety or heading towards Kherson and right into the path of the Russians. Given what’s happened so far, it’s not a surprise to learn that the book eschews the safe option. But now Reva has established a different kind of rapport with the reader and is able to intrude more directly into the narrative. She shares with us personal details about her connection with Ukraine, as well as her awareness of the war and the artistic challenge she faces: can anyone in good conscience make fiction out of these tragic events? Though not every element of the story is equally successful – I was left puzzled by the passivity of the kidnapped bachelors – the answer to that question is resoundingly affirmative.Endling by Maria Reva is published by Virago (£20).

Humble herself in origin,Hard she works through us.Nothing can cut the umbilical cord thatCalls us back to her, her bellyful of threadPaid out and yet perpetual, her silkenSac where we began.She is alone, outwith the worn orb web ofThe world. She’s woven into the wherewithalOf her own imagination, her mantleOf maternity.She is alone and she is loved among, asNo-one else in all her anonymity.One foot on the mountain, one foot on the web’sHer way, as she says.The legend of the weaving contest between the goddess Minerva (Pallas Athene) and the humbly born Arachne, istold by Ovid in Metamorphoses. The goddess is infuriated by Arachne’s ingratitude for her talent, and horrified by the scenes of un-godly behaviour her magnificent weaving depicts. After Minerva has ripped up Arachne’s work and beaten her with her shuttle, Arachne slips a noose around her neck. Minerva spares her life, but Arachne doesn’t avoid punishment: “Her whole body became tiny. Her slender fingers stuck to her sides as legs, the rest is belly, from which she still spins a thread, and, as a spider, still spins her ancient web.”In this week’s poem, from Gillian Allnutt’s new collection,Lode, Arachne becomes Arachnid, mother-spider and deified leader of her tribe. The ode that crowns Arachnid’s annual festival offers the tribe’s gratitude “to her and to their own being in her”, Allnutt’s endnote tells us. Ovid’s Arachne was rude and scornful about old age when Minerva appeared to her disguised as a grey-haired woman with a stick. Allnutt’s poem doesn’t only transform Arachne; it hands power to the singer-speaker, an elder of the tribe. Celebrating Arachnid’s power, she affirms her own.Allnutt, who describes herselfas a cultural Christianrather than a Christian poet, brings traces of Christian theology into her feminist and matriarchal narrative. Arachne’s redemption is through humility, signalled in a delicately homely first stanza: “Webs are small and spacious as simplicity / See-through as a summer’s day, old-fashioned as / A slip of butter-muslin, girlhood’s own.” “Webs” (importantly plural) represent simplicity, openness, respect for tradition. Once defiant in the self-assertion of young genius, Arachne/Arachnid is restored by her spider-smallness to her true imaginative resources.Imperfection is admitted. Spiders are “poor predators [who] love to catch the light / As it falls from the air”: like all life-forms, they’re devourers. Perhaps they’re especially like artists and writers in seeing their prey not as meat but as moving light. The winged creatures such arachnids trap become their means of self-creation, the wonders of addition: “What is not yet born, an acrobatic dot / And carry one.”Arachnid is always reborn, always mother. Her celebrant utters a gasp of thrilled discovery in the enjambment of verses two and three: “It’s // Our Arachnid.” Certain phrases in verse three evoke the rhythmic murmur of the prayer, Hail, Mary. But Allnutt’s goddess is wonderfully, humorously, earthed. She’s no “Mother of God”. As “ancestor, mother of all / Of us” Arachnid is also “mother of gorm and gormlessness / Among women.”“Gorm” may bea northern dialect wordfor “understanding”. Understanding, of a deep, grainy, common-sense kind, is what registers in the poem. Its opposite, the more familiar “gormlessness”, is the less ideal aspect of “simplicity”. Its use echoes the poem’s refusal of unthinking praise – the kind of praise Minerva expected from Arachne. The children of the spider-goddess are imperfect, too. But they are still the offspring of a divine mother, the “worn orb web” of earth, yet “woven into the wherewithal / Of her own imagination, her mantle / Of maternity.”Allnutt refreshes her diction with inventive interweavings: little grammatical “reversals” such as “Hard she works through us” and words with an antique patina: “silken”, “mantle”, “outwith”, “wherewithal”. Her alliterative music is a mnemonic web that reminds us that the tribal song lives by its orality. There are often whispers of end-rhyme. The tiny versatile spider of the word “as” recurs in verses one, two and six, signalling resemblance, duration and motion – the thread that is “paid out and yet perpetual”.In the last stanza, antithesis arrives at a more intriguing synthesis. The spider-goddess is “alone and [she is ] loved among, as / No-one else in all her anonymity.” The quality of being “among” others and “anonymous” – but unique – becomes a specific tribute in the line, “One foot on the mountain, one foot on the web’s / Her way”. The reference is to Lilian Mohin’s 1979 anthology of British feminist poetry, One Foot on the Mountain. A poetry anthology is an apt symbol of collectivism and individuality. And this particular anthology importantly “mothered” the art and politics of its female contributors.Lilian Mohin isremembered here by Cherry Potts, who in turn went on to found theArachne Press. Celebrating these poetic Mothers and their work, The Song of Arachnid presents the ecology of a feminised, maternally attentive cosmos in which weaving and mountaineering can both be “her way” and its generous, ecofeminist vision is enhanced by the celebration of real-life poetic mothers.The Song of Arachnid was written forthe Hardwick Park Festival of Minerva.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What’s ironic about the many instances detailed here of how daily life still excludes them is that being part of daily life is exactly what most disabled people wish to be; not visible, not exceptional.That said, Fighters does choose a focal point: the struggle of lower-limb amputee boxer Matt Edwards to gain approval from sport’s authorities to take part in amateur boxing bouts. Training and sparring have been a lifesaver for him; after losing a leg aged 19 in a road traffic collision, he fell into addiction. But with the boxing authorities refusing to let him compete, Edwards is forced to sweat it out – elegantly pivoting on his prosthetic limb – in white-collar bouts.The question of Edwards’ participation is in some ways highly specific, linked to his disability type (though there is a history of lower-limb amputee and wheelchair boxing), and available opponents. But it’s also emblematic of a wider resistance in sport and other arenas of life, both conscious and unconscious, to adapting to disabled people’s needs. Unbelievably, it can still come down to basic questions of access. Grimmett recounts an anecdote about a boxing gym who would only roll out their wheelchair ramp for him between 11am and midday.It’s exasperating because sport should be a universal route to self-validation and social interaction, all the more so for disabled people whose mental health is ground down by the constant struggle for recognition. Gladiator Jodie Ounsley, who is deaf, attests to how sport coaxed her out of her shell, and Amelia, a 10-year-old deaf boxer from a Pembrokeshire gym, is following the same path. There is some divergence here about whether the business rationale – the so-called “purple pound” – is the key driver for widespread change. Grimmett doesn’t editorialise, but lets the arguments breathe and allows quiet indignation to sink in. It would be good to see him tackle other facets of the disabled experience.Fighters is in UK cinemas from 27 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsDisabilityDisability and sportBoxingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Hashish is the means of dulling painful memories and, apparently, preventing subcutaneous eruptions of mint, in this distinctive and stubborn-headed post-Arab-Spring reckoning which comes with magic-realist overtones.Bahaa (Alaa El Din Hamada) is a disaffected doctor who, on hearing a woman’s complaint about being unable to stop her dead son manifesting, passes her a joint. Wandering through a set of decrepit apartments in a becalmed nocturnal purgatory, pursued by sprinting shadows and bemoaning his lost love Dalal, it seems he and his friend Mahdy (Mahdy Abo Bahat) have joined the ranks of the ghosts themselves. These ruins are psychological as much as anything: their dealer, a former Black Block activist, laments the failed revolution. Another acquaintance laments the 171 bullets that ended his life. There is much lamentation.With long dialogue scenes, Hamdy cleaves close to the Arabic verbal poetic tradition – though his tokers aren’t just lyrical but acerbic as well. “Talk to the letter,” bids Mahdy to Bahaa, referring to the sodden missive from his ex carried by the latter, which constantly soaks his trousers so everyone thinks he’s wet himself. But Hamdy isn’t merely loquacious but visual as well: showing his background as a cinematographer (he won an Emmy for his work on2013 Tahrir documentary The Square), he chiaroscuros the hell out of the deadbeat exchanges, occasionally breaking into ambiently soundtracked panning shots that recall Antonioni’s famous shot in The Passenger.Perfumed With Mint’s prolonged stasis becomes a bit wearing, but that is presumably the point: to relay the inertia of a society doubly haunted by the loss of the revolution’s unknown soldiers and disappearances under President el-Sisi’s repression. The mint symbolism is curious: growing out of Mahdy’s afro and people’s wounds, it seems to represent the creeping ruination of civilisation, the start of a myth-like reversion to dumb nature. But when it appears again in the lead-up to a surprisingly optimistic coda, it might also be a renewal. Hamdy, despite some longueurs, certainly shows a freshness of expression here.Perfumed With Mint isshowing at the ICA, London, from 27 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsEgyptAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

Floriane Devigne’s road trip documentary begins with such a relic: the last public phone booth in Paris, which also appears in Jacques Rivette’s mesmerising 1981 film Le Pont du Nord. Unlike their Instagrammable British counterparts, French phone boxes are usually painted in a demure grey and blend seamlessly with their surroundings.As it moves from the capital city to more remote areas, Devigne’s film observes the vanishing of a formerly essential utility as her cross-country odyssey sparkles with an endearing whimsicality. Instead of using talking heads, Devigne ducks into various phone boxes scattered acrossFrance, as she takes calls from her interview subjects. Stories of love and longing fill these unassuming booths, themselves once the location of secret rendezvous and romantic trysts. The interiors of these facilities are now caked with dirt and graffiti; the lovers of yore are long gone.In one of these booths, Devigne reads out graffitied slogans supporting the far-right National Rally and politician Marine Le Pen. It soon transpires that the disappearance of the phone boxes is just one symptom of a larger issue: funding cuts for public services in rural France. With state hospitals and schools closing down, local frustrations towards Macron’s policies morph into worryingly divisive rhetoric.Devigne’s talent for moving from a specific object to larger socio-political issues turns what could have been a nostalgia-heavy film into a clear-eyed examination of contemporary legislation and its consequences. With the past squarely in its rearview mirror, Allo la France looks towards the future, sounding an urgent warning about the disintegration of public amenities.Allo la France is on True Story from 27 JuneExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsFranceEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

It shouldn’t work, but it does – and so splendidly, too. In Paul Feig’s comedy Spy,Melissa McCarthyplays Susan Cooper, a timid CIA desk agent who gets sent out into the field by her fearsome boss (Alison Janney) after the death of her slick Bond-like colleague, Bradley Fine (Jude Law, in a rare comedic turn). The cast is full of delightful surprises. Rose Bryne is a stiletto-clad Oxford-educated villainess with quips so brutal that she makes Regina George look like Barney. Peter Serafinowicz does a game turn as an – admittedly very pre-#MeToo – cringey Italian pervert figure named Aldo (“like the shoe store found in American malls”).‘Always something I can watch’: why Spotlight is my feelgood movieRead moreAnd in the film’s most magnificent twist,Jason Stathamparodies the hard-as-nails action leads he’s played over the years as a hard-edged buffoon with “a habit of doing things that people say I can’t do: walk through fire, water-ski blindfolded, take up piano at a late age”. That’s not even to mention whatever it is that’s going on between the English comedian Miranda Hart, who stars as Susan’s best friend and co-conspirator, and American rapper 50 Cent, who plays himself.I was first introduced to McCarthy’s charms in another Feig feature, the 2011 comedy Bridesmaids, then hailed as a vital intervention in the major debate, considered legitimate and interesting at the time, about whether women were funny. Bridesmaids proved the affirmative. There were gross-out gags: who could forget Maya Rudolph’s diarrhea-ridden bride-to-be, festooned in her custom designer dress, running through a busy street before giving up to let loose among the cars, the sacred commingling with the literally shitty profane. Then there were the nuances of girl-world jockeying: the self-cannibalising competition involved in organising a bachelorette party, or showing up to a fancy party in your best clothes, only to be asked by the insouciant rich girl whether you had just “come from work”.Among this cast of funny women, McCarthy was a scene-stealer. As Megan, she first appeared as someone Hollywood would at best ignore or at worst despise: she was plus-sized, she was unglamorous, she dressed in clothes that – to borrow a joke fromSpy– made her look like “someone’s homophobic aunt”. But McCarthy delivered a magnetic performance of a woman who was foul-mouthed, sexually confident and utterly self-possessed. Far from being a figure of pity, McCarthy made Megan a figure of admiration.Those comic gifts are given more space to roam in Spy. McCarthy’s Susan Cooper is a meek middle-aged woman stuck in a fossilised routine, unappreciated at work and unseen in life. She watches her younger, thinner colleague get served faster at the bar, basking in the glow of the kind of male attention Susan’s never had in her life.Jude Lawgives her a hideous necklace with a grinning cartoon cupcake, which says: I like you, but I do not respect you. It is Susan’s invisibility, and the fact that people will underestimate her at every turn, that grants her a chance to go on a mission. Just follow the target from a distance, her boss tells her. Inevitably, Susan breaks the rules.My love for spy films began in the 2000s with cartoon Totally Spies, which follows a trio of high school girls in California who spend their time shopping, partying and undertaking high-flying missions for an international organisation. I was drawn to the boundlessness of their lives, their glamorous escapades, their incredible gadgets and total competence. That quickly led me to McG’s Charlie’s Angels films (great fun,dodgy accents) then later the classics: the Hitchcocks, the Bonds, the Le Carré adaptations.The spy films I returned to most, though, were the comedies that embraced the high camp of the genre, understanding that these stories were as total a fantasy as those about being saved by a perfect prince. I was also drawn to the stories about women, because the appeal of the genre is, to me, inextricably tied to gender. In a world that reminds girls that danger may be lurking around every corner, and asks women to embrace a kind of harried, self-sacrificial domesticity, the female spies in these films were a perfect on-screen foil.Spy – it’s in the name – is both a satire and homage. There’s a high-powered gadget lab with cars that look like smooth, expensive spaceships, and a sardonic gadget master to match. There’s a high-stakes poker game; a dangerous drop-off in a bumping club; a high-speed car chase through a European city. These tropes are both indulged and subverted to fun, frothy effect.And Spy is radical in other respects: it remains the only major Hollywood spy film that features a middle-aged woman as the lead. I know because every so often, in search of a feelgood film, I rewatch what can be inelegantly described as “female-fronted spy comedies”: Charlie’s Angels 1 and 2, the recent reboot of Charlie’s Angels, as well as the fun Mila Kunis-Kate McKinnon buddy comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me. Projects like these are few and far between; I guess Hollywood does not think there’s enough of an audience for them. To that I say: join us. The delights are profound; the sense of freedom intoxicating; the costumes and the gadgets and the intrigue sexy and absurd and larger-than-life – and an exciting new adventure, that great siren song to the desk-bound, is always just around the corner.Spy is available on Hulu in the US and Disney+ and Netflix in the UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsSpyMy feelgood movieMelissa McCarthyMiranda HartJason StathamComedy filmsPaul FeigAllison JanneyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From pop A-listers to underground ones-to-watch, here are our picksBen Beaumont-ThomasMon 23 Jun 2025 05.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 23 Jun 2025 08.59 EDTShare‘Not a vintage year,” came the usual grumbles about the Glastonbury lineup when it was announced in March – and it’s perhaps only in England where people would moan about the lack of quality on offer at a festival with more than 3,000 performances across five days. In reality, Glastonbury remains stacked with varied, progressive, boundlessly vital artists, and the real challenge is picking your way through them: here are some of our tips.The big namesAt 79,Neil Youngis as irascible and fired-up as a man a quarter of his age, and seems to steel-tip his laurels so he doesn’t rest on them: after reuniting with Crazy Horse in 2024, he’s swapped them out again for new backing band the Chrome Hearts (featuring 81-year-old legend Spooner Oldham on organ). You rather hope Young will get the same memo Elton John did in 2023, stating that the Pyramid crowds need more hits than most, though he may well ignore it. Even if he does, an ornery and obscureNeil Youngset is still a thrill.Olivia Rodrigodelivered a bracing seton the Other stage in 2022, naming the supreme court justices who overturned Roe v Wade that weekend and telling them “we hate you, we hate you” – and she has splenetic pop-punk and heart-rending balladry to match that venom. And kicking off these three Pyramid headliners on Friday night, there’s no doubting the pop heft ofthe 1975’s quite considerable catalogue, their lyrics rooted in the weirdness of the way we live now.View image in fullscreenSunset at the Pyramid stage.Photograph: Joanne Newman/AlamyOutside the headliners,Alanis Morissette– anthemic, ubiquitous in the 90s – is the kind of artist the Pyramid crowd unites behind: songs such as You Oughta Know and Ironic will be big moments.Noah Kahan’s Stick Season will be another huge Pyramid singalong, andRod Stewartback-to-back withChicis about as crowdpleasing as it gets.Rayeplays her biggest show to date before Young – she pairs old-Hollywood glamour with genre-surfing, propulsive pop and will put on a sumptuous show. Former Little MixerJadebrings bug-eyed personality to her solo performances, as dothe Prodigy, who still sound unhinged three decades after their peak. In the field and at home on TV, all eyes will be onKneecap– cabinet ministers and indeed our prime minister have voiced their distaste at this set going ahead, but you hardly imagine they’ll dial down their political fury, or indeed ketamine-referencing rap-rave intensity. AndCharli xcx’s current power-walking, phlegm-licking, Brat-heavy live show is the work of a pop star operating at the highest level.View image in fullscreenShowboating duo … Alt Blk Era.Photograph: Dean Chalkley for Earache RecordsRising starsIt’s worth trying, but you’ll be lucky to get in the Woodsies tent forLola Youngin her breakthrough year, showcasing global hit Messy and more – and the Avalon stage will probably be even more oversubscribed forParis Paloma’s dramatic, Florence-esque songcraft andOrla Gartland’s maximally emotive pop, any of whom could have commanded a decent Other stage audience. It feels as if Aussie indie-poppersRoyel Otisare one song from pan-Glasto awareness and are shamelessly populist, with their big singalong choruses (“you’re so fucking gorgeous!”) and bigger cover versions (Linger, Murder on the Dancefloor) making them a very reliable bet in a mixed-taste friendship group.Anyone unable to wait for the Prodigy’s industrial-jungle onslaught can enjoy a similar vibe from showboating duoAlt Blk Era. Rapper and singerLemfreck, winner of the Welsh music prize, is turning heads with his versatile vocalisations: one minute offering a croaking, conversational flow, the next soaring Sampha-like soul songs. And any Kneecap fans should check out hot drum’n’bass producerMozey– he did their latest single.Rap and R&BIf there is a criticism to be made of the lineup it’s that there’s a relative dearth of rap names – possibly a reflection of its waning position in mainstream pop culture – but there’s a scattering of masterful MCs, including arguably the hottest on earth right now:Doechii, whose preening brilliance, undercut with radical and self-lacerating honesty, makes for a series of miniature soap operas, dark thrillers and situation comedies. Her delivery, almost like dotting words on to the mic rather than speaking through it, is almost as superhuman as fellow performerBusta Rhymes, whose brain and embouchure continue to operate in a completely different gear.Don’t missBawo, whose funny and ruminative lyrics make him one of the UK’s most underrated MCs, followed straight after by beautifully melismatic R&B singerSasha Keableand socially conscious veteran UK rapperBashy.View image in fullscreenWedded to the hardcore punk scene … Turnstile.Photograph: Sonja Horsman/The GuardianRock and indieGlastonbury’s unofficial “no mosh” policy continues to fray at the edges, with some of their heaviest bookings to date. Powered as ever by Chino Moreno’s nape-tickling groans and nu-metal chatter,Deftoneshave rightly become lauded as true greats and this set could promise some cross-generational circle pits, helicoptering dreadlocks and airborne pints. DittoTurnstile, who – especially live – remain totally wedded to the hardcore punk scene even as they expand their sound.Woodsies on Sunday lunchtime offers a brace of smart, sardonic post-punk turns, first fromGurriers, then from Irish quartetSprints: powered by the withering vocals of Karla Chubb, they went Top 20 with their debut and they’ll no doubt be touting new material here. Also worth an earlyish start isHorsegirl, the Chicago indie-pop trio whose second album, produced by Cate Le Bon, is among this year’s very best, full of head-turning contradictions: naive yet world-weary, doleful yet brightly melodic. Having sloughed off his Black Midi bandmates,Geordie Greepis a maximalist prog-pop showman, whileRachel Chinouriri’s own alt-pop stagecraft has been honed by a spell supporting Sabrina Carpenter, and the reformedTVon the Radio, fronted by the ultimate Dilf in Tunde Adebimpe, remain magnetic.Dance musicIt started with a trickle of acts including Underworld and Orbital, and three decades on Glastonbury is essentially the UK’s best dance festival. One of the people from which today’s entire dance culture flows,Juan Atkins, is doing two polar opposite sets: as the bodypopping Cybotronas well an ambient set under his own name. Another Detroit icon,Richie Hawtin, is followed by similarly austere gear fromAmelie Lens, whileMathew Jonsonis another class act in the pure techno realm.Easing us in on Thursday evening areMajor League DJz, one of the biggest names pushing South Africa’s calm yet sensual amapiano sound. Of the back-to-back sets,Kettama b2b Interplanetary Criminalhas the potential for the most T-shirt-stripping, lizard-brained pandemonium of the weekend, whileConfidence Man b2b Job Jobsewill be chirpily cheery. In the bass zone,Skream and Bengawill hurl wobbling dubstep boulders andHiTechwill booty-shake through witty ghettotech, whileCalibretops an awesome daylong lineup of drum’n’bass and UKG at Levels on Friday. And kicking open the doors of perception with mini strobes in hand are two world-class, mind-expanding producers questing to the coalface of dance culture:VerracoandAvalon Emerson.Global namesView image in fullscreenEmotive musicianship … Abel Selaocoe.Photograph: Parlophone Records LtdAt 80, reggae legendBurning Spearis still devoted to uplifting Black consciousness and some gentle skanking for his mid-afternoon Pyramid set will limber you up nicely for the evening ahead, while there’s similar depth of heritage from his compatriotsBlack Uhuru.

It’s a question you will ask yourself on many occasions during the second instalment of Hideo Kojima’s hypnotising, mystifying, and provocatively slow-paced cargo management simulator series. First, because during the many long and uneventful treks across its supernatural vision of Mexico and Australia, you have all the headspace in the world to ponder its small details and decipher the perplexing things you just witnessed. And second, because the question so often reveals something profound.That it can stand up to such extended contemplation is a marker of the fine craftsmanship that went into this game. Nobody is scribbling down notes to uncover what Doom: The Dark Ages is getting at or poring over Marvel Rivals’ cutscenes for clues, fantastic as those games are. It is rare for any game to invite this kind of scrutiny, let alone hold up to it. But Death Stranding 2 is a different kind of game, one with the atmosphere and narrative delivery of arthouse cinema, light of touch in its storytelling but exhaustive in its gameplay systems, and the tension between the two makes it so compelling. At first you brave one for the other; then, over time, you savour both.For anyone who missed the first Death Stranding, yes, this really is the second in a series of games about moving cargo between waypoints, on foot or by vehicle; delivering packages of food, tech and luxury items, like a post-apocalyptic Amazon driver. A mysterious event fundamentally changed the world at the start of the first game, allowing the dead to return to the realm of the living as spectral entities known as Beached Things (BTs). When a BT kills a human, it creates a disastrous event called a “voidout”, a kind of supernatural nuclear bomb explosion that leaves behind nothing but a vast crater.View image in fullscreenA screenshot from Death Stranding 2: On the BeachWith humanity fragmented and sequestered in underground bunkers, protagonist Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus) was entrusted with connecting the remaining pockets of civilisation in the US to a global tech infrastructure called “the chiral network”, restoring hope for a better tomorrow. He managed it, too, making it across the entire continent with a sort of supernatural infant, Lou, carried in an artificial womb. As this sequel begins he is enjoying a secluded life in Mexico with Lou, now a toddler.And believe me, those are the scantest cliff notes possible. Death Stranding 2 begins with six solid minutes of cutscenes that attempt to convey the strange world of sci-fi and poetic metaphors that Kojima has constructed, and even that feels like a cursory summary. Decrypting the mysteries is half the fun here (the other half being the box-shifting) but even if you don’t engage that deeply with the world, it follows its own kind of dreamlike logic and starts to make intuitive sense. It is not clear whether Death Stranding 2’s Australian once looked like the one we know, for example, or whether it was always a patchwork of Icelandic tundra, snowcapped mountains and multicoloured desert. What matters is that it feels consistent.Meditative it may be, but this isn’t a game about watching Sam enjoy retirement and fatherhood for 50 hours. He is inevitably called back into action, this time reconnecting the Mexican and Australian populations to the chiral network for an outfit called Drawbridge, a logistics company funded by an unknown benefactor and headed by returning character Fragile (Léa Seydoux). If that sounds a bit dry, what if I told you that Fragile wears a pair of long Greta Garbo gloves around her neck, which she can move like a second set of hands?View image in fullscreenElle Fanning in Death Stranding 2.Photograph: Sony Interactive EntertainmentA swashbuckling gang of assists Sam on his mission, following him around on the DHV Magellan, a ship with more A-listers on board than a Cannes red carpet. Seydoux, George Miller, Guillermo del Toro, Nicolas Winding Refn, Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna all give brilliant performances, as does veteran game actor Troy Baker as chief baddie Higgs. The major characters exist primarily as poetic devices and morbid metaphors: Rainy (Kutsuna) is an ostracised optimist who makes it rain whenever she goes outside; Tarman (Miller) lost a hand to supernatural tar, and can now use it to guide the ship through its currents; Heartman (Darren Jacobs) dies and is reborn every few minutes. By rights, they should all be simply too strange to invoke pathos, but there are rare moments when the allegory is dialled down and they interact in human and poignant ways. If you don’t feel a lump in your throat watching Rainy and Tomorrow (Fanning) sing together, it’s not just Deadman who is dead inside.Package delivery is, strangely, depicted to the highest of gameplay standards. It sounds boring, but you can’t help get pulled in by the magnetic draw of these detailed systems. In the last game, combat felt like an afterthought, but there is more of it this time as missions bring you into conflict with both BTs and other humans, and it is supported by typically slick mechanics that make launching a grenade or snapping a neck feel equally gratifying. You can fabricate tools to take with you – ladders and climbing ropes for mountainous routes, assault rifles and grenades when a fight is likely. The pleasure is as much in the preparation as it is in the action; it feels good to impose some order on an otherwise chaotic and unknowable world. That’s probably why we all baked so much banana bread during lockdown.Kojima had a draft for Death Stranding 2’s story before the Covid-19 pandemic, but rewrote it from scratch after being locked down along with the rest of the world. You don’t have to look too hard to see the influences – a population that is too scared to go outside, governments that promise to save you by putting an end to travel and physical contact, the profound loneliness of Sam’s job as a porter travelling solo across barren landscapes.Fittingly, you can interact with other players, but only at a distance, sharing equipment, building structures and leaving holographic signs and likes for other players in their own games. This ends up being a biting piece of lockdown satire – as time goes by the world becomes clogged up with flickering icons, and as more structures appear you are confronted by constant “like” symbols. It feels like the mind-numbing attention spam of social media, and there’s no way this is an accident.The first game had the advantage of surprise. Death Stranding 2 does not. Much of what is good – and what is tedious – about this game was also true of the last, but at the same time it has refined each bizarre element. Combat feels punchier, the world map more hand-crafted, missions more varied. Asking you to do all of that schlepping about all over again in a whole new game should feel like a practical joke, but it is so mechanically rich and loaded with meaning, you just nod and don the backpack a second time.Of the many things Death Stranding 2 is trying to say, the message that comes to the fore is: you are never truly alone. Global disasters, big tech, even death itself – these things might abstract the way we connect to one another, but they can’t sever the connection altogether. Not bad for a game about delivering boxes.Death Stranding 2 is released on 26 June, £69.99/US$69.99/A$124.95Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5SonyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sitting by the Baltic Sea, toes in the water, I gaze at distant, tree-covered islands as gentle waves lap over the long, flat rocks. I follow a rough, winding path back to my cabin, through woods so quiet you can hear the pine needles fall.I’m in Santalahti woods, near Kotka on the south-east coast of Finland, on the trail of Finnish author, novelist, painter and illustratorTove Jansson(1914-2001). Best known as creator of the Moomins, and for her love of island living, Jansson also wrote for adults. Last year, her first novel,The Summer Book, was made into a film starring Glenn Close and directed by Charlie McDowell. One film critic has described it as “an ode to Finnish archipelago nature”.View image in fullscreenThe Summer Book is a series of 22 vignettes on island summer living, featuring a young girl, Sophia, and her grandmother. I first read the slim volume in the early days of the Covid lockdown.During that uncertain, fearful time, and every year since, reading it has been a balm, a reminder to slow down and pay attention. I’ve come to Finland to explore Finnish summer living, fill my lungs with archipelago air and try to find a little of the stillness and wonder that Jansson’s writing gives me.View image in fullscreenTove Jansson pictured in 1956.Photograph: Ian Dagnall Computing/AlamyIn Finland, summer is to be savoured. The south of the country receives just six hours of daylight a day in winter, and in the far north the sun remains below the horizon in December. It’s this darkness that makes Finns revere and celebrate summer. Schoolchildren get a 10-week summer holiday, and most Finns take July off work. Summer is mostly spent in one of the half a million summer cottages, known asmökki,usually by a lake or on one of the tens of thousands of islands scattered along the coastline.Amenities vary, but there’s a deep affection for traditional rustic cabins: off-grid, without electricity or running water, and definitely no wifi. Cottage living, ormökkielämä, is focused on slow living in harmony with nature: time in the woods, in the sea, picking berries, and relaxing in the sauna.I begin my journey on Pellinki, in the Porvoo archipelago, about an hour east of Helsinki. This part of Finland is bilingual. (Like 80% of Pellinki residents,Tove Janssonwas a Swedish speaker; in Swedish the island is called Pellinge). It’s a quick hop across the water on a free ferry into a different, slower pace of life. Through the woods I spy dozens of cute red and yellow painted cabins, each by a stretch of water.Tove spent many childhood summers on Pellinki, and she drew her first Moomin cartoon here – on the wall of an outhouse – as a teenager. To generate extra income, island families would rent their homes for the summer, moving into an outbuilding. Tove’s family rented the home of the boat-building Gustafsson family. Abbe Gustafsson, the same age as Tove, became a lifelong friend and the children turned their daily chore of milk collection into an elaborate challenge: there were trees to be navigated in one direction, streams to jump over and “evil” cracked rocks to sprint past.View image in fullscreenThe forested islands of Pellinki (Pellinge)This childhood game was the inspiration for The Book about Moomin, Mymble and Little My, which has been adapted into the puzzle-solving outdoorIsland Riddlestrail. Clues are in rhyme, and I try a few, filtering water to make the next clue rise to the surface in a small well, and hunting for a red umbrella in the trees. “You just have to play like a child and use your imagination,” Erika Englund, a local who devised the trail, tells me.From the woods you can see the small island of Bredskär, where the Jansson family built a house in 1947. Craving further solitude, Tove built a cabin on the even tinier island of Klovharun in 1964, where she spent 28 summers with her life partner, graphic artist Tuulikki Pietilä. The couple lived a very simple life here, with the island, each other, and their vast imaginations for company.Tove built a cabin on the tiny island of Klovharun in 1964, where she spent 28 summers with her partner, Tuulikki PietiläThe landscapes of Pellinki, Bredskär and Klovharun are easily recognisable throughout Tove’s work in all mediums. The sea and the weather play a central role: storms rage, belongings are lost and found in the sea, and life is lived with respect for the elements.Porvoo is the nearest town to Pellinki and a stopping point on the way to the archipelago. The old town is one of the best preserved in Finland, built after a catastrophic fire in 1760. I wander through the winding streets, admiring the colourful wooden homes and learning about the town’s history as a salt trading port, with Birgitta Palmqvist fromPorvoo Tours.View image in fullscreenPorvoo has one of the best preserved old towns in Finland.Photograph: Riekkinen/Getty ImagesI stay at the handsome art nouveau-styleRunohotel in the town centre.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOn the outskirts of Porvoo I visitKannonnokka, where a sauna has been partly built into rock deep in the woods. Sauna culture is essential to Finns: in 2020, Unesco recognised Finnish sauna culture as part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, and there are an estimated 3.3 million saunas in a country of 5.6 million people (though everyone I speak to gives a higher number). Even in the tiny cabin on Klovharun there was a sauna in the cellar (more important than running water). Kannonnokka sauna is kept at 60C for longer, laidback sessions, with dips in the cold plunge pool and gently warm whirlpool bath. Afterwards, the young couple who run the venue cook delicious pancakes over the fire.As a young artist, Tove painted murals for local buildings in towns along the Finnish coast. In Kotka, 50 miles east of Porvoo, a huge fairytale mural remains on show in the town’s youth work department. It’s a delight, with layers of stories, hidden Moomin characters and gemstone embellishments.The long daylight hours are perfect for happihyppely, a Finnish concept translated literally as “oxygen hopping”: taking a short walk for fresh air and exerciseIn Hamina, a neighbouring town, panoramic fantasy scenes decorate the walls of the town hall: mermaids flirt with cadets under water and shipwrecked treasure fills Hamina harbour. In Kotka, I visit Maritime Centre Vellamo, whereCourage, Freedom, Love! A Moomin Adventurelaunched this year (it runs until March 2027) to mark 80 years since the first Moomin book was published.Children can play inside a replica Moomin house, clamber on the rocks surrounded by an animated sea, and dress up in a little theatre. Also on display is Tove and Tuulikki’s boat, Victoria, built for the couple by Abbe Gustafsson.My voyage of good cheer around Finland – the world’s happiest countryRead moreFrom Kotka I catch a free ferry to Kaunissaari (90 minutes). The island’s name translates to “beautiful island” – fitting, given its pine forests, long white beaches and pretty marina. The harbour is a cluster of red wooden cottages with wildflower gardens, and boat sheds with spooled fishing nets outside. There’s a fascinating island museum, packed to the rafters with memorabilia from centuries of hardy island living. I follow winding paths through the trees to find a long, sandy beach, which I have all to myself. I can’t resist a swim – even without a sauna to plunge into. I warm up at Kaunissaaren Maja restaurant, where the simple salmon soup recipe has not changed in 70 years.View image in fullscreenThe cabin on the tiny island of Klovharun built by Jansson in 1964Near Kotka I stay in my own little summer cottage. The amenities are basic: a kitchen diner and one bedroom, but of course a sauna. I set it to heat then spend an hour walking through the woods and around the bay, watching the sunset. The long daylight hours are perfect forhappihyppely, a Finnish concept translated literally as “oxygen hopping”: taking a short walk for fresh air and exercise. Back at my cabin I jump between the heat of the sauna and dips in the icy Baltic Sea. I exhale, with the night, the light and the summer stretching out in front of me. I can see why Tove Jansson loved this coastline: all I need for a dreamy summer is right here.The trip was provided byVisit Finland.Runo Hotelin Porvoo has doubles from €171B&B.Self-catering cabins atSantalahti resortstart from €89(sleeptwo); sauna cottages from €198(sleeps up to four)Explore more on these topicsFinland holidaysEurope holidaysScandinavia holidaysCultural tripsThe MoominsTove JanssonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cream cheese. In a fit of inspiration (I was thinking aboutrugelachat the time), I replaced almost all the butter with it to great success. These scones are a hit with children, too: my three-year-old quite competently helped make them, from fetching rosemary from the garden to stamping out the dough and brushing on the egg wash. A nice kitchen activity for any resident children, even if your dog turns up for the cheese tax at the last stage.Mini parmesan, apple and rosemary sconesPrep15 minCook15 minMakes30 mini scones25g cold butter, cubed100g cold full-fat cream cheese100g parmesan, roughly broken300g plain flour,plus extra for dusting2 scant tsp baking powder1 tsp sea salt2 rosemary sprigs, needles stripped and finely chopped1 medium-sized apple, grated1egg50ml milkFor the topping1egg, beaten50g parmesan, finely gratedA few small rosemarysprigs(optional)To serveCold salted butter or BoursinHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Tip the cubed butter, cream cheese, parmesan, flour, baking powder, salt and rosemary into a food processor, and blitz until sandy. In a bowl, combine the apple, egg and milk, then pour into the butter mix and blitz briefly, just until everything comes together into a dough.Tip out on to a floured surface, and then pat down until even and 2cm-thick (you can use a rolling pin, but this is such a malleable dough that just your hands will work fine). Use a mini round cutter to stamp out circles, and transfer these to a lined baking sheet. Bring together the offcuts, pat back down and cut out more circles until you’ve used up all the dough (I got 30 mini scones in total).Brush each scone with beaten egg, top with a scattering of parmesan and a tiny sprig of rosemary, if you wish, then bake for 15 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through. (If you used a larger cutter, check on the scones after 18 minutes.)Transfer to a wire rack to cool a little, then serve warm with cold salted butter, or at room temperature with butter or more cream cheese.Explore more on these topicsBakingQuick and easyFoodSnacksCheeseFruitBreadEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

Rule two: nothing too crumbly (we’re looking at you, filo). Rule three: bonus points if it gets better after a few hours in a sealed plastic container in the sun. Today’s Tunisian-style quiche passes that test with flying colours: it’s sturdy, green, and full of spice and charm. Bake it, slice it, pack it. Eat with your fingers, chase with cold lemonade. And if you drop a piece? Rule four: pretend it never happened.Broccoli, pea, broad bean and leek maa’kudaPrep15 minCook1 hrServes8-10Sea salt andblack pepper1 small headbroccoli(about 250g), broken into florets200g frozen broad beans150g frozen peas2 tbsp olive oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced1 leek, sliced, washed and drained20g bunchbasil, leaves picked and roughly chopped20g bunchflat-leaf parsley, leaves picked and roughly choppedFor the egg mix9 eggs100ml milk, or any milk alternative of your choice1 tsp flaky sea salt½ tspground black pepperFirst blanch the veg. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the broccoli, cook for five minutes, then add the broad beans and cook for another two minutes. Add the peas, boil for a minute more, then drain the lot into a colander.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. In a large saute pan, heat the oil and garlic, then, as soon as the garlic starts to sizzle, stir in the sliced leeks and saute for two minutes. Add all the drained blanched vegetables, stir well, add all the herbs, mix again, then take off the heat.Line a roughly 26cm-diameter baking tin with a large sheet of paper that comes all the way up the sides, so the egg mix won’t leak out later. Transfer the hot vegetables to the lined tin and pop into the hot oven for three minutes.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app. Scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.Meanwhile, whisk all the egg ingredients, then pour over the vegetables in the tin. Turn down the heat to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, then return the tin to the oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, until the eggs are completely set and golden.Take out of the oven, leave to cool, then cover and chill in the tin – the maa’kuda is best rested for a couple of hours before slicing and taking on your picnic.Explore more on these topicsSummer food and drinkPicnicsFoodVegetablesEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"
