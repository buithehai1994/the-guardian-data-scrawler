Think again, say the expertsPaisley GilmourFri 23 May 2025 10.00 EDTShareYou have to havechemistryorfeel a sparkFor Toby Ingham, psychotherapist and author ofHow to Improve Emotional Stability, referring to that sought-after spark as “chemistry” is an interesting analogy. “In dating, it tends to describe an immediate reaction, whereas lots of chemical reactions take time,” he says.Still, many of us chase a spark. “It’s overrated,” says Lohani Noor, a psychotherapist and founding director ofThe Institute for Relational and Sexual Therapies. “That intoxicating, heart-racing feeling of early chemistry? Sometimes it’s anxiety.”Research showsthe physiological symptoms of nervousness (sweaty palms, a racing heart) mirror those of attraction. “We can mistake intensity for intimacy and drama for depth. Other times, the spark is lust: a biological pull that fades as quickly as it flares.”Instead of seeking out the elusive spark, experts advise forgetting about chemistry and focusing on connections that grow slowly and last longer. Seek emotional safety (feeling at ease), shared values (wanting the same things in life), mutual effort (both showing up, even if it’s hard) and growing attraction (admiration that deepens over time). “These are the foundations of lasting love,” says Noor. “Not a fleeting feeling, but a choice to build something meaningful.”It’s bad to argue“People think that always agreeing is a sign of compatibility,” says Mandy Saligari, apsychotherapistand author ofProactive Parenting. “It comes from a fear of conflict, a belief that anger is bad, or feeling ashamed of their own needs.” Anger is just a feeling and shouldn’t be demonised, she says. It shows what matters to you.Andrew G Marshall, marital therapist, author ofI Love You But I’m Not in Love With Youand host ofThe Meaningful Lifepodcast, agrees. “It’s an incredibly intimate thing to argue with somebody. Otherwise, when you disagree, you have to swallow your feelings. Underneath the surface, there’s a whole load of grumpiness, sarcasm and passive aggression. You become flatmates, not lovers,” he says.Research shows that couples who never argue aresignificantly unhappierthan those who do. So stop avoiding conflict and get back in touch with your feelings. Accept that your partner is trying to tell you something and be curious about what that is. “Listen with an open mind. Try to have a healthy discussion that fosters deeper connection and personal insight,” Saligari says.When you discuss problems, don’t meet anger with anger. That will only lead to more arguing. “Treat your partner as if every word they’re saying is true,” adds Marshall. “Give them the dignity of listening and try to understand their position. Nobody has ever settled an argument by working out who’s right and wrong.”Relationships should be easyIf you believe relationships should be easy, when a challenge inevitably arises you’ll either think something’s wrong with the relationship or with you. “Once you accept that relationships are hard, you don’t feel that you’re a failure,” says Marshall.There is, however, a middle ground. “Relationships aren’t supposed to be a prison sentence either. They aren’t easy, but shouldn’t feel like breaking up rocks,” he adds.How do you know when a relationship has become too difficult? PsychotherapistNatasha Pagepoints to a few telltale signs. “If a relationship makes us feel unfulfilled, and impacts on our mental health and wellbeing, this can lead to low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. If you don’t feel you’re living in alignment with your values and who you want to be; if you’re living in fear or being abused – these are not OK.”Your partner should be your best friendand you should spend all your time togetherThe myth goes that if you truly love one another, you won’t need anyone else or ever want to be apart. But Naomi Magnus, a psychotherapist and founder ofNorth London Therapy Practice, says: “Healthy relationships thrive on a balance of togetherness and individuality. Everyone needs personal space to grow and recharge. Having time apart can strengthen your bond, allow you to see things differently, and bring new energy into the relationship instead of relying solely on each other for happiness.”If you only spend time as a pair and have no wider support network, one of you is likely to feel suffocated or resentful of the pressure to meet all your partner’s needs. “It can create an unhealthy dependency, which takes away from individual happiness and personal growth,” Magnus says. Embrace quality time together, but give equal value to time apart. Pursue your own interests and build bonds with friends, family, colleagues … anyone who isn’t your partner.Sleeping in separate beds meansthe relationship isdoomedView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jessica Griffiths/The Guardian. Thanks to Trilby Fox“We’ve been conditioned to see separate bedrooms as the ultimate red flag, a silent admission that love has flatlined,” Noor says. According to Lori Beth Bisbey, a psychologist andsex and intimacy coach, this is because people wrongly equate sleeping separately with a lack of physical or emotional intimacy. Noor calls this “the proximity fallacy”. “Sleep martyrdom culture” is also at play here: the idea that real couples endure nights of snoring and knee jabs as proof of their love.If you have different schedules or wake up grumpy every morning after a night of disturbed sleep, separate beds could be the answer. Noor and Bisbey agree that this doesn’t spell the end of your relationship.“The healthiest ‘sleep-divorced’ couples create intentional intimacy with morning cuddles or evening tea rituals,” says Noor. “They reframe their separate beds as care: ‘We love each other too much to be sleep-deprived monsters.’ They also invest in connections outside the bedroom by compensating with quality time during waking hours.Attitudes are slowly changing.A 2023 surveyby the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that 35% of American couples sleep in separate rooms either occasionally or consistently. Millennials are the most likely generation to do this (43%) and baby boomers the least (22%).Noor says: “As one couple (happily sleeping apart for 12 years) told me: ‘We stopped pretending sleep deprivation was romantic. Now we greet each other well rested – and actually like each other again.’”You can’t get over cheatingResearch spanning 160 cultureshas cited infidelity as the most common reason for breakups. “Many people assume that once trust is broken, the relationship must end. This suggests cheating is unforgivable, no matter the circumstances, and staying after betrayal means weakness or lack of self-respect. True love would never have space for such a betrayal,” Noor says.It’s no wonder this “rule” is so deeply ingrained. Moral and religious values often equate cheating with sin. Black-and-white thinking tells us: “Once a cheater, always a cheater.” And the self-respect narratives of modern dating advice frame leaving a relationship after being cheated on as the only empowered choice.It requires “deep introspective work, therapy, honest communication and accountability from both parties”, Noor says, for relationships to recover, but it is possible. Context also matters: “Was it a one-time mistake? It might be a symptom of deeper issues such as emotional neglect or addiction. Both parties often enable the cheating to happen.” Some people really can change. “While cheating is serious, it doesn’t always define a person for ever. And not all cheating is the same. Emotional affairs, long-term deception and one-night stands have different impacts,” she adds.Sometimes reconciling after cheating makes couples even stronger. Others realise the relationship is truly over. The key is choice, not obligation. Noor says: “Both outcomes are valid.”Breaking up or divorcing means the relationship was a failureSocietal expectations tell us that breaking up means you’ve failed to make a relationship work. There can be extra stigma attached if you’re married, says Page. This keeps many people in relationships for the wrong reasons, which often has detrimental effects. “Sometimes people grow apart, and some relationships aren’t healthy to remain in,” she warns.If you’ve grown apart or your relationship is making you consistentlymiserable, it’s OK to leave. “Humans evolve and change over time, and our relationships may not be able to sustain these changes. It’s OK to start again. You don’t have to remain to keep others happy,” Page says.Think of every relationship as a learning experience, says Magnus. “Those who are able to look back and value the time spent with a partner, even if the relationship didn’t last, are displaying growth and personal development. The lessons we learn can help us to see what we do and don’t want in a future partner.”You only have onesoulmate“The myth of the soul partner is that if you just find the right person, all conflict will melt away. It’s a way that we comfort ourselves: ‘We’re going to find the right person. We’re going to find the one,’” says Marshall.As nice as that belief may sound, it can make you so doubtful in your relationships that it stops you fully leaning in. “I can’t tell you how many couples I’ve seen where one person is frightened to commit because there’s an instinct that says: ‘Have I found the right person? There could be somebody more perfect out there,’” he says. This concern is often born out of fear, particularly if you’ve seen your parents mess up their relationship. When the fear takes over, people can leave perfectly healthy relationships in search of a better fit.In reality, there are hundreds of people who you’re potentially compatible with. If you believe your partner is the only person who’s right for you, says Marshall, “you’re going to become slightly hysterical because if you lose them, you’re doomed until the end of time. And we can never recover from that. It’s all a little bit tragic.”There’s no coming back fromthe ‘ick’That sudden feeling of repulsion you get after a partner does or says something you find deeply unattractive? That’s the infamous “ick”, which many people think they can’t recover from. “It comes from the belief that you can’t experience powerful negative feelings in relation to your partner,” Saligari says.Sure, your ick may be a visceral sign of something important to you that shouldn’t be ignored, but it usually signals something you’ve repressed in yourself rather than anything your partner’s done wrong.“It’s easier to project issues on to our partners than reflect on them as our own,” Saligari says. Some of the icks Noor commonly sees in therapy include farting, nail biting and not “getting” something straight away.“Icks are often behavioural, although they can also be based on one person making an assumption about the other. For example: ‘If I believe you don’t care about me, I will misconstrue your behaviour as “ickish”, and proof that you don’t care about me,’” she says.Relationships should be based on the acceptance of differences, healthy communication, respect and trust, not on one (potentially repressed) feeling. “Before your ick becomes an inflexible truth that you can’t get over, listen to it, talk about it and try to address it,” Saligari adds. “Don’t let a gut feeling dictate the success or failure of your relationship.”Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsLove & FriendshipMarriageSexFamilyDivorcefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But vanishingly few can see itFri 23 May 2025 12.56 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 13.52 EDTShareIsat this week with Hussein Agha, a man who has given his working life to seeking peace between Israelis and Palestinians, negotiating from the Palestinian side of the table. He was gloomier than I have ever seen him, adamant that peace between the two sides can never, ever come. Because, Agha explained, this conflict was not about mere lines on a map or forms of words, the goods in which diplomats trade. This was about emotions, and specifically hatreds. Hatreds that, he feared, are becoming too murderous to contain. “It’s biblical,” he said.What he had in mind was the fury that drove Hamas to slaughter around 1,200 Israelis on a sleepy Saturday morning nearly 20 months ago and the fury that has driven the government of Benjamin Netanyahu to bombard Gaza ever since,killing more than 50,000, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry, and, over the last 80 days,denying foodto those who remain. He fears that the hatreds that fuelled these events, and that are fuelled by them, will grow larger and more venomous until nothing and no one is left. The whole land shall be laid waste and made desolate.A biblical rage is one that devours all reason. It is blinding. It prevents those who are gripped by it from seeing anything other than their own side. It prevents them holding two apparently opposed thoughts in their minds, even when both are true. Take, as an example, two statements we can make about the events of this week.Israel’s use of hunger as a weapon of war, keeping humanitarian aid out of Gaza for some 11 weeks, is a morally indefensible act that has, rightly, outraged the world. The partial lifting of the blockade supplies the tiniest fraction of what is needed and represents, by Netanyahu’s own admission, the“minimal” amount he can get away withto keep US political support. That is a fact.View image in fullscreenPalestinians gather outside a charity kitchen in Gaza City to receive limited food rations, 18 May 2025.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAThe deadly assault on the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington DC on Wednesday night was a morally indefensible act that lefttwo young people dead. The pair were staffers at the Israeli embassy, but all the evidence suggests they were struck at random. Even if he was heard chanting “Free Palestine” or “I did it for Gaza”, the gunman’s target was a Jewish institution filled with Jews. That makes it an antisemitic act. That too is a fact.And yet, people struggle to hold both facts at once. They fear that by acknowledging one, they will somehow weaken the force of the other. Some seized on the killings in Washington to downplay the killings in Gaza; others did the reverse.In the first category were those who used the deaths of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim to argue that even to speak about the agony currently inflicted on Gaza by Israel is to incite terrorism. That was the move made by Netanyahu himself, a man never slow to exploit Jewish suffering for his own narrow political purposes. Earlier in the week, France, Canada and the UK had joined together todenounce Israel’s escalating offensivein Gaza and especially its policy of hunger, described in March by Israel’s defence minister as one of the country’s “main pressure levers” against Hamas. The shootings in DC gave Netanyahu an opening to hit back.“I say to President Macron, Prime Minister Carney and Prime Minister Starmer, when mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you’re on the wrong side of justice,”the Israeli PM said,before deploying a phrase once favoured by the left:“You’re on the wrong side of history.”View image in fullscreenMourners attend a vigil outside the White House to honour Israel embassy staff members Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, 22 May 2025.Photograph: Leigh Vogel/UPI/ShutterstockHis argument amounts to the claim, often made, that those who draw attention to the consequences of Israeli policy are guilty of “delegitimising” Israel. It does not occur to Netanyahu or his allies that what might undermine Israeli legitimacy in the eyes of a watching world is not the condemnation of Israel’s actions, or the reporting of them, but the actions themselves.Again, two statements, apparently in tension, can be true at the same time. Journalists whothis week demandedthat Israel and Egypt make Gaza accessible to international news organisations were right to do so: the facts need to be known. Those facts, once known, may well drive people into a state of rage – even murderous rage – which is why they have to be handled with scrupulous care.And so, the UN humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, has been right to be clear and full-throated in his demands for Israel tolet food and medicine into Gaza, but was wrong to suggest that 14,000 babies in Gaza would die within 48 hours – a statement thatlater had to be corrected, because that warning applied to what would happen if the state of siege was maintained not for another 48 hours, but for a full year. Grave enough, but not the same. Deep and lethal hatreds are at work here; people can be stirred to violence very easily. There is little room to be casual.I would say the same of Yair Golan, a former general and now leader of Israel’s opposition Democrats party. He deserves credit for demanding Israelis face up to and look hard at what so many prefer not to see. This week he warned, “Israel is on the way to becoming a pariah state, like South Africa was, if we don’t return to acting like a sane country,” adding that “a sane country does not fight against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not give itself the aim of expelling populations.” That reference to baby-killing, the use of the word “hobby”,immediately allowed his criticsto say he was reviving the antisemitic blood libel that cast Jews as the ritual slayers of Christian children.This whole terrain is perilous and has to be navigated with great care, whether from within the conflict or without – and, again, that means realising that two things can be true at once. Yes, it’s true that anti-Zionism is not always antisemitic. But that doesn’t mean it’sneverantisemitic. Gary Lineker thought he was posting an anti-Zionist video. He failed to see itcame attached to antisemitic imagery, in the form of a rat, a favourite Nazi shorthand for Jew.That episode was a reminder that, much as we might want these categories to be neat and hermetically sealed – “Zionism” over here and fair game for attack; “Jews” over there and protected by anti-racism – the boundary between them is blurred and porous. A man in Washington was angry with Israel and it was a Jewish museum that ended up under deadly fire.There are countless distinctions like that to be made; complex, apparently contradictory statements to be held in mind all at the same time. But it’s impossible to see them when blinded by a rage and loathing that will not be quelled, when blinded by mutual hatred of biblical proportions. Agha no longer likes to speak in terms of peace or resolving the conflict, but rather of more modest “arrangements” that might keep these furies in check. Either way, one way or the other, this needs to end.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Critics are near-unanimous in their praise, withVariety calling his performance “revelatory”, andIndieWire describing it as “magnetic”.Influential film industry publication Deadlinesaid that Dillane “arrived in Cannes a virtual unknown, but Harris Dickinson’s directorial debut has made him a star”.In Urchin, Dillane plays Mike, a man living on the streets who ends up in jail after committing an assault and then struggles to go straight after his release. Despite being given a place in a hostel and helped into employment, Mike is tempted to fall back into his old ways. With a script written by Dickinson, Dillane committed to the role by trying full-immersion method acting, saying: “I spent a lot of time in soup kitchens, a lot of time with people, friends, walking around … You’re carrying your stuff, your feet hurt, your back hurts. It’s the weather. You can never close a door. You can’t sit here, you can’t stand there, move it along. No one’s looking at you.”Calling Dillane, 34, an “unknown” is not entirely accurate. Millions will have seen him in the small but eye-catching role of teenage Tom Riddle in the 2009 picture Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. He also held down a significant role in the first four seasons of hit zombie TV series Fear the Walking Dead as heroin addict Nick Clark, and starred alongside Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes in the Apple TV+ series The Essex Serpent, adapted from the novel by Sarah Perry. The son of Game of Thrones star Stephen Dillane and Naomi Wirthner, best known as records keeper Molly Doran in Slow Horses, he – like Spider-Man’s Tom Holland, Nosferatu’s Lily-Rose Depp, andfellow Cannes breakout star Mia Threapleton– may count as a “nepo baby” but earned his corn by spending three years at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art between 2010 and 2013.View image in fullscreen‘Sweetness and softness’ … Urchin director Harris Dickinson (left) with Megan Northam and Frank Dillane at the Cannes film festival.Photograph: Lewis Joly/Invision/APBut his stock has undoubtedly shot up as a result of Urchin’s impact at Cannes, where it was selected for the Un Certain Regard sidebar. On Friday, the Un Certain Regard jury gave Dillane the best actor prize. Guy Lodge, the UK critic for Variety, says that “it feels like he’s finally taking a step into serious character actor territory”. As well as Urchin, Dillane has impressed critics in another film that has so far played only at film festivals: Harvest, directed by Athina Rachel Tsangari, which premiered at Venice in 2024. Lodge says: “It’s a completely different part in terms of register, period and relationship to the audience. It took me a while to connect both performances to the actor: he’s clearly versatile and vanity-free, which bodes well for the next phase of his career.”Part of Dillane’s appeal is his versatile, non-intrusive masculinity; alongside Paul Mescal and Josh O’Connor (who also made attention-grabbing appearances in Cannes films this year), he is part of a generation of what Mescal describes as “post-alpha male” film stars. Hannah Strong, digital editor of Little White Lies magazine, says Dillane, “projects a sweetness and softness that can just as quickly become all hard edges, the twinkle in his eyes evaporating entirely”.View image in fullscreenSophie Turner and Frank Dillane in Joan.Photograph: Susie Allnutt/ITVStrong adds: “Urchin rests on his shoulders, and it’s Dillane’s ability to turn on a dime from charming to troubling with total believability that brings Dickinson’s words to life.”Dillane has been acting since he was six years old, having first appeared on screen as an extra in Welcome to Sarajevo, the 1997 film based on ITN reporter Michael Nicholson’s time as a war correspondent during the Bosnian war, in which Dillane’s father was the lead actor. The pair were cast together 15 years later in the 2012 British independent comedy Papadopoulos & Sons; Stephen again played the lead, a British Greek businessman who loses his fortune, and Frank (inevitably perhaps) played his son. In between, Dillane secured his Harry Potter rolevia an open casting call that took place in 2007.Dillane Jr’s career, however, took off after he struck out on his own having appeared in Fear the Walking Dead and the Ron Howard-directed whaling epic In the Heart of the Sea in 2015. He then built his CV with roles in Caitlin Moran comedy How to Build a Girl, as surgeon Luke Garrett in The Essex Serpent, and as crooked antiques dealer Boisie Hannington in ITV miniseries Joan. Now Urchin has elevated Dillane to the front rank of young British male leads and he is a potential rival, ironically, to Dickinson himself.Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalStephen DillaneFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ve got the nails for that. Well, they’re considerably smaller than they used to be. I haven’t had one of these in my hands for a long time.”‘These murders still live with me’: the show that goes inside Fred and Rose West’s ‘house of horrors’Read moreThen he’s had enough. “Oh, let’s put that away. That might scare people.”Persuading Lewis to appear on camera was a coup for the makers of a new Netflix docuseries exploringa 1982 series of poisoningsthat resulted in the deaths of seven people in the Chicago area after they ingested Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide.Cold Case: The Tylenol Murderstells how Lewis, who sent a letter to Johnson & Johnson demanding $1m to stop the killings, came under suspicion but was only convicted of extortion. Despite extensive efforts, including a nationwide search and the involvement of the FBI, the perpetrator of the poisonings has never been identified or apprehended.The three-part docuseries by the Israeli directorsYotam GuendelmanandAri Pinesrecalls how the deaths caused widespread panic and had a profound impact on consumer product safety regulations and the pharmaceutical industry. It examines lingering questions surrounding the investigation, the role of Johnson & Johnson and the possibility of other suspects.In a virtual interview from Tel Aviv, Guendelman says: “What sparked our imagination about this story was when we realised the reason why we can’t open our medical bottles or water bottles is because of the safety seals that were invented basically because this story. This is how we got into this story just by accident.“When we realised it still is an open case, and has such a twisty, turny narrative to go by, we were hooked and we were actually shocked nobody ever told this definitive story about what was the biggest true crime story in America in the 80s.”Featuring interviews with people involved in the original investigation, victims’ families and Lewis himself, Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders sets out how the most popular pain reliever became a source of dread. The nightmare began when 12-year-oldMary Kellerman, from Elk Grove Village, Illinois, felt sick one morning, took a Tylenol capsule, dropped to her bathroom floor and died soon after.On the same day, less than 10 miles away, Adam Janus, a 27-year-old postal worker, took two Tylenol capsules and died in hospital. That afternoon, Janus’s brother Stanley Janus and Stanley’s wife, Theresa, took Tylenol capsules from the same bottle. Both collapsed on the floor and died.Three more people in the Chicago suburbs died after taking Tylenol in the days that followed. They were 31-year-old Mary McFarland, 35-year-old Paula Prince and 27-year-old Mary “Lynn” Reiner, who had just given birth to her fourth child.It is thought that more people, especially elderly people, probably died from the capsules without anyone knowing the cause.Cyanide poisoningis difficult to detect without a specific test.Indeed, at first the deaths were not seen as related, with paramedics often attributing them to natural causes such as heart attacks. But the connection was made when Helen Jensen, a nurse, visited the Janus home and noticed that six capsules were missing from the same Tylenol bottle.The realisation prompted police cars to slowly patrolthe Chicago suburbswhile warning over loudspeakers: “Do not take Tylenol until further notice.” It also caused widespread panic across the nation, with millions of people terrified that their medication might be contaminated.Guendelman says:“It created this mass hysteria. Halloween that year was sort of cancelled because America was so shocked, so afraid that eating, drinking or taking any pill from your cabinet might kill you because it might just poison you – the most mundane products you can imagine.”The investigation became the FBI’s biggest up to that point, involving multiple law enforcement agencies. Pines says: “It was a new form of mass murder that the world has never seen before and the FBI also regarded it as the first domestic terror attack in the US, because it was a motiveless crime, so very terrorist-like.”At first investigators considered the possibility of the tampering occurring within the manufacturing plants, but tainted bottles were found from different lot numbers produced at different facilities.It therefore seemed most likely that the tampering occurred after the product left the factory, probably by someone who bought or shoplifted bottles, added cyanide to them, and returned them to store shelves. The capsules’ design made them easy to open and reseal.Lewis came to the attention of investigators after sending an extortion letter to Johnson & Johnson asking for $1m to halt the killings. Investigators traced the letter back to “Robert Richardson”, who was later identified as Lewis, a fugitive with a history of criminal activity.When Lewis was arrested in New York in 1982 after a nationwide manhunt, he gave investigators a detailed account of how the killer might have operated. He had a troubled past, including being charged with the dismemberment murder of a former client in 1978 – the charges were dismissed – and a conviction for mail fraud in a credit card scheme in 1981.Police described Lewis as a “chameleon” who lived in several states, used at least 20 aliases and held many jobs, including computer specialist, tax accountant, importer of Indian tapestries and salesman of jewellery, pharmaceutical machinery and real estate. One former investigator says in the film: “I believe that he is the one responsible for the Tylenol murders.”But the FBI was never able to definitively place Lewis in Chicago at the time of the poisonings; he claimed to be in New York with his wife. He consistently denied committing the murders, claiming the extortion letter was intended to frame someone he despised. He was convicted only of extortion related to the Tylenol case and served 12 years of a 20-year sentence.Lewis was charged in 2004 with rape, kidnapping and other offences for an alleged attack on a woman in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was jailed for three years while awaiting trial but prosecutors dismissed the charges on the day his trial was scheduled to begin after the victim refused to testify.View image in fullscreenJames Lewis.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixLewisdied in 2023at the age of 76. But by then had done an interview for the documentary after producer Molly Forster spent a year winning his trust. Guendelman explains: “Hundreds of journalists over the years tried to basically get him in front of a camera or just for a written interview and he never agreed.“What made it different this time was the fact that Molly gave him an opportunity to not just be James Lewis, the Tylenol man, the scary spooky boogeyman, but she also referred to him as a human being and told him that he has a story to tell and he wanted to tell his story.”He adds: “We didn’t give him an easy time. We asked him all the hard questions and he was aware of it. But we had his trust and he knew that we were gonna tell his story in any case from a holistic standpoint.”The idea of buying a bottle of Tylenol and presenting Lewis with it only occurred to the directors a day before the interview. Tentative at first, Lewis used his long nails to open the safety seal, took out some caplets and used a knife to see if it would still be possible to introduce a chemical agent (it isn’t).Pines says: “It was a very amusing scene, I guess, or maybe slightly disturbing; it depends how you view it. But it goes to show you this guy’s character and how mischievous he is. He likes to walk this fine line where he enjoyed the notoriety of this case without having to take the blame for it.”Guendelman chimes in: “When we gave him this, he said everybody who tries to open these bottles swears his name. It’s this kind of playful remark which is as close as it can get to a confession by him, that he might have done it.”He reflects: “When you have these interviews with your main characters when you do a series or a film, you try to bring something unexpected to get a different reaction from them, which will not be just your normal question and answer. We always try to figure out something different.”Did Lewis do it? Guendelman comments: “He’s a weird character and he’s surprising. I don’t want to say too many good things about him because of the horrific things that he’s been suspected of with very substantial evidence against him, but at the same time he is charming at times and sweet and funny.“When you sit with him for a couple of days, it is weird because most of the time you feel like no way this guy can do this. But then every once in a while you see something shift for a few seconds and you realise, oh yeah, he can.”Johnson & Johnson’shandling of the crisis is often cited as a model for corporate crisis management. The company initiated a massive nationwide recall of Tylenol products, the biggest in history at that time, and was praised for its cooperation with law enforcement.Guendelman reflects: “When you go to business school nowadays, probably the biggest case study about crisis management will be how Johnson & Johnson reacted to this case. They were the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world.“Tylenol was the bestselling drug in the world and everybody thought as soon as this happened, their brand is gone, maybe even the whole company is gone. But two months later they came back stronger than ever and actually sold even more Tylenol, which is insane. So one thing is for sure: they reacted very well in terms of a commercial point of view.”Pines adds: “When we started working on this doc, most people that we talked to, including most family members, were convinced that Jim Lewis is the culprit because that’s the story that’s been told over and over again from ’82 until now.”But there were other theories that suggest Johnson & Johnson may have been at fault in some way. “There are things we show in the series that make you raise your eyebrow or feel unsettled, like the fact that they initially denied having any cyanide in any of the plants where the Tylenol was manufactured, and that turned out to be false – there was cyanide a few hundred feet from the manufacturing chain at those specific plants for [quality control].”View image in fullscreenVictims of the Tylenol killer.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixConcerns are also raised about Johnson & Johnson’s involvement in testing the recalled bottles and the subsequent destruction of millions of capsules, potentially hindering the investigation and the ability to find further evidence. “A lot of people think that maybe that’s something that shouldn’t have been done because they were in a conflict of interests,” Pines says.“I do think that, especially following the opioid crisis in the US, it’s very important to look at Johnson & Johnson’s behaviour in this case, especially when you realise what was at stake for them back then and today.”Four years after the Chicago poisonings, another woman died in Yonkers from cyanide-laced Tylenol. Two other sealed bottles containing cyanide were found in a nearby pharmacy. This occurred after the introduction of safety seals, suggesting the tampering must have happened before the bottles left the factory, raising further questions about the possibility of inside involvement or a different perpetrator.The Tylenol murders led to significant changes in how over-the-counter medications are packaged and regulated. In 1983, Congress passed the “Tylenol Bill”, making it a federal crime to tamper with consumer products.Johnson & Johnson, in collaboration with theFood and Drug Administration, introduced new tamper-proof packaging, including foil seals and other features designed to make tampering obvious. These tamper-evident packaging requirements soon became the industry standard for all over-the-counter medications. Johnson & Johnson also introduced a new form of the medication, the “caplet”, which was harder to tamper with than the older capsules.Some victims’ families believe the focus on Lewis may have prevented a thorough investigation of other potential culprits. FBI interviews with Johnson & Johnson executives remain under seal to this day.Guendelman says: “We hope by doing this documentary the FBI will look at other possible directions that they never looked at. Every case can be solved, even especially a case which is so big, sparks such a huge investigation, has millions of pieces of evidence connected to it. I’m sure nowadays with technology and with a fresh look, there is a chance to solve it.”Pines also hopes the documentary will encourage viewers to be more sceptical of the long-established narrative. “It’s a very different true crime series because whenever we watch a murder case in a series it’s usually very gory: there’s usually a murder weapon, a knife or a gun, a direct contact between the murderer and the victim.“This crime has no motive, no contact: the murder weapon is basically the most everyday thing that you can think of, an innocent thing, and this is what actually makes it so terrifying, much more than the bloodiest murder – this uncanny feeling that something that is supposed to make you feel better becomes an instrument of death.”Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders is available onNetflixon 26 MayExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryNetflixFactual TVUS crimeJohnson & JohnsonTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He talks about how he’s ended up sparkling as the BBC’s new Sunday night crime-solver – and why he just wants to be brilliantFri 23 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 09.53 EDTShareSome like it hot, andTimothy Spallis among them. “Can I have an extra-large skinny cappuccino, absolutely boiling?” he asks the server from his seat at a pavement cafe. “The largest and hottest you’ve got.Illegallyhot.”Once we are alone again, Spall returns to what he was in the middle of discussing: 18th-century coffee-houses. “What they served didn’t taste like coffee. It was repulsive. I looked it up.” His curiosity is innate and all-consuming. When he was 16 and starring in a school production of My Fair Lady, he took it upon himself to visit the tenements on Tottenham Court Road in London where his character would have lived. At an even younger age, he secretly imitated the stooped walk of a stranger he spotted in the street. Not to be cruel. “I just wanted to know what it was to walk like that. How it felt inside. I still find myself doing it now. I’ll see somebody moving a certain way and I’ll try and copy that to feel where it comes from. I suppose that’s why I do what I do.”As he talks in his fascinated way, the low-speed London traffic trundles past and the morning sun blazes through the canopy of trees above us. It all feels rather like being on holiday, and Spall is dressed for the part: untucked white shirt, cobalt blue jacket, loose striped linen trousers. “I’m partial to a stripe,” he says, admiring a leg and turning a Chelsea-booted foot this way and that. “I bought these in a shopping centre on the Strait of Messina. I just hope it doesn’t look like I shat myself then knocked on someone’s door to borrow their pyjamas.”View image in fullscreenSpall as Peter Farquhar in The Sixth Commandment.Photograph: Amanda Searle/BBC/Wild MercuryAt 68, the Battersea-born actor has played sad-sack taxi drivers and world-class painters. He has been a Death Eater in theHarry Potterfilms, Britain’s last hangman,Ian PaisleyandWinston Churchill(twice in fact, as well as publicly reading Churchill’s VE Day radio addressearlier this month), as well asSanta Clausand even Margaret Rutherford. Some of his most exceptional work was seen recently on television: as a bewildered Duke of Norfolk inWolf Hall, and the university lecturer Peter Farquhar, tormented and murdered by the young man with whom he believed he had found love, inThe Sixth Commandment. That performance, which won Spall a Bafta and an International Emmy, amounts to a moving reclamation of a man who could have been seen as a victim but was instead rendered noble and even inspiring because of his ingenuous faith in love – and the actor’s skill in embodying that quality.What could be left for Spall to play? One answer is: a lovable old ham who fancies that his former role as a TV detective has imbued him with the skills to solve crimes. What’s more, he turns out to be not entirely deluded. This is the BBC’s new “cosy crime” series Death Valley, its title flagging both the show’s carousel of murders and its Vale of Glamorgan setting.Spall is John Chapel, an actor dimly remembered for playing theMaigret-likeTV sleuth Caesar, who came complete with his own cheesier-than-Caerphilly catchphrase: “Crime waits for no man.” Chapel’s glory days are behind him. But when DS Janie Mallowan (Gwyneth Keyworth) – who is also a Caesar fangirl – knocks on his door during a routine appeal for witnesses to a murder, he brings his thespian training (“Character is action!”) to the investigation and helps Janie find the guilty party. It turns out that years of fathoming the behaviour of fictional characters has left him with some practical crime-fighting skills. The opening episode even gives Chapel a Poirot-esque revelation scene in which he reveals whodunnit and why to the gobsmacked suspects – in between posing for selfies.That success, and his rapport with Mallowan, leads him to be a regular source of counsel on her subsequent cases. The generation-gap dynamic isn’t unprecedented:Only Murders in the Buildingfeatures a young woman sleuthing withtwoluvvies, one of whom also made his name as a fictional TV detective. But Death Valley has a wryly parochial strain of humour. (Accused of being a hermit, Chapel protests: “I’m not a hermit. I went to Swansea last month!”) The show also gets a lot of mileage out of fusing buddy-comedy conventions with a weekly whodunnit and an affectionate ribbing of its thespian hero, who in one episode turns up as Claudius in an am-dram Hamlet.As a seasoned pro himself, Spall helped develop the character. “I lampooned some aspects of acting and brought in some of the pretensions, the whole arse-ache embarrassment quality, but also the sincerity.” Bad behaviour among actors isn’t as common as people assume, he says. “The show is playing, coquettishly I suppose, with people’s preconceptions. But I’ve seen remarkably few displays of egotism in real life. We all just want to be brilliant, we’re all shitting ourselves and none of us want to look like twats. You want to give good value for money.”This is an idea to which he often returns. “As I’ve got older, I’ve realised that you’ve got to do it for the audience. It’s our duty to give value for money. Stories can just be entertainment but they can alsomeansomething.”Death Valley falls into this category. “It’s lovely, isn’t it?” he says in between sips of his cappuccino. “Me, I always want the darkness. I try to turn everything into a Lithuanian art movie. And it’s not that, is it?” Not by a long chalk. The epitome of sparkling Sunday evening entertainment, Death Valley has even been bumped to BBC One from its intended home on BBC Two. “I had a feeling that might happen when we dropped the fruity language,” he confides.View image in fullscreenScene of the crime … Gwyneth Keyworth and Spall in Death Valley.Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC StudiosOf course, Spall has been in plenty of art movies, if not Lithuanian ones. Among his earlier film roles was an overgrown mummy’s boy inBernardo Bertolucci’s majestic and desolate The Sheltering Sky. “Fourteen-hour trips across the Atlas Mountains,” he marvels. “Debra Winger, John Malkovich. My first scene was in a souk. Character names on the backs of the canvas chairs. I remember going: ‘Fucking hell, I’m in the movies!’ Then doing a scene with Debra and being so nervous and Bernardo saying afterwards: ‘Bellissimo.’ I’m thinking: ‘This is all right. I’ll remember this.’” He snorts at his younger self. “You’re the first person I’ve told.”That African adventure came six or seven years after Spall had experienced overnight fame in his mid-20s as the droning Black Country electrician Barry in the ITV seriesAuf Wiedersehen, Pet. That was a hit in 1983, the year his actor son Rafe (the middle child of three) was born. Although Spall has never had a Caesar-style albatross of a role – he once turned down a TV detective series that felt too close to Robbie Coltrane’s Cracker – it is Barry, if anyone, who follows him around. “It disappeared for a while but then it was constantly on Dave or Bob or Colin.

In Leigh’s TV play Home Sweet Home, Spall played a postal worker (coincidentally his father’s occupation). He was soon one of the film-maker’s most cherished collaborators, and won the best actor prize at the Cannes film festival for his visceral performance as JMW Turner, painting and grunting and rutting away, inMr Turner. (Spall later became a painter himself.)He was in his tuxedo on the red carpet for the Cannes premiere, flashbulbs popping away, crowds cheering. “I’m thinking: ‘Cannes, eh? This is the life.’” Then a lone, loud voice called out in an exaggerated Black Country accent: “All right, Barry?” Laughing now, Spall shakes his head. “I was straight back down to earth. You just go: ‘Fair enough.’”View image in fullscreenSpall as JMW Turner in Mr Turner.Photograph: FILM4/AllstarIt is Leigh’sSecrets & Lies, in which he played a patient but put-upon high-street photographer, that has an enduring place in his heart. While the film was scooping the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1996, Spall was in hospital with acute myeloid leukaemia. The movie became both a showcase for him and a placeholder while he was out of action. “I was in bed, hooked up to this electric soup, all these brilliant people trying to save my life, and wondering whether I was going to make it or not. As that was happening, Secrets & Lies was out there. And when I had the audacity not to peg it, I came back and found I had a film career!”Not half. He enjoyed a Hollywood spell, working alongside Amy Adams (Enchanted), Tom Cruise (Vanilla Sky,The Last Samurai) and Johnny Depp (Sweeney Todd). One of his proudest recent experiences was playing the Queen’s equerry, opposite Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana, in the pleasingly bananas biopicSpencer.Perhaps it is Spencer from which a passing stranger, somewhat the worse for wear, recognises him this morning. He stops at our table, waggles a thumbs-up in Spall’s face, and bellows: “Famous!” The actor knows how to handle this. “’Allo mate,” he replies affably, then watches the interloper stagger off into the distance. Once he is out of earshot, Spall mutters: “Cor, he’s lived a life.” The words are tinged with wonder and concern. You can sense him logging the details for later. He’ll be doing that stagger on his walk home for sure.Death Valley begins Sunday, 8.15pm, BBC One.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTimothy SpallDramainterviewsShareReuse this content"

They said the policy was being considered as part of the strategy but that no final decision had been made.“The government is determined to bring down child poverty. We’re not waiting to act,” the source added, pointing to measures already announced by the government, including the expansion offree breakfast clubs, a cap on school uniform items and increasing the national minimum wage.Experts say that scrapping the benefit limit would be the single most effective way of reducing child poverty. They say about 100 children are pulled into poverty every day by the limit, meaning up to 20,000 could be affected by a six-month delay. In addition, the benefit cap pushes 30,000 children into deep poverty when parents’ capacity to work is limited.Kendall and Phillipson are both understood to be in favour of scrapping the two-child limit. In March the Department for Work and Pensions’ own analysis of planned welfare cuts found that 50,000 children would be pushed into relative poverty by the end of the decade as a result.The former prime minister Gordon Brown urged Starmer this week to get rid of the “cruel” policy, arguing that it would be the most effective way of tackling child poverty, which was a “stain on the soul” of the country. Sources have suggested the policy could be tweaked rather than dropped entirely.There are concerns inside government that any further delay in acting on the limit beyond the autumn budget would mean the impact of scrapping it would not be felt before the next election, further reducing the political arguments for making the change.Sources suggested the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, did not want to commit to the estimated £2.5bn cost of scrapping the limit before knowing the total bill for other social security measures, which will be linked to September’s inflation figures and come into effect next April.Ministers are planning to announce a package of up to £750m to tackle child poverty at the spending review in June, the Guardian understands, although the final figure is yet to be agreed. It is expected to focus on measures to tackle the root causes of poverty, such as work, affordable housing and education. However, sources suggested this could include “rebadging” existing commitments “but putting child poverty in the press release”.Reeves hinted in aninterview with the Guardianlast week that the government was planning policies to tackle child poverty. “I want to lift people out of poverty, particularly I want to lift children out of poverty, and of course, we’ll set out more plans to do that,” she said.Thecuts to disability benefitsannounced in the spring statement have caused consternation among Labour MPs, dozens of whom are preparing to rebel against the policy in the vote expected next month. Backbenchers say more than 100 MPs have signed a private letter telling Labour whips they are unable to support the cuts.Seven Labour MPs were suspended from the whip for voting against the government on the two-child benefit cap in the king’s speech in July.Alison Garnham, the chief executive of the ChildPovertyAction Group, said: “There are 4.5 million children already in poverty and another 109 are pulled into poverty every day by the two-child limit alone. If this government is serious in its commitment to the nation’s children, it can’t keep waiting for the stars to align before taking action. It must urgently invest in children and their families, starting with scrapping the two-child limit.”Clare Moriarty, the chief executive at Citizens Advice, said: “It is deeply concerning that the government is watering down its commitment to publish a full and comprehensive child poverty strategy this spring. The need to tackle child poverty is urgent and the prime minister and chancellor should not let a point of process excuse them from taking decisions now.“Every day the two-child limit and benefit cap is in place, more children and families get sucked into poverty. Furthermore, these policies will act as a brake to any other action taken by this government to reduce child poverty.”Dan Paskins, from Save theChildrenUK, said: “Every month that goes by while Keir Starmer does not scrap the cruel two-child limit means thousands of children are plunged into poverty. We would like to see assurance from No 10 that this delay means their child poverty strategy contains bold ideas backed with the finance – starting with scrapping the two-child limit and benefit cap.”Helen Barnard, the director of policy at the Trussell Trust, said on social media: “Better a delayed child poverty strategy with measures to really protect children from hunger and hardship than one hitting the deadline but falling short on substance.”Explore more on these topicsPovertyChildrenWelfareSocial exclusionBenefitsKeir StarmerRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

You see many international institutions are complicit in spreading this lie,” he said.“The press repeats it. The mob believed it. And a young couple is then brutally gunned down in Washington.”UN officials had to retract Fletcher’s claim of deaths within 48 hours by saying he was referring to a UN technical report on food insecurity classification that said 14,100 severe cases of acute malnutrition could occur among children aged six to 59 months between April 2025 and March 2026. The report’s timeframe is one year and not two days, as mentioned by Fletcher.InFrance, the foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, described Netanyahu’s allegations of antisemitism as defamatory. “Accusing of encouraging antisemitism or [supporting] Hamas whoever defends the two-state solution is absurd and slanderous,” Barrot said in a statement posted on X.Barrot has also said that France supports Hamas being “disarmed and permanently excluded from the political future of Gaza”.Britain’s armed forces minister, Luke Pollard, said: “I condemn fully the murders of the Israeli diplomats in the United States, as has the prime minister very publicly.“But we’re also absolutely clear that the best way to bring peace to the Middle East is with an immediate ceasefire being restored in Gaza with Hamas releasing the hostages without any further delay, and with massive amounts of aid getting to the Palestinian people in Gaza – food, water and medical supplies being delivered – without delay.”Germany, the country most loyal to Israel for historical reasons, said the amount of aid entering Gaza was “too little too late”. Germany voted against the EU’s plan to review its trade agreement with Israel to see if it is compliant with the EU’s human rights obligations.Ministers in Arab states recognise Netanyahu is trying to shore up his political position by mounting attacks on the west, but warned he was causing irreparable damage to Israel’s global reputation and pursuing a dysfunctional war with no clear objectives.They said the US by contrast had embarrassed Netanyahu by showing direct diplomacy could produce the release of hostages.Israel says the block on aid is designed to isolate Hamas and permanently end its rule in Gaza. It says Hamas will not make concessions on its demand that Israel accept a permanent ceasefire.The United Arab Emirates, the Arab country with the closest relations with Israel, was in direct negotiation with Israel trying to ensure that 100 trucks cross the border into Gaza with aid to be distributed by UN agencies such as the World Food Programme. In what is seen as a test of Netanyahu’s bona fides, the UAE wants the trucks to be allowed to cross the border on Saturday even though this is the Jewish Sabbath.The UAE believes it is acting with the effective support of Donald Trump, who told leaders in the Gulf on his visit there that more aid must be allowed in for starving Palestinians. The UAE does not think the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the aid distribution mechanism being promoted by Israel as an alternative to the UN, will be ready to distribute aid for at least a month by which time many will have starved. A total of 119 aid trucks have entered Gaza since international pressure built on Netanyahu to allow aid into the territory.1:15Inside an Unrwa warehouse full of aid blocked from Gaza – videoAntonio Guterres, the UN secretary general, said on Friday that “Palestinians in Gaza are enduring what may be the cruelest phase of this cruel conflict”.He said only a “teaspoon of aid” had entered Gaza “when a flood of assistance is required”, adding that 16,000 pallets of aid, enough to fill 9,000 trucks, were ready to enter the strip and accused Israel of imposing unnecessary obstacles to the distribution of aid. He said four-fifths of the territory had been made a no-go zone for the people of Gaza by being declared a military zone by the Israel Defense Forces.An umbrella network of Palestinian aid groups said that so far only 119 aid trucks had entered Gaza since Israel eased its blockade on Monday. But distribution has been hampered by looting by groups of men, some of them armed, near the city of Khan Younis, the network said.“They stole food meant for children and families suffering from severe hunger,” the network said in a statement, which also condemned Israeli airstrikes on security teams protecting the trucks.A Hamas official said six members of a security team tasked with guarding the shipments were killed. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.The aid groups network said the amount of aid coming into Gaza was still inadequate and only included a narrow range of supplies. It said Israel’s agreement to allow trucks to enter the war-shattered territory was a “deceptive manoeuvre” to avoid international pressure calling for the lifting of the blockade.Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warIsraelAntisemitismGazaAidFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

But they clashed over other elements of the relationship, including Ukraine’s future Nato membership and the controversy over the import of cheaper agricultural goods,which has led to anti-Ukrainian protests by Polish farmers.Courting the rightwing voters of twofar-right candidates who came thirdand fourth, Nawrocki already said this week thathe would block Ukraine’s accession to Nato.On Friday, he repeated his criticism of the farming arrangements. “As a president, I will do everything to really support [Ukraine] militarily,” he said, but added he would not let Poland become a secondary market for Ukrainian goods.Trzaskowski, a former EU lawmaker and junior minister, attacked him for “speaking the language that favours Putin”, also citing his rival’s criticism of EU plans to boost member states’ militaries. “We need to be tough with Ukrainians, protect Polish interests … but help Ukraine, because Putin has to break all his teeth in Ukraine and not attack anyone else,” Trzaskowski said.Just over a week before the vote, the candidates remained virtually level, with individual polls showing narrow leads both ways within the margin of error.Experts said voter mobilisation – with turnout already at a record high in the first round – could play a decisive role in deciding the outcome.On Sunday, both candidates will lead rival marches across Warsaw, symbolically starting simultaneously on parallel streets but going in opposite directions.Explore more on these topicsPolandEuropeEuropean UnionDonald TusknewsShareReuse this content"

The latest case, involving dozens of children born between 2008 and 2015, raises fresh concerns about the complexity of tracing so many families when a serious medical issue is identified.“We need to have a European limit on the number of births or families for a single donor,” said Dr Edwige Kasper, a biologist at Rouen university hospital in France, who presented the case at the annual conference of the European Society of Human Genetics in Milan.“We can’t do whole-genome sequencing for all sperm donors – I’m not arguing for that,” she added. “But this is the abnormal dissemination of genetic disease. Not every man has 75 children across Europe.”The case came to light when two families independently contacted their fertility clinics after their children developed cancers that appeared to be linked to a rare genetic variant. The European Sperm Bank, which had supplied the sperm, confirmed that the variant in a gene called TP53 was present in some of the donor’s sperm.The rare variant was not known to be linked to cancer at the time of donation in 2008, would not have been detectable using standard screening techniques, and the donor is understood to be in good health. However, analysis by Kasper’s lab concluded that the mutation was likely to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, one of the most severe inherited predispositions to cancer.Kasper said: “I analysed the variant using population and patient databases, computer prediction tools and the results of functional trials and came to the conclusion that the variant was probably cancer-causing and that children born from this donor should receive genetic counselling.”Simultaneously, a number of genetics and paediatric departments across Europe were investigating their own cases, leading to 67 children from 46 families in eight European countries being tested. The variant was found in 23 children, 10 of whom have been diagnosed with cancer, including cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Children with the risk gene are advised to be monitored with regular whole-body MRI scans, MRI scans of the brain and, as adults, of the breast and ultrasound examination of the abdomen.The European Sperm Bank, which applies a worldwide limit of 75 families for each sperm donor, said more than 67 children had been conceived using the donor’s sperm, but that its policy was to not confirm exact numbers of children for a specific donor. It said all of the relevant clinics had been alerted.Kasper said this remained a concern. “Is 67 the total? It’s a really good question that I’ve asked the sperm bank. They didn’t want to tell me the denominator of the births for this donor,” she said.Prof Nicky Hudson, of De Montfort University in Leicester, said the case highlighted the complexity of the challenges that could arise when human gametes were shipped between countries and used for large numbers of recipients.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the very least we need better systems for tracking donor usage and of informing recipients of this.”Julie Paulli Budtz, a spokesperson for the European Sperm Bank, said: “We are deeply affected by this case.” She said the donor had been thoroughly tested but that “it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person’s gene pool if you don’t know what you are looking for”.She added: “We welcome continued dialogue on setting an internationally mandated family limit and have advocated for this on several occasions. This is also why we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor.”Explore more on these topicsSperm donationIVFCancerHealthEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We need to do better, which is why we are pioneering a new model of care where patients get the right support in the right setting.“As well as relieving pressure on our busy A&Es, mental health crisis assessment centres can speed up access to appropriate care, offering people the help they need much sooner, so they can stay out of hospital.”Last week,the Guardian reportedthat thousands of people with a mental health crisis are enduring waits of up to three days in A&E before they get a bed.The findings were included in research by the Royal College of Nursing.Based on freedom of information requests to NHS trusts in England and evidence from senior nurses, the research found that at least 5,260 people a year in a mental health crisis wait more than 12 hours for a bed after a decision has been made to admit them – up from barely 1,000 in 2019.A senior nurse in the south-west of England said: “Lots of people will just come and wait and be patient. But as you can imagine, some of them are in severe crisis. They want to leave. They want to self-harm. They are massively distressed and struggling.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Laure bought the house; it is her asset.“The main reason my name does not appear is for security reasons. I would have thought that obvious. As for her other UK or French assets, that is purely a private matter.”Nigel Farage missed debate on Brexit reset because he is holidaying abroadRead moreStamp duty is paid at rates up to 5% for residential property but an additional 5% is added if the purchase relates to another property on top of ones already owned.Farage already has a property worth about £1m in the village of Downe in Kent, as well as two houses in Lydd-on Sea in the same county, which are owned through his company, Thorn in the Side. He also has property in Tandridge in Surrey.The Reform leader has faced criticism about the amount of time he has spent overseas, mostly in the US, since he was elected MP for Clacton last July. He has made at least nine trips abroad in under a year and this week has been on holiday in France, despite parliament still sitting.This week, he confirmed he was on holiday, saying he was taking his first overseas break for three years apart from his stint in theI’m a Celebrityjungle – but that he was still writing articles and taking calls about fundraising for Reform UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The circumstances of my birth may seem, by most people’s standards, unusual and even outrageous.“That should come as no surprise. It never detracted from his commitment to love and look after me. He cherished me like a treasured possession.”Her existence is understood to be known only to Mercury’s inner circle.The singer started writing the diaries on 20 June 1976 when he first learned about the pregnancy, two days after Queen released their single You’re My Best Friend from their 1975 album A Night at the Opera.He chronicled his childhood in Zanzibar where he was born Farrokh Bulsara, to Parsi-Indian parents, on 5 September 1946, and attending a British-style boarding school in India.It also details how the family was forced to flee Zanzibar in the 1964 revolution before settling in Middlesex, north-west London.He wrote his final entry in his notebook on 31 July, 1991, as his health deteriorated. The singerdied aged 45of bronchial pneumonia caused by Aids.In another letter included in the book, B explains her reasons for sharing Mercury’s journals after 30 years.“After more than three decades of lies, speculation and distortion, it is time to let Freddie speak.“Those who have been aware of my existence kept his greatest secret out of loyalty to Freddie.“That I choose to reveal myself in my own midlife is my decision and mine alone. I have not, at any point, been coerced into doing this.“He entrusted his collection of private notebooks to me, his only child and his next of kin, the written record of his private thoughts, memories and feelings about everything he had experienced.”Jones said she was first approached by B three years ago. She told the Daily Mail: “My instinct was to doubt everything, but I am absolutely sure she is not a fantasist.“No one could have faked all this. Why would she have worked with me for three and a half years, never demanding anything?”Explore more on these topicsFreddie MercuryBiography booksnewsShareReuse this content"

Mars obsessives are flocking there – but some long-term locals are far from happyOliver LaughlandFri 23 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 05.51 EDTShareAlong a flat coastal highway in south-east Texas, surrounded by wetlands and open plains, the artefacts of a new American oligarchy appear in quick succession. Three towering rockets stand upright on the horizon. A fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks speeds by. A large mural of the Shiba Inu “doge” dog stares ahead, its arms crossed. There is a 4-metre-tall (12ft) bust of the world’s richest person, painted in bronze, facing a dusty roadside. “ELON aka MemeLord”, a plaque beneath reads. It’s not exactly romantic poetry, but the whole scene reminds me ofthe sonnet by Shelley: “Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!”While old Ozymandias may have seen his fiefdoms crumble, Elon Musk’s empire is possibly only just beginning. Here in Cameron County, on the southern tip of the Lone Star state, where Google Maps proudly displays the newly declared “Gulf of America” just offshore, Musk has situated his self-described mission to save humanity and populate Mars. Just a few miles from his painted bust is the Starbase industrial complex, a rocket-manufacturing facility and launch arena, which commands the vista for miles. It is also the site of the multibillionaire’s latest venture to acquire even more political power.Fresh from an extended stay in Washington as the de facto leader of the government-slashing,conflict-of-interest-riddled, so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), Muskhas returnedin time to see Starbase become its own city. We are here shortly before the vote, where there is little doubt that the 280 eligible voters (the vast majority of whom are employed by or connected to Musk’s space exploration company SpaceX) will approve the incorporation of a new, 4 sq km (1.6 sq mile) municipality.12:48How Elon Musk ‘colonised’ a corner of Texas to build his own space city - videoThere remain many questions about why the company, which did not respond to any of my written questions and interview requests, would move for such recognition. It brings limited local powers, including the ability to impose minor property taxes and grant building permits, as well as the mandate to create its own fire department and – to some alarm – police department. And yet, as the US lurches further into what many describe as an era of norm-shattering digital dystopia under the second presidency of Donald Trump, the goings-on here, in this remote enclave by the US-Mexico border, already bring a sense of grisly prescience.As we pull off the highway into the Starbase neighbourhood (Boca Chica village, before the vote), we are trailed almost instantly by two white security trucks with flashing yellow lights. We drive along the main residential drag, where dozens of shiny, silver Airstream trailers – housing forSpaceXstaff – sit in neat symmetry. We pass the newly renamed “Memes Street” (formerly it was Weems Street), marked with a black street sign accompanied by a small image of Musk’s pioneering Starship rocket.View image in fullscreenLocals on the beach before Starship’s third flight test last year.Photograph: Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesOn the adjacent LBJ Boulevard, lined with modest homes and customised Cybertrucks parked outside, we pass what isreportedlyMusk’s personal residence, a small bungalow winged by a high black fence. As I get out, I chat with the security guard who has trailed us for the past five minutes. He informs me with a smile that while the roads may be public, if I step on to the front lawns of any of the homes, he’ll seek to have me arrested. “It’s private property,” he says.Time to leave.While downtown Starbase may be a little averse to visitors, it’s a different story in the ranchlands outside. Muskfounded the facilityin late 2014, and its rapid expansion in recent years has drawn a small platoon of Mars obsessives to the area. A few miles away from the production site, at a staging location seen in the distance, a Starship rocket is preparing for a static engine test. Clouds of vapour cascade from the 170ft vehicle, and small groups of awestruck spectators congregate at intervals on the roadside.View image in fullscreenStreet signs in the Starbase neighbourhood are adorned with rocket ships and sophomoric jokes.Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The GuardianMany are livestreamers and photographers who document the minutiae of Starbase’s activities in extraordinary detail; surveying the serial numbers of components, the progress of launchpad construction and the particulars of planning documents, to assess when the next Starship launch is likely to take place.“When you’re standing here it’s a weird combination of the wild, wild west and the brand new future,” says a livestreamer named Caesar G, who works for an independent YouTube channel calledNASASpaceflight, which has 1.32 million subscribers. He’s focusing a long lens camera on the testing taking place a few miles away, arms flailing with excitement.“Take the politics out of everything,” he says. “This is the coolest thing that’s going on, engineering-wise. We are catching rockets!”While there is no doubt that the midair mechanical capture of a 232ft rocket booster,as happened here first in October of last year, is an extraordinary technological achievement, I do wonder how it is possible to distinguish it from politics, given the company’s owner is alsoaccused of making a fascist saluteduring Donald Trump’s second inauguration.View image in fullscreenAnthony Gomez, a manager of the Rocket Ranch campground: ‘There are asteroids floating around in space that can make the entire world wealthy.’Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The GuardianShaun Gisler, a self-described “aerospace histographer”, who is also livestreaming at the roadside, chimes in on this point. “He’s accused of a lot of things,” Gisler says. “A lot of that is just white noise. I’m looking at the result out here and I’m seeing success. We’re hoping this gets to a point where it becomes so big, it helps bridge the [political] gap.”The full engine test does not happen for another five hours, but both men are committed to waiting out in the humidity to film it.We drive a little farther inland to meet with Anthony Gomez, a manager of the Rocket Ranch campground, which caters to hundreds of travelling space tourists every year. Gomez moved here in 2021, abandoning his life in Florida to witness what he believes are the beginnings of a programme that will save humanity.We head to a viewing platform which commands an uninterrupted view of the launchpads and is fronted by a fire trench designed to protect visitors in the wake of a catastrophic rocket explosion. He wells up describing the feeling of watching a takeoff here. “Every cell and molecule is shaking with some form of elation,” he says. “It is overwhelming. It’s the apex of human technology. And when that thing takes off, somehowthatis communicated. Somehowthatinformation is delivered into your heart.”At the ranch, a cabin displays fragments of recovered Starship debris, and a large mural recreates Michelangelo’s ‘The Creation of Adam’, replacing God’s finger with one belonging to a Teslahumanoid robotnamed Optimus. We are meeting just days after a federal budget proposal by the Trump administration advancescrippling cuts to low-income housing assistancewhile greenlighting a$1bn investment in Mars programmes, which is likely to benefit Musk.View image in fullscreenVisitors surround the SpaceX Starship as it sits on a launch pad at Starbase last October.Photograph: Sergio Flores/AFP/Getty ImagesGomez, who does not identify as a Trump supporter, is unfazed by the apparent cronyism, arguing that homelessness is “the average human’s responsibility”, not that of the government. Plus, he argues, space exploration may one day allow us to retrieve gold- and platinum-encrusted asteroids to cure global poverty. “There are asteroids floating around in space that can make the entire world wealthy,” he claims. He acknowledges that the technology to receive such a planetary boon is probably centuries away, but argues that the new private space race should “give people a focus of hope”.It can be hard to unpick the politics here; a mixture of right-leaning libertarianism that feels largely mainstream, and visions of a tech utopia that seem more grounded in science fiction than reality. “If you want to take people to Mars, it’s going to include everyone on Earth,” Gomez says when I ask aboutMusk’s clear nods to white nationalism. “Why would you have any specific hate towards anybody?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How would astronauts be protected from cosmic radiation during the journey and while exploring the red planet? How would Starship refuel for a return trip? Can SpaceX even get Starship to orbit Earth in the first place? (The last two launches have ended inexplosive failure.)But perhaps the most pressing question is why humanity would want to spendtrillions of dollarson such a project while pervasive crises on Earth persist. You don’t need to look far in Cameron County to see this rammed home. This is a low-income, majority Latino community of just over 400,000 people,where almost a quarter of residents live below the poverty line.View image in fullscreenBrownsville resident Josette Cruz, who says her rent has significantly increased in the recent year.Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The GuardianIn the county’s main population hub, Brownsville, disdain for the Starbase facility and its impending city status seems to be the predominant view. While Musk’s foundation has madecharitable donations to the local school system and downtown revitalisation efforts, many people I speak to have seen little positive impact. Some complain that their homes shake during launches. Others say that the arrival of heavy industry has beaten up the county highways with little sign of repair. More object to ongoing gentrification.Josette Cruz, a local organiser and lifelong Brownsville resident, points to soaring housing costs associated with an influx of new residents tied to SpaceX expansion and increased tourism. Her rent, she says, has risen from $725 a month to an almost unaffordable $1,000 in just a few years. Realtor signs now spring up in her neighbourhood with images of cartoon rockets.“The fact that people can come here and say, ‘We’re going to have our own election, we’re going to build our own town’, what kind of mentality says that, if not one that is rooted in a colonial, settler mindset?” she says, shrugging. “They want to go to Mars to colonise it.”We take a trip back out past the Starbase facility to Boca Chica beach, a public state park just a few hundred feet from the Starship launch pads. The juxtaposition here is stark. Warnings not to disturb the nesting grounds of the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle are stationed across the beach entrance, framed by the giant launch pads and frantic construction work just metres away. In September last year SpaceXwas finedalmost $150,000 by the Environmental Protection Agency for spewing hundreds of thousands of gallons of polluted wastewater on to the surrounding wetlands after rocket launches. It is a charge the company has continued to deny.Using a low-income community for experimental rocket testing is another example of environmental racismWe meet local environmentalist Bekah Hinojosa, who in 2022was arrested by local policeover alleged involvement in the graffiti found on a Musk-sponsored mural in Brownsville. The three words, written in blue, read: “gentrified stop spaceX”. Hinojosa was apprehended in her pyjamas after plain-clothed officers arrived at her doorstep. Three years later, having pleaded not guilty to a class three misdemeanor, she is still awaiting a trial date.Like many generational residents, Hinojosa’s family have visited this beach for decades, coming to fish at the shoreline and enjoy the tranquillity. But every launch now means a beach closure, and many fear the incorporation of Starbase city will lead to further restrictions on access. “Using a low-income community for experimental rocket testing is another example of environmental racism,” she says, as a group of sandpiper birds paddle in the surf nearby. “Billionaires should not own a beach. We will continue speaking up because, for us, it’s about continuing to exist here.”View image in fullscreenA protest on Boca Chica beach, organised on the same day as the Starbase City vote.Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The GuardianJust coming down to the water’s edge can now feel like an act of resistance, it seems.The morning of the Starbase vote brings with it dark skies and torrential rain. We make a final trip to the complex and stand in the drizzle outside the polling station. It’s a cafeteria open only to SpaceX employees, but a small huddle of journalists seems to keep the security guards away this time.Most voters say they have been told by their employer not to talk to the press. But a stroke of luck allows us to meet one of the handful of residents who cast a ballot in opposition. She is one of the few hold-out residents, still living in a privately owned home on Memes Street. I can only imagine what it must be like to have your permanent address changed to a sophomoric joke.“I was here before SpaceX and I have no loyalty issues,” she says after casting her ballot and declining to be named. I ask how she feels about populating Mars. She grimaces and walks away.The vote ends uppassingby a majority of 212 to six. A 97% margin. The city’s new mayor,Robert Peden, is a SpaceX vice-president. He ran unopposed. Three days later the Federal Aviation Authority,an agency previously purged by Doge, approves an aggressive new SpaceX flight programme that will allow the company to quintuple its annual launches from five to 25.The next Starship is scheduled to take off later this week. Its hulking steel shell glistens in the rain as we drive away.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskSpaceSpaceXTexasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Beattie was familiar with pāua, the Māori word for abalone, and their iridescent shells of shimmering purples and greens. But the pearl that had formed inside was unlike anything he had ever seen, gleaming with layers of the pāua’s natural colours.“I just thought ‘heck, that would make amazing jewellery,’” Beattie says.That was in the early 1990s, and Beattiesoon started experimenting ways of farming pāua, and creating pearls in the shell. A decade later, he began selling the so-called blue pearls commercially.Now, a small industry exists in New Zealand cultivating the unique gems. They are rare, with only a handful of companies running farms, each producing only a few thousand pāua pearls each year. But the delicate operations are being made more complicated as changing conditions and warming seas alter the environments pāua need to survive.“Warm waters cause physiological stress to the pāua,” says Shawn Gerrity, an ecologist at the University of Canterbury who has studied the pāua.View image in fullscreenJacek Pawlowski sets a pāua pearl in a pendant.Photograph: Shanti MathiasThere are four species of pāua endemic toNew Zealand. The blackfoot pāua is the biggest species, known for its vibrant shell and succulent flesh. All cultivated pāua pearls come from the blackfoot pāua. The pearls appear shades of blue, turquoise, purple and green.“Only this abalone, in this water, produces such an unusual colour of pearl,” says Jacek Pawlowski, a jeweller in Akaroa, a seaside town southeast of Christchurch on New Zealand’s South Island. He has worked with the pearls for the last 25 years.“They have that rainbow, opal shine, no pearl is exactly the same,” Pawlowski says.View image in fullscreenRoger Beattie’s pāua live in cold water near the mouth of Akaroa harbour, in New Zealand’s South Island.Photograph: Roger BeattieRisk of warming seasMany of the world’s pearls come from freshwater mussels in China, while more valuable Akoya pearls primarily come from Japan. Black and golden “South Sea” pearls are cultivated in Australia and around the Pacific.In New Zealand, making farmed pāua pearls is delicate and labour-intensive. As juveniles, pāua are taken out of the water, where their flesh is pried up and a small implant placed under their shell for a pearl to form on. If their soft bodies are nicked, the pāua will bleed to death, so the process must be gentle. Only one in five pāua will create a jewellery-grade gem, Beattie says.Each mollusc needs to be fed vast quantities of kelp and live in water about 16 degrees for the three to four years it takes for a pearl to form.To keep the pāua cool, Beattie’s farm is towards the mouth of Akaroa Harbour, with colder water from the open ocean. Arapawa Pearls, in the Marlborough Sounds at the top of the South Island, keeps its pāua in tanks to create a constant temperature.But rising ocean temperatures pose a threat to their survival. Sea surface temperatures around New Zealand have increased 0.16 to 0.26C per decadesince 1982, according to official statistics. Marine heatwaves havedramatically increased in frequencyaround New Zealand, with a particularly severe event in 2017/18 causing thousands of sea creatures to die.Increased marine temperatures have caused mass die-offs of abalone species in other areas of the world, like California, wherewarming waterhas reduced abalone’s access to food and sped up the transmission of a withering disease.Beattie has had an algal bloom – which is more likely in warm water – kill a harvest of pāua by depriving them of oxygen.Gerrity says marine heatwaves “destroy habitats”.“When kelp is degraded,sea urchins survive, and it’s hard to get pāua back,” he says.Gerrity has researched the recovery of pāua in Kaikōura, on the north-east coast of the South Island, where thousands of pāua died after the sea floor was lifted six metres in a 2016 earthquake. Nine years later,with careful management, the population is healthy again. It is a model for what could happen if a heatwave caused similar pāua deaths, but there’s still a lot of risk.Dr Norman Ragg, senior shellfish scientist at science organisation Cawthron Institute, says pāua are a “really interesting quirk of nature”, that have remained unchanged for millennia. While New Zealand’s populations are still healthy, there is no room for complacency.“There are a lot of bad news stories about abalone around the world – they are a large, tasty, shallow-water, easy-to-catch sea snail that breeds and grows slowly and that puts a lot of burden of responsibility back on to [New Zealand].”Ragg believes cultivating blue pearls could go some way to bolstering appreciation for pāua and securing its future in the face of climate change.Looking over his Akaroa shellfish farm,Beattie says he will continue to “work with nature” to ensure the pāua and their pearls continue to thrive.“It’s almost impossible to improve on what nature makes. The pāua have to be not just healthy, but happy,” he says.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificOceansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last year,an embracebetween Xi and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, seemed to sum up the cosy – if at times slightly awkward – relationship between China and Russia.Now Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, can count himself among the hallowed few to havebroken the handshake barrierwith Chinese leader. Stepping off the stage after giving a speech in Beijing earlier this month, Lula shook Xi’s hand, but the moment swiftly melted into something more affectionate.Xi had good reason to be feeling warm towards the Brazilian leader. In Lula’s address to theChina-CELAC forum, a dialogue between China and Latin American and Caribbean countries, he condemned US tariffs and said the Latin American region wanted to be “the axis of a multipolar order where the Global South is duly represented.” Such words echo the case that China has been trying to make to the world – particularly countries in the global south – about the dangers of the tariffs unleashed by US president Donald Trump since he entered the White House in January.China’s argument stands in contrast to the stance taken by the G7, a group of the world’s wealthiest nations, which on Thursday issueda joint communiquein which they agreed to counter global “economic imbalances”, a veiled swipe at China.Brazil’s president seeks ‘indestructible’ links with China amid Trump trade warRead moreLula’s presence at the forum was itself a coup forChinaas it seeks to expand its global influence in Latin America. Lula was one of three heads of states to attend the conference, along with the presidents of Chile and Colombia. That was no accident. China had specifically courted the leaders of countries seen as being influential in the region and closer to the US, rather than those from the countries more naturally aligned with the Chinese Communist party, such as Venezuela and Cuba, who lack regional clout. Lula in particular got a full bells-and-whistles welcome to Beijing, with a military performance in Tiananmen Square including a 21 gun salute.In a keynote speech at the forum, Xi identified China as a fellow member of the global south.“Independence and autonomy are our glorious tradition. Development and revitalisation are our inherent right,” Xi said. China and the Latin American and Caribbean community have a “shared future”, he added.View image in fullscreenXi Jinping and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva attend a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People on May 13, 2025 in Beijing, China.Photograph: Getty ImagesSince Trump’s first term in office,Brazilhas been at the forefront of deepening ties between China and Latin America. One key domain has been trade, which hit a record $157.5bn in 2023. Last year, China imported more than 70% of its soya beans from Brazil, while imports from US farmers have plummeted. Luckin Coffee, China’s largest coffee chain, has pledged to buy 240,000 tonnes of Brazilian coffee beans over a five year period, worth $1.38bn.“If it’s up to my government,our relationship with China will be indestructible,” Lula told business leaders in Beijing, as the two countries announced $4.5bn of upcoming Chinese investments in Brazil. In total, Brazil and China signed 20 agreements on agricultural trade, as well as deals on mining, nuclear energy, and currency swaps.“From a commercial point of view, the current US-China trade war has brought some export opportunities for Brazil, especially in the agricultural sector,” said Victoria Chonn-Ching, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council.But with a trade policy landscape that can change overnight, Beijing is also trying to win the ideological argument on the global stage. Brazil, which China sees as a fellow leader in the global south, is an important player in that strategy.“From a geostrategic and diplomatic perspective, the US-China trade war places Brazil in a challenging position,” Chonn-Ching said.While Brazil has maintained strong ties with the US, on the other hand its relationship with China is significant, said Chonn-Ching, as “both countries promote multilateralism as part of their foreign policy and see themselves as having leading roles in their respective regions and in the Global South.”Unlike many other countries in Latin America, however, Brazil has not signed up to China’s belt and road initiative. Speaking in Beijing, Lula said that Latin America “does not want to be the stage of hegemonic disputes”.But while Trump’s vision for the global order is still coming into focus, Beijing has for years trumpeted the importance of a “multipolar” system of international cooperation. It is a sentiment that Lula echoes.Recent global events have also brought the two countries closer together. After the 7 October attacks in Israel, Brazil, as president of the UN security council, drafted a resolution condemning Hamas and calling for a humanitarian pause in hostilities as well as the release of hostages in Gaza. Many expected China, which had not until thismonthspecifically condemned the attacks, to veto the resolution. But following rounds of back-room diplomacy with Brazil, China voted in favour. The resolution ultimately failed because of a US veto.Since then, Brazil and China have come closer together in attempts to cast themselves as mediators in global conflicts. The countries have twice released joint statements on the war in Ukraine, neither of which condemn the Russian invasion. And on his flight back from China, Lula’s planestopped in Moscow, and he spoke to Xi’s “best friend”, Vladimir Putin, on the phone.Additional research by Lillian Yang and Jason LuExplore more on these topicsChinaBrazilXi JinpingLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Salgado, who in his lifetime produced more than 500,000 images while meticulously documenting every continent on Earth and many of the major geopolitical events since the second world war, will be remembered as one of the world’s most prodigious and relentlessly empathetic chroniclers of the human condition.An economist by training, Salgado only began photographing at age 29 after picking up the camera of his wife, Lélia. He began working as a photojournalist in the 1970s, quickly building an impressive reputation that led him to the prestigious Magnum Photos in 1979. He spent three decades photographing people in modern societies all over the world before stepping back in 2004 to initiate the seven-year Genesis project – there, he dedicated himself to untouched landscapes and pre-modern human communities, a project that would guide the remainder of his career. Hislate project Amazôniasaw him spend nine years preparing a profound look into the terrain and people of the Amazon rainforest.Photographer Sebastião Salgado at 80: ‘They say I was an aesthete of misery’Read moreIn 2014 the German director Wim Wenders teamed up with the photographer’s son Juliano Ribeiro Salgado to co-produce a documentary celebrating Salgado’s work titledThe Salt of the Earth. While covering 40 years of Salgado’s creative output, the film also centers around his decision to temporarily abandon photography after witnessing firsthand the horrors of the Rwandan genocide. Amid that crisis he founded his Instituto Terra in 1998 – ultimately planting hundreds of thousands of trees in an effort to help reforest Brazil’s Rio Doce valley – and through his communion with the land slowly pieced his way back to photography.Salgado tirelessly, and probably also recklessly, threw himself into his work – while documenting Mozambique’s civil war in 1974 he ran afoul of a landmine, and later, in Indonesia in the 1990s, he caught malaria, leading to ongoing medical issues for the remainder of his life. He spent nearly two months walking Arctic Russia with the Indigenous Nenets, encountering temperatures as cold as -45C, and he also recounted walking nearly 1,000km through Ethiopia because of the lack of roads. Late in life, Salgado was forced to have a surgical implant in order to retain use of his knee in the course of making his Amazônia project.View image in fullscreenSebastião Salgado in 2022.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesHis biblical landscapes are often taken from thousands of feet in the air – one imagines him leaning out of a helicopter, angling for the perfect framing. He was known for utilizing virtually every mode of conveyance available in pursuit of the new and unseen – car, truck, ship, helicopter, plane, even canoe, hot-air balloon, Amazon riverboat and others.Prints of Salgado’s work – always black and white, and generally printed at a dazzlingly high contrast – were as sizable as his ambitious, landing as overwhelming presences in galleries and museums. He was known for blacks that were as inky as they come, and his landscapes also show a remarkable obsession with rays of light shining through rainclouds, around mountains and off water. He loved the graininess that came from film – so much so, that when he finally traded in his trusty Leica for a digital camera, he often digitally manipulated his images to bring in a grain reminiscent of real film.For as much as Salgado was a photographer of extremes, he could also do tonal nuance – many of his landscapes are only capable of capturing their terrain’s immensity due to his careful use of mid-tones, and Salgado’s human portraiture often abandoned the high contrast for a rich subtlety.Sebastião Salgado: ‘I was transformed into an environmentalist’Read moreNo matter how enormous his subjects were, he always retained a remarkable human touch. When photographing Brazil’s Serra Pelada goldmine he made images showing the workers as thousands of ants scrambling up perilously sheer walls of dirt, yet also captured indelible expressions of effort and pride on the faces of individual, mud-soaked laborers. His image of the Churchgate train station in Bombay, India, shows thousands of commuters in motion, looking like a literal flood of humanity surging around two waiting trains. One snap of a firefighter in Kuwait working to cap the oilwells that Saddam Hussein set ablaze shows a man hunched over in a posture of utter exhaustion, one of countless examples of Salgado’s incredible ability to limn the human form via film.Given everything that Salgado shot over his incredible six decades of work, it’s hard to imagine what else he could have done. Upon turning 80 last year, he had declared his decision to step back from photography in order to manage his enormous archive of images and administer worldwide exhibitions of his work. He also showed his dim outlook for humanity, telling the Guardian: “I am pessimistic about humankind, but optimistic about the planet. The planet will recover. It is becoming increasingly easier for the planet to eliminate us.”It will probably take decades to fully appreciate and exhibit Salgado’s remaining photographs, to say nothing of grappling with the images he showed during his lifetime. One hopes that amid a period of increasing global strife, environmental collapse and threats to the mere notion of truth, this remarkable output will remain a beacon of decency and humanity – and help us chart a path back from the brink.Explore more on these topicsSebastião SalgadoPhotographyBrazilfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The abject non-hero of Kelly Reichardt’s engrossingly downbeat heist movie, set in 1970s Massachusetts, is weak, vain and utterly clueless. By the end, he’s a weirdly Updikean figure, though without the self-awareness: going on the run with no money and without a change of clothes, to escape from the grotesque mess he has made for himself and his family.This is James, played with hangdog near-charm by Josh O’Connor; he is an art school dropout and would-be architectural designer with two young sons, married to Terri (a minor complaint is that the excellent Alana Haim is not given enough to do). James depends on the social standing of his father Bill, a judge, formidably played by Bill Camp, and is borrowing large sums of money from his patrician mother Sarah (Hope Davis), ostensibly to finance a new project.But James has something else in mind for the cash. Having established the lax security measures at a local art gallery, he plans to pay two tough guys and a getaway driver to steal four paintings by American artist Arthur Dove and hide them at a nearby farmhouse. But then, as one of his robbers plaintively ask him, how are they to be fenced? James’s answer to that turns out to be the most pathetic thing of all.Obviously, you wouldn’t expect the quietist, realist movie art of Kelly Reichardt to give us anything like Ocean’s Eleven or Reservoir Dogs. But the very fact of its ostentatiously unadorned reality makes the extraordinary events real and startling, shot, as always with Reichardt, with an earth-tones colour palette in a cold, clear daylight in her unflavoured, unaccented style. We are talking about robbery with guns pointed at innocent people and security guards roughed up, with no dramatic music on the soundtrack (quite as it would be in real life). Reichardt has unerringly located the unglamour in the heist.You might compare this to realist art heist pictures such asAlonso Ruizpalacios’s MuseumorBart Layton’s American Animals, both from 2018, but this is utterly distinctive and, yes, exciting. So is the weird slice-of-life quality in every recorded detail of the chaotic and extended aftermath, which is the real meat of the picture in fact: James shows his failure to anticipate the reliability level of the tough guys and the likelihood that the local mob will not take kindly to audacious, eye-catching and – who knows? – lucrative robberies on their turf.James travels around his variously wary and aghast acquaintances, and these scenes show us the awful truth about James’s abysmally insubstantial dreams and ambitions – he periodically calls in from public telephones, asking the kids to “put mommy on the phone”, avoiding justice, committing contemptible theft (so much less exciting than art theft) and finally receiving brutal poetic justice amid the injustice of Nixon’s US. As for O’Connor, his art-thief character is weirdly similar to the one he played inAlice Rohrwacher’s 2023 film La Chimera, a former archaeological scholar turned antiquity robber, although he was there physically tougher and more knowledgable about art theft.Kelly Reichardt’s last film, as it happens, was also about art:Showing Up, with Michelle Williams as a stressed artist whose day-to-day existence (the banal business of “showing up”) is shown to be more real than the supposed white heat of artistic inspiration. There the quotidian details were as relevant as the art; in The Mastermind, the dreary details of post-heist calamity are as pertinent as the main event. It is this that attracts Reichardt’s observing eye and makes The Mastermind so quietly gripping.The Mastermind screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsCrime filmsUS crimePeriod and historical filmsJosh O'ConnorKelly ReichardtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Hamzah-Adam Desai also adds variety for wildlife with bird boxes and pollinators, such as the Sorbus tree on the right.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianSilver medal winner and Chelsea debutant Hamzah-Adam Desai doesn’t even have a garden. But in his personal time he has spent years working his green-fingered magic in a communal square in his home in east London.His “peace of mind” garden at Chelsea impressed the judges with its restful, pared back “restorative” greens to one side through to the purples and pops of yellow and red on the other, in what he describes as a 3D colour wheel.View image in fullscreenDesign tip: buy large pots for four or five plants. Small pots dry out as the enthusiasm of newcomers dies with the plants.Photograph: David Sillitoe/The GuardianHe trained as a gardener 16 years ago after a bout of seasonal affective disorder but the real education is just doing it. “It’s a constant kind of experimentation,” he says, urging amateurs to learn from their mistakes just as the professionals do.“I live in a square where we had lots of areas which weren’t gardened so you know we have areas in share where I have my woodland planting and then sunny areas where I have my herbaceous plants.”One of his top tips for balconies is to “avoid bedding plants”, which he says are less sustainable, only last a year and can be a garden passion killer.Go for “more shrubby, coastal plants” including heuchera, which “can have very interesting colours”, and grasses that “are brilliant for movement” such asStipa tenuissima‘Wind whispers’ with spikes of soft plumes that dance in the gentlest of breezes.Gardeners should also remember that in urban areas they are likely to be dealing with microclimates.View image in fullscreenDesign tip: use diagonals stretching out from the door to your container garden. Here used expertly in the placing of containers, tiles and pergola. ‘It stretches the space to the longest line in your garden,’ says Jen Donnelly.Photograph: Lisa O’Carroll/The Guardian“Some balconies have glass so when the sun shines the poor plants are being roasted. It is a microclimate; get to know it and what plants work in that environment,” he says.One of the stars of his garden is an exquisite Aquilegia crysantha‘Lemon queen’, with pale yellow flowers dangling from long spikes. It is a self seeder and was also chosen by his neighbouring designers Ben Strickland and Ben Gifford.He has also created height – a key to creating privacy and visual variety – by lifting his sage green containers behind his seating area, created through clever vertical stacking of slabs. His are custom-made, but the same effect could be achieved by tiles or slabs taken from an old patio.View image in fullscreenGet height and colour with a tree in a container.

Donnelly advises gardeners to buy one pot for four plants rather than four separate pots.Choosing the same colour container throughout your small space will tie everything together, another design trick, she says.Her star tip is repetition. “Don’t just have one of each plant, have multiples of them and repeat them through the garden.”“When you go to the garden centre don’t buy 10 different things, buy 10 of the same, or five of two different things. It will immediately transform your garden,” she says.Another tip shared by all the designers is to place plants with the same watering needs in the one pot. Don’t be tempted to put water-loving hydrangea with drought-tolerant lavender, for example.View image in fullscreenBalcony garden silver gilt medal winner at the Chelsea flower show: Freddie Strickland (above) and his partner Ben Gifford for their outdoor reading room.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianDesignwise, diagonals rather than straight lines can be used to create a sense of space.“Our space here is only 3 metres by 4 metres but it feels a lot bigger because we have gone for the diagonal,” she says, referring to the planters but also the pergola overhead. “It stretches the space because it draws your eye to the longest line of your garden,” she says.View image in fullscreenDrifts of foxtail barley,Hordeum jubatum, in Tom Hoblyn’s hospice garden, is testament to the idea of repeat planting but also the movement grasses deliver.Photograph: Lisa O’Carroll/The GuardianHer garden is testament to the power of shade-loving plants, something vital for the hospital’s east-facing aspect and shade-creating high walls.Among the most asked about plants is a variety of lady’s mantle – gold strike – and anemone – wild swan – that flower earlier than other Japanese anemones and have purplish reverse petals.Donnelly and Gibbon’s garden is inspired by their work at Amersham hospital and is designed to help caregivers recharge with a palette of greens and burgundy, creating a harmonious colour scheme by limiting hues to variations within a colour band.View image in fullscreenDeschampsia cespitosatakes pride of place in this container glistening in evening light on Freddie Strickland and Ben Gifford’s garden at the Chelsea flower show.Photograph: Lisa O’Carroll/The GuardianFurther down the road, crowds are wowed by Freddie Strickland and Ben Gifford’s “a space to read” balcony garden.The star of the show is the magnificentCornus kousaMilky Way, a small tree in the dogwood family.With their pink and white flower-like bracts they are highly valued in places such as Seattle, but are not so common in the UK.The trees can grow up to 12 metres tall in the ground but in a pot they can be a show-stopper addition to a small garden, provided they are not exposed to winds, and are placed in partial sun and neutral to acidic soil.“This can be pruned minimally once a year. It is a lovely tree, a hard-working tree, with three seasons of interest, the flower which lasts for a month, the fruits and then lovely autumn colour,” says Strickland.The two designers took a silver gilt medal for their garden dominated by hues of green set off by a wall of vertically placed tiles to mimic a bookshelf and two handmade garden chairs.Strickland’s garden is testament to the less is more philosophy. In 15 containers he has 20 plant types with accents of white, pink and soft yellow including ground cover stars such as the palmate-leavedMuckdenia rossiiand Epimedium “orangekonigin” with sprays of delicate orange flowers and an evergreen fern,Polypodium vulgare.View image in fullscreenGold medal winner for the fifth time for Surreal Succulents, Jack Drewitt at the Chelsea flower show.Photograph: Lisa O’Carroll/The GuardianAnother plant delivering height is a delicate grass,Deschampsia cespitosa, which twinkles in the evening light.Strickland, who trained in Cornwall, advises those with high-rise balconies exposed to windy conditions to walk around their neighbourhood to see what grows well, or to join a local gardening club: “Gardeners love to talk about gardening.”To survive in containers belonging to people with busy lives, “the plants have to work really hard” so choose those with interest, not the brightest thing in the garden centre, he says.“It’s really important to encourage people to embrace maintenance as part of the routine, getting your fingers in the soil is a joyous part of living.”For those without gardens or new to gardening, succulents are a great start, says Jack Drewitt of Surreal Succulents. He advises novices to try anything in the aeonium or echeveria families or an Aloe vera.“They are ideal for window boxes. People grow them in boots, shoes, just make sure they have a hole for drainage and they are happy in most small spaces and are very easy to propagate,” says Drewitt. Some of the less hardy ones will survive on heating transmitted through glass in the winter and will survive in window boxes.View image in fullscreenDishing up the succulents, a great introduction to gardening even if you don’t have an outdoor space, says Jack Drewitt of Surreal Succulents.Photograph: Lisa O’Carroll/The Guardian“They are very forgiving and very accessible and really good for children to start them understanding how plants grow.

The spring sun is not visible yet, but its pale-yellow light is catching the tops of the steep, tussock-clad valley where I spent the night. I am completely alone; it’s just me and my thoughts.These are the kinds of moments of peace and blissful contentment in nature that cannot be commodified and have been under threat since the owner of the land where I pitched my tent launched a legal case two years ago to curtail the right for the public to backpack camp onDartmoor.Alexander Darwall, a multimillionaire hedge fund manager, and his wife, Diana Darwall, claimed that wild camping was hindering their conservation efforts and putting their cattle at risk on their 1,619-hectare (4,000-acre) estate on the southern edges of the moor.But this week, the supreme court rejected Darwall’s lawyers’ argument that the act giving the public access to the moor for “open air recreation” only referred to walking and horse riding. The three judges ruled that recreation should be understood far more widely, including wild camping.View image in fullscreenCampaigners celebrate outside the supreme court in London after the legal right to wild camp on Dartmoor was upheld.Photograph: Lucy North/PAThis landmark ruling means Dartmoor remains the only place inEnglandwhere it is legal to wild camp without a landowner’s permission. I passed the Darwalls’ grand home – Blachford Manor – on the tough three-hour walk up on to the moor. Through a thick hawthorn hedge and barbed-wire fence, I caught fleeting glimpses of the couple’s shimmering fish pond and extensive deer park. But I didn’t need to knock on his door and beg to camp on their open moorland: I just went ahead.In Scotland, people are allowed to pitch their tents where they please, provided they do not stray on to enclosed land, such as fields of crops. In England it is a different story, although many hikers, bikers and climbers do it anyway in remote uplands. Usually they are tolerated as long as they are discreet and responsible, but it is not a right.Countryside access campaigners hope the Dartmoor ruling will push Labour to open up more land to the public (as it once promised in opposition, with a right to roam). Some wonder if the judgment could prompt other national parks to allow responsible backpacking camping, as it makes clear that wild camping counts as open-air recreation. After all, the postwar bill establishing the national parks was designed to give people in bombed-out cities “opportunities for open air recreation”.As the sunlight creeps down the sides of the valley, I fetch water from the River Erme and heat it on my stove. Soon, I have a warming mug of tea in my hands. This is very different from camping on a commercial site: there are no facilities or bins. You must carry out what you bring in – although you may carefully bury your own waste.View image in fullscreenThe sense of freedom is exhilarating … wild camping in Dartmoor national parkPhotograph: Peter Crome/AlamyIt is not for everyone, but for those who love adventure and resent paying to be crammed between a palatial air-tent and an SUV with a safari-style roof tent in rural Suffolk. No one has staked out their group’s patch with a fortification of wind breaks in something resembling a land grab. There are no queues and acrid smoke from burnt meat.The sense of freedom you get pitching your tent in open country is exhilarating. But of course, it brings a certain level of responsibility, and it is true some do not follow the rules.I reported on the spate of fly camping, where large groups left behind piles of rubbish and tents, during the pandemic.However, the supreme court judges made the point that it was far more effective for Dartmoor national park, which resisted Darwall’s efforts along with a coalition of campaigners, to deal with irresponsible camping than leave it to private landowners to take action in the civil courts.Whatever the transgressions of this tiny minority, they pale into insignificance compared with the damage caused by irresponsible landowners across the UK. We live in one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. Intensive farming coupled with the climate crisis has sent wildlife into decline, with nearlyone in six species now threatened with extinction.View image in fullscreenTom Wall camping on Dartmoor.Photograph: Tom Wall/The GuardianDartmoor itself is being overgrazed, particularly by sheep. The problem, which has prompted warnings from Natural England and a government action plan, is destroying habitats and putting rare birds at risk of local extinction. Darwall, who offers pheasant shoots, deer stalking and holiday rentals on his land, has beenaccused of endangering a rare beetleby releasing pheasants next to an ecologically important woodland.On my 17km hike through rugged moorland, rushing rivers and moss-draped woodlands, I did not see a single piece of litter or scorch marks from a fire. The only rubbish I saw was feed bags and boxes left by farmers.As I descend off the moor, I follow the route of one of the largest ever countryside access protests ever seen in the UK. After Darwall won his initial court case in the high court in 2023,thousands came together to defend the right to wild camp. It is a testament to their efforts that this special place remains open to all.Explore more on these topicsDartmoorNational parksEnglandAccess to green spaceLand ownershipConservationDevonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The reality is quite differentFri 23 May 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 07.25 EDTShareAmid all the acrimony surrounding Keir Starmer’s recentremarks on immigration– a row that could follow him into retirement and beyond – there has been one little-examined area of agreement between the prime minister and his critics. “When people come to our country,” Starmer said, “they should also commit to integration.” You may believe that integration is not best achieved by government decree, yet in conversations about what sort of society Britain should be, it has long been generally accepted that integration is a good thing – not just for immigrants but for everyone.Mixing, empathising and collaborating with people who aren’t like you has benefits, the argument goes, for individuals and the country as a whole. Perspectives are broadened. Inequalities are softened, at least a little. Lives are enriched, and feelings of loneliness and alienation are diminished. Who would want to live in a country without such social exchanges – in other words, in a segregated society?Actually, it appears that many of us do. For centuries, this country has been synonymous with segregation – by class, education, manners, dress, accents, leisure habits and housing. Since the early 1980s, when Thatcherism began to erase the more integrated and equal postwar Britain, these ancient divisions have been compounded by a further polarisation in incomes and between regions.“The UK – England in particular – has some of the deepest spatial inequalities … among the OECD countries,” noted the socioeconomic data website the Economics Observatory last year. “These differences have been increasing for over three decades.” Deep segregation also exists within cities, towns and villages. This week, research published by the pollsters More in Common showed that44% of Britons“say they sometimes feel like they are strangers to those around them”.Much of modern life seems to be about separation: wearing headphones in public, driving cars with tinted windows, looking at your phone rather than people around you. The wealthy seem especially keen to distance themselves from other Britons, minimising their taxes, choosing private schools and private healthcare, and living in enclaves behind electric gates and entry phones, high up in towers or down private roads.In his immigration speech last week, Starmer said he wanted Britain to be “a nation that walks forward together”, which acknowledged “the obligations we owe to one another”. This wish may be genuine. Some of his policies, such as abolishing the non-dom tax status, removing some inheritance tax privileges from farmers, imposing VAT on private school fees and partly equalising the balance of power between employers and employees, can be seen as efforts to create a more cohesive country. The fury of some of those affected by these modest adjustments to the established order reveals just how entitled they feel to separate treatment.Yet it’s striking that despite these welcome reforms, the government, like most of its British predecessors, rarely if ever tells elites to integrate more with the rest of society. Nor does Starmer criticise other Britons with separatist tendencies, such as white voters who move out to the suburbs from multiracial urban areas, or long-established rural residents who don’t welcome incomers. Instead, the integration lecture is reserved for immigrants.Patronisingly, this approach ignores the fact that immigration is by definition an act of integration: you are in effect blending your original national identity with one of another country. Even if you don’t try very hard to learn the language or meet the locals – a narrow-mindedness not unknown among British expats, as this country likes to euphemistically label its emigrants – you are sharing the same weather, built environment, natural landscape and social and political context as your new neighbours, and a gradual blurring of boundaries usually results. Immigrant communities rarely remain totally inward-looking and monocultural for long. Often, they start mixing with locals from day one – either because they want to, or because they have to.Having spent most of his adult life in multicultural British cities, Starmer must know this. “Migration is part of Britain’s national story,” he said last week. Britain is “a diverse nation”, he also said, “and I celebrate that”. The great immigrant integration panic, like the fear and hostility towards immigrants in general, is partly a reaction to social frictions and dislocations that rarely happen – or at least not on the scale claimed or imagined by socially conservative voters, journalists and politicians – in places where most immigrants to Britain actually live. As in other policy areas, Labour is doing itself no favours, politically or morally, by trying to legislate in ways that satisfy the British right’s gloomy and distorted view of the modern world.In recent years, with immigration at unusually high levels, the government has published an annual “community life survey”, measuring how Britons view their neighbours and neighbourhoods. Its findings have consistently been more positive than much of the media or this week’s downbeat More in Common poll would lead you to expect. According to thelatest survey, “81% of adults definitely or tended to agree that their local area is a place where people from different backgrounds get along well”. Since 2013, that figure has never fallen below 80%. Despite all modern Britain’s divides and disorienting social shifts, for most of us, Starmer’s “island of strangers” does not yet exist.One hot afternoon last summer, I was waiting for a bus in King’s Lynn in Norfolk, a usually Tory constituency that voted for Brexit by two to one, when I wanted a cup of tea. The first, traditional tearoom I tried in the town had closed early, so I followed a small cafe sign next to the bus station into an unpromising-looking, windowless building. Inside, to my surprise, was a classic Portuguese bar, with dusty Portuguese football scarves hanging from the ceiling and elderly Portuguese immigrants drinking dark Portuguese liqueur from tiny glasses. The bar felt both foreign and, in its confident approach to cultural difference, quite British.Were the bar staff and their customers completely integrated with the rest of King’s Lynn? On the basis of a brief visit, it was hard to say. But they made a very good cup of tea.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In Lviv last week, Adeline showed me on her phone map her lost home in Russian-occupied Nova Kakhovka, just across the Dnipro River from the Ukrainian-liberated territory around Kherson. Look, she said, with tears welling up in her eyes, here on this satellite snapshot you can see the ecological disaster that followedRussia’s destructionof the Kakhovka dam in 2023. And here’s the place where she dreamed of setting up a small art gallery. “Why should I give up on my home?” she cried. Why indeed.The territory occupied byRussiais the size of Portugal and Slovenia combined. It’s difficult to get accurate figures, but perhaps some 5 million people live there, while at least another 2 million refugees from those territories are now elsewhere. Inside the occupied territories, Ukrainians face brutal repression and systematic Russification. Outside, refugees like Adeline are left with only their memories, old photographs and the keys to lost homes. We should not whitewash this monstrous ongoing crime of occupation with the soothing words “land for peace”.No one in Ukraine believes that any “deal” will end the war for good, even if negotiations eventually produce a fragile ceasefire. It’s not just “land” that Russia has taken by brutal conquest; it’s the homes, family histories, lives and livelihoods of millions of individual men, women and children. Ukraine is not “ceding” territory any more than I “cede” my car if a criminal steals it and I can’t get it back. Above all, this will not be peace. A just peace, with Adeline going home following the liberation of all Ukrainian territory, reparations being paid by Russia andVladimir Putinon trial in The Hague, is unachievable in the foreseeable future. But anything seriously meriting the label “peace” requires the achievement of durable military security, economic recovery, political stability and European integration for the roughly four-fifths of its sovereign territory that Ukraine still controls. That will take years.No one wants peace more than the Ukrainians. Obviously Volodymyr Zelenskyy must try to keep Donald Trump on side, so the American bully doesn’t completely sell Ukraine out to Putin. In recent polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, only 29% of Ukrainians said they could accept Trump’s peace plan but 51% could live with the alternative plan proposed by European leaders. What all Ukrainians know is that, even as the world talks of peace, Russia has continued launching massive drone and missile attacks against them. Meanwhile, the emissary whom Putin dispatched to Russo-Ukrainian talks in Istanbul, Vladimir Medinsky, harked back to the great northern war of 1700-21,telling the Ukrainian delegation: “We fought Sweden for 21 years. How long are you ready to fight?”So the real issue is whether Ukraine can continue to defend itself and build up its long-term resilience, with increased support from Europe to compensate for vanishing support from the US. The most encouraging conversations I had in Kyiv were with people engaged in the defence industry. Ukraine now leads the world in theinnovative developmentand manufacture of drones, with more than 2m produced last year. It could do even better if more partner countries followed Denmark’s example andgave contracts directlyto Ukrainian arms manufacturers. Its biggest problem is the shortage of fresh recruits. One frontline commander told me he now has adequate arms and ammunition, but his battalion is only at 30% manpower strength. In the east, he said, there are empty trenches defended only by drones.Russia seems to be planning new ground offensives, but western military experts thinkUkrainecan continue to defend most of the territory it currently controls. Gradually, it can build up ways to fend off the Russians at sea (where it’s already successful), on land (with a drone-enforced “virtual wall” and deep strikes behind Russian lines) and, most challenging of all, in the air. With the advent of the new German chancellor Friedrich Merz, plus the somewhat unexpected Churchillism of the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, Europe’s “coalition of the willing” is strong. The most useful thing it can plan for is not “boots on the ground” but multilayered aerial defence to create a sky shield over the western half of the country.The three military essentials still needed from the US are its intelligence capabilities (very hard to replace), US-made Patriot air-defence interceptors (the only ones totake down Russia’s ballistic missiles), and large quantities of 155mm ammunition (although Europe is stepping up on that). If Trump can be persuaded not to block those three, Ukraine can survive with increased European support. Then, especially if Europe can also ratchet up economic sanctions on Russia, the squeeze could slowly become tighter on Moscow than on Kyiv. At some point, even Putin may begin to think it was time to stop the hot phase of this war, accept a ceasefire “line of control” and command his domestic propaganda machine to declare a famous victory. Nothing in this scenario is certain, and Putin’s regime may no longer be able to risk peace, but this is the least unrealistic path to ending the largest war in Europe since 1945.Trump has brought Ukraine-Russia peace talks back to square one – just where Putin wants them | Olga ChyzhRead moreUkraine would immediately face daunting new challenges. How to preserve the national unity of wartime when the guns fall silent? How to reintegrate more than 3 million veterans? When to hold an election and how to ensure it’s free and fair? The Ukrainian politics will be messy and full of recrimination, against each other and the west. Putin, for whom politics is the continuation of war by other means, will have ample opportunities to stir the pot, fostering acrimony and division.Meanwhile, Europe’s attention could rapidly turn away, as it did from Bosnia after theDayton accordsin 1995. Virtually all Ukraine’s non-military budget is today funded by international support. Hundreds of billions more euros will be needed before a reconstructed economy can acquire its own dynamism. From Portugal to Poland, Europe’s surging populists will tell voters they shouldn’t go on footing this bill. Only if Merz swings his weight behind confiscating Russia’s frozen assets will that kind of money be found.Earlier this month, four European leaderstravelled to Kyivthe day after what in English is known as VE (Victory in Europe) Day, marking the total defeat of Nazi Germany. Alas, there will be no simple, single VU (Victory in Ukraine) Day, marking the total defeat of Putin’s Russia. A durable peace won’t come any time soon, and certainly not from some hasty, unbalanced deal. Only if both Ukraine and Europe have the foresight, stamina and unity for a long struggle may something genuinely deserving of the name of peace be achieved by the end of this decade.Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionEuropeRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinDonald TrumpUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

And it’s spreadingGaby HinsliffIn this new climate, having an enviable job, while not being a straight white man, is grounds for suspicionFri 23 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 01.06 EDTShareWayne Brown was a trailblazer, a man who made his own small piece of history by becoming Britain’s first black fire chief.He worked his way up as a young firefighter, rising through the ranks, serving the public through dark times including the 2005 London terror attacks and the Grenfell fire.But in January of last year, at the age of 54,he took his own life, leaving a note that read: “I can’t do this any more.” An inquest heard Brown had become increasingly distressed after being bombarded for years with hostile social media posts, complaints to his employer, freedom of information inquiries and emails from an anonymous account that seemed to be mounting a campaign against him. Days before he died, Brown had learnedhe would be formally investigatedfor claiming on his CV to have an MBA, which in truth he had started but never finished.Whether these were vexatious complaints – what Brown’s female deputy called “constant harassment from multiple individuals” – or perfectly legitimate whistleblowing was not for the coroner to decide, and nor was it her job to investigate why a senior black officer seemingly attracted so many of them.Yet there was something in the picture friends and family painted of a man in an already stressful job, carrying an extra burden that will at the very least be familiar to other “firsts” in their field: the uncomfortable feeling that the world is just waiting for you to fall flat on your face, the relentless sniping that you’re not up to it, and the whispers that you’re what the very online British right is starting to call a “DEI hire”.The acronym is a giveaway: DEI is the American version of what Brits more often call EDI, or equality diversity and inclusion, ground zero of Donald Trump’s war on woke. The president’s bizarre and seemingly evidence-free attempt to blamea fatal mid-air collision between a helicopter and a planein Washington this January on DEI hiring policies was disturbing enough, but it was the speed with which some Americans embraced the idea that was genuinely chilling. An incoherent ball of online rage took shape, alighting horribly swiftly on Captain Rebecca Lobach, the female army helicopter pilot killed in the crash. Her grieving family and friends were forced on to the defensive, pointing out that she’d been in the top 20% of graduating cadets, information seemingly not required of the male crew on board. But to the DEI warriors, her qualifications didn’t seem to matter. She was a woman, wasn’t she? So obviously she must have been the weak link.Weeks later, Trumpfired the black air force general Charles Q Brown Jr, identified by his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, as a champion of “woke shit” in the military, along with Admiral Lisa Franchetti (who was the first woman to lead the US navy) and three other senior Pentagon figures. Gen Brown was a former fighter pilot with 40 years of distinguished service to his country, while Hegseth is a former Fox News pundit who never rose above the rank of major in the Army National Guard, and whose nomination as defence secretary prompted reports that he had left two jobs in veterans’ organisations afterallegations of financial mismanagement, aggressive drunkenness and sexist behaviour, which Hegseth has repeatedly denied. “Was it because of his skin colour? Or his skill? We’ll never know, but always doubt,” Hegseth once wrote of Gen Brown. Such doubts might seem unfair, Hegseth conceded, but “since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn’t really much matter”. To be scorned as a DEI hire, a liability on the job who should never have been allowed to rise this high, you don’t have to be proven incompetent or even to have been hired through any formal diversity scheme. Just having an enviable job, while not being a straight white man, is grounds for suspicion – especially if you have the audacity to champion lifting others up the ladder.Britain is not America, or at least not yet. We are still the country where it was “just not that big a deal” (asRishi Sunak put it) in the end to have a British Asian prime minister, and where Nigel Farage’s ominous suggestion that diversity officers in newly Reform-led councils should start looking for new jobs elicited sharp warnings from unions that in this country people can’t be fired at will for political reasons. (They could also have added that diversity officers aren’t some suspicious lefty affectation but mostly people employed to ensure councils meet their legal obligations under the Equality Act, as some Reform councillors may be about to discover.)But the playground taunt of “DEI hire” nonetheless feeds an age-old grievance, a lurking sense that someone has a job that could have been yours. It creates a climate where what was fast becoming unsayable in polite company can, once again, be said with confidence. And perhaps most corrosively of all, it feeds the nagging voice of doubt already lurking inside the most outwardly confident of people.Successful women, and increasingly often successful men from non-traditional backgrounds, sometimes complain of “impostor syndrome”, or the irrational fear that any minute now someone is going to rumble you as a fraud. You don’t belong; you shouldn’t be here; you’ll get found out, less for doing wrong than for intrinsicallybeingit. Though everyone makes mistakes, impostor syndrome makes them loom larger and more shamefully inside your head than they should.View image in fullscreenPete Hegseth sits next to JD Vance in the Oval Office, 21 May 2025.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersFor politicians and others in the public eye, social media long ago turned what were once snarky whispers behind your back into an incessant and very public barrage of sexist or racist abuse that chips away at the confidence of even the most rhino-skinned. You can complain to platform moderators if you like, but a fat lot of good it will generally do you – which leaves a choice between leaving or learning to ignore it, a choice nobody would consider acceptable if the same insults were driving minorities out of a pub. The race equality thinktank British Future argues, in a submission to the Commons equality select committee’snew inquiry into community cohesion, that platforms whose reporting mechanisms do not ensure that female and minority users enjoy the same service as everyone else could be in breach of the Equality Act 2010. At the very least, there’s arguably a case for the Equality and Human Rights Commission to make its presence felt.But the real risk, perhaps, is of the same playground taunts and knee-jerk prejudices spilling back out into real life conversations. Britain is not America, not yet.

Wellsbourne GP practice in Whitehawk, EastBrighton, has just been told it is losing its contract. NHS Sussex, the local integrated care board (ICB), is provisionally handing it over to a distant Leeds-based company whose main business is in owning and managing healthcare properties. This is a story about how parts of the NHS can slip awayto profit-makers, despite the government’s aim to put community first. The company, One Medical Group, won the bid by undercutting on price and proposing to add a walk-in centre. It’s not a lone case: some other ICBs erroneously put good NHS community services out for tender, and feel obliged to take the lowest bid.To give you a rough portrait, in 2019 Whitehawk was ranked within the top 10% of England’s most deprived areas, and the most deprived in Brighton.According to a doctor from the practice, life expectancy in the area is 10% lower than it is on the other side of the city.The renowned Marmot review on health inequalities and their underlying social causes drew on Whitehawk as a study of deprivation. It’s the type of place that needs exceptionally socially committed GPs.It’s not, in other words, where you would expect a private company to make money. Indeed, the last private company managing the GP practice quit, leaving services in disarray. The GPs of Wellsbourne now work as part of a not-for-profit community interest company. “We’re here because this is the kind of work we want to do,” said Posy Greany, a doctor at the surgery. Although they would be re-employed by the new company, she tells me they are likely to leave, as “working for a private for-profit provider doesn’t fit with our view of the NHS”. As Greany wrote in a local publication,Sussex Bylines: “It will dismantle a model that is working. It will scatter a team that has fought to earn trust.”Within days of the news, a petition opposing the handover of the practice gathered more than 2,000 signatures. Wellsbourne is a hive of community activity. It works closely with Whitehawk’s food bank, community sports centre and youth centre. Artists run community projects there and volunteers tend to a community garden with patients. All of these services could now be at risk. The Care Quality Commission rates the practice as “good”, in an area where reaching all of the regulator’s targets is hard.Here’s the puzzle. Andrew Lansley’s calamitous system that opened theNHSto “any willing provider” to compete for contracts was supposedly swept away in 2022, replaced with ICBs that strove for cooperation across all NHS and social services in England. Yet some ICBs still apply the old competitive impulse to NHS services, even though they now have an obligation to ensure that tenders help to reduce inequalities.To be fair, the entire NHS is the under the whip toeliminate its £6bn deficit. The government has instructed ICBs to reduce their running costs by50% by October this year; the Sussex ICB has to achievecost reductions of 30%by 2025-26. Some ICBs are fading away. The government has introduced “integrated neighbourhood teams”, but the10-year planexplaining what these do still hasn’t been published. In my decades of reporting, the NHS was always on the verge of, or just recovering from, a major reorganisation. No matter how reasonable these might seem, their true cost is never counted. Re-disorganisations “take far longer than you think, end up costing far more than you anticipate, and leave you with a distracted and demoralised workforce,”writes the King’s Fund policy director, Siva Anandaciva.View image in fullscreenPeople working in Whitehawk’s community garden.Photograph: FacebookCost-saving in Whitehawk may be just one accidental fallout of the 2022 reorganisation. After all, the surgery’s privatisation goes against the coming plan to shift health into the community and emphasise social prevention. Greany told me that about 60% of her patients have long-term conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and mental health problems. They have specialfocused care practitionersgiving extra social support.The Sussex ICB told me that national regulations meant it “had to follow an open procurement process, with the ability for all parties with interest in providing services to this community to submit an application”. Otherwise, its spokesperson said, private companies would challenge them in court. But King’s Fund experts told methat there is no obligation for ICBs to tender out existing NHS services – and that they can reject cheaper bids in favour of best “social value”.The “social value” requirement sent most private operators into retreat. The large US company Operose hassold its GP surgeries,while Babylon hascollapsed. Beccy Baird, a primary care expert at the King’s Fund, told me the number of private companies running NHS GP surgeries has fallen by three-quarters since its peak a decade ago: now just 63 practices are run by private companies, amounting to about 1% of all practices across Britain.Labour has stressed its willingness to use private services to clear waiting lists, but this is proving costly. Profits are still being made: just before the election, an ICB let out a huge contractworth up to £1.3bnto the private equity group HCRG Care (once Virgin Care), covering all community services across Bath, north-east Somerset, Wiltshire and Swindon. Meanwhile, long waiting lists are driving patients to buy one-off private treatments. According to the Health Foundation, the overall proportion of privately funded elective operations rose from 7.4% in 2019-20 to 8.3% in 2022-23.Wellsbourne seems to be caught in Lansley’s competition-era time warp. With no experience of writing tenders, its current GPs hadn’t a hope against companies that have entire teams of people who specialise in tender-writing. The GPs have appealed, and the ICB could still change its mind. If not, they could appeal to Whitehall. Their local MP, Chris Ward, is defending them vigorously. “I’m strongly opposed to a for-profit provider replacing a local community one,” he told me. “This is a matter of principal, it’s what theLabourparty stands for.”If this reaches Wes Streeting’s desk, surely he would reverse a decision that flies in the face of his own community policies. Setting that public example would halt other misguided ICBs wrongly still tendering out community services to private companies, and quietly privatising parts of our NHS.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionHealthGPsDoctorsInequalityLabourBrightoncommentShareReuse this content"

It was his “gotcha!” moment after four months of relentless social media attacks, executive orders, boycotts, and threats of economic and diplomatic sanctions.As the video played, a smug Trump claimed it was proof of “white genocide” inSouth Africaand mumbled: “It’s a terrible sight, never seen anything like it.”It was all lies. The crosses in the video did not mark actual graves. It was a memorial made in September 2020 after two white people were killed on their farm a week earlier. The crosses were meant to represent farmers who had been killed over the years. The idea that it is “genocide” has beendebunked so many timesover the past 10 years that it is extraordinary that the US president is not ashamed to repeat it in public. The state department under Trump released areportin late 2020 pointing out that, according to official South African statistics for the 2018-2019 period, “farm killings represented only 0.2 percent of all killings in the country (47 of 21,022)”.Ramaphosa withstood Trump’s bizarre ambush – but he let down South Africans | Zanele MjiRead moreSo here we have a man who has the mighty US state department, the wily Central Intelligence Agency and numerous other resources at his beck and call to help him discern the truth, relying on a badly made propaganda video sourced from aracist, rightwing, anonymous South African X account. Instead of embarrassing Ramaphosa on Wednesday, Trump merely illustrated just how low the US has fallen.His poorly produced Oval Office show, taken with the 28 Februaryattempt to humiliateUkraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, demonstrates that the country is now run by a man so steeped in discredited online conspiracy theories, so uncritical in his thinking, so poor in his grasp of global affairs, so careless in his exercise of power, that it is incredible that he is one of the most powerful figures in the world today. Such a figure’s power heralds instability and even danger for the world.The ambush of Ramaphosa is therefore not just spectacle. It is illumination. It underlines and emphasizes that Trump’s US is a fact-free, science-free, reality-television production lot whose leader daily defies court orders, alienates supporters of democracy, and tries to dismantle key practices such as the right to due process. It is an ugly place in which facts mean nothing and lies reign supreme.I was born under apartheid and lived under that heinous system until it was defeated in 1994. Those first 24 years were lived in Pretoria, in an impoverished village just an hour from Musk’s sumptuous family mansion in the suburb of Waterkloof. When I was teenager I walked the streets of Musk’s suburb, working as a “garden boy” or caddie, constantly harassed by police asking for my “pass book” – papers allowing me to be in the area designated “whites only”.I know apartheid. I grew up with it, breathed it and lived it every day. It is sickening to hear Trump compare the free, non-racist, democratic country that is South Africa today to the violent, murderous, hateful, system declared a “crime against humanity” by the United Nations in 1966.I know South Africa. I grew up in its brutal, cruel, divided past. I thrived in its hopeful democracy. I was one of the chroniclers of itspolitical descent in the 2010sas its institutions came under assault from a leader with anti-democratic instincts. I visited my mother there last week. There is no genocide in South Africa. Yet, Trump recently posted on hisTruth Socialthat he would not visit South Africa for the G20 summit when “white genocide” was happening there. Just more than 430,000 Americansvisited South Africa in 2023, up 37.4% from 2022. I know of not a single one who can point to a genocide happening in the country.This is the president of the United States peddling lies.One is therefore not surprised by the numerous assaults on the American constitution by this administration. The kidnapping of student activists, the trampling upon of citizens’ constitutional rights, the assaults on institutions such as the judiciary, the shamelessness ofpoliticians and their families and croniesenriching themselves – all this is typical of these kinds of corrupt regimes.What is going on in America? Kseniia Petrova, the Harvard Medical School researcherheld for monthsin Louisiana for failing to declare samples of frog embryos she had carried from France at the request of her boss,toldthe New York Times: “I feel like something is happening generally in America … Something bad is happening. I don’t think everybody understands.”Petrova, who fled Putin’s murderous regime as darkness fell over Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, understands the profound cloud hanging over the US. Those of us who grew up in regimes such as apartheid understand this ominous period.Trump’s actions are scary enough. It is, however, the silence of the US asassaults on American constitutional principlesunfold that is most disturbing.This is not a lament for SouthAfricaand how badly it is being treated by the US. It is a lament for myself, for those of us who grew up under systems such as apartheid believing that the US would uphold the rule of law, stand up for truth and speak up for these principles, and for a better world. A monarchical Trump, defying the supreme court and abandoning fact-based decision-making, imperils it all. With every student bundled by masked men into a van, this vaunted republic becomes smaller, lesser. It becomes Putin’s Russia, it becomes something akin to the way I lived under apartheid – a place where a contrarian thought led to detention without trial, to disappearance and for many, to death.There was a telling moment in Wednesday’s interaction when Trump revealed himself. It was a moment which reminded one that corruption, or the smell of it, now sits in the White House. Trump had just referred to a reporter as a “jerk” and an “idiot” because he had confronted him about why he wasaccepting the “gift”of a jet from Qatar to use as Air Force One.The Guardian view on the US and South Africa: Trump looks to his base and partners look elsewhere | EditorialRead more“Why did a country give an airplane to the United States air force? So they could help us out, because we need an Air Force One,” Trump fumed.Ramaphosa quipped: “I’m sorry I don’t have a plane to give you.”Trump didn’t detect the disdain in Ramaphosa’s voice and doubled down on the corruption inherent in accepting such a gift.“I wish you did. I would take it. If your country offered the United States air force a plane, I would take it,” Trump said.And there was the emperor, naked: an unethical leader who worships the dollar and has no concept of how corrupt his actions look to the rest of the world. This is what Wednesday was all about: an America led by a man susceptible to lies and lacking in a moral centre.Wednesday was not about South Africa. It was all about America today.Justice Malala is a political commentator and author of The Plot To Save South Africa: The Week Mandela Averted Civil War and Forged a New NationExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionSouth AfricaCyril RamaphosaAfricaUS politicsUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

I was not invited toLauren Sánchez’s hen do, and Jeff Bezos’s bride-to-be and her gang of close personal brunettes have now returned from their £500,000 jaunt and are recovering – I imagine in solid-gold flotation tanks in a mansion’s solid-gold flotation tank room – without me.They took a private chartered champagne boat ride down the Seine (or possibly up the Seine – are you going to make me admit again that I wasn’t there?), drank espresso martinis at Galeries Lafayette’s restaurant and documented every moment on Instagram so the rest of us could gaze in awe and wonder if hen partying as a billionaire’s fiancee’s friend is any less hateful than doing it the normal way.It is, I suppose, likely that if you are a Kardashian or an Eva Longoria or Katy Perry, as so many of the guests were, you are more extrovert and naturally gregarious than average, but it remains a pleasure to imagine that when the gilded invitation dropped through the letterbox the girls’ reaction was the universal one: a muttered “WTF does Bridezilla want now?”, a resentful locating of a wheelie suitcase and some mid-tier underwear to throw into it, and a vow never to agree to this kind of thing ever again.View image in fullscreen‘I think we just became dangerously cool, messieurs.

Her most (in)famous piece of Goop merch, a candle launched on her lifestyle website in 2020 under the name This Smells Like My Vagina for the not inconsiderable sum of $75, is now selling on eBay for the even more not inconsiderable sum of $400 (£295).And all my questions of five years ago come flooding back, including but not limited to: does the name mean that the candle smells like GP’s own? Or is it meant to evoke the essence of all? Is there an essential vagina smell? Is it the one we hear all the jokes about, and, if so, why would you want to perfume your house with that? Furthermore, who was in charge of ensuring that the scent was accurate enough to forestall claims of misrepresentation? Did they get a bonus payment or was it a privilege fought over by a worryingly devoted few? So strange to have so many questions burning brightly in my mind still, and yet somehow not quite want any of them answered.WednesdayI visited one of the oldest windows in London today. It looks like it is made of glass but is actually 15th-century cow horn, shaved to a translucent fineness. It is in the Great Hall of London’s Guildhall, and you should go and look around the whole thing immediately. Descend into the medieval crypt dating back to at least the 13th, and possibly the 11th, century and see the gouges at the bases of the pillars where the horses stabled there at times over the centuries have kicked them.Go to the art gallery and take in a Canaletto or a Constable or two. Look at the enormous royal coat of arms that was salvaged from Christopher Wren’s St Michael Bassishaw church when it was demolished in about 1897 (though take care because there’s a statue of Margaret Thatcher just a few yards on and I know we all need to be mentally prepared). And then, down some steps, 8 metres under the surface of the city, see the remains of the Roman amphitheatre that were discovered during the building of the underground car park that now lies on the other side of them.I was shown around by friends of my late dad, whom I very much consider myself to have inherited and won’t let any of the rest of my family have, and it made me think anew about how wonderful London is and how wonderful the people are who want to share its secrets with you.View image in fullscreen‘This old prune of a rocker says: “Love ya, Donald!”’ Bruce Springsteen leaving the Stock Exchange hotel in Manchester on Saturday.

What are you going to do when you need – yes, need – to indicate a pause in print slightly longer than a comma, slightly shorter than a full stop? How are you going to yoke together two separate but related clauses in a way that suggests exactly that liminal state? How are you going to avoid a comma splice when duty calls? Come on, people. If we can preserve Roman amphitheatres and the passage of medieval horses for the delight and education of future generations, we can do this too.FridayIt’s the end of the week so time for my mother to eat again. She works mostly off diesel but needs the occasional nutrient to get by. Dad used to do all the cooking but stopped a couple of years ago when he died. So every Friday she rings me (my sister just blows a whistle down the phone if she tries calling her) and we have conversations like this:“Did you say I should put salt in pasta?”“Yes.”“Why?”“Because that’s what gives it what we call ‘a taste’.”“Do I have to?”“You don’t HAVE to. The pasta will still get soft and in that sense be edible if you don’t.”“If I boil the water.”“Yes. Yes, if you boil the water. But it will be an unhappier experience than if you had put salt in.”“It’s a lot of faff.”“Is it really, though? It’s adding a teaspoonful of salt to a pan of water. People do it all the time, often almost without thinking, so automatic does this small action become.”“I’ll think about it.”“You do that.”I’m off to buy a whistle.Explore more on these topicsCelebrityDigested weekGwyneth PaltrowHeritagecommentShareReuse this content"

Why aren’t Gazans being protected in the same way?Fri 23 May 2025 14.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 14.01 EDTShareOn 20 May, the secretary-general for humanitarian affairs at the United Nations stated that 14,000 babies would bedeadunless the blockade was lifted immediately. The day before, the former Knesset member Moshe Feiglinsaid: “Every child inGazais the enemy.” And now, world leaders in the UK and Francethreatenvague “concrete actions” ifIsrael“does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid”. But undefined “concrete actions” are woefully insufficient. To those leaders I say: Gaza’s children cannot eat statements.Bezalel Smotrich,the Israeli finance minister,declared last week:“We are destroying everything in Gaza, the world isn’t stopping us.” So let’s say what must be said, without apology: military intervention to defend Gaza is not only justified – it is required. It is humanitarian. It is overdue. Israel must be stopped.A no-fly zone must be set up around Gaza to prevent further aerial bombing; and a coalition of willing states should come together to form a corridor to 1) end Israel’s colonial mechanism that is set totake 65%of Gaza’s land and 2) allow for the immediate dispersal of humanitarian aid. Military intervention should not merely be aimed at pausing the killing – it should be used to protect Palestinians’ right to exist as a people, with dignity, sovereignty and full unconditional control over their land and futures.The Guardian view on the calls to save Gaza: Palestinians need deeds, not words | EditorialRead moreThe latest UN announcement about the risk to Gazan babies follows others from the Israeli prime minister’s office that make Israel’s intention to destroy Gaza unmistakably clear. On the recommendation of the Israeli army, theysaidthey would allow in a “basic amount of food” to the south of Gaza – but not out of mercy, not to save lives. The stated reason: to prevent famine from undermining the coming ground invasion, to clear space for “intense fighting”. In other words, aid would be permitted only to fuel further ethnic cleansing. Food not as relief, but as relocation. Nutrition as a tool for displacement. Netanyahu claimed that international pressure, including from pro-Israel Republican senators and the White House, required the appearance of humanitarian intervention. “Our best friends in the world – senators I know as strong supporters of Israel – have warned that they cannot support us if images of mass starvation emerge,” hesaid.Israel recognizes that their mass extermination can only continue as long as world leaders are able to forego any criticism for allowing starvation, they allow the world to absolve their guilt so long as Gazans can be bombed with quarter-full stomachs. But world leaders cannot claim ignorance now. After all, Netanyahugavehis Amalek speech on 28 October 2023, in which he said the “entire people” of Gaza are “an evil” and that Israel is “committed to eradicating this evil from the world”. Intentions were always clear.It came days after thelaunchof Operation Gideon’s Chariots, a military campaign named after a biblical flood. The leaflets dropped over Gaza showed parted waters swallowing buildings, the Star of David glowing like a weapon. A “righteous conquest”, they called it. This is not subtle. This is a manufactured to make genocide look like a holy war. It is genocide marketed as prophecy. And still, no western leader has intervened to stop this madness.But here we are. Counting the dead and then doubting them. Watching 61,700 people be exterminated while the world argues about food trucks. And still – still – they tell us that help is coming. That humanitarian aid is arriving. That the system is working.Let’s be honest. Humanitarian aid is not arriving. Law is not arriving. The only thing arriving in Gaza is morebombs.What did you do during the genocide in Gaza? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreWe have tried the petitions. We have written the letters. We triedpeaceful protests and encampments. We have submitted the evidence. We have watched the Geneva conventions recited like prayer, while their every clause is violated. We have waited for the ICC to act while the United States rushesmore weaponsto the border. We have watched food convoysbombed, aid workersexecuted, newbornsstarved. We are not unreasonable. We are simply not willing to die politely.Military intervention is not some imperial fantasy we borrow from the west. It is a mechanism built into the very structure of international law.Article Iof the genocide convention requires states not only to punish genocide but to prevent it. The responsibility to protect doctrine (R2P), adopted in 2005 by every member of the United Nations, asserts that when a state is “manifestly failing” to protect its population – or, as in our case, actively trying to destroy it – other states are obligated to intervene, not encouraged, obligated.And yes, there is precedent. In Kosovo, Natointervenedin 1999 after mass killings and the threat of further ethnic cleansing. In East Timor, a multinational forcedeployedto halt atrocities committed by militias supported by the Indonesian army. In Libya, security council resolution 1973authorizedmilitary action “to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas under threat of attack”. Each time, the world acknowledged that force was the only viable form of protection. That sovereignty could not shield slaughter. That delay meant graves.So why not now? Why not for Palestinians? Is it that our children starve too quietly? That our bodies do not make for good television? Is it because the bombs are labeled “Made in America”?No one is asking for occupation. No one is asking for invasion in the name of oil, democracy or flags. We are asking for survival. We are asking for the same intervention that has been carried out for others when the death toll passed a certain threshold.Gazais not asking to be exceptional. Gaza is asking not to be abandoned.Military intervention is not violence – it is what stops violence. It is not the failure of law – it is its fulfillment. And it is the last remaining form of aidIsraelhas not managed to bomb, blockade or twist into a weapon of war. Airdropping rice into craters is not aid. Aid is removing the cause of the starvation. Aid is opening the checkpoints, not filming them. Aid is armored vehicles securing corridors for ambulances that no longer have to lie about their destinations to avoid being blown apart. Aid is ending the killing – not watching it with subtitles.If aid doesn’t enter Gaza now, 14,000 babies may die. UN peacekeepers must step in | Michael FakhriRead moreBecause at some point, the diplomatic language stops sounding like caution and starts sounding like complicity. And if the people who write the laws will not enforce them, then we must conclude what Palestinians have always suspected: international law is an illusion and one not meant for us.Before October 2023, I never thought I would see a father carrying the parts of his son in a bag. I never thought I’d hear a child whisper from beneath rubble, her voice small, her terror enormous: “Come get me.” I never thought I’d watch families burn in white tents outside bombed hospitals, or find toddlers swollen from hunger in the arms of mothers too weak to weep. I never thought I’d see doctors stitch wounds without anesthesia, perform amputations with kitchen knives, sterilize blades with cigarette lighters. I never thought I’d live through the genocide of my people was broadcast live – and still called “complicated”.But if there is still a use for law, if there is still any value to the wordhumanitarian, then act like it. The last aid left is force. Gaza cannot wait any longer.Ahmad Ibsais is a first-generation Palestinian American, law student and poet who writes the newsletter State of SiegeExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warOpinionGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuUnited NationscommentShareReuse this content"

This inequality has been tolerated partly becausegreedhas been rehabilitated asvirtue. The Billionaire Britain report, publishedthis weekby the Equality Trust, reveals what many instinctively feel but few in parliament will admit: the UK economy has become a machine for the upward redistribution of wealth.Using Sunday Times Rich List data, the reportfoundthat the 50 wealthiest UK families now own more than the poorest half of the population combined. Their opulence is no accident. It’s largely built on the labour and consumption of those 34 million other Britons. The gains of society are being hoarded by those least in need. There’s alexiconthat sells it all as “entrepreneurial spirit” and business dynamism. But the very markets that reward the wealthiest so handsomely are constructed and policed by the state. Governments entrench intellectual property rights, strengthen legal monopolies and write policies that benefit banks andasset markets.Austerity was imposed on the many, even as a decade of quantitative easing createdfiscal spacethat could have been used for public good. Instead it enriched the already wealthy by inflating property andshareprices while tax cutsbenefitedthe rich. A smallcorrectionto pandemic-driven gains for the billionaire class signifies no major shift. Their fortunes are 10 times larger today than they were in 1990.Louis XIV’s finance ministersaidgood tax policy plucks the most feathers with the least hissing. It was suggested that the government’s small-scale tax rises had triggered a full-blown squawk. More than 10,000 millionaires, it wasreported, had fled the UK in 2024. The source? Not actual migration data, but a firm selling second passports to the nervous rich. It is hard to not think such a company feeds on tax panic. Its numbers appear more astutemarketingthan solid evidence. Labour should be immune to such public relations stunts.Billionaires do not emerge in a vacuum. They are the product ofdeliberatechoices. Property speculation, inheritance laws and tax avoidance schemes are not spontaneous market outcomes. They are often lobbied for by people with access to government, on behalf of those who stand to profit. It’s no accident, then, that over aquarter of UK billionairesbuilt their wealth through property and inheritance, and another quarter through finance – sectors that rely on rent extraction more than innovation.The rich get richer because political leaders protect that growth – often in service of their ownambitions. A Britain governed in the public interest must not defer to a plutocratic class. There needs to be a break with the current model. Politicians could, as a start, take up Tax Justice UK’s idea for a 2%wealth taxon assets over £10m. Campaigners say this would raise £24bn annually – enough to begin repairing broken Britain. Oxfam says78%of the public would support such a progressive levy.Yet such proposals are still framed as radical. What’s radical is that monopoly profits end up in private hands while the state can’t fund public services. It is inescapably true that the rules have been written to benefit a tiny elite. They can be rewritten. If not, then the cost to society risks being paid inpopulist anger, democratic decay and a long-term loss of trust.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Soon afterwards, Russia’s Sputnik service began broadcasting on the frequency left vacant in Lebanon. That detail illuminates a larger picture. China, Russia and others see global-facing media as central to their global ambitions and are investing accordingly – pumping out propaganda to muddle or drown out objective, independently minded journalism. These outlets are state-controlled as well as state-owned.Meanwhile, conspiracy theories and disinformation proliferate online,attacks on press freedom intensifyand the Trump administration isdismantling media organisationsincluding Voice of America and Radio Free Asia (RFA), which have been essential sources of information for audiences under repressive regimes. Official Chinese mediawere gleefulat what RFA’s president, Bay Fang, called “a reward to dictators and despots”.The BBC World Service, and its accurate reporting borne of deep knowledge of places, has rarely been needed more. At its best it is a beacon of truth in times of war and crisis, as well aslife-transforming for listenersin a myriad less dramatic ways. Yet it is already scrabbling to compete with lavishly funded foreign rivals for both audiences and resources. The government boosted its contribution for 2025-26, but is now asking the BBC toidentify tens of millions of pounds’ worth of cutsover the next few years. Since 2014, the World Service has been primarily funded by the licence fee. But the government contribution is mostly funded from official development assistance, which Sir Keir Starmeris slashingto increase defence spending. Even an alternative budget, with funding remaining flat in cash terms, would make deep cuts inevitable when global inflation is running at well over 4%.The World Service faces tricky decisions too. Most future users are unlikely to come via radio, but shortwave services remain central in some areas and can reach listeners even when internet access is cut. The decision to axe Arabic radio services looked all the more ill-judged in light of wars in Gaza andSudan. Bosses are struggling to balance the competing demands to constrain spending, ensure reach and maintain standards of quality and depth. One current pilot is alow-budget model in Polish, which will mostly repurpose existing BBC journalism.In the long run, the BBC argues that the governmentshould fully resumeWorld Service funding. That sounds more like a negotiating position than a serious prospect. What is absolutely clear is that it needs more money to compete, not less, and a long-term settlement. Its authority depends on the capacity and institutional memory it has established, and the fact that it is not seen to respond to the imperatives of the government of the day: it represents national values, not a politician’s fiat. Those are all imperilled when it must battle over money year by year. Once weakened, it will not easily recover.Research conducted for the BBC found it to be the UK’s most recognised cultural export internationally – ahead of the Premier League and British universities. Its hundreds of millions of usersare more likely to favour the UK, as well as more likely to support democracy. The World Service is a precious and irreplaceable asset. The former UN secretary general Kofi Annanonce described itas “perhaps Britain’s greatest gift to the world” in the 20th century. But the giver enjoys rich returns, and would be foolish to squander them.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We’d back ourselves against anybody’Donald McRaeEngland and Lions fly-half on run to Champions Cup final, controlling his inner demons and playing junior tennis alongside Jack DraperFri 23 May 2025 15.00 EDTShare“Iwas always angry,” Fin Smith remembers as he explains his transition from a volatile young tennis player into the decisively calm fly-half for Northampton, England and the Lions who is as serene as he is interesting. Smith has had a remarkable year so far but there is an understated lightness about him as he recalls playing in tennis tournaments alongsideJack Draper, the current world No 5.“As an 11-year-old tennis player I was very angry,” he says at Franklin’s Gardens, having just completed Northampton Saints’ final training session before they faceBordeaux on Saturday in the Champions Cup final. “I used to blow up and smash rackets a lot. But getting that out of my system at a young age, while facing set points and match points, can only benefit me when I’m playing rugby under pressure and really taking on an internal battle.”We will return to his racket-wielding past but the way he has controlled his inner demons and found tranquillity is even more intriguing. Smith turned 23 this month but he sounds like a sage old soul when comparing his preparations for a European final in Cardiff with that of his young teammateHenry Pollockwho, in a few months, has become a rugby sensation.While Pollock watches Conor McGregor videos, Smith is writing a thesis on decision-making in domestic households as he completes his degree in economics and mathematical sciences next week. His academic work is part of the reason why Smith has shed an obsessive past to find a healthier balance on and off the field.He recalls a landmark conversation which made him understand how damaging it was to be consumed by sport. “I remember saying to a sports psychologist, Andrea Furst: ‘This is what I’m struggling with. Whenever I make mistakes they really get me down and I can’t look past them. In my head I’m either the greatest or the worst player ever.’“She asked me about my routine and I said: ‘I quite often watch rugby after training, and maybe in bed before I go to sleep.’ She went ‘Ah-ha!’ and laughed and put her finger on it straight away. She said: ‘You don’t ever let your mind rest. You need to let the battery recharge.’ It wasn’t until then that I realised [being consumed] had been a massive factor.”View image in fullscreenFin Smith will be a key player for Northampton in their Champions Cup final.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersSmith’s now trademark calm was evident during his first start for England against France in February. England had lost seven out of their previous nine Tests when Smith was given the No 10 shirt. He began badly and his first kick was charged down by Grégory Alldritt – but Smith retained his composure andsteered England to a pulsating victoryand, then, four successive wins.“I spoke to my parents and friends afterwards and they said: ‘Oh my God, you must have been terrified after that [difficult start].’ But I was really proud of myself. I was pretty relaxed and had a laugh with Ollie Lawrence and said: ‘Fucking hell, that wasn’t good, was it?’ I just got stuck into the next thing which was to make the best decision possible with the ball in my hands. You’ve got to focus on the little moments as they add up to a positive impact … I like to think that, in the majority of situations, I feel super-calm.”But he retains the spikiness that studded his early years in tennis for he makes it clear how much he is driven by criticism. He is also spurred on by comparisons with his namesakes – Marcus Smith, his friend whom he replaced as England’s fly-half and Finn Russell, the gifted Scottish playmaker who will be his rival for the Lions’ No 10 shirt in Australia.Rival fans have called him “the shit Smith” or “the poor Fin[n]” and he says: “It’s all good fun. That’s why I enjoy reading in the media about, ‘Oh, Saints have got no chance’ or ‘Why have they picked him at 10 for England?’ I love all that because it pushes me and gives me more reason to go hard.”Northampton were dismissed as having little hope against Leinster, who comprise virtually the entire Ireland team, in the Champions Cup semi-final in Dublin. “We used it as fuel to the fire and trained incredibly hard,” Smith says. “We’ve got some brilliant players and the fact no one gave us a chance was great. We love being written off because we’d back ourselves against anybody. It formed a decent part of why we managed to get over the line [andbeat Leinster 37-34].”Did Smith, an admirable team player, also regard the game as a straight shootout between him and Sam Prendergast, Ireland’s No 10, for a place in the Lions squad? “100%. I was focusing on the team and trying to play as well as I can for them, but I was definitely in a big personal match-up as the two of us were in contention for the Lions. That can be dangerous because you can force things and chase special moments to try and outdo your opposite man. But I must admit I was watching [Prendergast] every time he kicked at goal, thinking, ‘It will be interesting to see if this goes over.’ You keep that at the back of your mind while making sure it drives you on competitively.”Smith and his parents were reduced to speechless tears when he called them soon after he had heard his name being announced as a Lion – which he describes as “one the few things in sport that’s so raw and authentic.” His closeness to his Scottish mum and dad was reinforced by the fact that his maternal grandfather, Tom Elliot, had also played for the Lions in 1955.View image in fullscreenFin Smith has relished Northampton proving people wrong during their run to the final in Cardiff.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAFour years before Smith was born, his grandad died from motor neurone disease. Smith remembers how he and his brother Angus still wore his Lions blazer, shirt and cap as small boys. They also came to understand his courage. “As a family,” Smith says, “MND is very close to us so we always try and support people suffering with it whenever we can. I think he fought the disease off for over eight years after he got told he had only a little while to live. My mum speaks so fondly still of his funeral and how people were piling out of the church and filling up the car park just to catch a glimpse of him for one last time and celebrate his life.”Has Smith watched any footage of that 1955 Lions tour of South Africa? “I’ve seen a two-second video of him taking someone’s head off with a high tackle. That’s the only clip they managed to find and it made me laugh.He was a prop but a similar size to me. He just hadmassive hands and proper farmer strength so I’m sure he would have battered me.”Smith attended thefirst Lions get-together in Richmondlast Sunday and his face lights up. “It was cool and meeting everyone was class while hearing [head coach] Andy Farrell talk about the tour made me realise the magnitude – as well as the hype and buzz around it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Getting to know him is going to be awesome as he’s a real competitor.”How is the 20-year-old Pollock feeling as, having made only one appearance for England, when he came off the bench to score two tries against Wales, he has also been selected for the Lions? “I don’t know,” Smith says wryly. “He’s a freak and a weirdo. I don’t know if he does get nervous but he watches a lot of motivational videos of Conor McGregor and David Goggins. I wonder if he just tries to use those things to push the nerves away.”View image in fullscreenThe fly-half has juggled his rugby commitments with a degree in economics and mathematical sciences.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe wild rise of Pollock is welcomed by Smith who knows how badly rugby needs new stars to reach a wider audience. “100%. He’s done so much for rugby already – it’s mad.”Smith jokes: “He’s probably played 10 games and only about five of them have been good. But the hype around him has been amazing and you see how much that does for rugby. He’s being talked about so much and the more characters we can get, the better.”In contrast to Pollock’s motivational videos, Smith’s university dissertation sounds as thoughtful as it is diligent. “It’s about decision-making in households, the way you balance paid and unpaid work and why that might be. It’s a lot about the gender pay gap and it’s quite interesting. The only problem is that it’s due next Tuesday. That date is set-in-stone so it’s bad timing. But that’s the nature of trying to balance the degree and playing in a European final.”Smith smiles. “I really should have got ahead of it but I maybe didn’t think we’d beat Leinster. If all goes well on Saturday I imagine I’ll be in a different world on Sunday. Then I have to sober up as quickly as I can and mail the degree out on Monday.”His research included “interviewing loads of different couples of different ages about who wears the trousers and why that is. My conclusion is that younger couples are far more hybrid in terms of both working, both helping out around the house whereas some of the older couples will be very much the man is the head of house and everyone else tries to help him earn as much money as possible.”Smith says that, because of his love of maths and economics, he would like to one day work as an investment banker but his teammates are convinced he will become a coach. “They all call me a mini-Sam Vesty,” he says of Northampton’s head coach – but I wonder if, having been in the top 10 of British junior rankings, Smith might have made it as a tennis player?“Probably not. Even at 11 there was a big gap between myself and the top guys like Jack Draper [who was a year older] and Jacob Fearnley [whobeat Nick Kyrgios at this year’s Australian Open]. I played Jacob once and he battered me. I never actually played Jack but we were in a lot of the same tournaments. He always won everything.His dad [Roger] was head of the LTA so he was always the main man.”It’s striking that, on the eve of the European final and close to a Lions tour, Smith should feel an affinity with a tennis player: Novak Djokovic. “In a weird way I found him relatable. Some tennis players are incredibly gifted. Look at Federer and Alcaraz. But I loved Djokovic because he’s probably not the best at any shot or the best athlete. His mentality and how hard he works have been key in getting him to the top. I loved that he showed you don’t need to be the most naturally gifted. Of course he has an amazing talent, and I’ve got some natural gifts as well, but hard work and really dialling into something is always going to win.”Explore more on these topicsChampions CupNorthamptonBordeaux BèglesRugby unioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

The Euros final was fairly level to this in terms of testing my ability to manage the emotions of the day and occasion. I’m just going to enjoy it.Barcelona are big Women’s Champions League final favourites despite ‘worst’ seasonRead more“If I think that the fact that I’m an Arsenal fan is going to get in the way I have to shift, because that’s not my focus for the day – my job is to be a player, a player that wants to do it for the fan in me.”Williamson’s fandom and playing career have been intertwined from the moment she sidestepped her dad’s attempts to get her to support Tottenham. That included a trip to White Hart Lane and a new shirt that she had to take off before she got home; instead she chose their north London rivals, the team of her mum and grandma. On Saturday, it is her dad who will be donning a new shirt, having made a bet with her that if she ever got to a Champions League final with Arsenal, he would wear one.This may be the centre-back’s first European final, but it’s not her first wearing red and white, however. Looking down at the photograph of her 10-year-old self dressed in an oversized kit and clutching a mini football, Williamson grins. As a mascot for the second leg of the 2007 European Cup final, Williamson lined up alongside her under-10s teammates and a few other girls to witness an achievement that has become the benchmark for English clubs.View image in fullscreenThe Arsenal mascots before the second leg of the Women’s Uefa Cup final between Arsenal Women and Umeå in Borehamwood, England, in April 2007. Leah Williamson is sixth.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty Images“That’s my kit that I had to wash and wear again and again, but I loved it; it was something that was my own. I was just so happy to be part of Arsenal,” she says. “We had long-sleeved shirts if it was cold and if it was hot you just rolled them up. I broke my arm in my first game for Arsenal and when we got to the hospital, the woman said she was going to have to cut it off. I wanted a cast, as you do when you’re a kid, so I was saying it was painful but I switched to: ‘No. I’m fine. That’s OK. I’ll get it out.’ I wouldn’t let her cut it. It was broken, but I treasured that kit.”That European final was played at Boreham Wood FC’s Meadow Park, where her mum used to help out on the turnstiles; it was a sunny day and the small terraces were packed. Williamson did not quite understand the magnitude of the fixture – the first, and to date only, European triumph by an English women’s club – instead she was a little upset because they walked on to the pitch with Arsenal’s opponents, Umeå. “I wasn’t very happy about that,” she says.Seven years later, Williamson made her senior debut playing alongside some of Arsenal’s quadruple winners. “That for me was always the most humbling thing, playing with people that I idolised,” she says. “At one point they seemed so far away and then all of a sudden you’re in the same training session and you’re basically trying to not let them down.”Arsenal play their Women’s Super League (WSL) and Champions League home games at the 60,704‑seat Emirates Stadium, which displays a huge wraparound tribute to the 2006-07 quadruple winners next to the men’s Invincibles side. It depicts the players hoisting a giant European Cup with red ribbons while the men lift a gold Premier League trophy. “Whenever I approach the stadium it’s just there and I’mvery proud to be at a club that is as proud of them as I am,” says Williamson. “It’s also a reminder of the heights they reached and that incredible level of performance the club should aspire to be at. That’s the point of it all, to inspire people to climb higher.”View image in fullscreenArsenal scarves for sale in the images of Bukayo Saka, Beth Mead and Leah Williamson.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersDoes the weight of that legacy add pressure to the 2025 Champions League finalists? “It should do, but I don’t feel like it has,” she says. “It’s a fantastic opportunity and another step closer to getting the club back to winning ways, that’s how it’s seen by us, which is probably why the pressure doesn’t creep in.”Arsenal’s end to the domestic season was hardly consistent. After a thrilling 4-1 defeat of Lyon to overturn a 2-1 loss in the first leg of the semi-final, there were back-to-back defeats by Aston Villa and Brighton, losing 5-2 and 4-2 respectively, before securing second place in the WSL with a 4-3 win over Manchester United on the final day.“If we’d won those games I’d say to you: ‘It’s great preparation,’ and in losing those games I’ll say to you: ‘It’s great preparation, you just have to use it,’” says Williamson. “We had an opportunity against United to go out and to correct some of the things that had gone wrong in the previous games. Do I think there was a little bit of a hangover? Not mentally, in terms of concentration or commitment to the game, we prepared properly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I just think it was a concoction of a lot of different things, a little bit of rotation, a little bit of the unexpected, and then playing teams that are fresher is going to have an impact, but that’s not the standard we’re happy with.”Beating United at the Emirates Stadium was a chance to put things right. “The firepower that we showed, we looked like ourselves,” says Williamson. “I know they scored two late goals, but the nature of them is less concerning than those conceded in the other games. When you look at it holistically, we had a big task ahead of us to turn our form around and to re-engage with the fans at home after what they’ve done for us this season.”Despite having come from behind in the quarter- and semi-finals, Arsenal are the underdogs facing the holders and three-time champions, so knowing the likelihood of things not going their way at some point must be high.View image in fullscreenLeah Williamson is aiming high against Barcelona. ‘Getting to the final is an achievement and everybody should be happy about that, but we go there to win.’Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“It’s the one thing that you can’t force in football, that belief that you can turn it around, and it has to be organic and authentic,” says Williamson. “You don’t have it unless you’ve shown yourself that you have it.“You could argue that we’ve put ourselves in positions that we shouldn’t have, but ultimately to be able to turn it around and demonstrate to ourselves that we can overturn things means we have that inside us now – that belief, that calmness, and the comfort in being uncomfortable and just trusting.”That belief is liberating, but so is the feeling of being in a final. “A semi-final is hard because you’re not at the last step, there’s still another hurdle, but when you go to a final, you go free,” says Williamson. “That’s normally why you see the best football.“Getting to the final is an achievement, of course it is, and everybody should be happy about that, but we go there to win. That’s the only focus. I’m proud of everything we’ve achieved thus far and I hope no matter what happens there’s a performance to be proud of in the final.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueArsenal WomenWomen's footballBarcelona WomeninterviewsShareReuse this content"

I feel like I’m very well backed here. I’m well backed in county cricket as well, but I feel like England cricket is my happy place.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That the match is as close as it is is largely down to an outstanding contribution from another 21-year-old, the opener Brian Bennett. “To be honest I didn’t know much about him,” Bashir admitted, “but I think the way he was playing, we knew he was a very good player.”Bennett said he was inspired by seeingThursday’s centurionsbeing added to the honours board as he came into the ground before the start of play. “I saw them putting up their names so I thought it would be nice to be on there as well,” he said. “And a few hours later my name’s up there.

On Friday night at Hove they sealed their T20 series against West Indies with a nine-wicket win, thanks to a three-wicket haul by new-kid-on-the-block Em Arlott and a captain’s innings of 55 not out from their new skipper, Nat Sciver-Brunt.The 27-year-old Warwickshire seamer Arlott, having been handed her England cap just 48 hours previously, apparently impressed Charlotte Edwards, the new coach, so much on debut that she was promoted to open the bowling from the Sea End. She subsequently sent down a consecutive four-over spell of such accuracy that it yielded just 14 runs, despite three of the overs being inside the powerplay.“I was told: ‘You’ll have one in the powerplay and go from there and adjust,’” Arlott said. “It went well, so we carried on. I didn’t imagine I’d bowl four on the trot.”England’s notably-improved fielding helped Arlott out – Charlie Dean held onto Stafanie Taylor at extra cover, while Sophia Dunkley plucked a screamer out of the air with her left hand at midwicket – but the key intervention was Arlott’s second ball of the day, which shaped nicely into Hayley Matthews and bowled Wednesday’s centurion through the gate.“She was stood miles down leg stump,” Arlott said. “It was just adjusting my line and creating that angle back into her.”View image in fullscreenWest Indies' Hayley Matthews is bowled by England's Em Arlott.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAThat scalp was tantamount to sealing victory for England just four overs into the game: West Indies limped on, and even survived their 20 overs, but scraped together just 81 runs. Dean struck twice in two balls in the 14th over, breaking the slow-burn partnership of 34 from 51 balls between Shemaine Campbelle and Shabika Gajnabi as an exasperated Campbelle tried to go over the top and Arlott topped off her evening by snaffling the chance on the boundary rope.Arlott, who would likely have made her debut in 2022 against South Africa had it not been for an untimely bout of Covid, said the three-year wait had made her even keener to seize her chance. “It’s felt like a long time coming, so I didn’t want to get to the opportunity and then let it get the better of me,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve always struggled going into newer teams and not knowing people. In the winter, I went to Perth and I didn’t know anybody, and made myself do something uncomfortable. And actually it’s been really nice that a lot of people have come up to me being like: ‘You’re a different person than you were 12 months ago.’“I think I’m more content with who I am and not really caring how people take that. I’m really proud of myself for getting to this point.”England had strolled to a win on Wednesday, but this run-chase was more of a canter: an 82-run partnership between Sciver-Brunt and Dunkley sealed the deal with more than 10 overs to spare. Dunkley continued her form from the first T20, once again nailing the reverse sweep, while Sciver-Brunt’s placement was spot-on in an innings which – for now at least – should put to bed any concerns that the burden of the captaincy might affect her form with the bat.The only note of concern for England will be the continued poor form of Danni Wyatt-Hodge, who was bowled for a first-ball duck by Zaida James. Edwards may well be tempted to swap in Tammy Beaumont at the top of the order for the third and final T20, at Chelmsford on Monday.Explore more on these topicsWomen's cricketEngland women's cricket teamWest Indies WomenCricketmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The hope is that a decent percentage of the 80,000 Wembley crowd will be inspired to acquire this vital skill.Following Sheffield United in the hope of playoff success is a lifetime of hurtRead moreIf Lockyer’s presence places the losing finalists’ pain in important context, two managers who, in different ways, have breathed fresh life into their clubs will be desperate to avoid missing out on at least £220m in additional income next season. That is the prize awaiting the winner of football’s so-called richest game in the Premier League’s promised land.While United’s Chris Wilder has achieved five promotions with four clubs during a career embracing almost every level of English football’s pyramid, Régis Le Bris remains a relative novice.Not that a 49-year-old Frenchman who has spent most of his working life as a youth coach and became a manager – at Lorient – three years ago can be underestimated after his startling rejuvenation of an unusually young squad.For far too long playoffs have felt impossibly high altitude for a United side who havenever won promotion this way, losing four finals. Wilder has addressed theproblem by reminding his players that the Wembley air is really not all that thin and maintaining that history is bunk. His hopes of avoiding another demoralising repetition of the past should be enhanced by Gustavo Hamer’s presence. Two years ago the Brazil-born attacking midfielder scored for Coventry against Luton at Wembley and, as the Championship player of the season, he possesses the confidence and class to alter the Blades’ playoff story.View image in fullscreenRégis Le Bris said Sunderland must seize their opportunity.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersWhatever the result, the occasion will be poignant for everyone connected to United. “We’re incredibly sad George is not with us,” said Wilder, remembering the team’s much-loved former right-back George Baldock. The Greece defenderdrowned in his swimming poolin Athens last autumn, shortly after joining Panathinaikos.Baldock, known as “Starman”, was a big favourite at Bramall Lane who twice played an integral part in helping United win promotion to the top tier. “We’ve tried not to use George’s death as a motivational tool,” Wilder said last week. “But his spirit has been with us on the journey. His old shirt has always been in our dressing room, home or away, this season. As a player, and a person as well, George was incredibly driven, always wanting to be the best.”United’s hopes of holding their own at elite level were boosted in December when five financially challenged years under the ownership of Saudi Arabia’s Prince Abdullah were ended by a takeover.It placed a club relegated from the Premier League last spring under the control of COH Sports, a US-based consortium that immediately extended Wilder’s contract and bankrolled seven January signings including Ben Brereton Díaz, Tom Cannon and Hamza Choudhury.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wilder describes the quiet Devonian as “a librarian rather than a rockstar” but “extremely effective”.Sunderland,semi-final losers to Luton,with Lockyer on the scoresheet, two years ago, lack similar experience and finished the season 14 points behind Saturday’s opponents. Only two of the Sunderland XI that started the second leg of the semi-final against Coventry were aged over 25 but the squad bristles with the youthful verve and fearlessness epitomised by the 17-year-old Chris Rigg and 19-year-old Jobe Bellingham. It also contains the gamechanging skills of the Roma loanee playmaker Enzo Le Fée who, from the age of 10, was mentored through a troubled childhood by Le Bris.Wilder is suitably wary yet undaunted. “Sunderland have plenty of energy, quality and personality,” he said. “We need to be bang at it. This is one of the biggest games in world football and Wembley is not a place for losers. But we know how to win.”As Le Bris addressed reporters in Sunderland’s training ground on Thursday, a BBC radio commentator presented him with an elegant ribboned cake box containing a batch of the pink slices that remind the Breton of his favourite French patisseries.A manager noted for his capacity to create powerful connectivity and build strong bonds seemed touched by this good luck gift but those traybakes will taste infinitely better if it is mission accomplished on Saturday.“When I first met with the players last summer, and it was here, in this room, I asked them: ‘What is this season’s purpose?’” Le Bris recalled. “They said: ‘We want promotion’ – and here we are. We don’t know the future so, when you have an opportunity like this, it’s important to catch it.”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSheffield UnitedSunderlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When Stefan de Vrij put Inter ahead via a corner after 20 minutes, they leapfroggedNapoliin the live standings, but the goal from the former Manchester United midfielder McTominay in the 42nd minute, acrobatically converting Matteo Politano’s cross, eased nerves in Naples.Serie A title decider: Napoli win the Scudetto to deny Inter – live reactionRead moreRomelu Lukaku doubled Napoli’s lead six minutes after the restart by latching on to a long ball, shrugging off a defender and calmly finishing past the Cagliari keeper Alen Sherri. The rest of the match turned into a celebration at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium as flares and smoke filled the pitch before the final whistle blew and fireworks lit up the Naples sky.McTominay’s night got even better when he was named Serie A’s player of the season after the title race was decided. The Scotland midfielder has been vital for Napoli, scoring 12 goals and providing six assists in 34 league matches. The 28-year-old told DAZN: “The sacrifice of every single player in this group is just incredible. The people deserve it, as they’ve been behind us from day one. For me to come here and experience this, it’s just a dream.”In Naples he now goes by the name “McFratm” among supporters, a playful fusion of his name and “Fratm”, the Neapolitan word for “my brother”. “My Italian is OK, I can understand, but speaking it takes more confidence and it’s not easy. It is much easier to do it with people who don’t speak any English. I can feel a lot of love,” McTominay said, adding that he just had learned the words “festeggiamo, andiamo”, meaning “let’s go celebrate”.While Joaquín Correa also made it 2-0 to Inter at Como’s Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia, it was not enough forthe Champions League finalists. Serving a touchline ban, the Inter head coach, Simone Inzaghi, rested several regular starters before the European final on 31 May but his side still had enough to win.“We did our part, we knew we were depending on others. We couldn’t have done more today, but we have to put it behind us and prepare for the final,” the Inter captain De Vrij told DAZN. “We didn’t deserve [the title] because if we’re not top after 38 games, then whoever is top deserves it, but there’s a feeling that we could have done more in the league.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Inter nearly doubled their lead but Reina, making his final career appearance, denied Mehdi Taremi with a sharp one-on-one save.However, the Spaniard’s farewell turned sour when he was sent off shortly before half-time after a VAR review for a last-man foul on Taremi. Correa doubled Inter’s lead six minutes into the second half, cutting inside a defender before finishing coolly. De Vrij added: “There’s a huge desire to play a great final next week.

A first major trophy for 17 years – and only their second since they lifted the Heineken Cup in 998 – was also secured with a swagger reminiscent of the club’s golden era. With the Premiership title still up for grabs next month, a potential treble-winning season is now within their grasp.While the Premiership Cup and the Challenge Cup might not, in isolation, be the most prestigious competitions in the professional club game, there is no doubting Bath’s increasing durability under screeching knockout pressure. That said, they were lucky with a couple of contentious officiating calls which, had they gone the other way, might have made life appreciably harder.Northampton’s Fin Smith: ‘We love being written off. We’d back ourselves against anybody’Read moreThe awarding of only a yellow card to Sam Underhill rather than a red for a dangerous high challenge in the first half was just one of several contentious decisions for Hollie Davidson, the first female referee to officiate in a high-profile men’s club final. In the end, though, Bath’s familiar strength in depth off the bench paid its usual dividends and helped deliver four tries as they became the first English winners of this tournament for five years.French rugby does not have a total monopoly on power and tactical nous and when the outstanding Ben Spencer dived over to put his side clear early in the final quarter it was no less than Johann van Graan’s team deserved. “I’m so proud to give the fans what they deserve after so many years of hurt,” said Spencer. “To not concede in that first-half yellow card period was outstanding.”With the roof closed, the pitchside flame throwers at full blast and plenty of English supporters having made the short trip across the Severn Bridge, it certainly felt like a proper cup final, despite the minor caveat that Bath had trailed in fifth in their Champions Cup pool before entering this season’s Challenge Cup equation.Lyon, appropriately clad in red, may be lying in 11th place in the Top 14 but they can play eye-catching rugby when the muse is with them. Barely two minutes into the game a slick passing sequence put the winger Ethan Dumortier over in the right corner and, after lengthy video scrutiny, the score was belatedly confirmed.Bath, though, are a tough side to subdue indefinitely. Will Butt steamed clear through the middle to set up a prolonged spell of territorial pressure which, eventually, yielded a try for a burrowing Tom Dunn. Finn Russell’s conversion made it 10-5 and, suddenly, the contest had a different feel.Spencer’s left boot is also a tried and trusted tactical weapon and a raking 50-22 set up another promising position from which his side also profited. Again Spencer was a central figure, his long pass finding Max Ojomoh wide on the left and the centre’s clever pirouette took him past the flat-footed cover.View image in fullscreenHollie Davidson shows Will Muir a yellow card for clatteringEthan Dumortier in the air. Davidson is the first female referee to officiate in a high-profile men’s club final.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAny side containing a player of the pace and class of Davit Niniashvili, though, is never to be underestimated and the Georgian full-back duly set off on a daring surge only to be floored by a desperate upright tackle by Underhill. The England flanker was sent off by Davidson against Pau in the last 16 and was fortunate to see only yellow this time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lyon were also left frustrated when a slight nudge on Dunn in the buildup led to a potential try for Dumortier from a long lineout play being scrubbed out and the subsequent return of Underhill supplied some further Bath relief. Had Van Graan been offered a 12-point half-time lead in a pressure-laden final before kick-off, he would have snapped your hand off.Arno Botha’s try four minutes after the restart, though, was an abrupt reminder that nothing was yet guaranteed. Hence the roars when Beno Obano crashed over in the 50th minute to re-establish some daylight between the sides, with Russell’s conversion leaving Lyon 15 points adrift.The gap grew wider when Tom de Glanville cut past a tiring defence and put Spencer away to seal a result that will further raise Bath hopes that a seriously special season is brewing. It was also not an occasion Davidson will forget in a hurry, with the Scottish official firmly convinced there should be many more female referees at the top level of the men’s game in future years. “If you are physically fit enough, mentally resilient, you know your stuff around the sport and have enough experience, then there is nothing stopping women getting there.”It is not her fault that rugby’s high tackle regulations remain so wide open to interpretation.Explore more on these topicsEuropean Challenge CupBathRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Neville was scheduled to be part of Sky’s commentary team as both sides bid to secure Champions League football next season, but Forest have declined to grant him media accreditation. The East Midlands club declined to comment when approached.The former Manchester United defender Neville said on Instagram: “I was contacted bySky Sportsearlier on in the week and told that I would be commentating at the City Ground on Sunday for the Nottingham Forest v Chelsea match. I was informed yesterday by Sky Sports that Nottingham Forest would not give me an accreditation or access to the stadium as a co-commentator. I’ve had no choice but to withdraw from the coverage.Premier League race for Europe: who’s in, who needs what and how 10 could qualifyRead more“I’ve dished out my fair share of criticism and praise in the last 14 years of doing this job and have never come close to this unprecedented action. Personally, I think it’s disappointing that a great club like Nottingham Forest have been reduced to making such a decision. While they have every right to choose who they let into their own stadium, it’s symptomatic of things that have happened over the last 12 months with the club. I wish the coaching staff, players and fans of the club all the best in their quest to achieve Champions League football.”Neville has been highly critical of Forest and owner Evangelos Marinakis this season. He described Marinakis walking on to the pitch and exchanging words with the head coach, Nuno Espírito Santo, after therecent draw with Leicesteras “scandalous”.Neville urged Nuno to quit the club and his social media post further enraged Marinakis, who had threatened Sky with legal action over comments made by the pundit earlier in the season.AfterForest’s 2-0 defeat at Evertonlast year, the club issued a statement on social media questioning the integrity of the video assistant referee Stuart Attwell after claiming they had been denied three penalties. Neville’s response to that, comparing Forest’s actions to those of a “mafia gang”, prompted an apology from Sky after they had been contacted by Marinakis’s lawyers.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestGary NevilleSky SportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The east London club prevailed 4-1 on spot-kicks after an absorbing semi-final with Stockport ended 3-3 on aggregate.

The institution added that it planned to file for a temporary restraining order to block the Department of Homeland Security from carrying out the move.The Trump White House called the lawsuit “frivolous” but the court filing from the 389-year-old elite, private university, the oldest and wealthiest in the US, said: “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.”Harvard enrolls almost 6,800 foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Most are graduate students and they come from more than 100 countries.Meanwhile, the Department of Health and Human Services’ office for civil rights late on ThursdaycitedColumbia University, claiming the New York university acted with “deliberate indifference towards student-on-student harassment of Jewish students from October 7, 2023, through the present”, markingthe datewhenHamasled the deadly attack on Israel out of Gaza that sparked a ferociousmilitary responsefrom the Jewish state, promptingprolongedpro-Palestinian protests on US streets andcollege campuses.“The findings carefully document the hostile environment Jewish students atColumbia Universityhave had to endure for over 19 months, disrupting their education, safety, and well-being,” said Anthony Archeval, the acting director of the office for civil rights at HHS, in a statement on the action.It continued: “We encourage Columbia University to work with us to come to an agreement that reflects meaningful changes that will truly protect Jewish students.” Columbia University had not yet issued a statement on the citation as of early Friday morning.Orders by the Trump administration earlier this month to investigate pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University raised alarms within the Department of Justice, the New York Timesreported. A federal judgedenieda search warrant for the investigation.Earlier this year, Columbia Universityagreedto a list of demands from the Trump administration in response to $400m worth of grants and federal funds to the university being cancelled over claims of inaction by the university to protect Jewish students.Burroughs said Harvard had shown it could be harmed before there was an opportunity to hear the case in full. The judge, an Obama administration appointee, scheduled hearings for 27 May and 29 May to consider next steps in the case.The Harvard Crimson student newspaperreportedthat the Department of Homeland Security gave Harvard 72 hours to turn over all documents on all international students’ disciplinary records and paper, audio or video records on protest activity over the past five years in order to have the “opportunity” to have its eligibility to enroll foreign students reinstated.Before Harvard filed suit, the Chinese government early on Friday hadsaidthe move to block foreign students from the school and oblige current ones to leave would only hurt the international standing of the US.

In return, the department would dismiss the fraud charge in the criminal case against the aircraft manufacturer.“Ultimately, in applying the facts, the law, and Department policy, we are confident that this resolution is the most just outcome with practical benefits,” a justice department spokesperson said in a statement.“Nothing will diminish the victims’ losses, but this resolution holds Boeing financially accountable, provides finality and compensation for the families and makes an impact for the safety of future air travelers.”Many relatives of the passengers who died in the crashes, which took placeoff the coast of Indonesiaandin Ethiopialess than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, have spent years pushing for a public trial, the prosecution of former company officials, and more severe financial punishment for Boeing.Families of victims appalled as Boeing seems likely to avoid prosecution over 737 Max crashesRead more“Although the DOJ proposed a fine and financial restitution to the victims’ families, the families that I represent contend that it is more important for Boeing to be held accountable to the flying public,” Paul Cassell, an attorney for many of the families in the long-running case, said in a statement earlier this week.Boeing was accused of misleading the Federal Aviation Administration about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight. Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about a new software system, called MCAS, that could turn the plane’s nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.The Max planes crashed after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned MCAS to make it less powerful and to use signals from two sensors, not just one.Boeing avoided prosecution in 2021 by reaching a $2.5bn settlement with the justice department that included a previous $243.6m fine.A year ago, prosecutors said Boeing violated the terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeingagreed last July to plead guiltyto the felony fraud charge instead of enduring a potentially lengthy public trial.But in December, US district judge Reed O’Connor in Fort Worthrejectedthe plea deal. The judge said the diversity, inclusion and equity (DEI) policies in the government and at Boeing could result in race being a factor in picking a monitor to oversee Boeing’s compliance with the agreement.Explore more on these topicsBoeingTrump administrationLaw (US)Plane crashesnewsShareReuse this content"

The infant bear is now recovering atSan DiegoHumane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center, and is believed to be the youngest cub the organization has ever cared for.The two-month-old cub was discovered on 12 April by campers hiking in the forest. Wildlife officials with theCaliforniadepartment of fish and wildlife (CDFW) attempted to reunite him with his mother overnight, but she didn’t return. The cub was transferred to the Ramona facility two days later.View image in fullscreenStaff taking care of a baby bear.Photograph: San Diego Humane Society“The cub is thriving here. When he first arrived, he was only 3lbs and was a little debilitated, probably from going multiple days without any kind of nutrition or hydration,” said Autumn Welch, the wildlife operations manager at the center. “He’s now quadrupled in size, he’s over 12lbs.”Now thriving after more than a month of around-the-clock care, the cub is expected to remain at the center for up to a year. Staff are using enrichment sessions that mimic maternal behavior to prepare him for a future return to the wild, including staff members dressed as bears, plush toys and camouflaged headsets.Welch said that keeping bears away from human interaction when they are young is key to avoiding conflicts in the future, once they’re released in the wild.“They’re really smart and very food motivated,” Welch said. “As we continue to develop in the areas they live, they’re always being pushed into areas where people may have some type of conflict with them.”“Sometimes bears will get into trashes or get into people’s yards,” she added. “The more we can keep this cub wild and keep him from recognizing humans as the providers of anything good, we’re hoping every time we go in there, he’s seeing us as other bears and being able to identify with us as bears instead of humans.”Officials say he could eventually be paired with another orphaned cub to help his development and minimize human imprinting.View image in fullscreenRamona Wildlife Center staff in a bear costume. ‘We don’t often see bears this young without their mother,’ said Autumn Welch, the center’s wildlife operations manager.Photograph: San Diego Humane SocietyWelch said the CDFW determines the site of where any of the bear cubs and rehabs go after they are released into the wild. The department takes into consideration a number of factors, such as where the bear was found, what the population is like in that area, if there’s any human wildlife conflict, and whether the site will provide for their nutrition needs.She estimates the recently found cub won’t be released until the end of next spring or early summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

TheSan DiegoHumane Society relies solely on donations to sustain its wildlife rehabilitation efforts.The RamonaWildlifeCenter is the only facility in San Diego county permitted to rehabilitate native apex predators, including black bears, mountain lions and bobcats.“This is a very unusual case,” Welch said in a press release. “We don’t often see bears this young without their mother.

But now we are seeing the effects of climate change … this might be the beginning of us as a society really coming to terms with the fact that we need to modify our behaviours when we’re accessing wild places.”Country diary: A wildfire has killed off (nearly) everything wild | Eben MuseRead moreHe said the area between Sheffield and Manchester was facing a triple challenge of a warming climate, increasing visitor numbers and a budget reduction of about 50% in the past decade.“We really want to encourage people to come and experience these amazing habitats, these ultra-high-value peatland ecosystems. But we need to be accessing them and enjoying them responsibly in ways that don’t create fires,” Scott-Campbell said.For the past 20 years specialist teams have been working on the moors to try to manage and preserve the nature-rich peatland, blocking erosion gullies to increase water retention and cutting back heather to create a more diverse habitat.An initial inspection of the land after the recent spate of fires found that those areas that had been restored and protected had survived with less damage.Scott-Campbell said: “Damaging fire events like those of recent weeks only increase the urgency with which we must act to restore and protect degraded blanket bog habitats in the face of a changing climate.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The agency said it had found no evidence of transmission to humans and the risk to the British public was low.West Nile virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and, likedengue fever,chikungunyaand zika, used to be confined to hotter regions of the world. But global heating has expanded the geographical spread of West Nile virus and other tropical diseases into cooler areas, including parts of northern and western Europe. In 2024, there weremore than 1,400 casesof locally acquired West Nile virus andseveral hundred cases of dengue, mostly in France and Italy.According to Dr Robert Jones, assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in the most extreme scenarios – with temperatures rising by 4 to 5 degrees above pre-industrial levels – there is expected to be a fivefold increase in dengue and chikungunya outbreaks by the 2060s in Europe.“We are unlikely to see a dramatic surge in tropical diseases,” said Jones. “However, climate change is making the UK more hospitable to the insects that that transmit some pathogens that cause tropical diseases.”“Projected increases to UK temperatures in the coming years will increase the risks of West Nile virus outbreaks, potentially with epidemics appearing by the second half of the century.”Dengue fever deaths surge in Caribbean and Americas due to climate crisisRead moreFor tropical diseases to become established in the UK, those infected with the virus would have to be bitten by the appropriate mosquitoes, which then pass it on to other people.For now, the UK does not yet have the right mosquitoes in sufficient numbers, said Prof Tom Solomon, the director of the National Institute for Health and Care Research’s health protection research unit on emerging infections and of thePandemic Institute.“At the moment, Aedes mosquitoes such as the Asian tiger mosquito are the main vectors of dengue fever and zika, whilst for West Nile, Culex species are important. These mosquitoes have been detected in the UK, but are not yet fully established in sufficient numbers to cause large outbreaks.“But as the UK gets hotter, local mosquito populations are changing, which, long-term, could result in local transmission of tropical diseases, especially in southern England.”For now, there is no need for the NHS to embark on mass vaccinations for yellow fever or to prescribe anti-malarial drugs. And the public does not yet need to routinely use insect repellent in Britain during summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Heather Ferguson, professor of infectious disease ecology at the University of Glasgow, who leads the Mosquito Scotland project,says the “absolute number one priority” for the UK government if it wants to protect UK citizens long-term is to invest in measures to control these diseases in the tropical countries where they cause the overwhelming burden of illness and death.She added: “We should never lose sight of the fact that one child under five dies of malaria approximately every minute, with approximately 600,000 deaths and over 100 million cases in 2023 alone.“As we learned from the pandemic, infectious diseases have no borders and can spread quickly when the conditions are right. The government’s cuts to foreign aid will lead to a collapse in crucial surveillance, control and treatment programmes in endemic countries, causing more deaths from tropical disease.“The best way to defend ourselves is to not only maintain, but strengthen investment into the global elimination efforts that will ultimately keep all of us safe from tropical disease.”Solomon said: “Controlling mosquito-borne diseases overseas is also an important element of protecting the UK. If they are controlled overseas, there is less chance of them spreading to the UK.”“Long-term policies that address net zero challenges globally are arguably the best protection against such diseases,” said Prof James Wood, the infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge and the co-director of Cambridge Infectious Diseases.A FCDO spokesperson said: “Global health security is essential for our national security and the UK is a leading donor in the fight against mosquito-borne tropical diseases. We play a major role in the global malaria response, and we are the third largest donor to the global fund.“This week we adopted a new pandemic agreement, which will improve the way countries around the world work together to detect and combat global health threats. As the minister for international development, Baroness Chapman, has said, global health will be a priority for the UK’s international development. Diseases cross borders so our diplomacy must too.”Explore more on these topicsInfectious diseasesClimate crisisInsectsDengue feverHealthMalarianewsShareReuse this content"

These four say his policies are ‘wreaking havoc’Farm country voted for Trump in 2024, but many of his actions – from tariffs to federal cuts – are hurting growersSupported byAbout this contentWhitney BauckFri 23 May 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 09.01 EDTShareDonald Trumpmay havewonthe votes of the US’s most farming-dependent counties by an average of 78% in the 2024 election. But the moves made by his administration in the past few months – imposing steep tariffs, immigration policies that target the migrant labor farmers rely on, and canceling a wide range of USDA programs – have left many farmers reeling.“The policies of theTrump administrationare wreaking havoc on family farmers. It’s been terrible,” said John Bartman, a row crop farmer in Illinois. Bartman is owed thousands of dollars for sustainable practices he implemented on his row crop operation as part of the USDA’s Climate-Smart program.And he’s not the only one. Other farmers across the country are reporting that theTrump administration’s policies have destroyed their markets by ending programs that help farmers sell their produce to local schools and food banks; implementing draconian immigration policies that destabilize the farm labor pool; and generally creating volatility that makes it hard for farmers to plan ahead.One group of farmers, the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York, joined organizations like Earthjustice and the Natural Resources Defense Council insuingthe USDA for removing department webpages focused on climate change, arguing that the move was unlawful and undermines farmers’ ability to adapt and respond to climate threats. (On 13 May, the coalition declared a kind of victory when the government committed to restore the purged content; the government is set to provide more information about the restoration process on 11 June.)Some farmers, such as Bartman, loudly oppose Trump. “I’ve met some Democrats who’ll say: ‘You farmers deserve this. You voted for him.’ Well, I didn’t vote for the guy. The programs that have been impacted the most are targeted towards farmers that care about the environment.” Others, such as those living near North Carolina farmer Patrick Brown, are experiencing “buyer’s remorse”, said Brown, “but they don’t want to say it because they voted for the current administration”.No matter who they voted for, farmers across the country are living in the new reality created by the Trump administration’s agricultural policies. The Guardian spoke to four farmers about what it’s like trying to grow crops, feed people, and keep their operations afloat in 2025.‘If Uncle Sam will renege on a farmer, they’ll renege on anybody’John Bartman, Bartman FarmMarengo, IllinoisView image in fullscreen‘My family has been farming in Illinois since 1846; we have the oldest continuous running vegetable stand in McHenry county.’Photograph: John BartmanI am a vegetable and grain farmer; we’re mostly a row crop operation. My family has been farming in Illinois since 1846; we have the oldest continuous running vegetable stand in McHenry county. I farm 900 acres. I try to use the least amount of fertilizer and herbicides that I can.Three main policies have been impacting us. Number one is the cancellation of USAID. That’s about a billion dollars worth of grain that the United States purchases from farmers like me, and they give it to third world nations who are hungry. To kill that program is a disaster. It’s morally bankrupt, and it hurts farmers’ bottom line.Another thing that’s very pressing is the payment freezes to farmers from the USDA. I was involved in the Climate-Smart practices. We were paid to implement stewardship practices that the USDA has been preaching since the Dust Bowl. The added benefit is these practices combat climate change. That’s what the current administration doesn’t want anything to do with.I’m supposed to be paid close to $100 an acre. Then the current administration came in and put a freeze on everything. $100 an acre may not sound like much, but there are some years where we’re happy if we make $20 an acre off of things. I have an operating loan that I haven’t been able to pay off because I was counting on this money. I have rent that’s due. I have seed costs. I have chemical costs.I try to explain to people, if I were a repair person, and I went to my local grade school and fixed their furnace, and in the meantime, a new school board was elected, I still deserve to be paid. I’ve signed a contract with the USDA. The full faith and credit of the United States is at risk, because if Uncle Sam will renege on a farmer, they’ll renege on anybody.The third one is the tariff situation. China is and has been our number one export for soybeans; 100% of the soybeans that I grow are exported. During Trump’s first administration, half of all the soybeans that China purchased were from the United States. By the end of his first administration, it was down to a quarter. Now Brazil has taken over our role as the number one importer of soybeans into China. From an environmental standpoint, that meansmore deforestationin the Amazon. Mexico purchases 40% of all the corn in the United States. And he wants to have a trade war with Mexico? Mexico can just as easily buy their grain from Argentina and Brazil.The USDA has also canceled a lot of contracts for food pantries and school districts to purchase from local farmers, and that’s absolutely devastating. I was just in Springfield, Illinois, testifying and hearing testimony from other farmers. Many of them are first-generation farmers, and that program gave them an outlet for their produce. It’s so sad listening to them saying, ‘I finally had my dream of owning my own farm and making a living at it. Now I don’t know what I’m going to do, because my market has dried up.’‘If we don’t have enough workers, we cannot harvest our crops’Shah Kazemi, Monterey MushroomsSanta Cruzcounty, CaliforniaView image in fullscreen‘People don’t recognize that we either have to import our labor, or import our food.’Photograph: Shah Kazemi/Monterey MushroomsPeople don’t recognize that we either have to import our labor, or import our food.We operate five farms right now: in California, Tennessee, Texas and Mexico. We have close to 2,000 employees. Our business has been totally dependent on migrant workers, just like all other ag businesses in this country. Without them, there is no food on anybody’s table.In 1983 we acquired a farm in Loudon, Tennessee. At the time we didn’t have one migrant worker in that plant. By the early 1990s we had about 20% migrant workers, and by the early 2000s we had 85%, because nobody wants to do that kind of work any more in this country. When you’re bent over picking strawberries, cucumber, lettuce, zucchini, whatever the crop is – try to do that for eight hours. See how your back feels, how the rest of your body feels.Farmingis hard, physical work.These are skilled workers, harvesting at a certain rate to stay productive; you have to know your trade. A skilled mushroom picker can pick about 75 to 80 pounds an hour, and some of them exceed 100 pounds an hour. A new picker comes in, their productivity is in the 20s, and it will take six to eight months to get them up to 50. So if you had to replace a guy that’s picking 80 pounds an hour with people who are picking in the 20s, you need three or four of them. We have a lot of respect and admiration for these people. They’re really underappreciated.I have a friend who is in the farming business. About a month ago, there was an Ice [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] raid in the area. The following day, most of his employees didn’t show up. Even the people who have been here for a long time, they’re listening to the news and hearing that people with green cards are being deported. The fear factor has been heightened significantly. That’s what has happened with the new administration coming in.If we don’t have enough workers, we cannot harvest our crops. And if you don’t harvest, then it’s all wasted.The uncertainty and erratic decision making creates volatility in the marketplace. And now we’re concerned about where we’re going to get future workers. What’s going to happen a year from now, as some of these people get deported, or they feel so fearful they go back to their home country? Who’s going to replace them?We need to have a program that lets people come in who can do the work, and then at the end of whatever the term is, they can go back home. They have a guest worker program in Canada that works significantly better than what we have here.Nobody pays any attention to the farmers, and we are the people who put food on the table every day. And the migrant workers, those are the hands that pick the crops that you eat.‘The short-term impact is more anxiety, fewer investments on the farm’Josh Sneddon, Fox at the ForkMonee, IllinoisView image in fullscreen‘Fox at the Fork is a 10-acre regenerative farm – we grow fruit and nut trees like pecans, persimmons and currants, while also stewarding approximately one acre of land intensively in annual vegetables.’Photograph: Gokhan CukurovaI got into farming because I love to cook. When I was in New Jersey and I was getting my food from local farmers, ranchers and fishermen, the quality of the food was so much better that my spice cabinet became essentially salt and pepper, because the food was good enough [on its own]. I took my entrepreneurial spirit and applied it to my interest in building a local food system driven by higher-quality foods, greater accessibility, and a climate smart focus on our food system.Fox at the Fork is a 10-acre regenerative farm – we grow fruit and nut trees like pecans, persimmons and currants, while also stewarding approximately one acre of land intensively in annual vegetables.It’s my fifth year in business. In prior farm bills and administrations, the USDA supported individuals like me who are considered “beginning farmers”. That’s one of their historically underserved categories. The USDA [formerly] created and reinforced programs that supported individuals who hadn’t had the same opportunities – Bipoc, LGBTQ+, beginning, veteran farmers – to have an equitable shot at growing and establishing small-scale food businesses in their communities.Being considered a beginning farmer was part of the criteria that has helped me secure NRCS [Natural Resources Conservation Service] grants, one of them being a Conservation Stewardship Program contract. That’s a five-year contract that recognizes all of the conservation practices we implemented. For us, that’s about [protecting] native prairie; cover cropping; building bird boxes to bring back native kestrels and owls.Almost all federal grants require that some of the money spent is yours and is not reimbursed. So farmers have a stake in the game; it’s not just the government giving out corn and soy subsidies.The other program that really helped our farm last year [that has been canceled under the current administration] is the LFPA, the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program. It was getting up to $25m [in Illinois] that had been obligated to the state for food distribution organizations like food banks, who provide food to the community and pay a fair market value to us farmers.I also have a Reap contract – the Rural Energy for America Program – which is another program that faced direct cuts. At the end of last year, I spent approximately $79,000 to install solar, having already received approval and signed paperwork. That grant is a 25% reimbursement through the USDA reap, which is for me, $19,784. I’m still waiting for that. Not receiving that $19,784 has slowed what investments I’m going to make for the year.It’s hard to predict the long-term impacts, but the short-term impact is more anxiety, fewer investments on the farm, and likely greater effort trying to get my food placed in the community at a fair market price.‘When you sign a government contract, you feel some sense of,“this can’t be taken away”’Patrick Brown, Brown Family FarmsWarrencounty, North CarolinaView image in fullscreen‘I’m a fourth-generation row crop farmer. My home farm is about 165 acres.’Photograph: Patrick BrownI’m a fourth-generation row crop farmer. My home farm is about 165 acres. I also grow industrial hemp fiber and produce – watermelons, leafy greens, tomatoes, sweet corn.We’re an impoverished community, and we don’t have access to a lot of food, so I try to get healthy options to children especially. We were participants for the past two years in a USDA project – which has just gotten terminated – providing fresh food to local schools. We also created a non-profit to help create a path for young kids that want to become farmers. And I also am a director of a non-profit called Nature for Justice, and we were awarded a USDA Climate-Smart contract to help farmers with conservation practices.All my projects that were funded by the federal government have been terminated during the current administration. It’s caused us to pivot. We’re so used to not having anything – as a minority farmer, that’s the way things have always been.But when you sign a government contract, you feel some sense of, ‘this can’t be taken away.’ I was doing two projects: one for cover crops and nutrient management, and the other one to plant trees to help with erosion and chemical drift, and to create habitat for wildlife. We did all this work and invested all this money, all for them to say, as of 29 January, the project is no longer in place.We were expecting to get over $65,000 this year from work we did in 2024. They claim that I will eventually get the money, but who knows how long that will be held up?Plus, the announcements made during this administration through the secretary ofagricultureare not getting down to the rural community offices that represent small farmers. It’s almost as if things are announced on social media, andthenthe offices hear about it. And our local NRCS offices and our Farm Service Agency offices are more understaffed than they’ve been in 20 years. The technical assistance is non-existent.The main thing we need right now is for our local legislators to speak up for us. A lot of them are being quiet. But we need to advocate against the wrongdoing that is being done to farmers.Explore more on these topicsFarmingOur unequal earthAgricultureTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS domestic policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With its worst fire season on record, Bolivia was especially hard hit. “We felt powerless and angry to be unable to protect what is ours,” says Isabel Surubí Pesoa.Surubí Pesoa wasforced to migrateto the nearest town after the spring that fed her village in Bolivia’s eastern lowlands dried up after the fires and the drought that preceded it. “It’s very painful,” she says.Largeranches and farmsoften use fire to clear land for crops or to graze cattle.Chronic drought, fuelled by theclimate crisisand El Niño weather patterns, combined withweak environmental governance, made it easy for these fires to spread out of control, destroying forests and grasslands.View image in fullscreenIsabel Surubí Pesoa, who had to leave home after fires last year.Photograph: Laura Barriga DávalosIndustrial-scale land clearances without fire isalso a major cause of deforestation, undermining the resilience of communities and ecosystems alike.With insufficientlocal and national government support, many people are left to battle fires with little more thanshovels and small water bottles. “As elected officials, we feel impotent,” says Verónica Surubí Pesoa, a city councillor in San Javier and Isabel’s sister.Forest loss in Bolivia and across Latin America is part of a broader worldwide trend. New data released earlier this week by World Resources Institute’s Global Forest Watch found thatglobal forest loss reached record highs in 2024, with almost twice as much tropical primary forest lost in 2024 as in the year before. That is equal to an area larger than Ireland.Deforestation in the Amazonmeans warmer temperatures and decreased rainfall, with consequences for farmers and food production. When fire is involved – as it increasingly is –communities reportissues from water pollution and smoke, which might increase lung cancer and susceptibility to infections, to disruption to education when schools are forced to close.“When people live in the middle of thousands of burnt hectares, of course, it’s not going to be a healthy environment,” says Iván Arnold, director of the Bolivian environmental organisationFundación Nativa.View image in fullscreenA satellite view of South America showing the smoke from fires last September.Photograph: Nasa Earth ObservatoryHistorically heavy rainfallfollowed Bolivia’s drought and fires in 2024, flooding towns and destroying crops. In the Surubí community, in the country’s tropical dry forest region, they disrupted growing seasons and damaged roads and bridges, further complicating recovery efforts.If this trend continues, it could permanently transform critical natural areas and unleash large amounts of carbonPeter PotapovFire – which is not a natural part of tropical ecosystems, as it is in much of Australia, for example – was the leading cause of the loss of tropical primary forest for the first time recorded. Forest loss in tropical regions is especially grave as these ecosystems are some of the world’s most biodiverse and serve as key carbon sinks.The greenhouse gas emissions from tropical primary forests lost in 2024 alone exceeded the annual carbon emissions of India. Majorfires sweptCanadaand Russia’s boreal forests as well, and overall tree cover loss reached all-time highs across the globe.Peter Potapov, co-director of the University of Maryland’s GLAD Lab, which collected the data, says: “If this trend continues, it could permanently transform critical natural areas and unleash large amounts of carbon – intensifying climate change and fuelling even more extreme fires.”View image in fullscreenBurnt trees after a wildfire in Quebec last June. Last year’s fire season was Canada’s worst on record.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesElizabeth Goldman, co-director of Global Forest Watch, which has analysed the report, says the data is a “global red alert” to the international community. “It’s a global red alert,” she says.Although the loss of vegetation occurs across the world, Latin America has witnessed much of this catastrophe withBrazillosing the most tropical primary forest of any country. The Amazon biome saw its worst decline since 2016, with primary forest loss more than doubling, driven by fires and agricultural expansion.After a dip in 2023, Colombia’s primary forest loss rose by 50% in 2024, though fires were not the main driver. Joaquin Carrizosa, an adviser for World Resources Institute Colombia, says: “Most of the deforestation dynamics are associated with larger macro-criminal networks interconnected through the basin and … with other countries. This is not just a Colombian problem.”Loss of primary forest surged elsewhere across Latin America. Fires were the biggest cause in Belize, Guyana, Guatemala and Mexico. Nicaragua lost nearly 5% of its primary forest in 2024 – the highest proportion of any country.Bolivia’s primary forest loss increased by 200%, reaching 15,000 sq km (6,000 sq miles) in 2024. For the first time, it ranked second to Brazil in tropical primary forest loss and surpassed the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has more than twice its forest area.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of fires in Bolivia’s Chiquitano tropical dry forests last year.Photograph: Benjamin SwiftThis “signals that Bolivia has become a major driver of the global climate and ecological crisis,” says Stasiek Czaplicki Cabezas, a Bolivian environmental economist.Czaplicki Cabezas says the expansion of industrial-scale farming and cattle ranching, weak enforcement and oversight of environmental regulations, and a legal and political framework that values land conversion over protecting forests drove the increase in Bolivia.“What makes 2024 particularly severe is the convergence of these structural drivers with a deepening ecological andeconomic crisis,” he says.‘It still gives me nightmares’: the firefighters on the frontline as the world burnsRead moreIsabel Surubí Pesoa says of the latest data: “We’re the guardians of our territory, but this is out of our hands.”Yet, the data showed some successes. In Bolivia’s southern Chaco region, Indigenous communities, public institutions, civil society organisations and volunteer firefighters banded together to protect the tract of land that spans national parks and Indigenous territories.After a devastating 2019 fire season, they invested in early warning systems and enforced land-use policy better. It helped themsuccessfully fight backthe wall of flame that had enveloped nearby areas in 2024 and 2023.Collaboration across sectors was fundamental, says Arnold, whose Fundación Nativa supported the effort. Just as crucial were the local monitors – mostly Indigenous Guaraní park rangers – who know the area and track conditions all year to enable a fast response.“What’s important is not just acting when there’s a fire,” he says, “but preparing in the off-season.”View image in fullscreenA volunteer near Charagua fighting the 2019 wildfire  that destroyed huge tracts of Chaco dry forest.Photograph: David Mercado/ReutersIn San Javier, Isabel and Verónica Surubí Pesoa are looking towards the next fire season. The organisation of Indigenous women Isabel leads is holding workshops to train women in fire prevention and management, and a municipal strategy is being drawn up.They are also seeking support from conservation organisations to equip a local fire brigade, as the group has no boots, helmets or fire-resistant clothing.“Last year, we often went to fight the fires in shoes or sandals, and the fire burned them quickly,” she says. “We’re fighting so we don’t have to suffer the fires again.”Explore more on these topicsWildfiresSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanTrees and forestsDeforestationAmericasConservationExtreme weatherClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I don’t understand why there’s such a problem with a brick with a hole in it. It seems ludicrous,” she said. “Why say your new legislation is a win-win for new homes and the environment and exclude the only measure that is a true win-win?“They are tone-deaf. This is such a tiny thing they could do, but it’s brewing such a distrust and sense of betrayal among the people who voted for them.”View image in fullscreenCampaigner Hannah Bourne-Taylor says the government are ‘tone-deaf’ over the issue.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianAlthough some housebuilders are incorporating swift bricks in new builds, a recent University of Sheffield study found that75% of bird and bat boxesdemanded as a condition of planning permission for new housing developments had failed to materialise when the housing estates were complete.Asked if he would meet MPs to discuss how to encourage the building industry to adopt swift bricks more widely, Pennycook said he would be happy to have conversations with MPs despite claiming hiscorrectly reported opposition to mandatory cavity-nesting brickshad been “spun” in a Guardian report.These comments follow Pennycook’s recent defence of the planning bill’s proposed amendments to the Protection of Badgers Act that MPswarned would lead to “hostile treatment” of the much-persecuted animalin which the minister joked: “I would just like to make very clear, for the Guardian article that will no doubt appear tomorrow, that I have no particular animus against badgers in whatever form.”Bourne-Taylor said she hoped that the swift brick amendment would now be championed by the House of Lords.If that fails, Bourne-Taylor hopes to take her campaign to the wider public once again. The risingnew petition for swift bricks“just goes to show the public concern,” she said. “The government are not listening to the public or the experts.”Explore more on these topicsBirdsPlanning policyLabourWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

He told them he was returning home after a day at work on a nearby farm and gave a false name.He was initially sectioned to a secure facility in Devon where he was later released into custody and charged. Parish took £75 and clothing from the house to facilitate his escape.The court was told that Parish had been of previous good character and he did not know Beryl Purdy, who had been a church warden for 20 years before her death.Speaking after the sentence, DI Debbie Hatch said: “This case highlights the complex intersection between mental health and criminal justice. While the defendant’s illness does not excuse his actions, it has been recognised as a key factor in the tragic events which unfolded.”A spokesperson for Somerset NHS foundation trust said: “As is standard practice with tragic incidents like this, we conducted a full root cause analysis investigation to understand and review the unit’s environment, to identify if there are any areas of learning that we can take forward for our future care and support to patients and families. This includes a review of security arrangements on Rydon ward, where appropriate changes have been made.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeSomersetnewsShareReuse this content"

But later that day, another judge discharged the injunction andthe agreement to hand over Britain’s last African colony was sealed.While much of the fallout has focused on the cost to the UK of leasing back Diego Garcia, which is home to a UK-US airbase, and perceived security threats from Mauritius’s relationship with China, many Chagossians feel sidelined.Chief among their concerns is that Diego Garcia is exempted from the right of return for Chagossians contained in the deal and that the Mauritius government will not do right by them.Dugasse, who was two-and-a-half when her family was forced to move to Seychelles, said on Friday that she was heartbroken. “I don’t know how to put it because the night before we won, and in the morning we lost – I’ve been betrayed by the British government,” she said.“I will have to keep on fighting the British government till they accept for me to settle there [on Diego Garcia]. Do I know if I’ll be able to be around to keep on fighting? I’m getting older and older and I’m losing my strength so I don’t think I can make it for very long.”The presence of the military base was the reason the UK severed the Chagos Islands – renaming it the British Indian Ocean Territory – from the rest ofMauritius, when it granted the latter independence in 1968. The British forcibly displaced up to 2,000 people in what has been described as a crime against humanity and one of the most shameful episodes of postwar colonialism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They don’t even mention us. When they expelled us, everything was hidden [as if] there were no human beings on the island, just some Man Fridays. And they’re not saying it [now], they’re not pronouncing the [same] words, but by their actions they’re doing the same thing. We’re being scammed over and over again.”Given their historic treatment by the British, it might seem strange that the legal challenge sought to keep the islands under British control, but the women explained that it was intended as a temporary arrangement.Dugasse said it would be “for the time being, until we are able to manage our island by ourselves”. She elaborated, likening the deal to going “out of the frying pan, into the fire”, and added: “Like my grandparents used to say: ‘Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t know.’”Of the Chagossians in Mauritius, many of whom support the deal, she said: “They forgot that in the past they were campaigning against the Mauritian government for dumping them in rough houses, dirty places.”Pompe and Dugasse pledged to continue the fight by urging MPs to vote against the deal in parliament and also through the courts. “I’m still feeling hopeful,” said Pompe. “[Thursday] was a little bit of a disappointment, but after that we’ve had so much support, especially from other Chagossian groups.“I’m going to keep working with my lawyers, and we’re going to bring another case. So it’s not over until the fat lady sings – and that’s me.”The government made no reference to the Chagossiansin its press releaseon Thursday. It described the agreement as a “legal necessity”, giveninternational court rulingswhich said it should return the islands to Mauritius, and said it had secured the future of the “strategically critical” Diego Garcia base.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsForeign policyForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeMauritiusColonialismnewsShareReuse this content"

The pair were named in aGuardian investigation into UK assets owned by allies ofBangladesh’s former autocratic ruler, Sheikh Hasina.All properties are owned via companies in the British Virgin Islands, Isle of Man or Jersey, according to Companies House records, and were acquired for prices ranging from £1.2m to £35.5m.The Rahmans are the son and nephew, respectively, of Salman F Rahman, a wealthy businessman who was arrested while allegedly attempting to flee during thestudent-led revolution that toppled Sheikh Hasina last year.Salman F Rahman, who is facing corruption charges inBangladesh, was Hasina’s adviser on private industry and investment and was seen by many in the country as the most influential figure in the regime.His son and nephew’s properties featured in a joint investigation between the Guardian and the campaign group Transparency International last year, which revealed £400m worth of property owned by allies ofSheikh Hasina.The properties frozen by the NCA include one in Gresham Gardens, north London.Sheikh Rehana, who is Sheikh Hasina’s sister and also the mother of the former UK City minister Tulip Siddiq, has lived at the property, according to the Financial Times, which first reported freezing orders on two of the properties, bought for £7.7m.Duncan Hames, the director of policy at Transparency International UK, said: “We urge UK law enforcement to continue their inquiries and to freeze all suspect assets without delay.”An NCA spokesperson said: “We can confirm that the NCA has secured freezing orders against a number of properties as part of an ongoing civil investigation.”Investigations by the interim government of Bangladesh into the former regime have also resulted in authorities thereissuing an arrest warrant for Tulip Siddiq, who stepped back as City minister in the light of the allegations. She has denied any wrongdoing.The Guardian has approached lawyers for the Rahmans and Beximco, the family corporate empire founded by Salman Rahman, for comment.A spokesperson for Ahmed Shayan Rahman earlier told the FT: “Our client denies any involvement in any alleged wrongdoing in the strongest possible terms. He will of course engage with any investigation which takes place in the UK.”They added: “It is well known that there is political upheaval in Bangladesh, where numerous allegations are being made against many hundreds of individuals. We would expect the UK authorities to take this into consideration.”Explore more on these topicsNCA (National Crime Agency)BangladeshReal estateSouth and central AsiaSheikh HasinanewsShareReuse this content"

Four other people were found guilty of assisting in the plot or related charges. Two people were acquitted of accusations they handed out information about Kardashian’s whereabouts.Thearmed, masked menwho were dressed in police jackets, arrived by bike or on foot just before 3am on 3 October 2016 at Kardashian’s exclusive building near Paris’s Place de la Concorde, known as a “no address” site, where celebrities often rent sumptuous suites.They held a receptionist at gunpoint and then went up to Kardashian’s room where they held her hostage with a gun, tying her hands and feet and taping her mouth. They escaped with jewellery worth up to an estimated €10m. The jewels, which were never found, included a 18.88-carat diamond engagement ring given to Kardashian by her then husband, the rapper Kanye West, estimated to be worth £3m.The leaders of the gang, aged in their 60s and 70s, were nicknamed the “grandpa robbers” by French media. But the state prosecutor, Anne-Dominique Merville, had told jurors not to be fooled by their age or “reassuring wrinkles”, saying they were seasoned criminals with long track records and previous prison sentences.Aomar Aït Khedache, 68, a retired restaurant owner alleged to have masterminded the robbery, was handed the heaviest sentence of three years in prison plus five years suspended, but due to time already served in jail he will not return to detention. For the same reason, none of the convicted men were sent to prison.The court heard Aït Kadeche ‘“gave orders”, recruited others and travelled to Belgium to sell the jewellery. He is now deaf and cannot speak, so he read the court’s questions on a typed transcript, writing his answers with a pen and paper, projected on to a screen. “I ask for forgiveness. I can’t find the words. I am very sorry,” he wrote as the trial ended.View image in fullscreenAomar Aït Khedache, 68, was alleged to have masterminded the robbery.Photograph: Aurélien Morissard/APDidier Dubreucq, 69, was found guilty as well as Yunice Abbas, 71, who admitted to arriving at the scene with two accomplices on bicycles to “keep watch”. Abbas had told the court: “All I have to offer you is regret. I’m sorry.” Marc-Alexandre Boyer, the youngest member of the group, now in his 30s, was also convicted.In a statement after the verdict, Kardashian said she was “deeply grateful to the French authorities for pursuing justice”.She said: “The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family. While I’ll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all.”Kardashian, 44, a billionaire celebrity influencer and business owner who is now a criminal justice advocate in the US,attended the trialin Paris, telling the court her life had been changed by the robbery and she had feared she would be raped and murdered by the masked gunmen who entered her rented two-floor suite.On the day of the break-in, Kardashian and her reality TV star sister, Kourtney, had attended an exclusive lunch, then several fashion shows where they were photographed, followed by a dinner at a fashion house in the city centre, returning to their suite after midnight.Kim Kardashian’s Paris chauffeur told the court that everywhere she went there was a crowd of paparazzis on motorbikes. He said she always stayed at the same exclusive residence when in Paris and would take advantage of the photographers’ presence, getting out of the car a few metres from the residence’s front door “in order to get photographed” while she walked along.That night, Kourtney Kardashian changed clothes and went out again to aParisnightclub. Kim Kardashian insisted her bodyguard should accompany her sister. Meanwhile, she stayed home without security protection in the upstairs bedroom of her suite, while her stylist went to sleep in a downstairs room. Kardashian spent a while working on her computer and posting online. At that time, Kardashian routinely posted most of her daily movements and whereabouts on social media, where she also displayed her jewellery, including the large diamond engagement ring. Those details on social media may have facilitated the thieves’ targeting of her.Meanwhile, at 2am, the lobby of the residence was staffed only by one receptionist. Abderrahmane Ouatiki, 48, who is Algerian, was working as a night receptionist to fund himself as he completed a Sorbonne University PhD thesis on the semiotics of extremist discourse.Ouatiki said that after 2am he saw three masked men “with police jackets on” approach the glass door to reception and gesture to him to open up. Thinking they were police officers, he opened the door. Security camera footage from the street would later show that the men had arrived leisurely by bike or on foot, to avoid a car raising suspicions.He said they handcuffed him, showed him an automatic pistol and held another gun to his neck as they asked him: “Where is the rapper’s wife?” He knew that meant Kardashian because he had done some photocopying for her a few days before.Two of the masked men held a gun to Ouatiki and took him in the lift with them to Kardashian’s apartment. As they approached her bedroom, Ouatiki said Kardashian called out “Hello? Hello?”, thinking it might be her sister Kourtney returning from the nightclub.Kardashian told the court she was in a hotel robe ready to sleep having packed up everything including her pyjamas ready to fly back to New York the following day.She said: “I didn’t understand what was happening. I was just about to fall asleep. I was naked with a robe on and I pulled it.”The robbers only spoke French and she didn’t understand what they were saying. “I heard one of the men saying forcefully ‘ring, ring’ a few times over and pointing at his hand,” she said. The robbers found her diamond ring but were not satisfied and dragged her into another room where they found her jewellery box.Kardashian, who thought at first it was a terrorist attack, was held by the neck at gunpoint. She said: “They threw me on the bed and the smaller one started to tie my hands together with a zip tie. I was pretty hysterical. I looked at the gentleman who was the concierge and said: ‘What is going to happen to us? Are we going to die?’”She said her robe fell open and she felt certain she would be raped and shot dead.She asked Ouatiki to tell the men: “I have babies; I have to make it home. They can take everything but I have to make it home to my babies.” She said: “He just looked at me and said: ‘I don’t know what is going to happen to us.’”Kardashian was tied up, her mouth was taped over and she was dragged to the bathroom and left there while the men left the receptionist in a side-room near the hotel lobby and escaped. She later managed to loosen her hand ties against the edge of the bathroom sink.She told the court her life had changed. “It changed the way that I felt safe at home,” she said, adding that she now had up to six security guards there. “We never felt that we were unsafe before this. This experience changed everything.”In court, some of the men apologised to Kardashian. She said to Aït Khedache in court: “I forgive you for what has taken place but it does not change the emotion, the feelings, the trauma and the way my life is forever changed.”Explore more on these topicsKim KardashianParisFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

CNNreportedin April that Bukele’s government had specifically asked for nine top MS-13 leaders to be brought back to El Salvador from the US.Critics of Trump who are defending Arevalo-Chavez’s rights see the move to deport him as a way to prevent him from testifying in a US court, or becoming a federal government cooperator, to limit disclosures about Bukele’s past ties to the gang as much as possible.Arevalo-Chavez is a member of the “Ranfla Nacional”, which is considered to be a directors’ board of sorts for the MS-13 gang. Federal charges pending against him in New York include racketeering, terrorism and conspiring to commit narco-terrorism.A filing from the US justice department – dated 1 April but not unsealed until Thursday – said federal prosecutors want to dismiss charges against Arevalo-Chavez for “sensitive and important foreign policy considerations”.Prosecutors added that “geopolitical and national security concerns of the United States” and said permitting “the prosecution of the defendant to proceed in the first instance in El Salvador” was also a factor.Arevalo-Chavez is still in the US, with his attorneys requesting more information about the reasons behind the dismissal of charges and the intended deportation.The judge ruled in April to not relocate him anywhere, preventing his being placed into the custody of the US’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), which would lead to his deportation.“The ‘geopolitical and national security concerns’ appear to be an effort by the government to support a ‘deal’ with El Salvador to assist Bukele in suppressing the truth about a secret negotiation he had with MS-13 leaders in return for our government using El Salvador prisons,” Arevalo-Chavez’s attorneys said in a separate filing also unsealed on Thursday. That filing in particular mentioned the notorious Cecot prison built to house alleged gang members.The US attorney’s office for New York’s eastern federal district, where Arevalo-Chavez is being prosecuted, declined to comment Friday when asked by the Guardian. Arevalo-Chavez’s attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In mid-March, the US justice department quietly dismissed charges against another top Ranfla Nacional member andexpelled him to El Salvadorto be detained at Cecot, an acronym whose full name in Spanish means “the terrorism confinement center”. That other Ranfla leader, Cesar Humberto López-Larios, was facing similar charges in New York and also reportedly had insight about the deal Bukele previously struck with the gang.“This is collusion between two governments, the US and El Salvador, to cover up a gang pact by dropping charges on known gangsters in order to disappear them before they can testify,” said political science professor Michael Ahn Paarlberg at Virginia Commonwealth University. “It’s a criminal conspiracy between the Trump and Bukele administrations.“The irony is both of them claim to be tough on crime.”According to a justice departmentindictment, in 2019, the MS-13 leadership forged a pact with top Bukele administration officials. El Faro, a Salvadoran news organization,first reportedon secretive meetings during which Bukele officials would enter prisons in El Salvador to negotiate directly with the Ranfla leaders.As part of the deal, MS-13 would receive certain money- and land-related concessions while agreeing to reduce the amount of violence they inflicted in El Salvador. Additionally, some top MS-13 leaders were released from prison – and the gang promised to leverage its networks to support Bukele’s political party in the 2021 legislative elections, according to prosecutors.The pact purportedly collapsed in 2022, leading Bukele to engage in a massive offensive against gangs in the country. Critics say that so-called state of exception crackdown led to atrampling of due process and human rightsin the Central American nation – while also allowing Bukele to further consolidate power there.For years, Bukele has attempted to suppress any evidence of his ties to MS-13 by either attempting to recapture Ranfla leaders or by ignoring US extradition requests.Does Nayib Bukele’s campaign against democracy give a blueprint for Trump?Read moreUS federal law enforcement agencies have long pursued MS-13’s criminal networks. In 2020 and in 2022, two separate federal indictments in New York charging 27 leaders of the gang were handed up and unsealed.In 2021, the US treasury departmentsanctionedtwo top Bukele officials for their alleged “corruption”, saying they engaged in “covert negotiations between government officials and the criminal organization” in order to secure the secret pact with MS-13. The treasury department also alleged that Bukele’s administration in 2020 provided financial incentives to MS-13 to reduce gang violence in exchange for “political support”.Arevalo-Chavez, one of the co-defendants in the 2022 indictment, had “participated in negotiations with the government of El Salvador on behalf of MS-13”, said the justice department, then controlled by Joe Biden’s presidential administration. Arevalo-Chavez left El Salvador and went to Mexico, where he helped run the gang’s operations there.The Mexican government arrested Arevalo-Chavez in February 2023 and quickly transferred him to the US, where the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) took custody. He is in custody in a federal detention facility while his case proceeds.Relations between El Salvador and the US have improved since Trump took office. In 2021, tensions between Biden officials and the Bukele government flared when, despite an international arrest warrant and extradition request, Salvadoran officialsquietly releasedRanfla Nacional leader Elmer Canales-Rivera from prison. US prosecutors alleged in a 2023 letter that he was personally escorted out of prison by a high-level Bukele official, given a firearm and driven to the Guatemalan border for his escape.The Bukele administration then attempted to recapture Canales-Rivera. According toreporting from El Faro, Bukele’s government discussed a plan to pay a Mexican cartel to find Canales-Rivera and return him to El Salvador. The Mexican government found him first, arrested him, and expelled him to the US in November 2023.Eight Ranfla Nacional leaders remained in US custody after López-Larios one was expelled in March. Two of them pleaded guilty earlier this year.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationEl SalvadorUS immigrationUS politicsGangsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The NSC declined to comment.The restructuring of the NSC is expected to further reduce the agency’s influence, transforming it from a powerful policymaking body into a small organization focused more on implementing the president’s agenda than on shaping it, the sources said. In practice, the move is expected to grant more authority to the state department, the defense department and other agencies, the sources said.The aim is to reduce the size of the NSC to just a few dozen people, down from hundreds. Four sources with knowledge of the plans said they expect the final headcount at the NSC to come out to around 50 people.The NSC is the main body used by presidents to coordinate national security strategy. Its staff often make key decisions regarding the US’s approach to the world’s most volatile conflicts and play a key role in keeping the US safe.The firings will reduce the NSC’s already pared-down staff. The body had more than 300 staffers under the Democratic president Joe Biden, but even before the recent firings under Trump, it was less than half the size of Biden’s NSC.The NSC staffers who are cut from the agency will be moved to other positions in government, two of the sources told Reuters.Many conservatives have long pushed for a pared-down NSC, arguing that a number of the positions are duplicative of functions found elsewhere in the government.The NSC has had a hard time recruiting top talent in recent months. Certain key positions, like the top post overseeing Latin American affairs, were never filled on a permanent basis.Several high-ranking staffers were fired earlier in the year after the rightwing conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer presented Trump with a list of national security staffers she perceived to be disloyal.Disclosures that Waltz, the previous national security adviser, had accidentally shared information on an imminent bombing campaign in Yemen with an Atlantic journalist further dented morale.As part of the restructuring, certain sections of the NSC – known as directorates – are expected to be combined with other directorates or eliminated altogether, three sources said. In most of the directorates that remain, only a few staff are left, the sources added.Among the directorates that may cease to operate as independent bodies are those overseeing African affairs and multilateral organizations, like Nato, three sources said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS militaryTrump administrationUS politicsMarco RubionewsShareReuse this content"

We’re still here’: Wolf Alice on ambition, ageing and why new bands are strugglingRachel AroestiThey were the chart-topping, Corbyn-supporting band taking potshots at the Tories – so why do they sound so jaded about politics? As they gear up for album four, the alt-rockers explain their journey to self-discoveryFri 23 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 05.42 EDTSharePaper tablecloths, blazing sun, spitting grill, plastic chairs, dishes of tzatziki, an expectant cat sidling up to diners: we could be in Greece. “It’s like a holiday,” marvels guitarist Joff Oddie, sipping an enormous iced coffee. ButWolf Aliceare not on a Mediterranean jaunt – they’re at a restaurant on an industrial estate in Seven Sisters, north London, a few doors down from the studios where they wrote their upcoming fourth album The Clearing and itschart-topping predecessor, Blue Weekend. “We used to call this street Anchovy Mile,” reminisces front woman Ellie Rowsell. “Because it smelled like fish.” That might be the tip round the corner or, thinks bassist Theo Ellis, a nearby brewery (“something to do with filtering through fish scales”). Either way, such an odour would only cement the seafront ambience of “Costa del Tottenham”, as Ellis names it.The only thing that could disrupt the serenity of this scorching Wednesday lunchtime is a spin of Wolf Alice’s new single. Bloom Baby Bloom is a genre-bending rock bonanza: squealing guitars, bone-shaking bass, ostentatious drum fills, but also honky tonk piano and a dreamy pop chorus. Throughout Rowsell veers between breathy folk croon and a hair metal wail. To underline the retro vibe – and the vocal gymnastics – the video has Rowsell writhing in a sparkly, glam cut-out leotard amid aFame-style dance troupe; in the promo images she is clad in cherry-red hot pants and matching knee-high boots.The band aren’t just going hell for leather aesthetically. After 2021’s Blue Weekend, the foursome left indie label Dirty Hit and signed with Columbia Records, part of Sony. The move to a major means more money for spangly Lycra – but is it also a sign of prospective world domination?“English bands are so hesitant to ever admit ambition, but I am ambitious with this record,” says drummer Joel Amey. Sony has the ability to spread the word globally, says Oddie: “I’d like every person to be able to have the opportunity to say whether they like or don’t likeWolf Alice.” Ellis looks bemused: “That’s a dangerous thing to wish!”By many measures, Wolf Alice are already colossally successful. They are Brit and Mercury award-winners, and Grammy-nominated. Blue Weekend reached No 1, while their first two albums only narrowly missed the top spot. In 2016, they were the subject of aMichael Winterbottom film; the director called them “the best band in the world”. They’re high up onnext month’s Glastonburybill. “In many ways, bucket lists have been filled like five years ago,” admits Amey.They have transcended the folk-punk shoegaze of their formative years to become omnivorous guitar music masters, incorporating hardcore, chamber pop, country, industrial, funk and psychedelia. On The Clearing they nod to krautrock, glam and trip-hop; one song sounds like a bossa nova Carpenters, another recalls Steely Dan’s Reelin’ in the Years. Yet what made the band an instant success story remains the same – Rowsell’s precise, poetic millennial vignettes, and an ability to make every song stylish and memorable. As a genre, rock is experiencing a decades-long decline; there are no journeymen any more. “Our peers have come and gone,” says Amey. “We’re still here.” The only way to be a rich and famous – or even solvent and vaguely recognisable – rock band in this day and age is to be exceptionally good at it.View image in fullscreenColossally successful … the band winning the Mercury prize in 2018.Photograph: Jo Hale/RedfernsAnd yet, you might also consider Wolf Alice underrated. They’ve never had a hit single. Gratifyingly, their most popular song on Spotify is also their best – 131m streams for 2017’s Don’t Delete the Kisses, which preserves the turbulent ecstasy of fledgling love in hypnotic indie electronica – but that’s mostly due to a “really big” TV sync. Which was …? They puzzle over the answer. Heartbreaker? suggests Rowsell. Heartstopper! says Ellis, suddenly remembering the name of Netflix’s queer teen drama phenomenon. While Oddie seems the most business-minded (he tells me the band “wouldn’t work if it wasn’t making money”), Ellis and Rowsell clearly can’t fake an Ed Sheeran-style stats fixation.It’s a decade since Wolf Alice’s debut album My Love Is Cool. Oddie’s face lights up when reminiscing about the low-stakes euphoria of nascent rock stardom. “Everything was a win. People coming up to you and saying that they liked your music; being buzzed about 20 people turning up to a gig in Leicester!” At that point they had been a proper band for less than three years – originally Wolf Alice was an acoustic duo comprising Oddie and Rowsell, who met via an internet forum. But nostalgia makes Rowsell shudder: she can’t believe her youthful chutzpah, performing songs she didn’t know on instruments she couldn’t play. “I didn’t even know …”“Where A was?” says Ellis.“I still don’t know where A is …” she mutters mordantly.I first met the band in the run-up to that album’s release, and they remain meticulously self-deprecating. Ellis and Rowsell both grew up in north London and still live here, as does Oddie (Amey has moved to Hastings). On The Clearing’s sweetly harmonic closer, The Sofa, Rowsell reflects on youthful fantasies of escape to California, but sounds almost relieved at the prospect of being “stuck in Seven Sisters” for ever.But Wolf Alice are not immune to the march of time. They are all now in their 30s, and The Clearing is a meditation on the first stage of the ageing process, a time when the “frantic” struggle to navigate adult life begins to ease, says Rowsell.On Play It Out, a kind of self-soothing lullaby, Rowsell contemplates the rest of her life: a future without children and, eventually, parents. She wonders whether she’ll still be valued and adored “when my body can no longer make a mother out of me” – an anxiety partly prompted by acquaintances on social media posting about “their mums or their partners being mums. It was the nicest things I’d ever heard coming from men about women. I was like:oh myGod, I hope that you can not be a mother and people can think you’re that amazing.” The proverb “the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world” was also stuck in her head: on Play It Out, Rowsell attempts to make peace with the inescapable spectre of motherhood, even if it only exists in the form of “an empty pram in my mind”.Rowsell has an extraordinary ability to whittle her internal monologue into lyrics, but on The Clearing she begins to doubt her instincts. Opening song Thorns reflects wryly on Blue Weekend’s account of a devastating breakup – that she must be a “narcissist” to literally make a “song and dance” about the split. At the time, she claimed Blue Weekend was her least autobiographical album. “Yeah, I was lying!” she laughs.In reality, the album combined real details with fictionalised elements, which often felt like the worst of both worlds. “I was like, maybe it’s not truthful, or it makes it sound worse.” Did she regret writing it? “I wasn’t sitting there being like:nooo,” she says, miming anxious despair. “Well, actually I was …” Rowsell still doesn’t know how much of her real life to put into her music. “What is the stuff that’s supposed to be kept for your DMC [deep meaningful conversation] with your mate? If I’m such a private person then why am I doing this?!” Does she find writing about her problems cathartic? “I must do because look how much stress it’s caused me!”View image in fullscreen‘If I’m such a private person then why am I doing this?’ … Ellie Rowsell.Photograph: Rachel Fleminger HudsonOn the new album, Amey – too unwell to come to lunch, so we speak the following day – offers Rowsell a brief respite by taking the mic and pouring his own heart out. The sonic touchstones for the song White Horses were The Sunshine Underground by the Chemical Brothers, and Can; the lyrical inspiration was the lifelong mystery surrounding his heritage.Previously, the 34-year-old had no handle on it. Taxi drivers routinely asked “if I was from where they’re from because of my dark colouring”, but he couldn’t say either way, because his mum and aunt were adopted. Then Amey’s family found out his grandmother was from Saint Helena – a discovery that chimed with the “strange in-perspective bullshit that starts happening in your 30s”. The resulting track alludes to his grandmother’s “very tough” journey to England and doubles as a love letter to his chosen family: his friends and bandmates.Everyone agrees that they’re in Wolf Alice for the long haul. But while getting old in a band is par for the course for men, there’s an added self-consciousness for women. Rowsell ends Play It Out with an optimistic manifesto: she wants to “age with excitement – go grey and feel delighted”. She is “less worried” about her future as a frontwoman than she used to be, she says, partly thanks to a selection of inspirational peers, including Charli xcx, Caroline Polachek and Self Esteem.All three of those women are knowingly camp and committed to mining cool from unlikely places – all of which Wolf Alice are doing in their flamboyant new era. When Rowsell, 32, was growing up in the 00s, zeitgeisty rock was “quite cold and aggressive, black and white, not warm” – think angular post-punk revivalists such as Interpol. The Clearing skews instead towards “softer and more colourful” 1970s guitar music; Fleetwood Mac, Pentangle and Steely Dan were all references. Liking soft rock was “embarrassing for so long”, she continues. “I don’t care any more.” The bold new look is an extension of this. When Rowsell was younger she agonised over wearing the right thing. “Now I’m so tired of caring that I just want to do something fun.” Not funny, though. “I don’t want people to think it’s a joke,” she says. “It’s self-aware, but not self-deprecating.”The Clearing was recorded in LA, with Adele’s producer Greg Kurstin, but its gestation period ran from spring 2023 to the end of 2024. Rowsell says that witnessing everyone “noodling” and “pottering” in Get Back, Peter Jackson’s epic Beatles documentary trilogy, inspired a leisurely, tech-free, in-person writing process. Yet the band assure me it is merely a coincidence that the beginning of the album sounds so Beatlesque: Thorns’ pared-back piano intro and swelling strings land somewhere between Let It Be and I Am the Walrus. “Every song sounds a bit like the Beatles,” says Oddie. “They invented everything.”View image in fullscreenWolf Alice play the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury 2016.Photograph: Samir Hussein/RedfernsThey are well aware that having such space and time is a luxury for a band, especially in the current economic climate. Costs of touring have almost doubled since they started, Oddie explains, but ticket prices have only increased by a small amount. Plus, it was hard enough back then – the foursome were only able to make tours viable by cramming themselves into a single small hotel room or sleeping on friends’ floors. The tacit agreement was that the stay would turn into a party, say Oddie. “You’d be having big nights out for weeks on end, it was exhausting.” But even that didn’t last. “If your friends start leaving uni and you’re doing a regional tour, you’re like: I don’t actually know that many people in Sheffield now I’m 23,” says Ellis.Last week, Oddie told MPs in a parliamentary meeting that he didn’t know how his band would survive if they were starting out today. He was giving evidence as part of an effort to safeguard the future of live music in the UK amid rocketing costs and shuttering venues, suggesting a £1 levy on tickets for larger gigs, with the proceeds going to support up-and-coming acts on tour (the band are donating £1 from each UK ticket sale to help grassroots venues).His appearance recalls the late 2010s, when Wolf Alice were never far from the cut and thrust of Whitehall. The band heavily endorsed Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 election, played anti-Tory marches and kicked off their2018 Brixton Academy showwith Danny Dyer’s expletive-riddled viral rant about Brexit, in which he called David Cameron a “twat”.Back then, they were driven by a genuine optimism about Corbyn’s message and the excitement of being part of a genre-uniting “youthquake”; 2017 was the year Stormzy paid tribute to the Grenfell victims and participated in pro-Corbyn chants at Glastonbury. It all seems like a very long time ago. Can they see themselves speaking out about politics again? “It depends if we’re represented by someone,” says Ellis. “Personally, I don’t feel particularly represented right now by many things.” Oddie thinks they should use their platform “sparingly – if you talk all the time about something, people switch off.”‘People think I’ve gone crazy’: indie sensation Cameron Winter on leaving crowds in tears with his wild lyrics and supernatural voiceRead moreThe band’s focus is now on some secret-ish Irish dates (they never officially announced them; they sold out anyway) to warm up for that Glastonbury performance and Radio 1’s Big Weekend, although Ellis is concerned he might have forgotten “how to stand”. For their end-of-year arena tour, they’re hoping to transform their usually straightforward live show into a spectacle: the current West End production of Cabaret, which Rowsell recently took Ellis to see, may be an influence; there might be a wind machine. With an exceptional – if characteristically unconventional – new album and major label money behind them, perhaps Wolf Alice will also take things to the next level commercially this time. But global superstardom isn’t the be-all and end-all; to be honest, they seem more than happy on Anchovy Mile.Bloom Baby Bloom is out now on Columbia Records.

Let’s go with karate man. He’s in the basement of his house in Los Angeles. “My daughter’s working upstairs, my son’s working, I’ve been relegated to the dungeon,” he says. I continue: “So exactly how good are you at karate?”Forty-one years since he first became Daniel LaRusso, Macchio is back in the role for Karate Kid: Legends. In this fictive universe, it’s three years since the end ofNetflix series Cobra Kaiand LaRusso has settled into his gardening gloves and embraced the spirit of his own mentor, Mr Miyagi, whose graceful, defensive karate style, Miyagi-Do, was all about never looking for a fight. Jackie Chan (reprising the role of Mr Han from the 2010 reboot The Karate Kid) comes to beg of him one more job.No spoilers, of course, but to have been winning at this for more than 41 years, the mask must surely have become the face: he must be really good? “I should really be the world champion,” Macchio says. “If I truly had trained for 41 years, every day, that’s probably where I’d be, or I would have so many broken bones and pulled muscles that I’d have moved on. It was easier when I was in my early 20s, now it’s much tougher. I’m not as limber. But I passed my black belt in Gōjū-ryū, that Miyagi-Do style we did in the Cobra Kai series. It’s far more defensive and less flamboyant than some of the super flippy styles.”View image in fullscreenMacchio and Chan promoting Karate Kid: Legends in London this month.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAIn Karate Kid: Legends, Mr Han is mentoring a teenager, Li Fong (Ben Wang). He’s the key svengali, no doubt, but LaRusso arrives midway through, to introduce some karate to boost the kung fu. “You make a Karate Kid movie,” Macchio says, “you better have a great kid, right? He’s wonderful.” Heiswonderful – with a funny, slightly anxious face, like a trainee accountant who thinks he doesn’t like parties, but is really stoked to have been invited to one. “He’s my favourite thing in the movie,” says Macchio. “He does almost all his own stunts, he’s really doing the work.”The whole film is a love letter to fighting with heart. I would not have predicted how enjoyable that would be. Macchio makes a stab at explaining the charm of the choreography. “The camera’s very inside the fights – the Karate Kid films that I made, certainly the first movie, was very cinematic, wide, you saw everything happen. This has a lot of cuts, it’s a bit jarring but it’s exciting. It’s 2025, this is how they make movies now. The Marvelisation of fight scenes, along with the video gamification-isation, and the desensitisation of the younger viewers, it’s nice to bring it back and feel that you’re in it.”But you can’t understand the longevity of the Karate Kid franchise without engaging with the sport itself. “Hopefully the through-line, which has always been the theme of the Karate Kid universe, is that fighting is always the last answer to the problem,” Macchio says. “It’s all about training and how to build confidence and how to defend yourself, but always with the question: at what point do you use these skills? When everything else has failed. Those roots are the grounding of martial arts, which were never intended to build warriors to kill people.”After the first Karate Kid iteration, Macchio made other films, notably My Cousin Vinny, “a late-for-dinner movie. You’re just going to be late for dinner because you have to wait for every scene, the way it sets up and pays off.” But he didn’t get a lot of work. “I was doing smaller roles or writing more and directing shorts,” he says of these lean years, “but I had a lot of time for my kids.”View image in fullscreenMacchio as Daniel LaRusso in Cobra Kai.Photograph: Album/AlamyThey weren’t wild about the Karate Kid films. “When you’re four years old, you don’t really want to watch your dad get beat up,” he says. And he didn’t try to instil any martial arts. “No, not only did I not teach them that, I didn’t teach them how to use the chopsticks. They think I can catch flies with them, but that was a little bit of movie magic.”It was more than the school run that kept Macchio on the margins of Hollywood for basically 20 years. “Being a celebrity is what I didn’t take to. I’ve always kept one foot in and one foot out. And sometimes you need to have both feet in to survive the game.” He might have also been a little too pure. “At the end of the game, it’s showbusiness,” he says, never sounding more Italian American than with that emphasis, “so they’re trying to say, OK, how can we milk this and create the next return on investment, while I’m trying to protect the truth of the character.”He appeared in HBO’s series The Deuce, which is brilliant, but his role was small. He didn’t mind that. “Four scenes or an arc in a great indie film, that’s attractive as well. Being the guy, being the franchise, it comes with a lot of responsibility and pressure.” In 2005, Pat Morita, who’d played Mr Miyagi, died of kidney failure, and Macchio and Billy Zabka, who played LaRusso’s original arch-enemy Johnny Lawrence, were in the same room for the first time in years.“If you would have told me then, Billy Zabka would be one of my best friends … There was about 20 years that I hadn’t seen him. We were at the funeral, it was a really poignant moment. I was nervous because I was about to speak, there was a bunch of emotions. I looked across, and I saw Billy, and for the first time, it was like we were on the same side of the mat, because we were both there to honour our friend.”View image in fullscreenMacchio with Pat Morita as Mr Miyagi in The Karate Kid (1984).Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyZabka was much more open to revisiting the Karate Kid franchise; Macchio says he’d said no “for thirtysomething years”. Then Cobra Kai came along. Its creators,Josh Heald,Jon HurwitzandHayden Schlossbergare “some of the biggest Karate Kid fans I’ve ever met,” Macchio says. “They know way more about that film than I do. Listen, it’s 65 episodes. That’s a heck of a run, during the pandemic and everything else. We were the comfort food when there was nothing else to watch.”Karate Kid: Legends is an incredibly warming, quite innocent, ensemble piece, in which you really root for the young cast in harmony, like watching Fame. Their personal triumphs and disasters are all routed through physical discipline, but it takes such a reassuring rhythm that you never have any doubt they’ll get there. I remember my kid saying, “What I take from this is that literally everybody can become the best person in the world at karate.” Which is kind of the point of the original film, that any kid can win, just by trying. It’s an elegy to stickability that it seems nobody can get enough of, whatever their generation.“I was just in Mexico City,” says Macchio. “There must have been 10,000 people looking at the entrance to the film premiere, chanting my name, ages eight to 80, as if I was a matador. Come on! That’s a wonderful thing to be a part of.”Karate Kid: Legends is released on 28 MayExplore more on these topicsFilmThe Karate KidinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It is set in a luxurious Utah megalodge which winds up resembling theDr Strangelovewar room, mixed with the apartment from Hitchcock’s Rope. Mountainhead is a super-satirical chamber piece about the deranged, cynical and facetious mindset of the uber-wealthy, the kind of people who think about ancient Rome every day, though not about Nero and his violin. It may not have the dramatic richness of Armstrong’s TV meisterwerk while the pure testosterone of this all-male main cast (minus anyShiv figure) is oppressive – though that is kind of the point. The pure density of weapons-grade zingers in the script is a marvel.Our heroes are four unspeakable American tech plutocrats, a billionaire boys club with one mere centi-millionaire who isn’t up to “bill” status; this beta-male cuck of their peer group is nicknamed “Soup Kitchen” because of his poverty, and he is their eager host. They are exactly the kind of people with whom legacy media aristocrat Logan Roy (played inSuccessionby Brian Cox) would once grit his teeth and take meetings, vainly hoping for investment. These masters of the universe are getting together for an alpha bros’ hang-slash-poker-weekend, razzing and bantering with each other with deadly seriousness about their respective wealth levels, at this mega-lodge that is called Mountainhead. As one guest asks: “Is that like The Fountainhead? Your interior designer is Ayn Bland …?”They are: Venis, played by Cory Michael Smith, a preening Elon Musk figure who has just dropped a whole new set of AI-creation tools to his social media platform which is allowing anyone to create explosively divisive deepfakes, and so the guys’ phones are now pinging with news of imminent global war.Steve Carellplays grey-haired Randall, the ageing member of the group, an OG investor and a sort of Peter Thiel type who is repressing thoughts about his cancer diagnosis, calling his doctor “stupid” and brooding about uploading his consciousness to the net as a posthuman. Ramy Youssef plays Jeff, the relative liberal of the group; he is a very un-Bezos Jeff, like a Biden-era Mark Zuckerberg with a touch of Nick Clegg. Jeff’s team have developed a filter allowing users to distinguish real content from fake which Venis wants to buy, maybe because it’s profitable, or maybe to suppress it. Jeff keeps acidly mocking his comrades in ways that will remind you of Shiv or maybe Roman. And Jason Schwarztman is Soup Kitchen, or Soups, who yearns pathetically to bring out a new meditation app.As chaos spreads out there in the super-poor world, the guys – who in any case despise nation states with their tiresome regulatory interventions – discuss the need to “coup out” South American countries or even the US. Things get even darker from there. Throughout it all, the impossibly sophisticated backchat continues, like background radiation, with the guys competitively insisting on how hilarious it all is: “Nothing means anything – and everything’s funny!” Yet Venis earnestly insists his platform can save the world: “Once one Palestinian kid sees some really bananas content from one Israeli kid – it’s all over!” The guys are driven mostly by macho recklessness; they loathe “AI-doomism and decelerationist alarmism”.So what happens when the chaos they’ve unleashed on the world’s systems actually impacts on them personally in their Mountainhead hideaway? Well, it’s a flaw in the film. At one point, Soups turns the tap on and no water comes out. How is this crisis going to work out? A little perfunctorily, as it happens. More than any comedy or even film I’ve seen recently, this is movie driven by the line-by-line need for fierce, nasty, funny punched-up stuff in the dialogue, and narrative arcs and character development aren’t the point. But as with Succession, this does a really good job of persuading you that, yes, this is what our overlords are really like.Mountainhead is on HBO and Max from 31 May, and on Sky Cinema and NOW from 1 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsDrama filmsJesse ArmstrongSteve CarellJason SchwartzmanComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Like the music industry, television has seen its entire business model upended by the streaming revolution this century. That has meant what was once a universal activity – an entire nation sat around the glow of the old cathode ray tube – has been replaced by people watching a galaxy of different shows, or watching the same show but at completely different times.Still, the monoculture isn’t entirely dead. A look atthe listof each year’s most-watched broadcasts in the UK from TV ratings agency Barb shows that, for all the changes that have come with streaming, tens of millions of us still have an appetite for mass entertainment. That list, based on consolidated ratings (ie viewed within seven days of a show’s broadcast) isn’t a perfect encapsulation of the state of telly: its focus is British, not global; TV’s golden age doesn’t get a look in (shows like The Wire were hardly ratings hits, and for many, were discovered long after they were broadcast); and perhaps most significantly, streaming isn’t fully represented – Netflix, for example, only signed up to Barb in 2022 (though maybe that doesn’t matter: surprisingly, Netflix shows rarely crack Barb’s weekly top 20). But it is the best measure available for getting a sense of what people have watched over the past two and a half decades.To make sense of it, I spoke to TV journalistPhil Harrison. He’s the author ofThe Age of Static: How TV Explains Modern Britain, which covers British television from 2000 onwards, so if anyone can explain how TV has changed in that time, it’s him. Here’s the list and what we can learn from it …The full list2000| Coronation Street2001| Only Fools and Horses2002| Only Fools and Horses2003| Coronation Street2004| Euro 2004: England v Portugal2005| Coronation Street2006| World Cup: England v Sweden2007| EastEnders2008| Wallace & Gromit: A Matter of Loaf and Death2009| Britain’s Got Talent final2010| The X Factor final2011| The Royal Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton2012| Olympics Closing Ceremony2013| New Year’s Eve Fireworks2014| World Cup Final: Germany v Argentina2015| The Great British Bake Off final2016| The Great British Bake Off2017| Blue Planet 22018| World Cup: Croatia v England2019| Gavin & Stacey, Christmas special2020| Prime Ministerial Statement on Covid-192021| Euro 2020: England v Denmark2022| The Funeral Service of Queen Elizabeth II2023| The Coronation of King Charles III2024| Gavin & Stacey: The FinaleEvents, dear boy! Events!View image in fullscreenBoris Johnson announces the first coronavirus lockdown, addressing the nation from 10 Downing Street.Photograph: PA Video/PAOur list shows that the biggest TV ratings this century have been for major cultural or news events. This might sound completely unsurprising – but it wasn’t always the case.“In previous decades, you see TV premieres of films and more scripted drama and comedy at the top of these lists, but viewers have become more atomised and niche-occupying,” says Phil. “Various quite popular things have stopped being national events as the amount of choice, channels and platforms has expanded. Apart from a few outliers, communal national TV watching is now basically about live events with assumed national importance.”This means Covid briefings or royal funerals – or, more cheerily, sporting events or the New Year’s Eve fireworks. “Though why so many people watched that live in 2013, I have no idea,” Phil rightly wonders.Big Brother’s influence looms largeThe emergence of reality TV is another theme on the list, with singing contests and then Bake Off taking the top slots. But the show that perhaps defined the reality boom – Big Brother – is surprisingly absent. Still, says Phil, its fingerprints are all over this list.“The innovations it spawned have driven TV discourse,” he says. “I think a few shows on here – the eliminative format, ‘ordinary people’ as the stars – can be at least tangentially linked to it. You could tie X Factor to it, Bake Off too. It opened up a space and introduced a broad, adaptable idea that literally dozens of shows have since occupied.”A case in point: the most watched show of 2025 so far is The Traitors – “another show with plenty of Big Brother’s DNA”, says Phil.The fat lady is singing for soap operasAs the appetite for reality TV has grown across the 21st century, the popularity of soaps has plummeted. Once dominant in these end-of-year lists, EastEnders and Coronation Street now consider it a strong night if they crack the 5m mark – as EastEnders just about managed for its much-trailed 40th anniversary live episode.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWith their endless ongoing storylines soaps are particularly ill-suited to the age of the binge, says Phil: “It’s quite a job keeping on top of them, what with all the other options. And streaming shows have, to an extent, taken their place: so open-ended in narrative terms, so expansive in terms of run time and so impossible to kill – Stranger Things has been running for a decade. They’ve essentially become high-production value soaps.”But it’s not just the delivery method, says Phil – but the actual drama itself: “I just don’t know if they reflect people’s lives any more. You can’t really see 2025 London in EastEnders. You can’t see 2025 Manchester in Corrie. They’re like living period pieces and for that reason, I just can’t imagine they gain many new, young fans.”That’s borne out by starklydeclining numbersfor EastEnders and Coronation Street among 16- to 34-year-olds – though Hollyoaks has bucked the trend with that age group,according to Channel 4, by releasing fewer episodes a week and shaving its runtime down to an attention-span-friendly 20 minutes.Gavin& Stacey aims for the middleView image in fullscreenNessa (Ruth Jones), Stacey (Joanna Page), Gwen (Melanie Walters), Bryn (Rob Brydon), Gavin (Mathew Horne) in Gavin & Stacey.Photograph: BBC/Toffee International Ltd./Tom Jackson/PA WireOf course it’s not just soaps: scripted TV is largely absent from our list from the 2010s onwards. There’s one major exception: Gavin & Stacey, which appears twice on this list, with last December’s finale attracting 19.1 million viewers.How has a cheerful, low-stakes romantic comedy set in south Wales proved so ratings-conqueringly successful? By aiming squarely for the middle, says Phil. “It’s intelligently written without being hard to swallow. It’s knowing and self-conscious but also has incredibly universal themes: romance, the minor irritations and routines of family life, getting older etc. And it’s really fond and respectful of its own characters – there’s no real snark in it, or victims, or perpetual butts of the joke: it started in the late 00s at the time of loads of cringe comedy, stuff that occasionally veered towards cruelty and there’s absolutely none of that.“Also,” Phil adds, “it’s got a really good cast. Rob Brydon, Alison Steadman and Ruth Jones are all great at what they do – and even James Corden hits his beats among certain people!”What sums up 21st-century TV?Which show on the list best explains UK TV in the last 25 years? With Big Brother ineligible, Phil opts for The Great British Bake Off, a show seeminglyin sync with the nation’s psyche, from its name onwards: “That title prefix The Great British … is emblematic of the desperate search for a workable national identity that we’ve been embarking on throughout the 21st century.”It’s also, says Phil, the show that best demonstrates how reality TV – the dominant genre of 2000-2025 – has evolved: “It feels like we tried slightly cruel variations on reality TV early on in the century and then decided we preferred nice, twee ones instead. With bunting.”If you want to read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletterTelevisionReality TVTelevision industrynewslettersShareReuse this content"

Washed up on a remote island populated only by animals, service unit Roz (voiced by Lupita Nyong’o) finds it has no one to serve. That is until it falls on to a goose’s nest, killing all its occupants apart from runt of the litter Brightbill (Kit Connor) – who imprints on Roz as his mother. Assisted by Pedro Pascal’s cynical fox Fink, the ever helpful machine reprogrammes itself to rear the gosling well enough so he can migrate with the other geese. The Disney-style anthropomorphising is a bit overdone, but it’s a film full of warmth and wit.Simon WardellExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Does it add value or reflect YouTube’s increasing might?Fiona SturgesFri 23 May 2025 08.00 EDTShareIt is four in the afternoon at Pellicci’s, a family-run cafe on Bethnal Green Road in London that has been an East End institution for 125 years. Its famously loudmouthed owners, British-Italian siblings Nevio and Anna, have been serving fry-ups, soups, pasta and jam roly-polies since eight this morning. The cafe is now closed, but Anna and Nevio are just getting started on their second job as hosts of the podcast seriesDown the Caff, in which they interview people about food and life over a meal of the guest’s choosing. The conversations are sweary, chaotic and an absolute hoot.Their guests so far include actor and Pellicci’s regular Ray Winstone, Dexys’ Kevin Rowland, rapper Hak Baker and 86-year-old YouTuber Marge Keefe, AKA Grime Gran. Today’s interviewees are TikTok star John Fisher, AKA Big John, and his son, the boxer Johnny Fisher. When I tell Anna she must be due a lie down, she says: “Tell me about it. In fact, tell him!” pointing at their longsuffering producer George Sexton-Kerr, who is busy moving Formica tables around to make way for the film crew.Why the film crew, I hear you ask? Podcasts are for ears, not eyes, aren’t they? It’s because the past 18 months have brought a shift in how pods are consumed, with scores of shows moving into video. In February, YouTube announced it had 1 billion monthly users watching podcast content, meaning the platform has leapfrogged Spotify (which in 2023 reported 100 million regular podcast listeners) and Apple to become the market leader. Little wonder Spotify is trying to catch up, with many of its top podcasts, including TheJoe RoganExperience, The Mel Robbins Podcast and Call Her Daddy now publishing in video.This year, the BBC launched The Traitors: Uncloaked and Uncanny: Post Mortem in video as well as audio formats, while Business Insider has reported that Netflix is also preparing to move into visualised pods. Reflecting this trend, the British Podcast awards has this year added a new visual innovation award for “outstanding visual podcasting”. All of which means, like it or not, visualised podcasts – or vodcasts, as some are calling them – are happening.Speaking to both listeners and creators about this brave new audiovisual world, it seems opinions are divided. Dedicated audiophiles quite reasonably ask why they would want to watch a podcast when their TV to-watch list is already out of control, but others say they enjoy having a choice and it can be fun to see the hosts whose voices they know so well. I also spoke to several independent audio producers who don’t wish to be named, who worry about YouTube’s dominance over the industry and are sceptical of audio being restyled as “crap telly”.That’s not to say that visualised podcasts are expected to compete with mainstream TV: just as celebrity interviewer Amelia Dimoldenberg, the host of YouTube’s Chicken Shop Date, can exist alongside Graham Norton on the BBC, so can visualised pods exist in parallel with better resourced and produced television shows. Nonetheless, as a listener and podcast critic, I confess I too have reservations. For me, the delight of audio lies in the intimacy of having voices and soundscapes piped straight into my ears and sparking my imagination. Plus, I do most of my listening while doing other things such as cooking and walking the dog. The last thing I need is another form of entertainment that requires me to gape at a screen.Seeing fun, silly or serious stuff makes someone far more likely to hit Follow on the podcast appMatt DeeganI am, however, up for watching pods where the visuals have a clear purpose and Down the Caff, which launched last year, is absolutely one of those. Sexton-Kerr, a radio and pod producer who took two years to persuade Anna and Nevio to make the series, imagined it as an audiovisual package from the off. “I always wanted it to be a multifaceted thing. It’s partly about the food, and Anna and Nev, who are this brilliant double act. But it’s also about the beauty of just sitting in here over a cup of tea and having a chat. It’s a grade II-listed building with all this art deco panelling and you need to see that.”Nevio adds that, during the first couple of episodes, “Me and Anna didn’t know what we were doing, so it’s a lot of people shouting over each other. But we’ve got better, mainly because George has been telling us off. We’re thinking a bit more about how it will work [in audio and visual mediums] now.”When my producer friends talk about pods as “crap telly”, they are referring to interview pods and chat-casts that, in theory, lend themselves to a visual format. For productions such as Begin Again With Davina McCall, Fashion Neurosis With Bella Freud or Call Her Daddy, this means you see hosts and interviewees on TV sets arranged like fancy living rooms complete with coffee-table books and mood lighting.Often, though, it’s a camera squeezed into a sound booth or, worse, a crummy Zoom recording. One such offender isThe Rest Is Politics, the chart-topping series presented byRory Stewart and Alastair Campbell. Since the hosts are rarely in the same place, viewers invariably watch them in split screen, each beaming in fuzzily from their respective hotel rooms or home offices. Not for nothing did YouTube executive Pedro Pina recently say that The Rest Is Politics “feels like a high school [production]”, adding that “viewers determine the production values that they’re prepared to accept” – a polite way of saying that the show’s audience don’t care about quality.Matt Deegan, a partner at the podcast marketing company Podcast Discovery, says: “For some audiences it’s less about consuming a podcast and more about consuming ‘a show’. There are definitely younger audiences who don’t listen to audio podcasts but are very comfortable on YouTube.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionNo matter the production values, the video versions can be easily clipped up for social media, boosting audience awareness of the shows. For a podcast looking to grow its audience, says Deegan, “the repetition of seeing fun, informative, silly or serious stuff from a show makes someone far more likely to hit Follow on their podcast app”. This is echoed by Sexton-Kerr, who notes: “We’re sticking minute-long Down the Caff reels up on Insta and TikTok and we’re getting more than 400,000 views on some of them. You can’t pay for that kind of publicity.”For interview pods, the benefit of video content is clear, not least because it’s straightforward to make. Turning a narrative podcast into a decent visual proposition is a far bigger challenge, though there are already podcasters giving it a go. George Mpanga (AKA George the Poet) and Benbrick, creators ofHave You Heard George’s Podcast?, the Peabody award-winning series about race, history and culture, are in the process of going back over their audio episodes and remaking them for a video audience.“We need to go where the audience is,” Benbrick explains. “Even if your strategy is audio-first, it is insane to leave out [YouTube]. And if you’re going there, you might as well give that content the best chance to resonate. It kind of feels you can do anything right now, so we’re trying it out and seeing what it could look like. I don’t think it’s in its final form yet.”Does all this spell doom for audio? While some in the industry worry that visualised content could further squeeze indie podcasters out of a crowded market, Benbrick believes it will create space “for productions that really consider their audio. With video content it’s hard to do really intricate audio work and, as a producer, I want what I put out to sound beautiful. This is a moment to make exceptional work.”Back at Pellicci’s, as Nevio plonks down two enormous platefuls of jam tart on our table, Sexton-Kerr says he is certain it will all shake out. “It’s like that song Video Killed the Radio Star, isn’t it? But we still have radio stars. I have podcasts that I still love listening to, so I think there’s space for both. They’ll just live next door to each other.”Explore more on these topicsPodcastsYouTubeSpotifyVideo on demandDigital music and audiofeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a high-octane, unpredictable mix, only unified by the fact that when Debbie is on the decks, the energy is up.Bringing this ungovernable, quickfire sensibility to club lineups alongside the likes of Welsh producer Kelly Lee Owens and American rapper Zack Fox, Ijaduola has recently been releasing her own productions, seemingly taking inspiration from the need to get her crowds moving and to keep them on the floor. Her debut release, 2024’s Juicy for Ya, easily fulfilled that premise with its chipmunk-tuned vocal sample and skittering kick drums, primed to reverberate through the body when firing out of a large speaker stack, while this year’s No Signal channels an Eric Prydz-style trance synth.It might sound like an irreverent set of tunes but on her upcoming debut EP Jellyfish, Ijaduola gets more serious. Darker, heavier and intensely propulsive, across its seven tracks there are shades of Goldie’s Rufige Kru alias on the hammering drum’n’bass of Medusa, Special Request’s chopped breakbeats on the title track and Coki’s bass weight on Float. This is lively music to inspire the late-night crew. And yet, in Medusa there’s also a joyous sample of what sounds like Homer Simpson screaming; on Jellyfish a jazz Rhodes lick tastefully rolls through, maintaining the chaotic playfulness that ultimately makes Ijaduola’s music so hard to resist.Ammar KaliaThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenHeartwarming … Wednesday.Photograph: Graham TolbertWednesday – Elderberry WineElderberries can heal – but make you puke when eaten raw, says Wednesday’s Karly Hartzman, taking them as inspiration for this pedal-steel-sweetened heartwarmer about striking the right balance in relationships.LSKieran Hebden and William Tyler – If I Had a BoatAfter 2023’s Darkness, Darkness, the guitarist and producer unveil a full-length album, led by this 11-minute Lyle Lovett cover: fine acoustic chiming fractures into pointillist, dancing electronics.LSMark William Lewis – TomorrowIs PerfectThe superb London singer-songwriter, who sits somewhere between Dean Blunt and Prefab Sprout, is the first signing to A24’s in-house label.

Recorded with drummer Mark Richardson in recovery and bassist Cass undergoing chemotherapy, their first album in nine years confronts such issues with candour and defiance. Opener An Artist Is an Artist stridently lays down the manifesto: over an infectious collision of electro-pop and post-punk, singer Skin insists that a true creative will not be denied by ageing or menopause. The vocalist subsequently addresses challenges ranging from the hedonistic rock lifestyle to her own family history.View image in fullscreenSkunk Anansie: The Painful Truth.Musically, producer David Sitek of TV on the Radio has urged them to throw off the shackles of their 90s rock sound and be unafraid to go wherever experimentation takes them. Songs hurtle through electronic rock, ska, dub and even tinkling pianos as moods shift from urgent to ethereal. Singer Skin digs deep into her personal well for Shame (“I got the love from my mother, the pain from my dad”), but allows a moment of euphoria on the catchy My Greatest Moment. The album’s sense of emotional investment and creative rejuvenation reaches a sublime apex with the closing track, Meltdown. Skin’s delicate vocals give the song about a lonely breakdown a raw, disarming beauty.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

The theme is woman, the theme is marginalised people, the theme is to be a voice to the voiceless community.”Mushtaq, from the Karnataka region of southern India, has been “awake all night”, she says, as we speak on the morning after she won theInternational Booker prizein London for her book Heart Lamp. The prize is shared between Mushtaq and her translator Deepa Bhasthi, who is also present – and also had no sleep.View image in fullscreenIt’s a year of firsts for the International Booker: this is the first time that a collection of stories has won; it’s the first winner from the Kannada language; and it’s Mushtaq’s first book to appear in English. At 77, she is also the oldest winner.Yet Mushtaq, a lawyer and social activist as well as a writer, has been publishing stories since 1981; Heart Lamp represents just a selection from her career. They are powerful accounts of the lives of Muslim women in Karnataka, portraying terrible experiences – domestic violence, deaths of children. In the final story, a woman is glad she gave birth to a boy instead of another girl. “At least we had not created another helpless prisoner of life like me.”Do these stories reflect how things still are for women in the region? “Yes,” says Mushtaq. “Even today. It starts from the home itself.”But the stories have wider application too. For example, any parent can empathise with the woman in one story,Red Lungi, struggling to entertain her children during the summer holidays. “Even though these stories are set in a certain community in a certain geographical location,” says Bhasthi, who was born and still lives in Madikeri in the Western Ghat mountains, just 60 miles or so from Mushtaq’s home town. “I think the ideas and stories are absolutely universal.”How does Mushtaq’s work as a lawyer and activist inform her writing? “They are the fields where I sow the seeds of my stories. When people come to me with a legal issue, they want to share all their feelings […] which haunt me like anything. It goes on growing and then one day, I craft it into a short story.”Can stories change things, the way a legal case can? “Of course, because people will not know what rights they have got, and how silent suffering is not the solution. They can fight back. That insight is given through my stories.” In the story Black Cobras, a woman is informed that Islam does allow women to be educated and to work, but the scriptures are “twisted” by scholars for their own benefit. “Do not beg,” she is told. “Demand justice.”Amid the darkness of Mushtaq’s stories there is comedy too: in A Decision of the Heart, a man seeks a new husband for his widowed mother; but one of her suitors, a “dandy” with “the womanising disease”, is chased out of town covered in shit from a septic tank. Jokes, Mushtaq explains, enable her to be honest without causing offence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

I intentionally use that strategy instead of undergoing self-censorship.” Bhasthi adds that in this story, “The underlying theme is that women are being controlled by men, even when it comes across as a joke.”Mushtaq writes in the tradition of Bandaya Sahitya (literally “protest literature”), a “brief but highly influential movement”, as Bhasthi puts it, which arose in the 1970s against a literary landscape that was “mostly male, mostly upper caste”. The movement, whose slogan was, “If you are a writer, you are also a fighter”, “encouraged women and minority writers to write in their own registers” and, adds Mushtaq, “opened a gateway to all the downtrodden, marginalised and ignored people who didn’t have a voice”.And although Mushtaq’s work has always been popular inIndia– “my literature is people’s literature”, she says – her openness sometimes gets her in trouble: those “consequences” she spoke of earlier. In 2000, she was subject to a fatwa – an Islamic legal decree – after saying that “Islam had never prohibited women from entering mosques and praying there” but rather that the patriarchs in certain mosques were “denying it unlawfully”.So, she tells me, “some mosque authorities got offended and laid a fatwa against me, saying you are not among Muslims, you cannot socialise with Muslim people”. They lifted the fatwa “after three months, but during that time I suffered a lot due to it. But nowadays,” she adds, “theyareallowing women to pray inside the mosque”.Things are improving for women and minorities in India in some ways, Mushtaq says. “They’re progressing in higher education. But even then there are issues due to the patriarchy. If a girl of one community wants to marry a boy of another community, there will be issues.”Bhasthi agrees. “It’s better than yesterday,” she concludes, “but there is still a very, very long way to go.”Explore more on these topicsBooksInternational Booker prizeAwards and prizesFictionFiction in translationIndiainterviewsShareReuse this content"

Noble monastic mice battle thuggish rats: catnip for a seven-year-old.My favourite book growing upThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the GalaxybyDouglas Adams. The mad robots and two-headed aliens are great for the teenage brain, but beneath all that is the sadness, and the questions about why life has to be like this, all filtered through poor Arthur Dent. I sometimes pull it off the shelf to read half a page, just to remind myself how comedy writing is done.The book that changed me as a teenagerI triedOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nesta bit young, was baffled and thrown back by it, and then had another go, and couldn’t believe how bracingKen Kesey’s writing was. It’s pure psychedelia and probably hasn’t aged tremendously well, but in terms of the way you could write, it really freed my mind (man).The writer who changed my mindI was a full-on doomer about humanity’s future until last year, when I read statistician and climate scientistHannah Ritchie’s excellentNot the End of the World. I’m now a fraction more optimistic, which makes me a fraction more fun at parties.The book that made me want to be a writerI don’t remembernotwanting to be one, which is obviously insufferable. But I didn’t seriously think about how to go about doing it until my mid-20s, when I readJohn Wyndham’sThe Kraken Wakes. It’s great sci-fi, but rooted in complex characters doing their best in an extraordinary situation, and it sparked the idea that became my first novel.The book or author I came back toI used to thinkCharles Dickenswas very boring and stuffy, but the more I read him now, the more I think he’s the absolute nuts. Slightly embarrassingly, I welled up reading bits ofBleak Houselast year on a crowded commuter train. I had to pretend I had something in my eye.The book I rereadI’ve been readingPride and Prejudiceevery few years for two decades now. I studied Austen at university, spent 10 years in aJane Austen-themed improvised comedy group called Austentatious, and P&P only gets better. Just when you think you’ve got everything out of it, you find more jokes, more wisdom, more understanding. It’s stunning. Plus, everyone fancies Lizzie.The book I could never read againThe Art of the Deal, by Donald Trump and Tony Schwartz. Such beautiful prose, and Trump’s ruined it for everyone now.The book I discovered later in lifeA few years ago I discovered the publisherPersephone, which specialises in mid-20th-century books, mostly by women. The pitch is that these authors are all undeservedly forgotten. I was given a subscription by some comedian friends several years ago and am now about 50 books in. They are comfort reading, but high-quality, like a wholemeal pizza. Actually, that sounds horrible.The book I am currently readingI’m regretfully coming to the end ofMick Herron’s Slough House series, which has been a perfect, very British, very depressing, very funny pick-me-up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It opens with several pages of another ostensibly unrelated novel that is abandoned in its early stages; the reader simply turns a page and is confronted with the line: “At that point, the novel I was writing stalled.” What comes after seems suspiciously like memoir – particularly to anyone vaguely familiar with de Kretser’s biography – following a young Sri Lankan-Australian woman studying English literature at Melbourne University in the 1980s.The Stella prize judges called it “a brilliantly auto-fictive knot” and “a sharp examination of the complex pleasures and costs of living,” awarding it among a shortlist that included Amy McQuire’s essay collection Black Witness, Melanie Cheng’s novel The Burrow and Samah Sabawi’s family memoir Cactus Pear For My Beloved.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningTheory and Practice is also disarmingly quotidian, relatable – and funny.

While she did attend Melbourne University in the 1980s, she didn’t study English literature; nor did she undertake a thesis on Virginia Woolf, as her protagonist does. “That’s one of the things the novel is saying: don’t confuse the representation of reality with reality,” de Kretser says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While Woolf remains an important feminist figure, she had a patrician view of class and could be quite racist, with an uncomfortably colonialist outlook on the world. The protagonist dubs her “the Woolfmother”, and she exerts a problematic influence second only to the character’s own mother, who sends passive-aggressive letters to her daughter throughout.“When you think about feminism, you think of course about mothers and daughters because that’s the maternal line, it’s the maternal legacy,” says de Kretser.The process of maturation is also a process of deconstruction and reformation, of grappling more honestly with the past.You want to keep yourself interested and intervene in the novel formMichelle de Kretser“The narrator considers herself a feminist and yet she’s been hurt by other women and will hurt other women in her turn,” says the author.That gap between our intent and our actions is exploited throughout Theory and Practice, as the narrator begins to obsess about her lover and then the woman who’s also sleeping with him. The righteous feminist soon has to confront her own petty insecurities and jealousy – her decidedly un-feminist id – and the result is subtly hilarious.As much as de Kretser’s crackling prose and probing intellectualism have wowed awards judges – her Stella win caps a tally that includes two Miles Franklin awards and three Christina Stead prizes – it’s this wit, the levity and playfulness of her sentences, that makes her so fun to read.“I think we confuse seriousness and solemnity. We think if it’s funny, it must be trivial,” says de Kretser. “For me, being funny is a way of being very serious.”View image in fullscreenA photo of the author as a young woman graces the cover of Theory and Practice.Photograph: TextIn her novel, she pokes sly fun at those pesky post-structuralists – Derrida, Foucault et al – who took the idea of literary deconstruction to an absurd, and eventually meaningless, place. De Kretser remembers post-structuralism descending like a cloud on Melbourne University in the 80s: “Suddenly theory became more important than literature.” And how did she find it? “I just sort of skulked in corners. We were all scared.” She laughs at the memory, but you can almost sense the chill run down her spine.Entertaining and intellectual, Theory and Practice is the kind of novel that – like most of de Kretser’s work – will not only bear rereading, but benefit from it. The false novel that opens the book contains dark echoes of what is to come, but only on reflection. The themes of the book are layered on top of each other, but also spread outwards like tendrils. And that formal experimentation, so clever but judicious and perfectly calibrated, points the way for future works by the author.“I quote Woolf to that effect in the novel. She says, ‘I want to go on adventuring and changing’. And that is what any artist worth their salt wants to do,” says de Kretser. “You want to keep yourself interested and intervene in the novel form. It’s good to expand our notions of what a novel can be.”Explore more on these topicsStella prizeFictionMichelle de KretserfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Johnny’s copy of what he later identifies as A Susan Sontag Reader is an heirloom. It has been extensively underlined by his mother, who has just died, and by his estranged half-brother Lawrence. Johnny wonders if reading Sontag, or his family’s other heavily annotated books, will “unlock a secret or hint at one, offer a glimpse of their dreams or invite them into mine”.A Susan Sontag Reader includes Sontag’s 1968 defence of Jean-Luc Godard, the great modernist and Marxist provocateur of French New Wave cinema. If Johnny, in search of family connection, happened to read that essay, he would encounter a paragraph that rather neatly describes the novel that he is in the process of narrating. Godard’s films, Sontag writes, “show an interrelated group of fictional characters located in a recognisable, consistent environment: in his case, usually contemporary and urban”. But “while the sequence of events in a Godard film suggests a fully articulated story, it doesn’t add up to one […] actions are often opaque, and fail to issue into consequences”.There is almost always a kind of ulterior quality to the debut novel of a very good critic, stemming perhaps from a willed suppression of all that the critic knows about novels – how they can go wrong, how they must go right. And a very good critic is what Leo Robson is. For years he has been publishing long, formidably intelligent essays and reviews in venues including the New Statesman, the New Yorker and the London Review of Books. He is one of a handful of working critics worth reading not merely for the rigour of his arguments but for the pleasures of his unfailingly witty prose. He is a great articulator of minority opinions, having dared, among recent sallies, to defend the unfashionable oeuvre of Joyce Carol Oates, diss the films of Pedro Almodóvar, and express deep scepticism about Paul Murray’s widely belovedThe Bee Sting.Johnny’s older half-brother, Lawrence, is the book’s magnetic core: half hooligan, half intellectualWith such a reputation, the actual production of a first novel could be construed as either reckless or brave. And the fact that The Boys more or less begins with its narrator reading Susan Sontag might perhaps ring alarm bells, not least because Sontag herself, a superb critic, wasn’t much cop as a novelist. But one of the interesting things about The Boys is the way in which it both invites and refuses a “literary” or “critical” reading. As in Sontag’s account of Godard’s films, The Boys goes to some trouble to avoid being obviously “novelistic”. It has no clanging symbols or coy thematic statements. Scenes and even sentences appear ready to lurch toward event, toward meaning, only to collapse abruptly into a bemusing bathos. It is a pottering-about sort of book. It delivers great pleasure, actually, at the level of humble perception, of anticlimax.It does indeed remind you of a French New Wave film – not one of Godard’s spiky assaults on bourgeois complacency, but perhaps something gentler by François Truffaut (who is not mentioned) or Eric Rohmer (who is). Setting and period are hyperspecific: certain parts of London, in and around Swiss Cottage, during the 2012 Olympics. (In some ways it’s a London-geography novel, a tube-nerd’s dream.) The narrator, Johnny, seems to be looking for love – but is he? He has a girlfriend, whom we barely meet, named Chloe. He muses on the history of his family, Viennese Jews who fled to London during the second world war. His older half-brother, Lawrence, is the book’s magnetic core: half hooligan, half intellectual, passionate about city planning and social care. Around Lawrence’s charismatic instability, the Voghel family revolve and reshuffle their priorities.A plot, sort of: Johnny and Lawrence repair their estrangement; Lawrence’s teenage son Jasper is having a baby with his girlfriend LouLou; Johnny, in trying to find Lawrence a job, discovers himself, in the novel’s longest section, deeply attracted to two young postgrad students at the university where he works as an administrator, Harvey (male) and Rory (female). This is a bit Jules et Jim, except that it doesn’t quite go anywhere. Instead, Robson lets us hang out with his characters until we find ourselves thinking of them as real people.The Boys, in its prose and in its structure, is almost entirely made up of odd kinks of specificity – as are we all, of course, and as is the world. Hardly bothering with the conventions of “the novel”, it nonetheless – or perhaps I mean therefore – creates a mood that is less like fiction and more like life. It is a rather luminous, eccentric and memorable book.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The Heat is something different again, a long way fromHarry’s House– although the house bit is right, as it’s entirely set in one living room. But in this one a naked woman is crouched on all fours on the arm of the sofa, looking like things might go feral.Namgauds is clearly a choreographer with vision, and this is dance-theatre that’s by turns unsettling, comic and mildly erotic. She is one of five female performers, of varying ages, inhabiting this domestic setting – sofa, coffee table, lamp, pot plant – where the ordinariness swerves into the surreal. Suddenly one woman is smooshing a tomato into her face. Another’s head becomes disjointed from her body in an amusing bit of optical illusion. There’s a blankness about these women, but also a hunger.View image in fullscreenUnpretty but powerful … Becky Namgauds’ The Heat at Sadler’s Wells.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellThe Heat is inspired by Paula Rego’sDog Woman paintings, depicting women behaving like dogs, with animalistic poses and bared teeth. It’s an unpretty side of womanhood, but powerful too. Namgauds has also definitely watched some Pina Bausch (just look at all that long hair swishing luxuriously!) with these absurdist set pieces, only it’s a more suburban version: admonishing a sofa cushion, feeling frisky while vacuuming and so on.The pivotal scene begins when one woman puts a fuchsia-pink vibrator on a table; switched on, it starts to do a little dance of its own. Across the room, a different woman suddenly starts vibrating. Then it’s catching, soon they’re all quaking: pure instinct, pure sensation-seeking, desperate for friction. Poor Henry the Hoover is all I will say.This is an unapologetic depiction of female instincts and what’s suppressed beneath the surface. Namgauds has got something, for sure. But is there enough of it in this piece? It feels like a strong 40 minutes stretched to 60. Still, she’s one to watch.AtSadler’s Wells, London, until 23 May, then atthe Lowry, Salford, on 3 JuneExplore more on these topicsDanceTheatrePaula RegoSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

So when she suffered a mental breakdown in 2022, the Argentinian choreographer decided to keep recording.“It seemed interesting to me, recording the darkest parts of a person,” Otero tells Guardian over Zoom from Madrid, where she is based.Her breakdown had several causes, she says: “The cliche of the midlife crisis, coupled with unstable travel and a relationship with a narcissistic man, which exacerbated my longstanding dependence on men and fear of loneliness.” Afterwards, she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.View image in fullscreenArgentinian choreographer Marina Otero.Photograph: Santiago Albanell/Marina OteroOtero drew on her breakdown footage to create Kill Me, her show about “madness for love” (or, as she puts it, “locura por amor”), coming to Australia in June as part of Melbourne’sRising festival.In it, she and four female dancers – each with their own experiences of mental illness – share stories and re-enact painful experiences, in what Otero describes as an “attempt to poetise mental disorder”. Otero has also incorporated biographical details about love and mental illness from other women she knows.It’s more playful than it sounds: there’s nude dance numbers, rollerskating and an eclectic soundtrack that ranges from Bach to Miley Cyrus. In one sequence, the four dancers strut the stage nude except for white boots and knee pads, wielding plastic pistols: on a mission to kill romantic love before it kills them.View image in fullscreenKill Me in Montpellier, France, in 2024.Photograph: Marina Caputo/Marina OteroOtero says the decision to cast four women was an ironic comment on the “mad woman” cultural trope. Each woman was required to have a “relationship” with a personality disorder in real life; some have their own psychiatric diagnoses. In the show, Otero jokes that she and the dancers together embody the DSM (theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association).Meanwhile, a male dancer channels the spirit of the Russian ballet virtuoso Vaslav Nijinsky, who had schizophrenia. “His megalomania, which has to do with someone who believes they’re special, who is God and speaks to God, that relationship fascinated me,” Otero says. “I reinvent Nijinsky in the play, that his problem was an excess of love, and excess led to death.”Kill Me, which premiered in France in 2024, is part of Otero’s ongoing autobiographical art project Recordar para vivir (Remember to Live), which she has described as “an endless work about my life in which I am my own object of research”. Kicking off in 2012 with Andrea, the story of a woman who “danced her whole life to avoid talking about certain things”, the body of work has often drawn on Otero’s personal archive of footage, as the dancer worked out her traumas and neuroses on stage.Within the Remember to Live cycle, Kill Me is the final instalment of a trilogy of works exploring personal transformation, following Fuck Me (2020) and Love Me (2022).“Each work somehow confronts me with a way of self-destruction,” Otero says.View image in fullscreenKill Me, Marina Otero’s show about ‘madness for love’.Photograph: Marina Caputo/Marina OteroIn Fuck Me, Otero delved into the connection between her family history and Argentina’s military dictatorship in the 70s and 80s. Otero’s grandfather, who died when she was 15, had been a naval intelligence officer during that era. “He had told me that there are ‘secrets that are kept until death’, a phrase he repeated to me many times, and that phrase was the seed of the play,” she says.While she was developing Fuck Me, Otero underwent spinal surgery that left her unable to move, leading her to cast five male dancers to take her place – all playing military seamen and completely nude.The experience inflected the work in more profound ways, too: “[In the show] I make a link between my grandfather’s secrets, what was hidden in my family, and the paralysis of the body,” she says.In her solo work Love Me, which premiered in Buenos Aires “as a farewell to the country”, Otero returned to the stage, speaking about the impact of the spinal operation on her sex and love life.In Kill Me, the dancer turned choreographer and director cuts a middle path, appearing on stage but also enlisting the help of other dancers.View image in fullscreenOtero drew on her breakdown footage to create Kill Me, which will be part of the Rising festival in Melbourne.Photograph: Marina Caputo/Marina OteroHaving struggled to walk just a few years ago, Otero, now 41, says she is feeling fit again; while she can’t yet dance again, she is doing boxing training each day in preparation for her next “very ambitious and very complex project” (under wraps for now). Unsure at this stage whether she will be able to dance in the work, she says, “I will be putting my body to work in some way”.Having left Argentina to seek new adventures and meet new people, she is also unsure if she will ever return, given attacks on freedom of speech by far-right president Javier Milei. “[He’s] a horror … he’s destroying everything,” she says.In the meantime, Otero continues to embrace the artistic possibilities of doubt: “Whatever happens to me, I’m going to question everything,” she says.“The most important thing for me is that the pieces transform me and take me to another place, to another life experience.”Kill Meis playing at the Sumner Southbank theatre, Melbourne, from 5-8 June as part of the Rising festivalExplore more on these topicsRising festivalDanceTheatreMelbournefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It makes reading the signs now that bit more difficult: the bizarre event on the Croisette boulevard this year was apalm tree falling over. If it happened in a film, the metaphor would be unbearable.Whether 2025’s Cannes movies are going to spark a new burst of overwhelming excitement remains to be seen, though this year’s vintage feels good – often excellent, although even the biggest names can get it wrong: former Palme d’Or winner Julia Ducournau presented anincoherent drama called Alpha.This was a Cannes competition whose great movies were about political cruelty and tyranny.Jafar Panahi’sA Simple Accidentwas about a fortuitous event that unearthed horrifying memories in Iran. Kleber Mendonça Filho’s glorious, sprawling, Elmore Leonard-esque film from Brazil,The Secret Agentwas about the 1970s dictatorship – interestingly, both films showed petty officials taking bribes. Filho’s wretched cops are bought off with some cigarettes – Panahi’s crooked security guards carry a debit card reader so they can take contactless payments. But for sheer existential grandeur of evil nothing could touch Sergei Loznitsa’sTwo Prosecutors– about the Stalin 30s, with its Dostoyevskian and Kafkaesque moments of despair.And to go with these views of the patriarchy, there were daddy issues. Joachim Trier’sSentimental Valueshowed Stellan Skarsgård being insufferable with his daughters – the preening Egyptian movie star played by Fares Fares in Eagles of the Republic infuriates his son, and Josh O’Connor’s hapless art thief in Kelly Reichardt’s The Mastermind is a very neglectful dad. And in the Dardenne brothers’ compassionate and poignant movie Jeunes Mères, about a care facility for teenage mothers, the fathers were conspicuous by their absence.So here are my prize predictions, followed by my extra Cannes Braddies, my personal awards in other sections which should exist, but don’t.Palmed’OrThe Secret Agent (dir Kleber Mendonça Filho)Grand PrixTwo Prosecutors (dir Sergei Loznitsa)JuryprizeA Simple Accident (dir Jafar Panahi)BestdirectorCarla Simón for RomeríaBestscreenplayMascha Schilinski for Sound of FallingBestactorJosh O’Connor for The MastermindBestactressYui Suzuki for Renoir (dir Chie Hayakawa)Braddies for prize categories that don’t exist but shouldBest supporting actorStellan Skarsgård in Sentimental Value (dir Joachim Trier)Best supporting actressTânia Maria for The Secret Agent (dir Kleber Mendonça Filho)CinematographyDavid Chambille for Nouvelle Vague (dir Richard Linklater)Production designRoger Rosenberg for Eagles of the Republic (dir Tarik Saleh)Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsAwards and prizesJafar PanahifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, the movie-maker’s post-credits sequences are mostly cryptic cameos and empty gestures. Perhaps we just shouldn’t botherBen ChildFri 23 May 2025 12.35 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 19.09 EDTShareLet’s face it, hanging around to watch post- or mid-credits sequences is a pretty weird thing. The movie is over, we’ve all had our fill – of CGI skybeams, multiversal migraines and superheroes punching each other in the feelings – and it’s time to head out into the night to debate whether the film was brilliant, baffling or just a $250m trailer for the next one. But leave we cannot, because something monumental might just happen after the credits roll. Or during them. Or, increasingly, not at all. Still we stay, we hope, we watch.Remember the end of 2012’s The Avengers when Thanos turned and smirked, sparking a good six years of movies in which the Mad Titan wasdefinitelygoing to do something totally crazy very soon – and then, to everyone’s surprise,actually did? Or that glorious moment after Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) when Marisa Tomei’s aunt May walked in on Peter Parker mid suit change? Back then,Marvelcredit scenes usually felt earned, and vital. They were windows into the future of the saga, at a time when Kevin Feige and his team seemed to be able to do no wrong. What made those early years so intoxicating was the sheer audacity of it all. Marvel wasn’t just making superhero movies. They were building a connected universe on screen, one meticulously cross-pollinated character cameo at a time, like a giant, exploding beehive of superhero synergy.View image in fullscreenUnprecedented … Tom Holland in Spider-Man: Homecoming, 2017.Photograph: Courtesy of Columbia Pictures/Marvel Studios/Columbia Pictures/AllstarThis kind of long-game storytelling had existed in comics for decades, of course, with Spider-Man swinging through a Fantastic Four panel or the Hulk popping up in someone else’s emotional breakdown – but to see it play out in Hollywood blockbusters was unprecedented. Suddenly, a throwaway joke in Iron Man 2 might lead to a plot-point in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. An alien artefact glimpsed in the background of Thor would become central to Guardians of the Galaxy. The post-credits scene wasn’t just a gimmick – it was the glue. A breadcrumb trail. A narrative lighthouse guiding fans through the fog of increasingly busy crossovers.For a while, it worked, like a magic trick pulled off across a dozen movies, each new tease setting off a chain reaction of hype, speculation, and Reddit threads. But it wasn’t as if these end-of-movie scenes were all that vital to the filmgoing experience: they were just there to make us feel involved in the grand design of the Marvel macro-saga, like subscribers to a sprawling cosmic newsletter. We probably wouldn’t have even noticed much if they hadn’t been up to scratch – until one day, they really weren’t. Was it the arrival of Harry Styles’ Starfox and the Patton Oswalt-voiced Pip the Troll at the end of2021’s Eternalsthat was the tipping point? Here were a duo with all the relevance of a magician at a funeral. And OK, Eternals itself was more pointless than a fax machine at a Starlink board meeting, but that doesn’t mean Marvel didn’t have a duty to give us some kind of payoff at some point in the future of the franchise.View image in fullscreenBig heel turn … Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.Photograph: Marvel StudiosInstead we’ve had so many meaningless credits scenes that everyone is beginning to wonder if they should stick around for the inevitable feeling of disappointment. There was the bit at the end of Thor: Love and Thunder when Hercules – played by a surprisingly buff Brett Goldstein of Ted Lasso fame – steps into frame wearing comic-accurate gladiator gear, but says nothing memorable, flexes impressively and the scene cuts to black. Then there was Charlize Theron, striding into Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness; she’s Clea, apparently – sorceress, niece of Dormammu, future wife of Stephen Strange in the comics – and she whisks our hero away with a vague threat about “incursions,” which, like most of Marvel phase four, sounded important but didn’t go anywhere. Perhaps she’ll turn up in the new Avengers films, but even if she does we’ll have absolutely no idea why.Even Doctor Strange in 2016 teased a big heel turn for Chiwetel Ejiofor’s Mordo, who ended the film on a soul-sucking rampage to purge the world of “too many sorcerers”. A tantalising setup for a future clash! Which we didn’t get. By Multiverse of Madness, he’s been quietly swapped out for a different variant entirely.Thunderbolts* review – Florence Pugh is saving grace of Marvel’s hit-and-miss messRead moreSo why are we still bothering to wait? The truth is that despite everything, there’s still a chance thatthis timethere will be one serious, monumental moment that blows our minds and reminds us of that bit at the end of Avengers: Infinity War when Nick Fury paged Captain Marvel just before crumbling into cosmic dust, and for a fleeting second it felt as if the future of the entire universe hinged on a single glowing beeper. Or we may finally have to admit that Marvel’s real superpower is making us continually sit through the credits for absolutely no reason at all.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSuperhero moviesMarvelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Physical health had also significantly improved, the IMF found.Governments burdened with historically high levels of public debt, the IMF said, could not afford to let growing numbers of older workers exit the workforce while they were still healthy and able to work. Instead, it argued, governments could encourage workers to delay their retirement, cut early retirement benefits, and increase pension ages to rebalance the increasingly precarious ratio of workers and retirees.Thousands of people from across the globe shared with the Guardian how they felt aboutsuch proposals. Although some thought the IMF’s idea was good, an overwhelming majority expressed outrage, typically describing the concept that older people should retire later to ease fiscal pressures as “disgusting”, “ludicrous” and “unfair”.“Seventy is not the new 50. That’s propaganda,” said a 63-year-old NHS admin worker from Dundee. “Having worked since the age of 18, retirement cannot come soon enough for me. I find travelling for work stressful and long for a time when my days are my own. I am tired.”I’m 60, fit, don’t drink or smoke, and I’m finding every day a struggleMany worried that workers in often physically demanding low-paid jobs would be hardest hit if retirement goalposts changed again.“[It’s] people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who will need to stay in work as they won’t have private pensions and they are the demographic that tend to have poorer health,” said Deanne, from North Lanarkshire, Scotland.“I believe it’s the poor or just state pension claimants that will have to carry on working, low wage earners and [those in] manual jobs,” said Robert Mcalone, a bricklayer and builder from Bournemouth, Dorset.View image in fullscreenRobert Mcalone, 60, hopes to retire at 67.Photograph: Robert Mcalone/Guardian Community“I left school at 16. Before that I worked in hotel kitchens at 14, 18 hours a week. Then construction as a bricklayer builder. I’m 60, fit, don’t drink or smoke, and I’m finding every day a struggle. Fortunately I have my own house and savings, but not enough to retire until 67. I’ve built many houses, schools and hospitals in my time – I think I’ve put back enough into society.”“I’m trying to work until I’m 70,” said Anne, 66, a night-shift worker at a homeless hostel in the UK. “It’s increasingly challenging. I often sit at work crying due to the effort. It takes me longer to recover from an 11-hour shift. It takes me two days of being off to physically recover.“Many women friends are also looking after their grandchildren so their children can work, as childcare is either nonexistent and/or unaffordable.”“Older workers have already done their bit and paid into the system,” said a 61-year-old woman working in event management from Nottingham, a view that was shared by many, alongside hundreds of people who complained that taxes were high while public services had dramatically worsened.Samuel, an HGV driver from Cumbria, said: “Spending a lifetime paying taxes and never having any of your prime years to enjoy is disgusting, the government needs to ease pressure on public finances in other ways.“The government is asking us to pay into a system for healthcare and pensions, and increasingly we get less and less.”“We are paying higher contributions than ever before,” said Adam, an aircraft maintenance mechanic. “I have paid into the system, I want to get back what I paid in.”Why should we work to 70, put more in for people who don’t work?Hundreds felt that successive UK governments had simply misspent public funds, and called for drastic policy changes in other areas to balance the books and relieve pressure on public services.Scores of people argued that ministers should dramatically limit immigration, reduce spending on housing asylum seekers and migrants and cut benefits for young people who were out of work, before asking older people to forgo some of their retirement.Andrew, 68, from Northamptonshire, who retired at 60, said the government “should stop throwing taxpayers’ money down the drain on foreign aid and funding support for illegal immigrants and abolish unaffordable civil service pensions. Look after our own elderly and homeless first.”Others suggested benefits should be reduced for the near-record number of people under 65who were economically inactive.“Why should we work to [70], put more in for people who don’t work?” asked Susan, a factory worker from Hull. David, 66, from Sheffield, said he was “able to work [to 70] but unwilling to pay for people” who had “contributed nothing”.Others argued that older people staying in paid work for longer could lead to significant other costs elsewhere – particularly in social care and childcare, where a bulk of the burden is shouldered by older family members acting as unpaid carers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Also, many in this age group take on work in the voluntary sector, providing much needed support to charities and local groups.”Companies discriminate against older workersSusan Chardin, a 71-year-old editor and English teacher from Bayeux, France, was among many people who said they had experienced ageism in the labour market, a practice they felt would stand in the way of many who might want to delay retirement.“Governments want [baby boomers] to stay in work, but companies discriminate against older workers,” she said.View image in fullscreenSusan Chardin, 71, said she would like to keep working even if she could afford to retire, but pointed out that age discrimination in the labour market is rife.Photograph: Susan C/Guardian Community“Until policies and programmes are mandated by the government, nothing will be done to make it possible. Moreover, society will have to overcome their long-held prejudices and psychological barriers to hire older workers.”Others, however, agreed wholeheartedly with the IMF’s suggestions, and various people said they had worked until 70 or older and had enjoyed it.“That’s what I did,” said Erwan Illian, 72, a retired cabinet maker from Berkeley, California. “It was a financial necessity but also a choice. I was born in France. Retiring at 64, the legal retirement age in France, is in my view ludicrous and selfish. It strains public finances at a time of increasing monetary difficulty all over the globe.”“I’m game,” said Lewis, a 50-year-old senior rural estate manager for the Ministry of Defence from Bath. “I’d do this for myself, my family, for society. I don’t want to wither away once I retire. Work and social contact stimulates and refreshes.“If we don’t work older, then there will not be enough tax in the system – my son’s generation will be under enormous pressure.”Retirement is looking like an unaffordable luxury for the future“I ‘retired’ in 2010 after working in the heavy building supply business and then started volunteering at major sporting events, such as the 2012 Olympics,” said Malcolm Chevin, 74, from Walton-on-Thames in Surrey.“I decided aged 67 to go back to work as I needed to do something on a more regular basis.

I planned to become an artist, but when I was offered a job as a stockbroker at 19, the pull of a glamorous lifestyle and the earning potential compared with that of an impoverished artist was too strong. But, during my 15-year career, I kept up art as a hobby, dabbling in pottery and jewellery-making as well as painting.In 2008, I took a break from work and ended up living in Hawaii for seven years. Inspired by the landscape, I took some art courses, which reignited my energy and excitement for it.When my parents died unexpectedly in quick succession in 2019 and 2021, I threw myself into my artwork. I found it helped me cope with the loss.Using acrylic paint on canvas, I created abstract pieces and shared my work on Instagram. In 2023, a follower messaged me, saying she loved what I was doing and wanted to commission me – but she had an unusual request. She wanted me to paint a picture using her mother’s ashes.My thoughts immediately turned to my own mum, Carol. Her ashes were in an urn in my cupboard. I felt they ought to be scattered, but I didn’t want to be separated from her.My mum was joyful and had been an artist herself. The idea of using ashes in my artwork resonated with me, and I thought Mum would have liked it, too – being part of a beautiful painting, looked at and appreciated every day.I have an inquiring, scientific mind, so I wanted to make sure everything was done properly and respectfully. Cremated remains have a high pH level, similar to bleach. I was concerned about how that would affect the paint. Would the ashes fade or even erode it?I contacted a forensic laboratory, which helped me develop a stabilising agent, so ashes could be added to my paint safely. I had to believe in the technique – if I wasn’t prepared to use my own mum’s ashes, I shouldn’t be using someone else’s.My first commission to paint using someone's ashes was incredibly nerve-rackingI painted a seascape using acrylic paint mixed with Mum’s ashes and the stabilising agent. It was an emotional experience, and I was really pleased with the finished piece. It takes pride of place in my kitchen, where I spend most of my time, and it feels like Mum is with me.That gave me the confidence to accept my client’s commission to paint a seascape using her mother’s ashes. It was incredibly nerve-racking. I feel things very deeply; there was added emotion and pressure. I worried she might not like the finished piece. But she loved it. It was a beautifully moving moment when I handed it over – there were tears, but happy ones.I have now painted about 20 memorial pieces using ashes, and I’ve created my ownwebsite, ash2art.com. People are often curious about my techniques. I send clients a plastic wallet and pouch so they can give me a small amount of their loved one’s ashes. The remains come in different sizes and textures and require some preparation so they are fine enough to add to the paint.Other pieces I’ve painted include a pair of flower meadows for a brother and sister to celebrate their mum, who was a keen gardener. They wanted something joyful and colourful to remember her by. Last year, someone asked if I would paint a portrait of their late cat, Mindy, incorporating her ashes. I’m an abstract painter, and pet portraiture was out of my comfort zone, but I really wanted to do it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Pet cremation is a growing trend, and since then I’ve painted several other memorial pictures of cats and dogs.I thought using cremated remains in my work would open me up to criticism, but I’ve been overwhelmed by the comments of love and support. People find my memorial pieces comforting. There’s a reassurance in having their loved one’s or their pet’s ashes nearby, immortalised in an original painting.I never imagined I’d be painting using ashes, but it’s a beautiful way to honour the memory of our loved ones.As told to Kate ChapmanDo you have an experience to share?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The days when your only choice was between a foam roll mat or a leaky airbed and foot pump are long gone. From self-inflating mattresses to lightweight sleeping pads and insulated airbeds, the comfort and portability of sleeping mats have dramatically improved. But with so many types of camping mattresses available, costing from tens to hundreds of pounds, it can be difficult to know where to start.To save you the sleepless night of an ill-informed choice, I tested 26 and shortlisted the best camping mattresses for various scenarios.At a glanceBest camping mattress overall:Therm-a-Rest NeoLoft£212.50 at Outdoor ActionBest budget camping mattress:Simond inflatable trekking mattress MT500 Air Insulating L£64.99 at DecathlonBest double mattress:Big Agnes Rapide SL insulated tent floor pad£244.95 at WildboundsBest self-inflating mattress for luxury camping:Coleman Supercomfort self-inflating sleeping mat double£195 at AE LeisureBest sleeping mat for expeditions:Alpkit Radiant£99.99 at AlpkitWhy you should trust meAs a keen camper and festival goer, not to mention the parent of two adventurous teens, I’ve done my fair share of backpacking and car-based camping trips, and had the bruised hips and backache to prove it. Particularly memorable was the night my self-inflating mat punctured while wild camping on Mont Lozère in the south of France, as well as the time we ignored the yellow weather warning at Port Eliot festival in Cornwall, and spent the night reinforcing our collapsing tent as the sleeping area gradually filled with water.I am also a science journalist and the author of abook on circadian rhythms and sleep, so I recognise the importance of a good night’s sleep for physical recovery, brain function and wellbeing.How I testedView image in fullscreenComfort was tested by placing several sharp stones underneath each mattress.Photograph: Linda GeddesI assessed each mattress on comfort, durability, packability, and how easy they were to inflate and deflate. Comfort was assessed by placing each mattress on a hard wooden floor on top of several sharp stones, lying on it inside a sleeping bag on my back and side, and rolling between positions for 20 minutes. As a wriggly side sleeper, I was particularly vigilant for any pressure points around my hips or shoulders, or mattresses that were overly narrow or slippery. Points were deducted if I could feel the stones, couldn’t comfortably stretch out and for shiny surfaces that caused me to slither off the mattress.I assessed durability by lightly jumping on each mattress five times (against manufacturers’ instructions) in bare feet, and falling on to it from standing – as might happen if you were to stumble into your tent in the middle of the night without a torch. I also gently stabbed and scratched at the surface of each mattress with a pointy stone, and sprayed the underside with water, to see how easily it soaked through. Mattresses were left overnight with two 20kg boxes on them to check for any signs of deflation. Further points were deducted for mattresses that were excessively difficult to pack away after use or needed a large storage space.View image in fullscreenCould the mattresses stay inflated under 20kg of weight overnight?Photograph: Linda GeddesI’ve also included the R value, or thermal resistance, of each mattress. This measures how well it resists heat transfer from your body to the cold ground. A lower R value means less insulation, which is better in warmer weather, but less good for winter camping (see more below, in the What you need to know section).I tested 26 mattresses in total, and rated them for different camping scenarios, including family camping holidays, summer or winter backpacking expeditions, glamping, festivals and weekends away for two. I also enlisted my back-sleeping husband – a keen winter mountaineer – and comfort-seeking kids, aged 12 and 14, for their perspectives. Below are the best 10 from my experiments.Mattresses were either returned to the manufacturer or donated toKitsquad, a scheme that helps low-income people get out into the great outdoors, or thePeople’s Republic of Stokes Croft, which supports people rough sleeping in Bristol.The best camping mattresses and sleeping mats in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Linda GeddesBestcamping mattress overall:Therm-a-Rest NeoLoftView image in fullscreen£212.50 at Outdoor Action£249.95 at AmazonIf you crave the comfort of an air bed but need something compact and lightweight enough to carry in your backpack, Therm-a-Rest’s NeoLoft regular wide camping mat could be the answer. With a packed size not much larger than a 1L water bottle, chambers that rise to form subtle side rails when the pad is inflated, and internal insulation, this pad isn’t cheap, but it should dramatically boost your chances of a good night’s sleep.Why we love itThis mattress merges comfort with packability, making it a practical option for family camping holidays and backpacking alike. It feels soft and warm to lie on; it’s wide enough for back or side sleepers; and the side rails gently cradle you while you sleep.We tested the regular wide single mat, which was fine for sleepers up to 5ft 10, but taller people may prefer thelarge version, which is 198cm long. We’ve taken this mattress on several camping trips, and it was so comfortable that my children fought over who got to sleep on it. Lumpy ground is imperceptible through its 11.7cm loft, even when sleeping on your side, and while softly springy, this mattress thankfully lacks the trampoline-like bounce of a conventional airbed.It’s a shame that …while the surface of the mattress is super-soft, it does generate some static if you roll around too much.Weight:850gDimensions (packed):29 x 15cmDimensions (inflated):185 x 66 x 12cm (LWH)Rvalue:4.7Self-inflating?NoPump included?Yes, pump sack (a bag that fills with air and connects to the mattress valve to inflate it)Best budget camping mattress:Simondinflatable trekking mattressMT500 Air Insulating LView image in fullscreen£64.99 at DecathlonDecathlon is a trusted source of affordable outdoor equipment, and its own-brand Simond sleeping pad doesn’t disappoint. Its vertical air-filled chambers easily absorbed large stones and provided a comfortable sleeping surface, and its tiny pack size makes it suitable for campers without a car. It also comes in anXL versionfor taller and wider sleepers.Why we love itThis is a comfortable and versatile mattress suitable for most camping scenarios, apart from winter trips, which might require a better-insulated sleeping surface.As a side sleeper, prone to waking up and rolling over multiple times each night, I also appreciated the silicone patches on the mattress’ surface, which helped stop my sleeping bag from sliding off. Though considerably thinner than the Therm-a-Rest, this mattress absorbed lumps and bumps well, and I was unable to feel stones when lying on my side – even when placed directly underneath my hips.This is a lightweight and easily packable mat, which could fit inside a rucksack during expeditions.It’s a shame that …my younger family members disliked being able to feel the vertical grooves when lying on the mattress without a sleeping bag – although these were far less noticeable once wrapped inside one.Weight:670gDimensions (packed):33 x 12cmDimensions (inflated):180 x 52 x 5cm (LWH)Rvalue:3.3Self-inflating?NoPump included?Yes, pump sackBest double mattress:Big Agnes Rapide SL insulated tent floor padView image in fullscreen£244.95 at WildboundsA night under canvas with your partner might sound romantic, but sharing the wrong mattress can make for an uncomfortable experience, with one partner being bounced awake when the other turns over, or slumped on to the hard rocky floor when their partner goes out to pee (yes, I speak from experience). This inflatable sleeping pad is extremely comfortable, tapered to fit in most two-man tents, insulated enough to see you into the colder months, and packing down small enough to fit into a backpack.Why we love itI’ve spent years grumbling about sharing a two-man tent with my husband, because we couldn’t find two compatible, comfortable mattresses that would fit. This is the solution. It fitted into the two-man expedition tent that my husband is illogically attached to, despite my grumbles about the lack of storage space, but it also worked well in our family tent, where recently I enjoyed one of my best camping sleeps ever, with no hip or backache the following morning.Like our other top mattress picks, stones and rough ground were imperceptible through its surface, and I wasn’t bounced awake at any point, even when my husband crawled out to make breakfast, while I dozed on.It’s a shame that …it is relatively narrow for a double mattress. This is deliberate, as it’s designed to fit inside the average two-person tent, and my husband and I are both relatively slim, so it wasn’t a problem for us. However, larger couples, or those looking for more space, may find it a bit cramped. It was also relatively difficult to get the deflated mattress back inside its stuff sack.Weight:1.22kgDimensions (packed):29 x 14cmDimensions (inflated):198 x 127 x 9cm (LWH) 102cm wide at tapered endRvalue:4.8Self-inflating?NoPump included?Yes, pump sackBest self-inflating mattress for luxury camping:Coleman Supercomfort double self-inflating sleeping matView image in fullscreen£195 at AE LeisureThis 12cm-thick self-inflating mattress gradually fills with air when the valves are twisted open. It comes in single and double sizes and is filled with polyester foam. All this makes for a more bed-like feel than the inflatable “air pads” we tested, and helps to insulate it from the cold ground. Although the mattress is self-inflating, its travel bag doubles as a pump sack to add further inflation and create a firmer sleeping surface, if preferred.Why we love itIt’s very wide and comfortable, and there’s minimal motion transfer when two sleepers lie side by side. We tried the double, and I barely noticed when my husband deliberately rolled around and climbed off the mattress.Any lumps and bumps are absorbed with ease, and stones were imperceptible when placed under it. Weighing 6kg, this mattress is suitable only for car-based camping trips or camper vans, but we would certainly consider packing it for a week-long camping holiday.Its high thermal resistance (R value) would make it usable in winter conditions.It’s a shame that …this mattress is too big for backpacking, and the double mattress takes a bit of effort to pack away: you need to fold it in half lengthways, and lie on its surface to squeeze out enough air to begin the process of rolling it up.Weight:6kgDimensions (packed):65 x 32cmDimensions (inflated):200 x 128 x 12cm (LWH)Rvalue:12.9Self-inflating?YesPump included?Yes, pump-sackBest sleeping mat for expeditions:Alpkit RadiantView image in fullscreen£99.99 at AlpkitThis is a lightweight and compact sleeping pad with excellent insulation, making it suitable for all sorts of outdoor adventures – including winter expeditions.Why we love itWhile there are wider and marginally more comfortable lightweight mats, Alpkit’s Radiant provides superb cushioning on rocky ground, and wins extra points for its relatively low price, high thermal resistance, 100% recycled outer fabric and water-resistant surface, which I tested by spraying it with a water bottle and leaving it for 30 minutes to soak in (it didn’t).View image in fullscreenThe Alpkit Radiant passed the water-resistance test.Photograph: Linda GeddesIts high R value means it should keep you warm in all weather conditions. Weighing only 600g – less than two tins of baked beans – it will easily fit inside a rucksack, making it suitable for summer and winter expeditions alike.It’s a shame that …the surface of the mat is a little shiny and slippery.Weight:600gDimensions (packed):25 x 11cmDimensions (inflated):194 x 62 x 9cm (LWH)Rvalue:7.2Self-inflating?NoPump included?Yes, pump sackskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Measuring 64cm across and 10cm thick, the Ether Light XR is wider and slightly more comfortable than the smaller size available (larger sizes are also available). My husband also had no grumbles about warmth when he used it to sleep in a Scottish bothy in March.It didn’t make the final cut because …although this was a worthy contender for best expedition mattress, it was narrowly pipped to the post by Alpkit’s Radiant on the grounds of price, eco-credentials and insulation (though it still has a four-season rating).Weight:665gDimensions (packed):24 x 12cmDimensions (inflated):183 x 64 x 10cm (LWH)Rvalue:4.1Self-inflating?NoPump included?Yes, pump sackBig Agnes Campmeister Deluxe InsulatedView image in fullscreen£214.95 at Wildbounds£224.95 at Valley and PeakBest for:winter campingAnother great option for winter camping – especially if comfort is a priority. This inflatable sleeping mat is 11cm thick and 63.5cm wide, with slightly raised edges to prevent you rolling off in the night. With tough 70 denier ripstop fabric on the underside, this feels like a robust mat that’s built to last. A larger 76 x 198cm version is also available.It didn’t make the final cut because …insulation is similar to Alpkit’s Radiant, but with a weight of 907g, it’s more than 300g heavier. Although this is unlikely to bother the average camper, serious mountaineers may prefer a lighter, smaller mat.Weight:907gDimensions (packed):20 x 14cmDimensions (inflated):183 x 64 x 11cmRvalue:7Self-inflating?NoPump included?Yes, pump sackEasy CampKestrel mat singleView image in fullscreen£35.99 at Easy CampBest for:family camping on a budget and festivalsThis 3.8cm self-inflating matisn’t the most comfortable we tested, and measuring 51cm across, it is quite narrow. Even so, rocks were barely perceptible through its surface, and my back-sleeping husband reported feeling very comfortable on it. A5cm-thick versionis also available, which should provide side sleepers with a little more cushioning. This mat is also considerably cheaper than many of our other top picks, making it a great budget option, particularly for festivals and for kids or smaller adults.It didn’t make the final cut because …adults may find it too narrow for comfort, and side sleepers a little too thin.Weight:945gDimensions (packed):28 x 16cmDimensions (inflated):182 x 51 x 4cm (LWH)Rvalue:3Self-inflating?YesPump included?No, but this is unnecessaryVango Shangri-La II 20 Grandeself-inflating matView image in fullscreen£209.99 at Decathlon£209.99 at Mountain WarehouseBest for:luxury glampingThis behemoth of a self-inflating mat is 20cm thick and more comfortable than many regular mattresses, let alone camping ones. But this luxury comes at a cost: bulk. Taking up more storage space than our family tent, and weighing 5.6kg, the Shangri-La II would only be suitable for those with large cars or camper vans, and even they may need to sacrifice other equipment to fit it in. But for campers who prize soft, squishy comfort above all else, this mattress is hard to beat.It didn’t make the final cut because …it is too bulky for most camping scenarios.Weight:5.6kgDimensions (packed):80 x 32cmDimensions (inflated):200 x 76 x 20cm (LWH)Rvalue:14Self-inflating?YesPump included?No, but this is unnecessaryOutwell Dreamscape InsulatedView image in fullscreen£119.99 at OutwellBest for:family campingIf you like the bouncy loft of an airbed but find them unpleasantly cold and clammy to sleep on, this insulated version is a great alternative. Although the Therm-a-Rest NeoLoft is lighter and considerably more portable, the Dreamscape is cheaper and would be fine for car-based camping trips from spring to autumn. It does require a foot-pump or a large pair of lungs to inflate it, though.It didn’t make the final cut because …it isn’t as portable as some of our top picks.Weight:1.7kgDimensions (packed):39 x 17cmDimensions (inflated):205 x 77 x 12cm (LWH)R value:3.8Self-inflating?NoPump included?NoAlso considerCamping pillowWhile many people sling their regular pillow into the car as a token luxury on camping trips, this doesn’t work if you’re backpacking, when a lumpy pile of clothes is the make-do option. The necessity of packing pillows is also a frequent flashpoint for arguments when packing for family camping trips (believe me, I know).Thankfully, there are now inflatable pillows that are small enough to fit in your pocket, and compressible foam or microfibre pillows that take up far less space than a regular pillow. I tested eight camping pillows and would highly recommend Sea to Summit’s Aeros Ultralight pillow (£25 at Decathlon) for a super-packable inflatable pillow or Vango’s Deep Sleep Memory Pillow (£31.99 at Amazon) for a supremely comfortable alternative, provided you have more space.What you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Linda GeddesWhat’s the difference between an airbed, sleeping pad, foam roll mat and self-inflating mattress?From glamping to Alpine mountaineering, there are different types of camping trip, and different mattresses will suit some better than others.Airbedsare large, inflatable mattresses, often high and bouncy, inflated with a foot- or electric-powered pump (some even have one built in). Although they’re very comfy, they’re poorly insulated, can feel cold and clammy to lie on, and tend to be susceptible to punctures. They’re also relatively heavy and bulky, making them unsuitable for backpacking, while those sharing a double airbed may be bounced awake by restless partners.Sleeping padsare ultralight inflatable mattresses designed for backpacking and mountaineering. Although they’re thinner and less bouncy than air beds, they’re extremely comfortable and often incorporate insulating materials, making them suitable for camping in colder conditions, including winter when it comes to high-spec versions. Most also come with air sacks to aid inflation (see below) and puncture repair kits.Closed-cell foam roll matsaren’t particularly comfortable, but virtually indestructible. They’re designed to providea basic layer of padding, waterproofing and insulation between you and the ground. Being made from foam, they also tend to retain body heat well. Because of these properties, some backpackers choose to combine them with a basic air pad. They are usually secured to the outside of a backpack with elasticated straps.Self-inflating mattressesconsist of an open-cell foam core inside an air-tight fabric shell, with a valve that allows in air to inflate the mattress when it’s opened – although they often require a top-up of air from your lungs to make them firmer. Comfort ranges from moderate to high, depending on the thickness of the mattress, and the foam core tends to provide good insulation. However, they’re heavier and bulkier than air pads, and still susceptible to punctures. They’re deflated by opening back up the valve, and squeezing out the air, rolling as you go, and then closing the valve.How long do camping mattresses last, and are they repairable?The lifespan of a camping mattress depends on its type, quality and how well it’s cared for, but closed-cell foam mattresses tend to be the most durable, and air beds the least so. Both self-inflating mats and air pads can also suffer from punctures and valve or seam failures, but self-inflating mattresses are often constructed from thicker fabrics and are less likely to fully deflate if punctured.To extend the life of your camping mattress, you could consider using a groundsheet to reduce the risk of punctures from sharp rocks, sticks and rough terrain, and avoid leaving inflatable mattresses in the sun. Care should also be taken not to over-inflate air mattresses, while foam or self-inflating mats should ideally be stored unrolled, with inflation valves left open to maintain the loft and integrity of the foam.How do I inflate my camping mattress?It depends on the mattress, but air beds tend to require a foot- or electric pump, while air pads are inflated by mouth, or using a “pump-sack” – a lightweight, air-filled bag, that helps to keep moisture out of the pad (also important for longevity) and is more efficient than inflating by mouth.What’s an R value, and why is it important?The R value of a camping mattress measures how well it resists heat transfer from your body to the cold ground. A lower R value means less insulation, which is better in warmer weather, but less good for winter camping. Foam-based mattresses tend to have the highest R values, but some air pads incorporate other insulating materials, making them suitable for winter camping expeditions. As a general rule of thumb, R values of 1 to 2 tend to be sufficient for summer camping; R values of 2 to 4.5 are suitable for spring through to autumn, while for winter camping or other cold climates, you’ll need an R value of 4 to 5 or higher.Linda Geddes is a former Guardian science correspondent,known for inserting herself into her own mini-science experiments (like the time she spenta week with a clown, a comic and some toddlers).

Several kilos of fresh coffee beans and a pile of Nespresso-compatible pods have been sourced direct from my go-to roaster,Craft House Coffee. I’ve used the manufacturers’ official pods where applicable, too.For the filter and espresso machines that don’t have an integrated coffee grinder, I’ve used my own: aBaratza Vario W+and aKingrinder K6 hand grinder.

With some takeaway coffees commanding £4 a pop, you could forgo just one month of paper cups of coffee and save enough to buy your own espresso machine. And boy, does the Stilosa make a great espresso.Why we love itThe price is obviously a big part – after all, we love a bargain – but it would be a false economy if it didn’t deliver the espresso-based goods. Connoisseurs may want more features and control, but they’ll probably be pretty surprised, too. Feed the Stilosa with great-quality, well-ground beans from a good grinder, and it’ll serve stunning coffee.I got great results from the medium-light roast beans I had to hand, and pairing the Stilosa with myKingrinder K6 grinderwas a match made in heaven. Espresso was flavourful and well balanced. Although the steam wand lacks oomph, it serves up silky hot milk with a dense microfoam with a bit of practice. The result? Great espresso, wonderful flat whites, moreish cappuccinos.Make sure you check the model number before buying, though. The EC235 and EC260 look almost identical, but swap the manual steam wand for an automatic steam wand and pressurised coffee baskets. That means easier but inferior milk frothing and middling espresso – if you’re planning to feed the Stilosa good, freshly ground coffee, then buy the EC230.It’s a shame that …you don’t get everything you need in the box. The water tank feels cheap, and there’s no option to fit a water filter – although that can be fixed by buying a separate water filter jug.It comes with a piece of plastic that resembles a plastic tamper and coffee scoop, but it’s useless at the former and merely OK at the latter. My advice?Buy a proper metal tamper for about a tenner.It tends to drip from the spouts as there’s no pressure valve, so have a cloth handy. Maybe an apron, too.Machine type:manual espressoDimensions:21x 34 x 29cm (WDH)Time to heat up:1min 30secsMakes milk-based drinks?YesPeak noise level:80dB (61dB average)Warranty:1 year repair or replaceBest low-effort coffee machine:De’Longhi Magnifica Evo One TouchView image in fullscreen£579 at John Lewis£449 at AmazonI’ve tested several De’Longhi bean-to-cup machines over the years, all the way up to its range-topping £2,299.99Maestosa, but the Magnifica Evo One Touch is the best-value pick by a margin. It serves up tasty espressos, americanos and lattes with minimum fuss.Why we love itThe machine is fairly compact by bean-to-cup standards, although you’ll need to leave a little room around and above the machine. Bright, illuminated icons along the top edge evoke the glow of touchscreens on pricier models, but these are simple press buttons. You can choose from seven different drinks, and the built-in milk carafe allows it to craft cappuccinos and creamy lattes with zero hassle.The quality of the drinks isn’t as immaculate as the pricier Jura C8, but it’s not far off. Espresso is rich and flavourful, hitting about 68C, and cappuccinos and latte macchiatos are topped with a pleasingly dense layer of creamy foam. The MyLatte drink option will prove popular: fill the carafe with the right amount of milk for your preferred coffee cup, and the machine will drain the carafe and add a shot of coffee.It’s a shame that …it’s not quiet. The grinder’s whines peak at 75dB, and the average noise level of 60dB is markedly louder than the Jura. The lack of a dedicated hot milk function feels like an oversight.Machine type:bean to cupDimensions:24 x 44 x 36cm (WDH)Time to heat up:35 secondsMakes milk-based drinks?YesPeak noise level:75dB (average 60dB)Warranty:2 years repair or replace at De’Longhi’s discretionBest for capsules:L’or Barista SublimeView image in fullscreen£104 at John Lewis£69.99 at AmazonBuilt by Philips, this L’or-branded machine makes a huge range of coffees thanks to its compatibility with official Nespresso, Nespresso-compatible and L’or’s own range of pods. It doesn’t support the latest Vertuo pods, but this machine looks great and works well.Why we love itThe compact dimensions are a big plus, and the design is (mostly) sensible. There’s a removable 0.8l water tank at the rear, and the drip tray and pod bin slide out together.It’s easy to use, too. Simply lift the large curved handle on top, pop in a capsule and close the lid. You can also pour two normal-size cups simultaneously.I wasn’t a fan of some of the more potent XXL L’or espresso pods – although the high-street chain flavour may be to some tastes – but there are more than 100 other options from which to choose.It’s a shame that …the drip tray, lid and pod bin separate with minimal encouragement, so it’s easy to send their contents scattering across your kitchen floor if you’re not paying attention. Nor is it the quietest machine, although it’s unlikely to wake up the household.Some users have reported that the machine doesn’t play nicely with all Nespresso-compatible capsules. I had no such problems during my testing, but it’s worth buying a handful of capsules to test before buying in bulk.Opinions are mixed on thesustainability of capsule coffee, butL’orandNespresso’sstandard aluminium capsules can be sent back for recycling – both companies provide free postage options for returning capsules in bulk.

The stainless-steel build is reminiscent of the Gaggia Classic, but the big upgrade is the adjustable PID temperature controller that puts you in charge of both the brewing and steaming temperatures.Why we love itIt’s the Anna’s mixture of talents that makes it so appealing. Value is foremost: the price is only a little higher than the Gaggia Classic, without even considering an aftermarket PID, which would add £300+ on top. The two-year warranty is welcome, too – and Lelit is also confident enough to warranty it for a full year of commercial (ab)use.Once you’ve primed the boiler (note: read the instructions carefully), you can get brewing in about three minutes. The Anna PL41TEM lets you adjust the brew and steam temperatures from 80C to 130C. Set to the specific brew temperature recommended for your coffee, or just start with the default 95C.The control is invaluable: I remedied a slight bitterness to my first shots by dropping the brew temperature down a single degree. If, like me, you love globe-trotting one far-flung coffee plantation at a time, this adjustability ekes out amazing results from exotic light roasts through to classic Italian espresso.It’s a shame that …getting started may be daunting for beginners. The text-only, bullet-point instructions are unwelcoming;YouTube videosare a friendlier place to start. The manual fill boiler requires a little care, so it’s essential to get the hang of.The solid, basic design is reassuring for longevity, but refined it is not. The water tank just clunks into place with rubber pipes feeding from the top, and the top cover and drip tray are rattly. What’s more, the 57mm portafilter is a non-standard size, so upgrades to the portafilter, basket and various accessories are slightly harder to come by.One final very minor moan from my long-term testing: the plastic window is just a tad too opaque, so it’s not very clear how much water is remaining.Machine type:manual espressoDimensions:23x 38 x 34cm (WDH)Time to heat up:3 minutesMakes milk-based drinks?YesPeak noise level:79dB (64dB average)Warranty:2-year repair or replace at Lelit’s discretionThe best espresso machines to unleash your inner barista at home, testedRead moreBest manual machine for beginners:Sage Bambino PlusView image in fullscreen£399.99 at Currys£399 at AmazonThe Bambino Plus’s balance of coffee-brewing talent and beginner-friendly features can’t be beaten for the money. It welcomes even complete newcomers with its friendly, informative user manual and helpful YouTube tutorials, and it’s capable of brewing brilliant coffee.Why we love itIt’s a neat little machine, and the modest dimensions mean it will slot unobtrusively on to most kitchen worktops. Sage supplies almost everything you need in the box, too. I say almost everything: you’ll also need some good fresh coffee beans and something to grind them with.The quality of the coffee seals the deal here, however. In something of a rarity at this price, the Bambino Plus has a temperature controller, ensuring the brewing water hits the coffee grounds at a consistent temperature. Combine that with a decent-quality coffee bean and a capable grinder, and you’ve got a recipe for routinely good espresso with a bare minimum of faff.The best food processors, mixers and blenders – chosen by chefsRead moreFactor in the automatic milk texturing, which serves up wonderfully hot, silky, frothed milk at the press of a button, and it’s invigoratingly easy to whip up superb flat whites and cappuccinos. It’s a beginner’s dream.It’s a shame that …the manual mode doesn’t feel quite right without a proper physical dial, so budding baristas may hanker for a fully manual espresso machine. As you can’t adjust the brew temperature, you’re better off sticking with medium- to dark-roast coffee beans (lighter roasts require higher brew temperatures, so they may taste a little sour).Machine type:assisted manual espressoDimensions:19 x 36 x 30cm (WDH)Time to heat up:6 secondsMakes milk-based drinks?YesPeak noise level:63dB (50dB average)Warranty:2 years repair, replace or refund at Sage’s discretionRead our fullSage Bambino Plus reviewBest premium low-effortcoffeemachine:Jura C8View image in fullscreen£672 at Appliance City£899 at John LewisJura describes its C8 as its first entry into the “premium economy segment”, which gives you a good idea of how expensive the rest of its machines are. The C8 is, however, an example of trickle-down technology done right. It makes only four types of coffee, but makes them well. The design is astute, and it’s easy to use. A class act.Why we love itThere’s only so lovely you can make a large black cuboid, but Jura’s done well here. It’s all plastic, but it doesn’t feel unsubstantial, and unlike rival machines, there’s precious little in the way of lumps and protrusions.One of my favourite features is the milk system: the milk carafe itself is rather elegant, or you can choose to drop the rubber tube into a milk bottle or jug straight from the fridge.Espresso is among the best from any bean-to-cup machine I’ve tested in this price range, and the Jura produces a smoother, more balanced shot than cheaper machines. The black coffee is good, and although the cappuccino is similarly tasty, the latte macchiato was my favourite – the combination of a nice dense milk foam and well-extracted coffee is dangerously moreish.It’s a shame that …it’s mostly quiet – noise levels hover around 45dB while brewing and grinding – but the milk system can make a loud 70dB slurp when it first starts to pull milk through.Machine type:bean to cupDimensions:26 x 44 x 33cm (WDH)Time to heat up:30 secondsMakes milk-based drinks?YesPeak noise level:70dB (average 45dB)Warranty:25 months repair or replace at Jura’s discretionBest Nespressomachine:Nespresso Vertuo PlusView image in fullscreen£199 at NespressoThe Vertuo Plus uses Nespresso’s larger, pricier Vertuo capsules, allowing it to make everything from surprisingly refined espresso to half-litre carafes.Why we love itIf you’re looking for the most compact machine possible, then the Vertuo Plus isn’t it. Standing almost 33cm tall, the Plus’s curved body and offset water tank are an imposing sight next to the smaller capsule machines on my kitchen counter.Crucially, though, the Vertuo Plus makes a mean coffee. You can use any of the Vertuo capsules, and the machine did a great job with all those I tested. It’s quieter than theVertuo Lattissima, too, and while the noise levels reach 54dB when the capsules spin up, it’s a much less annoying thrum than its stablemate.One word of warning: lungos come out at a steaming hot 78C, perfect for adding milk, but tongue-searingly hot without. Espresso shots tend to pour into the cup at about 70C, so they are drinkable right away.It’s a shame that …the retail price is high. However, it’s regularly discounted. The same machine is made by several different manufacturers, though, so you’ll see versions with slightly different styling.Machine type:capsuleDimensions:22 x 35 x 33cm (WDH)Time to heat up:27 secondsMakes milk-based drinks?NoPeak noise level:54.5dB (average 50.5dB)Warranty:2 years repair or replace at Nespresso’s discretionThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Makes consistently enjoyable coffee’: the Lavazza Jolie Evo.Photograph: Sasha MullerNinja Cafe Luxe ES601UKView image in fullscreen£549 at John Lewis£499.99 at AmazonBest for:sublime espresso and milk-based coffees without the effort – or the expenseskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Pour coffee beans into the hopper on top, and it’ll grind, measure and adapt the settings automatically to produce the perfect espresso, long black and beyond.Indeed, espresso is just the beginning. Press a button on the shiny fascia and it’ll whip milk into a hot, silken froth perfect for a cappuccino or flat white. But what if you fancy something more akin to a filter coffee? Or a cold brew coffee, for that matter? Not a problem: cold or hot, milk or coffee, the Cafe Luxe will brew, steam or froth it to perfection. Take a little time to decipher the busy control panel, and a whole world of coffee lies at your fingertips.If you’re wondering why you’d pick this over a fully automatic bean-to-cup machine, then the answer is the coffee quality. As this is a portafilter machine, the Ninja draws out a depth of flavour and complexity from good coffee beans that fully automatic machines can only dream of. The downside is more effort, but if you want manual espresso quality without the faff, this is as good as it gets for about £500 – Sage’s superior assisted machines cost twice as much.It didn’t make the final cut because …if you have £500 to spend but don’t want a fully manual machine, the question is whether this will be automatic enough for you. If you’d prefer to simply press a button and get on with the washing-up, then a fully automatic bean-to-cup machine such as theDe’Longhi Magnifica Evo One Touchwill be a better pick.Machine type:assisted;dimensions:37 x 33 x 37cm (WDH);time to heat up:35 seconds;makes milk-based drinks?Yes;peak noise level:66dB (average 57dB);warranty:two yearsMoccamaster KBG SelectView image in fullscreen£193.54 at Amazon£218 at AOBest for:simple filter coffeeSpending more than £200 on a filter coffee machine may seem extravagant, but the KBG Select is anything but ordinary. Built to last a lifetime, it’s one of a few select machines to earn an accreditation from the SpecialtyCoffeeAssociation and the European Coffee Brewing Centre for its brewing prowess.That the machine is designed and handbuilt in the Netherlands goes some way towards explaining the high price. As does the five-year warranty and the promise of lifelong repairability. It certainly doesn’t hurt that you can pick from more than 20 kitchen-matching colours.It couldn’t be simpler to use: pop in a paper filter, add the ground coffee to the filter and wait patiently. You can brew anything between four and 10 125ml cups of coffee – admittedly closer to five normal-size mugs – and a full jug takes a consistent six minutes to brew.If you’re making fewer cups, you can flick the half-jug switch to slow the brewing process and eke every last drop of flavour from smaller doses of coffee. However much you brew, the hotplate then stays on for 40 minutes, keeping coffee warm without stewing it.The quality of the coffee it makes, and the consistency with which it does so, is what sets the KBG Select apart. I’ve had surprisingly pleasant results from pre-ground supermarket coffee, but routinely enjoy wonderful cups from freshly ground beans. Feed the KBG Select with great coffee, and it quietly does the rest.It didn’t make the cut because …the machine feels lightweight, and the glass carafe doesn’t feel especially solid. That said, my unit has been used daily for almost two years now, and nothing has broken. Yet.One final word of caution for any coffee perfectionists: you may prefer a machine with more adjustability, such as Sage’s well-regardedPrecision Brewer.Machine type:filterDimensions:32 x 17 x 36cm (WDH)Time to heat up:25 secondsMakes milk-based drinks?NoPeak noise level:59dB (average 44dB)Warranty:5 years (excluding carafe)Lavazza Jolie EvoView image in fullscreen£69 at Lavazza£81.68 at AmazonBest for:hassle-free Italian espresso and tasty black coffeeThere are cheaper capsule machines and there are far fancier ones, but the £99 Jolie Evo earns a recommendation by making consistently enjoyable coffee. Lavazza’sA Modo Miocapsule range is small, but each gives a pleasingly brash, nutty Italian espresso flavour with minimal hassle, and the machine is compact and uncomplicated.The Jolie Evo is small, so it fits into tiny gaps on a kitchen worktop. The removable 0.6l water tank saves you from carrying jugs of water across the kitchen, and the little bin holds five caps.The machine heats up in 30 to 35 seconds, then you drop a capsule in the slot, pull down the lever (which has a rather satisfying action) and press the button. The Jolie Evo will keep pouring until you press the button a second time, so you can have any amount of coffee from the shortest ristretto to a longer 160ml brew. It’s reasonably quiet, too: I measured a peak sound level of 45dB from a metre away.It didn’t make the final cut because …the water tank can be fiddly to slot back into place. Also, the capsule drawer doesn’t always push back flush with the surround.Machine type:capsule;dimensions:12 x 33 x 21cm (WDH);time to heat up:35 seconds;makes milk-based drinks?No;peak noise level:45dB (average 35dB);warranty:2 years repair or replace at Lavazza’s discretionSage Barista Touch ImpressView image in fullscreen£1,199.95 at Sage£1,199 at AmazonBest for:manual espresso excellence without the effortIf it weren’t for the price, this would be in one of the top slots: it’s become my go-to for espresso, cappuccino and beyond. The combination of automatic grinding, dosing and brewing assistance and the excellent automatic milk texturing is a life-saver when I need to be juggling kids rather than coffee paraphernalia.The Barista Touch Impress is truly lovely to use. The bright touchscreen guides you through the process of dialling in your espresso and steaming your milk, so even beginners don’t feel overwhelmed. What’s more, it optimises the grind size and amount of coffee to ensure that every shot extracts the optimal amount of flavour.All the little details make for a great experience, such as the Baratza-manufactured burrs in the grinder, the adjustable brew temperature and the overall ease of use. And, although it’s assisted, the physical process of handling the portafilter and popping the milk jug under the wand makes you feel like you’re doing it all yourself.This is barista cosplay for lazy and busy espresso fans – and I count myself as being in both camps simultaneously.It didn’t make the final cut because …for the same kind of money, you could buy a very capable, fully manual machine, a quality grinder and still have enough cash for a few kilos of high-end coffee beans.Machine type:assisted manual espresso;dimensions:36 x 34 x 42cm (WDH);time to heat up:6 seconds;makes milk-based drinks?Yes;peak noise level:76dB (average 60dB);warranty:2 years repair, replace or refund at Sage’s discretionNespresso Vertuo LattissimaView image in fullscreen£198.96 at John Lewis£239 at HarrodsBest for:sumptuous milk-based coffees with minimal effort and no messBuilt by De’Longhi, the Vertuo Lattissima is what you’d get if you crossed an automatic bean-to-cup with a Nespresso Vertuo machine. You get all the usual black coffee options, and the clip-on milk carafe means it also serves moreish cappuccinos, latte macchiatos and hot milk on demand.It’s possible to make gorgeously long milk-based drinks with the Vertuo Lattissima – so much so that you’ll need to unclip the small drip tray completely. Pop in an 80ml espresso capsule, for instance, and the latte macchiato button will fill a 590ml cup.The drinks are more than worthy substitutes for any high-street coffee – I could see this machine costing people a small fortune in capsules.It didn’t make the final cut because …as tasty as the coffees are, the RRP of £379 is a lot of money.

Despite a handful of redesigns since its release in the 1990s, this manual espresso machine has become a regular sight in the kitchens of coffee enthusiasts worldwide. It’s capable of making superb espresso, but its retro-facing looks go hand in hand with old-school engineering, and this means that getting consistently great coffee requires a fair bit of trial and error.The decidedly unmodern construction is all part of the appeal here. The stainless steel body and chunky switches are reassuringly utilitarian, and while the drip tray just loosely slots home and the water tank is fiddly to remove, there’s a ramshackle charm to the whole thing.It feels built to last, and it will – replacement parts are readily available. This DIY repairability opens the door to aftermarket upgrades that can radically improve its shot-pulling capabilities and also makes it a good buy on the secondhand market, as long as you budget for potential repair costs.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s perfectly possible to pull a great espresso, but it takes a little trial and error to get there. If you’re willing to learn its quirks, you’ll find the Classic a rewarding companion.Machine type:fully manual espresso;dimensions:23 x 24 x 38cm(WDH);time to heat up:1 minute;makes milk-based drinks?Yes;peak noise level:76dB (average 60dB);warranty:3 years repair or replaceWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenDaily cleaning is non-negotiable for machines with built-in milk-frothing systems.Photograph: Sasha MullerWarrantyWhen things go wrong with your coffee machine, the first port of call is the manufacturer’s warranty. Most have a two-year repair or replace warranty as standard, but pricier models may increase that to three years or – in the rare case of Moccamaster – five years.For the most part, these will be a repair or replace warranty, which means the machine will have to be shipped back to the manufacturer, sometimes at its expense but not always (as ever, it pays to read the small print). It will then be at the company’s discretion as to whether a repair or a replacement is the best course of action.Before you buy, it’s advisable to shop around and check whether different retailers provide free extended cover or offer sensibly priced upgrades to the standard warranty – or alternatively you can consider third-party appliance insurance. This is unlikely to be cost-effective for cheaper machines, though: even a small monthly outlay will quickly add up to more than the price of a new machine.RepairabilityWhen you’re out of warranty, things can get tricky. Generally speaking, the cheaper the machine, the less likely it is that repairs will be economical. Some machines, such as capsule, filter and low-end espresso models, are just not designed to be easily serviceable. Screws and bolts are often replaced by plastic clips, which generally aren’t designed to be unclipped once fastened. Spare parts are hard to come by, too, if they exist at all. And a repair is unlikely to be worthwhile anyway: labour charges will be in the region of £40 an hour.If you want to buy once – or like the popular Reddit communityr/Buy It For Life– you’ll need to spend more upfront for a machine with a repairable design and a healthy supply of spare parts.How often should you clean your coffee machine?The oils in coffee are brilliant at creating sticky, hard-to-remove stains – and dried-on milk does a pretty good job, too. A quick wipe with a wet cloth and a rinse of the machine’s washable or removable parts after every use can save a lot of hassle later. Whatever you do, though, always consult the user manual. If a manufacturer advises against putting a particular part in the dishwasher or immersing it in soapy water, don’t ignore them.You’ll also need to be mindful of long-term maintenance, such as descaling or deep cleaning internal parts. Each machine will require a specific approach, and while some clever units may remind you what’s needed when, or even have automatic cleaning cycles, others will need you to make a note in your calendar and remember to do it yourself.Everything you need to make great coffee – and the kit that’s not worth your moneyRead moreWhen it comes to descaling, always use the correct type of descaler for the job. The metals used in some machines’ heating elements can be irreparably damaged by the types of acids in descaling agents. If in doubt, check the manual, look online or contact the manufacturer for advice before making a potentially costly mistake.A top tip for filter coffee machines is to never use the coffee carafe to fill the machine with water: this coats the machine’s insides with hard-to-remove coffee residue. Some machines have built-in water filters that can pretty much banish the buildup of limescale, but you can get the same benefit by using an affordablewater filter jug. If your kettle is caked in limescale, then you’d benefit from one – and it may even make your coffee taste better.Daily cleaning is non-negotiable for machines with built-in milk-frothing systems. Spoiled milk will taint plastic parts permanently. If you’re not a huge fan of camembert cortados, a thorough wash in the sink after every use is required. Dedicated cleaning products, such asUrnex’s Rinza tablets, will do an even more thorough job if you can bear the expense, but they’re not essential.How to recycle your old coffee machineView image in fullscreenRepair shops can breathe new life into old coffee machines.Photograph: YakobchukOlena/Getty Images/iStockphotoIf you’re tempted to just sling your old coffee machine in the bin, hang on. There are sustainable options you can consider.Repair:If you were happy with your coffee machine before it went kaput, the first option is to repair it. Have a look on Google to see if there are any coffee machine repair shops or technicians nearby. These experts may be able to give you some general advice about the viability and cost-effectiveness of a repair.Donate:Another option is to offer it for free on Freecycle, Ecobees, Freegle or a similar service. If the machine doesn’t work, you can state that it’s supplied on a spares or repair basis. Someone may relish the challenge of bringing it back to life.Refurbish:Some manufacturers provide the option to return your broken machine for repair, even if it’s out of warranty. In the event a repair isn’t possible or cost-effective, they may recycle or refurbish your machine for resale – and possibly offer you another refurbished machine for less. If in doubt, it’s always worth emailing or phoning your manufacturer.Reuse:If you’re replacing your machine with another from the same manufacturer, some parts may be interchangeable, so it could be useful to keep it for spares. Many espresso machines have similarly sized portafilters and filter baskets, and the same goes for other types of coffee machines: many manufacturers use compatible parts across multiple models in their ranges.Recycle:For the parts or machines you can’t reuse, most coffee machines – and most small appliances, for that matter – can be recycled. If you’re unsure about your nearest options, try the Recycling Locator onRecycle Your Electricals. Type in your postcode, the type of appliance and whether you want to recycle, donate or repair it, and you’ll find a list of your nearest options.For my postcode, this gave me the location and contact details for my local recycling centre, in addition to branches of Argos, Tesco, Asda and Currys. It also gave a list of which products would be accepted at each location. This, however, is worth taking with a pinch of salt; I’d contact the location before turning up with a trolley full of old appliances.For example, not all of those stores will provide free recycling for non-customers. Currys is a notable exception, accepting most small electrical items for free in-store recycling. Asda recycles goods only when customers are buying a replacement in-store. And although it said my local Tesco would accept coffee machines, the staff member I spoke to said that while they’d accept anything with a battery, they weren’t aware of an equivalent service for bigger items.The best bet is your local recycling centre, as it will be more likely to accept appliances, especially bulkier ones. Some centres also have dedicated repair boxes where items that may be repairable can be left – in my local borough, these are then taken to prison repair programmes so they can be donated to charity or other good causes.If you can’t get to your local centre, your council may collect smaller appliances alongside your bin collections. For reference, my council stipulates that the items be no larger than 35 x 40cm, fit in a carrier bag and don’t include any glass. Those dimensions cover most coffee machines, so the only challenge may be finding a carrier bag that’s big enough.Sasha Muller is a freelance tech and consumer journalist, avid coffee drinker and craft beer enthusiast with more than two decades of experience in testing products and avoiding deadlines.

I loved the flavour combinations, and was keen to incorporate similar herbaceous notes into a drink that would represent one of the four elements, as well as our new restaurant. I’ve used citrus in the form of yuzu to introduce another flavour dimension that blends in harmoniously. At the restaurant, we make big batches of the citrus syrup from spent lemons and limes, to save on wastage.EarthServes2For the syrup100g finely chopped mixed lime and lemon peel50g finely chopped basil100g sugarFor the drink80ml gin– we useDownpour Original30ml yuzu liqueur– we useChoya150ml basil and citrussyrup– see above and method30ml lime juice40ml egg white(from about 1 large egg)4 slices dehydrated lime, to garnishPut all the syrup ingredients in a medium pan, add 100g cold water and put on a medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar, for six to eight minutes. Take off the heat, leave to cool and infuse overnight or, better still, for 48 hours, then fine-strain into a clean jar, seal and store in the fridge, where it will keep for about three weeks.To build the drink, measure all the liquids into a shaker, add the egg white, then dry shake to set the white. Add ice, shake again, to chill and dilute, then fine-strain into two coupes, garnish each drink with two slices of dried lime and serve.Connor Wren, bar manager,Elements, GlasgowExplore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"

The scent can be elusive, but occasionally, on a warm, sunny day, the breeze catches those golden flowers and diffuses their distinct, sweet scent – a mingling of coconut, vanilla and almond. I’ve added lime to freshen things up, should those flavours prove a little heady or rich.Coconut, vanilla and almond cake with strawberriesWhen strawberries aren’t in season, chopped pineapple also works beautifully here.

Hot on the heels of white smoke at the Vatican and Conclave in cinemas, the gothic Palais des Papes in Avignon, home to the popes of the 14th century, hosted aLouis Vuittoncatwalk, the first fashion show at the palace in its 700-year history.There was no shortage of pomp and ceremony in the central courtyard of one of Europe’s largest medieval structures, where 400 chairs with tall, arched backs and plush, cardinal-red cushions were ranked tightly for Brigitte Macron, Cate Blanchett, Pharrell Williams, a clutch of celebrities making a post-Cannes detour, and a select few of Louis Vuitton’s most deep-pocketed clients.View image in fullscreenPharrell Williams.Photograph: Alexandre Dimou/ReutersView image in fullscreenCate Blanchett.Photograph: Alexandre Dimou/ReutersView image in fullscreen‘Dressing is a performance,’ says Ghesquière.Photograph: Alexandre Dimou/ReutersIn a preview, the designer Nicolas Ghesquière said the collection was part-Arthurian legend, part-Haim sisters on stage. (Danielle and Este Haim were in the audience; the medieval ghosts perhaps watching from within the walls.) “There is something medieval, for sure, but something futuristic too. This is armour, but for now,” he said.Ghesquière chose the building last year, drawn not by its papal origins but by his own memories of attending the experimental theatre festival it hosts each summer. “Dressing is a performance that we are all part of. I love that about fashion, I think it’s really cool,” he said.View image in fullscreenPageantry and drama: a model in Louis Vuitton’s 2026 cruise collection in Avignon.Photograph: Alexandre Dimou/ReutersThat the papacy has been so visible this year is fitting for a designer whose nose for the zeitgeist has secured an impressive 11-year run at the helm of Vuitton. “The coincidence is interesting, of course. And there is a magnetism to this place, to the idea of believing,” he said.The venue also reflects the scale of Louis Vuitton. It is the biggest fashion brand in the LVMH stable, which generated $88bn (£65bn) in revenue in 2024. Filling a gothic palace with celebrities is a power flex the 14th-century popes for whom it was built would have respected.View image in fullscreenEste, left, and Danielle Haim at the Palais des Papes in Avignon.Photograph: Edward Berthelot/GettyGhesquière understands that luxury has become a vast industry, not because people want to be seen to have an expensive handbag, but because they want to be seen to have status, taste and class, all of which are signalled by taking over the Unesco-listed Palais des Papes.

His job, he says, is “to stimulate the eye. If you want to create a classic, first you have to make something new.”Ghesquière, who is contracted to Louis Vuitton until 2028, stands out as a beacon of stability in an industry in flux. Calm and smiling even minutes before the show, he said he was looking forward to the next Paris fashion week, which will be packed with designer debuts. “October will be really exciting.

With no previous gardening experience, the owner Sue Manners began to work on the garden alone after buying the old hall in 1989 with husband Mike. Nowadays, the gardens are among the finest in the country. As you wander, you’ll discover a rich variety of rare and unusual flowers mingling with striking trees and beautiful shrubs. Over 100 roses bloom alongside vibrant collections of delphiniums, peonies, and irises, all set within lush, flowing borders and thoughtfully arranged island beds. Because Thornton Hall is a working farm, the gardens are onlyopen on nine daysthis summer (£10, 10am-4pm).Mike LadymanBuzzing with bees, Gotha Gardens, HertfordshireView image in fullscreenGotha Gardens was an arable field until 1990The site of the family-ownedGotha Gardensat Pembroke Farm, north Hertfordshire, was an arable field until 1990. The original plan was to create a woodland walk with plants to attract pollinators and other wildlife, but then topiary and formal areas were added. On our visit, purple delphiniums and alliums buzzed with bees, and we watched water boatmen and damselflies around the pond. Wandering through the different sections felt like visiting separate open-air rooms, with places to sit and enjoy them.

Stepping into this sunken Victorian garden feels like entering another world. With time to kill before catching a train home, we spent a happy afternoon exploring the 1.2-hectare (three-acre) site, walking the woodland paths and admiring the view from the Italianate terrace before enjoying a cup of tea and homemade cake to the sound of a live jug-band (part of a summer music programme). Entrance costs just £2 and the place is open 9am-6pm in spring and summer and 9am-4pm October to March. For those lucky enough to be local, each summer they host plays, music and exercise classes.LisaWild beauty by the Menai Straits, GwyneddView image in fullscreenThe Lucombe oak in Treborth Botanic Garden was first spotted in 1762.Photograph: Tracey Whitefoot/AlamyWhen I visitedTreborth Botanic Gardenin May, it was buzzing with life.

Informative labels guided me through a collection of fascinating plants, while a wildlife area featured a pond teeming with tadpoles and vibrant dragonflies. Glasshouses (restricted entry) host cacti and orchids. Paths through ancient woodland led down to the Menai Bridge, offering spectacular views across the strait.

The couple who own it – Kay and Patrick McHugh, a musician and an architect respectively – have worked hard for about 25 years to bring the hectare (three acres) of 17th-century walled gardens back from dereliction. The kitchen garden is a patchwork of beautifully designed features including 56 geometrically arranged organic vegetable beds. The orchard is believed to be the remains of a historically significant Renaissance pleasure garden; with a unique arcaded wall comprising 33 identical niches, very few gardens of this type survived the landscape movement.

Friendly gardeners were happy to give us insights in to what was growing and told us about their own lovely adventures in gardening. The cafe uses the garden’s delicious produce and it also has a brilliant shop. All that for £10 for adults (child, £5) in summer (or free for RHS members on Thursdays).

Gary Lineker transfer speculation swirls after BBC exitOutgoing Match of the Day host poised to embrace role of media disruptor during Club World Cup but may not suit move to a traditional BBC rivalMichael SavageMedia editorFri 23 May 2025 07.40 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 13.56 EDTShareIt is a scenario straight from the footballing world. A public falling out, leading to a star player becoming a free agent. From the moment Gary Lineker’s hastened departure from the BBC wasannounced this week, after he apologised for amplifying a social media post with antisemitic connotations, speculation began over his next move. In truth, however, the 64-year-old had already been thinking about his plans beyond the broadcaster.This week, industry insiders have been wondering whether the BBC’s highest-paid presenter could be the subject of an audacious bid by a rival or be sought after by an overseas network. But Lineker could be working closely with another broadcaster as soon as this summer.Having navigated one transformation, from goal poacher to trusted anchor, the presenter is now free to complete another – from a face of the established media to a streamer challenging the old guard.In a sign he is ready to embrace the role of media disruptor, talks are taking place that could lead to his podcast, The Rest is Football, launching shows featuring match clips of this summer’sClub World Cup, whose participants include Manchester City, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. His Goalhanger Productions company is discussing the idea with Dazn, the global rights holder for the tournament, which kicks off next month.It is not just his platform of choice that is changing after his BBC departure. While Lineker’s on-screen draw has always been a streak of cheekiness, in the podcast he and his regular Match of the Day sparring partners Alan Shearer and Micah Richards take a more irreverent – and sweary – tone. Lineker caused headlines during last year’s Euros bydescribing an England performance as “shit”in one episode. By this summer, he will be fully unleashed from the BBC’s strictures.View image in fullscreenLineker and his Match of the Day sparring partners including Alan Shearer (right) take a more irreverent tone in their podcast.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAThe potential deal indicates the ambitions of Lineker and Goalhanger Productions, the extraordinarily successful podcast company he co-founded, which oversees titles including The Rest is History and The Rest is Politics. Cracking the US, where the Club World Cup is taking place, is a priority. Lineker has previously made clear that podcasting is where he sees his post-BBC future.It also tees up next year’s World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico. While he is no longer taking on presenting duties for the BBC, there is obvious scope for The Rest is Football livestreams to conduct instant post-match analysis.“We’re keen to take a similar approach to what we did around the [2024] Euros, with The Rest is Football going out more regularly across the tournament,” said a Goalhanger representative. “We’ll certainly be covering the World Cup, though no production plans have been finalised yet.”Unsurprisingly, Lineker has been cutting back on his commitments this week. He was said to be genuinely devastated by what he admitted was a serious error – reposting a video about Zionism that used a rat emoji, echoing a depiction of Jewish people used in Nazi Germany. He deleted the post and apologised the next day, but anger had already built within the BBC among staff and bosses. With his social media activity having caused repeated heat for the corporation, both sides agreed enough was enough.Lineker was due to make a starring appearance at a podcast conference in central London on Thursday but pulled out. While he has already had offers of new projects of various kinds, friends said his immediate concerns were to take time out and prepare for an important family wedding. It will not be until the summer that he sits down to think about a firmer, longer-term plan.But that has not stopped speculation within the TV world about a big-money transfer. Some things can be ruled out. He will not be switching to cookery programmes, a previous offer from the BBC that he found easy to resist.He would come to any new broadcaster with the baggage ofvarious skirmishes over political impartiality, quite apart from this week’s incident. But his status as a trusted screen presence is well established. Match of the Day has performed well under Lineker’s reign. While viewer numbers have declined as media habits have changed, its audience share has grown from 20% in 2002 to 29% in 2025, according to the analytics company Digital-i. The show’s average audience so far this year has been 2.3 million and it has held pretty steady since the Covid pandemic.Gary Lineker was once my rival. I feel no shame in saying I was beaten by the bestRead moreSo is there any chance Lineker will be targeted by a traditional BBC rival? The obvious post would be heading ITV’s World Cup coverage, but most industry figures who spoke to the Guardian believe that highly unlikely. The channel has invested in Mark Pougatch, its lead football anchor. In practice, parachuting Lineker in would involve putting “a lot of noses out of joint” at the broadcaster, said one industry old hand, adding: “There’d be a mutiny.”Even those who consider it a possibility regard it as unlikely. “I’d say about a 10% chance,” said one television insider. Another gave it less credence: “No chance.”Sky Sports shows the most Premier League games by far, and spends a lot of money for those rights. Industry figures said it ran a tight ship in terms of its team. “You can almost be a bit too big to fit into another organisation,” said one figure in football broadcasting.View image in fullscreenLineker in 1999 when he began presenting Match of the Day, alongside Trevor Brooking (left) and Alan Hansen.Photograph: PA Images/AlamySome have speculated that an overseas broadcaster such as Fox in the US may be a more likely home, where Lineker’s social media history would be less of a concern. But those who have worked with him say he enjoyed working for a prominent UK broadcaster. “Gary likes being with one of the main players,” said one former colleague, adding that the presenter paid close attention to how the BBC rated against ITV during major football tournaments.The real decision, say some who know him, will come down to how he feels after so many years at the BBC and bruising encounters with the media. “It’s up to him,” said one. “I’m not sure that he would jump at just anything. He’s very close to his boys and that’s very important to him. It would have to suit Gary and I think he’ll probably take some time out anyway.”Another former colleague agreed. “I’m a big fan of Gary, who developed from an average presenter to a star,” they said. “But he might decide to have a different life.”Explore more on these topicsGary LinekerMatch of the DayBBCITV plcSkyPodcastsTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The crew watched as the animals – the last survivors of a weeks-long voyage from Saskatchewan, Canada – skittered out of their crates and up into the dense, lonely, rainforest.The moose had arrived on a flight of fancy, as part of the then premier’s grand vision to turn Fiordland national park into a hunters’ paradise. It was the second attempt to release moose into the region – in a country whose only native land-based mammals are bats – after nearly all of an earlier herd died crossing the seas. Red deer and wapiti, or elk, were also released around the same time for game-hunting.Over the next few years, moose sightings were reported and photographs of their hulking frames lying dead next to hunters occasionally graced the pages of local newspapers. The last confirmed sighting was in 1951, after which, they were pronounced extinct.What really happened in Calvine? The mystery behind the best UFO picture ever seenRead moreYet in the decades since, there have been clues that the animals remain in New Zealand. People have found footprints too large to be deer, branches 7 to 8 feet high broken and stripped of their leaves, fur snagged in trees and cast antlers. There have also been numerous unconfirmed sightings of moose.Seventy-five years on from the last confirmed photograph, New Zealanders are still hunting moose – not for their heads, but for answers to an enduring mystery that has captured the public imagination for decades: are the elusive beasts still roaming the vast Fiordland wilds? Or is this just another myth of many projected on to the eerie, isolated terrain?That question came one step closer to being answered in March, when within two weeks of one another two hiking groups from the US and Canada reported seeing moose while tramping along Fiordland’s Kepler Track, sparking a new flurry of national interest.On the trail of New Zealand’s NessieKen Tustin, a biologist, former helicopter pilot and hunter who is more widely known as New Zealand’s “moose man” has been tracking moose for more than 40 years – half his lifetime.View image in fullscreenKen Tustin servicing trail cameras in the Fiordland bush.Photograph: Stephen JaquieryIn 1995 he captured grainy footage on a trail camera of what he believes is a moose and in 2002, a tuft of fur he found snagged on a tree was confirmed to be moose through DNA testing at a Canadian university.It is tempting to draw comparisons between the moose mystery and the quests for Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster but Tustin says moose are in “quite a different category”, given they were introduced.“The existence [of moose] is so extraordinary, it seems unbelievable. But we ask people, before you dismiss it, please look to the evidence.”Canadian Antoine Beauchamp says there was no mistaking the large animal, which crossed their path 10 metres away during their hike.“All three of us had the same thought: that this is a moose,” Beauchamp said, adding that his hiking party regularly see moose at home, sometimes in their own back yards.“The colour was very distinctive, it had a big shoulder bump which is not common for red deer or wapiti … this, combined with the height of the animal, it was clear it was a moose.”Without photographic evidence, the department of conservation is sceptical moose still exist.View image in fullscreenKen Tustin’s only photo of what he believes to be an adult female moose, captured on a trail camera in Fiordland, 1995.Photograph: Ken TustinWhen the most recent sightings emerged, its Te Anau-based operations manager John Lucas said until there was proof, the department would “continue to take the view that we are most likely dealing with a deer … or possibly a red/wapiti cross that has been mistaken for a moose.”Moose are larger than red deer and wapiti, and unlike the latter two species, which have tree-like antlers, moose have broad flat antlers that fan out into finger-like edges.Moose are typically dark brown, red deer are reddish-brown in summer and grey in winter, while wapiti are fawn-coloured with a rump patch. Moose are typically solitary, while red deer and wapiti tend to move in herds.“In some respects, if someone actually gets a photo, that might be quite disappointing – the mystery would be solved,” Lucas says.“There is a saying that the presence of absence is not necessarily the absence of presence and that will endure until someone actually takes a photograph.”Fiordland a ‘locus’ for mysteryFiordland is New Zealand’s largest national park and forms a major part of a Unesco world heritage site. Its rainforest, ragged mountains, glassy fjords and lakes draw tourists to its famous hikes, while its dramatic and mostly inaccessible terrain is a perfect canvas for mythology and rumour.For over a century, stories abounded of a lost Māori tribe living in Fiordland, while some people believed the moa – a large flightless bird that went extinct hundreds of years ago – stalked the vast valleys into the late 1800s.View image in fullscreenKen Tustin’s wife, Marg, in a boat in Dusky Sound, Fiordland, during one of the couple’s many moose tracking trips.Photograph: Ken Tustin“Fiordland is always the locus for this sort of stuff,” says Charlie Mitchell, a senior journalist for The Press who has covered the moose story for years.“We sort of need Fiordland to be this locus of mystery, because otherwise we have to accept that we’ve managed to survey everything, we’ve found everything.”Sometimes, species deemed extinct have reemerged, such as thetakahē, another large flightless bird as round and blue as Earth, which was rediscovered in Fiordland in 1948, 50 years after the last sighting.Mitchell says the odds of moose following in the footsteps of takahē are extremely low, but not zero.“That’s what makes it frustrating and compelling at the same time … as long as that [chance] is there, I think there will be people still searching for the moose.”map of fiordland national parkTustin concedes he may never find a moose but seeing one is almost besides the point.“I love that moose have taken on an almost spiritual element in Fiordland,” he says.“When I think of Fiordland … I think rain on the smooth water, diminishing ridges, hanging cloud, ferns bobbing under the rain. Its mood, its mystery, and my goodness, a moose fits in there beautifully.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While your article featured many nearby places, it failed to mention the Fleece Inn in Bretforton.Owned by the National Trust, it was built in the early 15th century as a longhouse by a prosperous yeoman farmer called Byrd. It later became a pub, which was rebuilt in the 17th century and remained in the Byrd family until 1977. It is also the venue that kicks off the annualasparagus festivaland auction, and serves a much loved beer called Pig’s Ear, another product along with the local “gras” that makes local people very happy.Dr Stephen MartinMatlock, DerbyshireIt was disturbing to read your description of Caernarfon as the third happiest place to live in Britain without mentioning how the town’s main spoken language is Welsh. Much of the happiness felt in living here comes from having our own language, which we share with people from across the globe. It fosters a sense of community and is the medium of a thriving culture. In encouraging your readers to move there in complete disregard of its linguistic ecosystem, you destroy the very basis of your own “feature”.Angharad PriceCaernarfonThe writer of the Lewes section somehow managed to miss the town’s major feature, Harvey’s Brewery at Cliffe Bridge alongside the River Ouse. It’s beenbrewing since the 1820sand the grade II listed redbrick buildings, including an imposing chimney, were designed by leading Victorian architect William Bradford. The award-winning beers include one of the finest cask ales known to drinking kind: Sussex Best Bitter. The beers are available in Harvey’s many pubs in Lewes. The pubs and the brewery should be high on any visit to the town.Roger ProtzSt AlbansThanks for trumpeting that Berwick-upon-Tweed is the happiest place to live in Great Britain. Now we can expect even more visitors than we already receive.

Don’t think it’s all overReaders offer sympathy and advice to Guardian sportswriter Jonathan Liew after his retirement from amateur footballFri 23 May 2025 12.34 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 13.18 EDTShareJonathan Liew’s piece on the end of his football career struck a chord, or perhaps a tendon (Some guts, no glory: end of my amateur football career brings painful realisation, 20 May). His comment that top players can count on “trophies and triumphs, medals and memories” is true for a few. But for most of us who’ve played team sports, wins may come yet trophies rarely do.Many revered professionals, though well-paid and regularly picked, retire without silverware. Does that diminish their sporting life? I don’t think so, but perhaps they do. I’m pleased for Harry Kane that he’s finally in a team that’s won something meaningful, as I was when my own team, West Ham,lifted the Uefa Conference Leaguetrophy in 2023. A winner is a winner, at whatever level, and they can all eventually retire having won at least one competition.I understand Jonathan’s feeling that the only connection with elite athletes is “the sacrifice” and “pain and punishment”. But I’d argue that the true link is the desire to play, to compete, to give your best. After a 41-year break, I’ve taken up cycling time trials again. I’m slow, but as fellow competitors point out, faster than everyone sitting at home. And post-race, I hobble around just like the 28mph riders; the effort is the same, even if the results are very different.Jonathan should celebrate his football days. He’s played more, and better, than most of the armchair pundits ever will. And now? Well, he could try cycling: easier on the knees and ankles, great cardio, and there’s still a pint and a laugh at the end. Good luck!Nigel HoggartBradwell-on-Sea, EssexI, like Jonathan Liew, also recently made peace with amateur “career” retirement. Having lasted 25 years playing at various levels of the Donegal junior league, the time felt right to finally hang up the Copa Mundials (the boot of choice, despite a brief ill-fated dalliance with Nike).Unfortunately, I was unable to go out on a high note, having suffered relegation from the Donegal premier division on the last day of the season. I have no doubt my body will appreciate the decision. As will the younger members of our squad – who inexplicably frequently rejected my choice of dressing room music. (The Prodigy’sFat of the Landis surely still popular with the young folk, right?)Park running, swimming and cycling will become my new physical pursuits. All noble and worthwhile, but absolutely nothing will replace the feeling of lacing the boots up and crossing the white line. It’s been emotional.Colin McNicholasBunbeg, County Donegal, IrelandMy heart goes out to Jonathan Liew, whose excellent article beautifully captured those feelings experienced on the day you realise you have to hang up your boots.My “career”, played out in the Wensleydale Creamery League no less, was cut short by injury at the tender age of 26, so Jonathan can perhaps think himself fortunate to have nearly reached 40 before having to call it a day.And anyway, I have some good news for him. There’s always walking football. I began in my 50s and still get a childlike thrill every Thursday evening when I don my trainers and for an hour can still pretend to be Colin Todd, sweeping majestically in defence. As long as you can wander around the artificial grass,  and stay upright, you can continue to dream what it must be like to be great.Ben RustonRichmond, North YorkshireOh Jonathan, don’t despair! I play regularly with a group ranging in age from 19 to 68 and, afterwards in the pub, a fellow sexagenarian and I toast the miracle of playing the same game at 60 that we were playing at six years old. Hell, we’re better than we were as six-year-olds!

Will England listen?, 19 May) in condemning the use of physical and verbal violence on children. However, I part company with Cosslett in her view that taking an enlightened position on this issue is co-terminus with a “child-centred” parenting style. It is possible to be non-violent without subscribing to a child-centred approach. It can be argued that such child-centredness is itself an overreaction to past parenting approaches, and can lead to as many problems as it seeks to solve.I have been privileged to be given a ringside seat to two very different parenting styles as a member of a “blended” family, with grandchildren being brought up in this country by committed child-centred parents, and grandchildren being brought up in Spain with a parenting style I would call “family centred”. And if you think this is the same thing, you would be mistaken.Childrenin Spain learn from the moment they are born that they are members of a family first and foremost.The parenting style reflects the preeminence of the group, not the individual child. In my (admittedly subjective) experience, children brought up in a family-centred culture are far less likely to be attention seeking, are less demanding of their parents, and evince greater emotional security, subject to less parental over-involvement. I see less aggression and frustration being expressed by Spanish parents with their kids than that shown by English ones.I do wish we could all learn to lift our heads up and look at how other cultures parent their children. We could find plenty of examples that beat our child-centred approach hands down.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

On Wednesday evening Brian Murphy, a US district judge in Boston, determined that the administration had disregarded his earlier judicial directive, issued in April, which ruled that anyone being deported to third-party countries had the right to challenge it legally. He criticized the brief window allowed for the men to object to their transfer, labeling it “clearly inadequate”.The group is currently being held by the Department of Homeland Security in Djibouti, which also hosts a key US military installation. At a briefing on Wednesday the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed that the men would stay in Djibouti for two weeks.Donald Trump responded to the ruling on hisTruth Socialplatform, expressing dissatisfaction with the order. The US president wrote that the judge “has ordered that EIGHT of the most violent criminals on Earth curtail their journey to South Sudan, and instead remain in Djibouti. He would not allow these monsters to proceed to their final destination”.The president added that the administration was “also forced to leave behind, in order to watch these hardened thugs, a large number of Ice Officers, who would otherwise be in the United States, protecting our Citizens”.Murphy’srulingstipulated that the men must receive adequate notice and a minimum of 15 days to contest their deportation, aligning with international human rights standards. He further specified that six of the individuals had the right to assert, with legal representation, fears of torture or mistreatment in the destination country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

CNNreportedin April that Bukele’s government had specifically asked for nine top MS-13 leaders to be brought back to El Salvador from the US.Critics of Trump who are defending Arevalo-Chavez’s rights see the move to deport him as a way to prevent him from testifying in a US court, or becoming a federal government cooperator, to limit disclosures about Bukele’s past ties to the gang as much as possible.Arevalo-Chavez is a member of the “Ranfla Nacional”, which is considered to be a directors’ board of sorts for the MS-13 gang. Federal charges pending against him in New York include racketeering, terrorism and conspiring to commit narco-terrorism.A filing from the US justice department – dated 1 April but not unsealed until Thursday – said federal prosecutors want to dismiss charges against Arevalo-Chavez for “sensitive and important foreign policy considerations”.Prosecutors added that “geopolitical and national security concerns of the United States” and said permitting “the prosecution of the defendant to proceed in the first instance in El Salvador” was also a factor.Arevalo-Chavez is still in the US, with his attorneys requesting more information about the reasons behind the dismissal of charges and the intended deportation.The judge ruled in April to not relocate him anywhere, preventing his being placed into the custody of the US’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), which would lead to his deportation.“The ‘geopolitical and national security concerns’ appear to be an effort by the government to support a ‘deal’ with El Salvador to assist Bukele in suppressing the truth about a secret negotiation he had with MS-13 leaders in return for our government using El Salvador prisons,” Arevalo-Chavez’s attorneys said in a separate filing also unsealed on Thursday. That filing in particular mentioned the notorious Cecot prison built to house alleged gang members.The US attorney’s office for New York’s eastern federal district, where Arevalo-Chavez is being prosecuted, declined to comment Friday when asked by the Guardian. Arevalo-Chavez’s attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In mid-March, the US justice department quietly dismissed charges against another top Ranfla Nacional member andexpelled him to El Salvadorto be detained at Cecot, an acronym whose full name in Spanish means “the terrorism confinement center”. That other Ranfla leader, Cesar Humberto López-Larios, was facing similar charges in New York and also reportedly had insight about the deal Bukele previously struck with the gang.“This is collusion between two governments, the US and El Salvador, to cover up a gang pact by dropping charges on known gangsters in order to disappear them before they can testify,” said political science professor Michael Ahn Paarlberg at Virginia Commonwealth University. “It’s a criminal conspiracy between the Trump and Bukele administrations.“The irony is both of them claim to be tough on crime.”According to a justice departmentindictment, in 2019, the MS-13 leadership forged a pact with top Bukele administration officials. El Faro, a Salvadoran news organization,first reportedon secretive meetings during which Bukele officials would enter prisons in El Salvador to negotiate directly with the Ranfla leaders.As part of the deal, MS-13 would receive certain money- and land-related concessions while agreeing to reduce the amount of violence they inflicted in El Salvador. Additionally, some top MS-13 leaders were released from prison – and the gang promised to leverage its networks to support Bukele’s political party in the 2021 legislative elections, according to prosecutors.The pact purportedly collapsed in 2022, leading Bukele to engage in a massive offensive against gangs in the country. Critics say that so-called state of exception crackdown led to atrampling of due process and human rightsin the Central American nation – while also allowing Bukele to further consolidate power there.For years, Bukele has attempted to suppress any evidence of his ties to MS-13 by either attempting to recapture Ranfla leaders or by ignoring US extradition requests.Does Nayib Bukele’s campaign against democracy give a blueprint for Trump?Read moreUS federal law enforcement agencies have long pursued MS-13’s criminal networks. In 2020 and in 2022, two separate federal indictments in New York charging 27 leaders of the gang were handed up and unsealed.In 2021, the US treasury departmentsanctionedtwo top Bukele officials for their alleged “corruption”, saying they engaged in “covert negotiations between government officials and the criminal organization” in order to secure the secret pact with MS-13. The treasury department also alleged that Bukele’s administration in 2020 provided financial incentives to MS-13 to reduce gang violence in exchange for “political support”.Arevalo-Chavez, one of the co-defendants in the 2022 indictment, had “participated in negotiations with the government of El Salvador on behalf of MS-13”, said the justice department, then controlled by Joe Biden’s presidential administration. Arevalo-Chavez left El Salvador and went to Mexico, where he helped run the gang’s operations there.The Mexican government arrested Arevalo-Chavez in February 2023 and quickly transferred him to the US, where the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) took custody. He is in custody in a federal detention facility while his case proceeds.Relations between El Salvador and the US have improved since Trump took office. In 2021, tensions between Biden officials and the Bukele government flared when, despite an international arrest warrant and extradition request, Salvadoran officialsquietly releasedRanfla Nacional leader Elmer Canales-Rivera from prison. US prosecutors alleged in a 2023 letter that he was personally escorted out of prison by a high-level Bukele official, given a firearm and driven to the Guatemalan border for his escape.The Bukele administration then attempted to recapture Canales-Rivera. According toreporting from El Faro, Bukele’s government discussed a plan to pay a Mexican cartel to find Canales-Rivera and return him to El Salvador. The Mexican government found him first, arrested him, and expelled him to the US in November 2023.Eight Ranfla Nacional leaders remained in US custody after López-Larios one was expelled in March. Two of them pleaded guilty earlier this year.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationEl SalvadorUS immigrationUS politicsGangsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Thehigh-street retailer Marks & Spenceris one of the most high-profile and recent victims in the UK this month.The Europeans led by the German crime agency, Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) released public appeals in its attempts to track down 18 suspects believed to be involved in the Qakbot malware family along with a third malware known as Trickbot.BKA and its international counterparts said the majority of the suspects were Russian citizens. The Russian nationalVitalii Nikolayevich Kovalev, 36, already wanted in the US, is one of BKA’s most wanted.He is allegedly behind Conti, considered to be the most professional and best-organised ransomware blackmail group in the world with Kovalev described as one of the “most successful blackmailers in the history of cybercrime” by German investigators.Using the pseudonyms Stern and Ben, BKA allege he is claimed to have attacked hundreds of companies worldwide and extracted large ransom payments from them.Kovolev, 36, from Volgorod, is believed to be living in Moscow, where several firms are registered in his name. He was identified by US investigators in 2023 as having been a member of Trickbot.Investigators now also believe he was at the helm of Conti and other blackmail groups, such as Royal and Blacksuit (founded in 2022). His own cryptowallet is said to be worth about €1bn.BKA said, along with international partners, of the 37 perpetrators they identified they had enough evidence to issue 20 arrest warrants.The US attorney’s office in California at the same time unsealed the details of charges against 16 defendants who allegedly “developed and deployed the DanaBot malware”.The criminal infiltrations into victims’ computers were “controlled and deployed” by a Russia-based cybercrime organisation that has infected more than 300,000 computers around the world particularly in the US, Australia, Poland, India and Italy.It was advertised on Russian-language criminal forums and also had an “espionage variant used to target military, diplomatic, government and non-governmental organisations” the indictment states.“For this variant, separate servers were established, such that data stolen from these victims was ultimately stored in the Russian federation.”Also on the Europe most-wanted list as a result of the German operation is a 36-year-old Russian-speaking Ukrainian, Roman Mikhailovich Prokop, a suspected member of Qakbot, according to BKA.Operation Endgame was instigated by the German authorities in 2022. The BKA president, Holger Münch, saidGermanywas a particular focus of cybercriminals.BKA in particular is investigating the suspected perpetrators’ involvement in gang-related activities and commercial extortion as well as membership of an overseas-based criminal organisation.Between 2010 and 2022 the Conti group focused specifically on US hospitals, increasing its attacks during the Covid pandemic. US authorities had offered a $10m reward to anyone who would lead them to its figureheads.Most suspects are operating in Russia, some also in Dubai. Their extradition to Europe or the US was unlikely, Münch said, but their identification was significant and damaging to them.“With Operation Endgame 2.0, we have once again demonstrated that our strategies work – even in the supposedly anonymous darknet.”Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeInternational criminal justiceInternetRussiaEuropeCanadaGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

He was 81.His death was confirmed by the Instituto Terra, the environmental restoration non-profit he founded with his wife of six decades, Lélia Wanick Salgado. In a post on Instagram, the institute described Salgado as “much more than one of the greatest photographers of our time”.Salgado had developed severe leukaemia due to complications from malaria contracted in Indonesia in 2010, his family said in a statement.Photographer Sebastião Salgado at 80: ‘They say I was an aesthete of misery’Read more“I know I won’t live much longer,” Salgado toldthe Guardian in an interview last year. “But I don’t want to live much longer. I’ve lived so much and seen so many things.”Salgado was born in rural Minas Gerais,Brazil, and studied economics in São Paulo. His leftwing sympathies led him and Wanick to move to Paris during the political repression of Brazil’s 1964-1985 military dictatorship. It was there that he took up photography in the 1970s, experiencing an instant rise to stardom.His prolific career took him to more than 130 countries over five decades, where he documented the world’s human injustices and natural environments through instantly recognisable black-and-white compositions shaped by expressive lighting. His beautiful shots of human suffering led some to criticise him for being an “aesthete of misery”.“Why should the poor world be uglier than the rich world? The light here is the same as there. The dignity here is the same as there,” Salgado said last year.With his awe-inspiring landscapes, Salgado also drew attention to the destruction of the planet. One of his most famous photographs, taken in 1986, captured illegal gold miners toiling away in the anthill-like Serra Pelada mine in the Amazon.In his last mega-project, Amazônia (2021) –a monumental exhibitionof more than 200 photographs that is still touring the world, currently on display in Brussels – Salgado showcased the Amazon’s lush landscapes, sinuous rivers and diverse Indigenous peoples, drawing attention to the wealth of the rainforest as it faces heightened threat of destruction from human activities and the climate crisis.The award-winning photographer alsoput his environmental concerns into practice, working to restore the native Atlantic forest on the family farm in Minas Gerais. The Instituto Terra has reforested over 2,000 hectares of land and produced nearly 7m seedlings since it was founded in 1998. “We will keep honouring his legacy, cultivating the land, justice and beauty he so believed was possible to restore,” the institute said.Although Salgado had taken a step back from photography, he continued to work on many projects, including a special show for the Cop30, which will be held in the city of Belém on the edge of the Amazon in November.Sebastião Salgado: ‘I was transformed into an environmentalist’Read moreBrazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, observed a minute of silence when he learned of Salgado’s passing during an event in Brasília on Friday. The photographer’s work serves “a warning for the conscience of all of humanity”, Lula said in a statement. “Salgado didn’t only use his eyes and his camera to portray people: he also used the fullness of his soul and heart.”The French Academy of Fine Arts, of which Salgado was a member, described him as a “great witness to the human condition and the state of the planet”.Salgado was in the process of editing and curating his monumental body of work, an archive of more than 500,000 pictures, for sale when he died.He is survived by his wife, Lélia, his two sons Juliano and Rodrigo, and his grandchildren Flávio and Nara.Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasPhotographySebastião SalgadonewsShareReuse this content"

We intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.”The theme of Nicas’s story was that after less than a year of service, the community was now facing the same kinds of struggles with the pervasive effects of the internet and the proliferation of smartphones that much of the world has dealt with for years.Nicas listed a broad range of those challenges: “teenagers glued to phones; group chats full of gossip; addictive social networks; online strangers; violent video games; scams; misinformation; and minors watching pornography”.He later wrote that a tribal leader “is most unsettled by the pornography. He said young men were sharing explicit videos in group chats, a stunning development for a culture that frowns on kissing in public.”‘Can’t live without it’: alarm at Musk’s Starlink dominance in Brazil’s AmazonRead moreThe piece makes no other mention of porn, but that aspect of the story was amplified and aggregated by other outlets including TMZ, which ran a story and accompanying video headlined “Elon Musk’s Starlink Hookup Leaves A Remote Tribe Addicted To Porn.”The suit says the video segment “falsely framed the Marubo Tribe as having descended into moral collapse”.Messages seeking comment from TMZ and Yahoo were not immediately answered.The misperceptions brought on by the aggregation and repackaging of the story led the Times to publish a follow-up.“The Marubo people are not addicted to pornography,” Nicas wrote in the second story. “There was no hint of this in the forest, and there was no suggestion of it in The New York Times’s article.”That did not satisfy the tribe, which says in the lawsuit that the story “failed to acknowledge the role the NYT itself played in fueling the defamatory narrative. Rather than issuing a retraction or apology, the follow-up downplayed the original article’s emphasis on pornography by shifting blame to third-party aggregators.”Nicas wrote that he spent a week with the Marubo tribe. The lawsuit says that while he was invited for a week, he spent less than 48 hours in the village, “barely enough time to observe, understand, or respectfully engage with the community”.The lawsuit was first reported by Courthouse News.The plaintiffs also include the community leader Enoque Marubo and Brazilian journalist and sociologist Flora Dutra, both of whom appeared in the story.Both were instrumental in bringing the tribe the internet connection, which they said has had many positive effects including facilitating emergency medicine and the education of children.They cited the TMZ video, which shows them setting up antennas for the connection, as creating the “unmistakable impression” that the two “had introduced harmful, sexually explicit material into the community and facilitated the alleged moral and social decay”.The lawsuit seeks at least $180m, including both general and punitive damages, from each of the defendants.“The fallout from the publication was not limited to public perception,” the suit says, “it destroyed lives, institutions, and culturally significant projects.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilIndigenous peoplesNew York TimesPornographyNewspapersInternetUS press and publishingnewsShareReuse this content"

The area is largely jungle but also rich in oil, gold, diamonds, timber and other natural resources.Ali told the Guardian the move was part of a “campaign to provoke confrontation” and that the “implications are grave – not just forGuyana, but for the entire western hemisphere”.“The sham elections Venezuela seeks to stage in our territory are not only illegal – they are an act of brazen hostility. This threat is not just aimed at Guyana. It undermines regional peace,” Ali said.Guyana, an English-speaking former British and Dutch colony, has for decades administered the region, which makes up two-thirds of its territory and is home to 125,000 of its 800,000 citizens. It says the frontiers were determined by an arbitration panel in 1899. Venezuela also lays claim because the region was within its boundaries during the Spanish colonial period.The centuries-old dispute was reignited in 2015 when the US energy giant ExxonMobil discovered huge crude reserves in the region, and escalated in 2023 when Guyana began auctioning oil-exploration licences.In late 2023, after holding a referendum asking voters if it should be turned into a Venezuelan state, President Nicolás Madurothreatened to partially annexthe region by force and pledged to hold elections there.View image in fullscreenMaduro supporters set fire to a doll with pictures of his opponents, including Guyana’s president, Irfaan Ali.Photograph: Juan Barreto/AFP/Getty ImagesCaracas describes Essequibo as “an inalienable part of the Venezuelan territory and a legacy of our liberators” and has rejected an order by the international court of justice to suspend its plans. “No international pressure, judicial blackmail, or foreign tribunal will make us back down from this conviction,” Venezuela said.Dr Christopher Sabatini, Latin America expert at Chatham House, said the move to push ahead with elections was “intended to stoke the fires of nationalism”.Guyana’s chief of defence staff, Brigadier Omar Khan, hascalled on Guyanese Indigenous communities– particularly those living along the border – to share any relevant information about Venezuela’s attempts to organise the election.“I want you to be vigilant,” Khan told Indigenous leaders on Tuesday.He also warned that any resident participating in the elections would be charged with treason and other felony crimes.“If anyone participates or takes any similar action, it will amount to support for a passive coup,” Khan toldthe Associated Press. “Anything along those lines will speak to a violation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity.”A Venezuelan source said that although the newly created “Guyana-Essequibo state” included the entire disputed territory, voting would only take place in a border municipality in the Venezuelan state of Bolívar. The source said Venezuelan authorities would be unlikely to cross the internationally recognized border.President Ali said Guyana was a “peaceful nation” but “bows to no bully and yields to no threat”. He added that he “will make every investment – military, diplomatic, technological, and human – necessary to secure and defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity”.View image in fullscreenIrfaan Ali, the Guyanese president, at a conference in Houston in March.Photograph: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty ImagesThe elections come 10 months after Maduro claimed victory in an election he was widely suspected of stealing.A deadly crackdown followed, withHuman Rights Watch(HRW) reporting that the government had “killed, tortured, detained, and forcefully disappeared people seeking democratic change”.Venezuelans will elect 24 state governors and 285 national assembly members in Sunday’s poll, but turnout is expected to be low.Tensions rise in Guyana as Maduro uses border dispute to build support ahead of Venezuela pollRead more“Last year, Maduro stole the votes of Venezuelans and repressed those who demanded fair counting. It’s hard to see how many of them will turn out to vote again,” said Juan Pappier, deputy director of theAmericasDivision of HRW.Víctor Alfonzo, a 33-year-old resident living in the state of Anzoátegui, said that the country no longer “believes in the political system”.“I’m not planning to vote. Neither are my friends, nor my family. We know that everything is a fraud with this government, and we don’t want to participate,” he said.The Venezuelan opposition has been beset by infighting over whether to abstain from the election, with the handful who are set to run facing bitter recriminations from their political allies.the opposition leader María Corina Machado has called on voters to stay away in the hope of humiliating the government with low turnout.But others warn the boycott could play into the hands of the administration. In 2020, theopposition boycottedparliamentary elections, which rights groups sayallowedMaduro’s allies to regain control of parliament.“Those leaders, the ones that sit out, become irrelevant,” said Sabatini. “They may be marginalising themselves even more, and that, in part, is the government’s plan.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaGuyanaAmericasUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Trump administration has since been reviewing the proposal.Under the arrangement announced by Trump on Friday, US Steel would remain in the US, with its headquarters in Pittsburgh, he stressed, announcing plans to hold a “big rally” in the state next week.“This will be a planned partnership between United States Steel and Nippon Steel, which will create at least 70,000 jobs, and add $14 Billion Dollars to the U.S. Economy,” the president claimed on Truth Social, his social network. “The bulk of that Investment will occur in the next 14 months.”Shares of US Steel soared 21% as investors interpreted Trump’s post on Truth Social to mean Nippon Steel had received his approval for its long-planned takeover, the last major hurdle for the deal.Trump says he is hitting EU with 50% tariff as trade talks are ‘going nowhere’Read moreUS Steel kept rising after-hours and reached $54, just shy of Nippon Steel’s $55-per-share offer price made in late 2023. While no details were released, investors expressed confidence that terms would be similar to those agreed upon in 2023. Investors said that eventually US Steel would no longer be publicly traded and they would receive a cash payout for their shares.Trump added that the bulk of that investment would occur in the next 14 months and said he would hold a rally at US Steel in Pittsburgh next Friday.Nippon Steel said it applauded Trump’s decision to approve the “partnership”. The White House did not immediately reply to questions about the announcement.This week, Reuters reported that Nippon Steel said that if the merger were approved, it would invest $14bn into US Steel’s operations, including up to $4bn in a new steel mill.The deal has been one of the most highly anticipated on Wall Street after it morphed into the political arena with fears that foreign ownership would mean job losses inPennsylvania, where US Steel is headquartered. It factored into last year’s election that saw Donald Trump returned to the White House.The Pennsylvania senator Dave McCormick, who also called the deal a “partnership”, on Friday said it was a “huge victory for America and the US Steel Corporation” that will protect more than 11,000 Pennsylvania jobs, and support the creation of at least 14,000 more.The United Steelworkers union had urged the president to reject Nippon’s bid, dismissing the firm’s commitments to invest in the US as “flashy promises” and claiming it was “simply seeking to undercut our domestic industry from the inside”.Trump’s position on Nippon’s approach has shifted significantly. Just in December, he declared he was vehemently opposed to the transaction. “As President, I will block this deal from happening,” he wrote. “Buyer Beware!!!”By last month, however, he had somewhat softened his stance, stating only that he wanted US Steel to remain in the US. “We don’t want to see it go toJapan,” he said.For investors, including prominent hedge funds, the news spells relief after more than a year of waiting for a resolution. “There were huge high-fives all around today,” one recent investor said, adding: “We understood Donald Trump’s psyche and we played it to our advantage here.”Investors said Trump appears to have won ground after the pledge for new investments was increased.“This deal ensures that steelmaking will live on in Pittsburgh for generations,” another investor said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationJapanSteel industryDonald TrumpUS politicsAsia PacificPennsylvanianewsShareReuse this content"

If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.”Trump says he is hitting EU with 50% tariff as trade talks are ‘going nowhere’Read moreApple shares fell 2.6% on Trump’s comments, pushing the company’s valuation just below $3tn.Apple won’t be alone. In remarks to reporters at the White House on Friday afternoon, Trump said that he would also impose a 25% tariff on Samsung and any other phone manufacturer that makes phones outside of the US, or, he said, “it would not be fair.”“When they build their plant here, there’s no tariffs. So they’re going to be building plants here,” Trump said.Trumpalarmed Apple investors last monthwith a series of escalating tariff announcements on goods from China, where the majority of iPhones are assembled, whichratcheted up to total 145%. A couple of days later, however, the administration announced anexemption for smartphones and computers.Soon afterwards, it was reported that Apple was planningto switch assembly of all iPhones for the US market to Indiain an attempt to swerve the impact of Trump’s trade war with China.Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said in an earnings call this month that the majority of iPhones sold in the US for the June quarter would “have India as their country of origin”. The company is secretive about details of its production processes but analysts estimate that about 90% of its smartphones are assembled inChina.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves … we want you to build here.’”Analysts have warned that moving US-bound iPhone production to the States would be prohibitively expensive, owing to the lack of facilities and flexible workforce that Apple has access to in China.

It’s one of the three closest results in recent historyGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastKrishani DhanjiFri 23 May 2025 11.00 EDTShareThe 2025 federal election was historic in many ways.It delivered the most dominant Labor win in decades, and threw up some of the closest-ever contests in seats such as Bradfield and Goldstein.Tim Wilson was declared the winner by fewer than 150 votes in Goldstein, in inner-Melbourne, but in Bradfield the full distribution of preferences left Liberal Gisele Kapterian only eight votes ahead of her opponent, independent candidate Nicolette Boele. A recount will be needed to confirm the winner of the inner-Sydney seat.It’s not the first time voters have spent weeks waiting for a result or that just a handful of ballots have determined who becomes the MP.Here are a few of the more recent examples of extremely close counts.An excruciating Palmer challengeThe last time the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) did a ballot recount was 2016, in the Queensland seat of Herbert, based around Townsville.Voters had to wait nearly a month after election day (2 July) to finalise their new local member.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAt the end of the two-candidate preferred count between Labor’s Cathy O’Toole and the LNP’s Ewan Jones, who had held the seat since 2010, O’Toole was just eight votes ahead.The AEC went to a recount on 21 July, 19 days after polling day. Ten days later, O’Toole was declared the winner by 37 votes.Speaking during the recount,O’Toole said: “I won’t say it hasn’t been stressful at times … For me, it’s put a whole new spin on the term ‘down to the wire’.”In 2013, there was a recount in another Queensland seat, Fairfax, on the northern Sunshine Coast.The seat had been held by the Liberals since 1990, but in 2013 the new LNP candidate, Ted O’Brien – now the party’s deputy leader – faced an upset at the hands ofClive Palmer.At the end of the two-candidate-preferred count, Palmer was just seven votes ahead, prompting a recount.It turned into one of the longest ever, as Palmer’s scrutineers challenged so many of his opponent’s votes.Kevin Bonham, a psephologist, says this level of vote challenging is uncommon.“They weren’t challenging every adverse vote, but they were challenging most of them, and that is unusual,” he says.“Normally, the number of votes challenged is quite a small proportion … experienced scrutineers know that there are some votes where there’s no point in challenging … because they know it’s going to waste the AEC’s time.”3:50Has the Liberal party lost Chinese Australian voters for good? – videoThe 2013 election was held on 7 September. The recount began on 3 October and did not finish until four weeks later.Palmer won the seat by 53 votes. He didn’t run in the next election, and O’Brien has held it since.Before that, the most recent recount was in 2007, in the seat of McEwan, north-west of Melbourne.At the end of the two-candidate-preferred count, Labor’s Rob Mitchell was six votes ahead of the Liberal MP, Fran Bailey, who had held the seat for more than a decade.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the application was dismissed, and Bailey retained the seat until she retired before the 2010 election, when Mitchell won. He has held the seat since.Before becoming an MP, Mitchell had also been a scrutineer for other Labor candidates and says the atmosphere was “intense”.“Your object is to knock out as many of the other person’s [votes] as you can … it’s very intense, you’ve got the AEC counters there trying to do their job and you’re standing looking over their shoulders. You can’t touch the table, you’re not allowed to touch a ballot paper, and you’ve got to be very short and succinct when you’re talking to staff.”Election deciderThere has been only one occasion when a seat decided by a few votes helped determine the whole election.It was 1961 and the Liberal MP in the south-east Queensland seat of Moreton, James Killen, was holding off a challenge from Labor.Architect of Labor’s crushing win flags Dutton’s fatal flaw and outlines what PM must do nextRead moreHe won by just 130 votes, which urban myth says came as a result of preferences from the Communist party, but others say came from preferences from the DemocraticLabor party, which had split from the ALP in 1955.Bonham says it was preferences from both that got Killen over the line.“The Communist candidate actually helped the Labor candidate more than Killen … but a small number of [Communist preferences] went to the Liberals,” he says.“If they had flowed 100% to Labor, Labor would have won the seat, and that would have tied the election, and then you would have had a very interesting situation.”As it was, Robert Menzies led the Liberal-Country Coalition to a two-seat majority, despite Labor, under Arthur Calwell, collecting 47.9% of the primary vote. It would take Labor another 11 years to gain government under Gough Whitlam.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsLabor partyLiberal partyClive PalmernewsShareReuse this content"

A former police officer, he worked as a prison officer and then chief correctional officer at the prison before his arrest in 2019.He was found guilty of 27 charges, including aggravated sexual and indecent assault, before the state government launched an inquiry.Theinquiry handed down its reportin March 2024 and found Astill should “never have been employed” in the state’s prisons. It said “corruption or incompetence” led to Corrective Services NSW hiring him in 1999.DCJ admits plaintiff suffered loss and damageCA1 is the second plaintiff to lead the class action after the governmentsettled via an undisclosed sum with another inmate.The first plaintiff, known as GP1, had alleged in court documents that Astill raped her when the DCJ already knew Astill “was abusing his position toward female inmates”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThere are no public court documents that show the DCJ’s response to GP1’s claims, which included – according to her statement of facts – that he allegedly attempted to bribe her with information on the welfare of a loved one if she performed sexual favours for him. He also allegedly told her he would “make her life hell” if she told anyone about the abuse.The DCJ filed a response to the clams of the new lead plaintiff – CA1 – earlier this month. It admitted that Astill sexually assaulted CA1 on multiple occasions.The DCJ admitted Astill’s conduct constituted a “trespass” on the inmate “in the form of assault and battery”.This included an admission to the inmate’s claim that while she was in isolation Astill entered her cell and allegedly grabbed her around the waist and tried to kiss her. This incident was then interrupted by another correctional officer, at which time Astill left the plaintiff’s cell.It also admitted that, while the inmate was kneeling and sweeping, he stood by her “in a sexually suggestive manner” with his groin at the level of her face, and placed his hand on the zipper of his pants.“[DCJ] admits that the plaintiff suffered loss and damage in relation to the admitted batteries,” the defence to the statement of claim said.But the DCJ denied the claims that the conduct constituted unlawful imprisonment – which turns on whether Astill restrained the inmate’s freedom during the abuse to the point she could reasonably escape.Both parties ‘keen to explore the possibility of settlement’The total number of inmates that could form part of the class action is not yet finalised – 3,700 notices have been sent to current and former inmates at the prison.However, the class action – which is still in its early phases – could soon end, with the second plaintiff’s barrister, Matthew Robinson, telling the court on Friday that both parties were “keen to explore the possibility of settlement”.During the directions hearing, Robinson said that given it was “difficult to ascertain” how many group members there could be, the parties were seeking a “soft closure” of the class action.Rapist officer ‘should never have been employed’ to work in NSW prisons, scathing inquiry findsRead moreA soft closure requires potential inmates to sign on by a particular date. After that, if no settlement is reached, the class action will reopen.In response to this, Justice Peter Garling expressed a concern on whether a soft closure was in the best interest of all potential inmates who could have a claim.Garling said this could see a claimant that “comes to realise in two years’ time or becomes in a position in two years’ time to identify themselves a group member” excluded because of the soft closure.He asked the parties to consider “whether the circumstances of an inmate may give rise to something akin to the late reporting feature of juvenile sex abuse”.People who allege they were sexually abused as a child can make disclosures outside of usual limitation periods in recognition it can take “lengthy periods” for people to come forward.“I’m just concerned about how all of that might pan out. I don’t have a view, but I think it’s something I would want to be addressed in due course,” Garling said.The matter returns to court on 15 September.Explore more on these topicsPrisonsNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The AEC said the recount would begin on Monday and might take up to two weeks.On Monday, Boele wasdeclared the provisional winnerof the seat at the end of the two-candidate-preferred count, with a margin of 40 votes.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe full distribution of preferences then led to minor changes in the margin as votes were challenged by scrutineers. Boele’s lead narrowed over several days until the two candidates were exactly tied late on Friday afternoon, before Kapterian nudged in front about 5pm.If the margin were to remain below 10 votes after the recount – an extremely rare occurrence – the AEC or one of the candidates could consider going to the court of disputed returns to “void” the seat, which would trigger a full byelection. That hasn’t happened since 1920 in the seat of Ballarat, when the two leading candidates were separated by a single vote at the previous year’s federal election.Liberals agree to in-principle policy deal with Nationals, paving way for Coalition to reuniteRead moreOne trigger for such an outcome could be if the number of unexplained multiple votes – suggesting someone may have voted more than once – could push the result one way or the other.Psephologist Kevin Bonham said at the 2019 election that there was an average of about 15 unexplained multiple votes per electorate, but the numbers had been trending down in recent decades as the AEC developed ways to better control the issue.Bradfield was most recently held by the Liberal MP Paul Fletcher, who was elected in a byelection in 2009 and announced his retirement at the end of 2024.This is Boele’s second run at the seat, as an independent backed by the Climate 200 group.Kapterian was preselected by the Liberals for the seat in January, beating Warren Mundine.The seat has been held by theLiberal partysince its creation in 1949.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsLiberal partyIndependentsSydneynewsShareReuse this content"

But they clashed over other elements of the relationship, including Ukraine’s future Nato membership and the controversy over the import of cheaper agricultural goods,which has led to anti-Ukrainian protests by Polish farmers.Courting the rightwing voters of twofar-right candidates who came thirdand fourth, Nawrocki already said this week thathe would block Ukraine’s accession to Nato.On Friday, he repeated his criticism of the farming arrangements. “As a president, I will do everything to really support [Ukraine] militarily,” he said, but added he would not let Poland become a secondary market for Ukrainian goods.Trzaskowski, a former EU lawmaker and junior minister, attacked him for “speaking the language that favours Putin”, also citing his rival’s criticism of EU plans to boost member states’ militaries. “We need to be tough with Ukrainians, protect Polish interests … but help Ukraine, because Putin has to break all his teeth in Ukraine and not attack anyone else,” Trzaskowski said.Just over a week before the vote, the candidates remained virtually level, with individual polls showing narrow leads both ways within the margin of error.Experts said voter mobilisation – with turnout already at a record high in the first round – could play a decisive role in deciding the outcome.On Sunday, both candidates will lead rival marches across Warsaw, symbolically starting simultaneously on parallel streets but going in opposite directions.Explore more on these topicsPolandEuropeEuropean UnionDonald TusknewsShareReuse this content"

The latest case, involving dozens of children born between 2008 and 2015, raises fresh concerns about the complexity of tracing so many families when a serious medical issue is identified.“We need to have a European limit on the number of births or families for a single donor,” said Dr Edwige Kasper, a biologist at Rouen university hospital in France, who presented the case at the annual conference of the European Society of Human Genetics in Milan.“We can’t do whole-genome sequencing for all sperm donors – I’m not arguing for that,” she added. “But this is the abnormal dissemination of genetic disease. Not every man has 75 children across Europe.”The case came to light when two families independently contacted their fertility clinics after their children developed cancers that appeared to be linked to a rare genetic variant. The European Sperm Bank, which had supplied the sperm, confirmed that the variant in a gene called TP53 was present in some of the donor’s sperm.The rare variant was not known to be linked to cancer at the time of donation in 2008, would not have been detectable using standard screening techniques, and the donor is understood to be in good health. However, analysis by Kasper’s lab concluded that the mutation was likely to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, one of the most severe inherited predispositions to cancer.Kasper said: “I analysed the variant using population and patient databases, computer prediction tools and the results of functional trials and came to the conclusion that the variant was probably cancer-causing and that children born from this donor should receive genetic counselling.”Simultaneously, a number of genetics and paediatric departments across Europe were investigating their own cases, leading to 67 children from 46 families in eight European countries being tested. The variant was found in 23 children, 10 of whom have been diagnosed with cancer, including cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Children with the risk gene are advised to be monitored with regular whole-body MRI scans, MRI scans of the brain and, as adults, of the breast and ultrasound examination of the abdomen.The European Sperm Bank, which applies a worldwide limit of 75 families for each sperm donor, said more than 67 children had been conceived using the donor’s sperm, but that its policy was to not confirm exact numbers of children for a specific donor. It said all of the relevant clinics had been alerted.Kasper said this remained a concern. “Is 67 the total? It’s a really good question that I’ve asked the sperm bank. They didn’t want to tell me the denominator of the births for this donor,” she said.Prof Nicky Hudson, of De Montfort University in Leicester, said the case highlighted the complexity of the challenges that could arise when human gametes were shipped between countries and used for large numbers of recipients.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the very least we need better systems for tracking donor usage and of informing recipients of this.”Julie Paulli Budtz, a spokesperson for the European Sperm Bank, said: “We are deeply affected by this case.” She said the donor had been thoroughly tested but that “it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person’s gene pool if you don’t know what you are looking for”.She added: “We welcome continued dialogue on setting an internationally mandated family limit and have advocated for this on several occasions. This is also why we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor.”Explore more on these topicsSperm donationIVFCancerHealthEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Therefore I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on theEuropean Union, starting on June 1, 2025.”Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump claimed the EU had “taken advantage” of the US and claimed the new tariffs would be imposed unless EU companies moved their operations to the US.“It’s time that we play the game the way I know how to play the game,” said Trump.Stock markets slumped in response to the news, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 1% as Trump also signalled plans to imposetariffs on Apple, Samsung and other phone manufacturers.

Germany’s car makers were particularly hard hit, with BMW down 3.7%, Volkswagen off 2.6% and Mercedes-Benz down 4%.The US imposed a20% “reciprocal” rate on most EU goods on 2 April, but halved that rate a week later until 8 July to allow time for talks. It has retained 25% import taxes on steel, aluminium and vehicle parts and is threatening similar action on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other goods.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The EU would have to react and it is something that would really hurt the US and European economy.”EU negotiators have been locked in meetings with White House representatives since Trump’s so-called “liberation day” tariffs were first announced. Dozens of countries have been holding discussions to try to bring down their own levies before the 90-day pause elapses.The White House has relented on many of its most onerous tariffs, including loweringtotal tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%after what Trump declared were constructive talks with Beijing, which lowered its retaliatory border taxes from 125% to 10% in response.A week ago the US president appeared to acknowledge that Washington lacked the ability to negotiate deals with scores of countries at once, saying the US would instead send letters to some trading partners tounilaterally impose new tariff rates.Perceptions of an easing back on a hardline approach to trade brought a period of calm to stock markets, but Friday’s threat of a 50% levy on EU goods, plus a separate threatmade the same day of 25% tariffs on iPhones made abroad, have brought an end to the peace.The EU presented a fresh trade proposal to the US on Thursday. The offer included phased tariff cuts on non-sensitive goods, plus cooperation on energy, AI and digital infrastructure. The bloc was readying about $108bn in retaliatory tariffs if talks failed.To sweeten the deal, EU officials were also willing to extend a 2020 tariff-free arrangement on US lobster imports,according to the Financial Times. But it appears to have proved insufficient to persuade the US president to sign a deal allowing only his 10% universal tariff to apply to the EU, as it does the UK.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsInternational tradeGlobal economyDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Four other people were found guilty of assisting in the plot or related charges. Two people were acquitted of accusations they handed out information about Kardashian’s whereabouts.Thearmed, masked menwho were dressed in police jackets, arrived by bike or on foot just before 3am on 3 October 2016 at Kardashian’s exclusive building near Paris’s Place de la Concorde, known as a “no address” site, where celebrities often rent sumptuous suites.They held a receptionist at gunpoint and then went up to Kardashian’s room where they held her hostage with a gun, tying her hands and feet and taping her mouth. They escaped with jewellery worth up to an estimated €10m. The jewels, which were never found, included a 18.88-carat diamond engagement ring given to Kardashian by her then husband, the rapper Kanye West, estimated to be worth £3m.The leaders of the gang, aged in their 60s and 70s, were nicknamed the “grandpa robbers” by French media. But the state prosecutor, Anne-Dominique Merville, had told jurors not to be fooled by their age or “reassuring wrinkles”, saying they were seasoned criminals with long track records and previous prison sentences.Aomar Aït Khedache, 68, a retired restaurant owner alleged to have masterminded the robbery, was handed the heaviest sentence of three years in prison plus five years suspended, but due to time already served in jail he will not return to detention. For the same reason, none of the convicted men were sent to prison.The court heard Aït Kadeche ‘“gave orders”, recruited others and travelled to Belgium to sell the jewellery. He is now deaf and cannot speak, so he read the court’s questions on a typed transcript, writing his answers with a pen and paper, projected on to a screen. “I ask for forgiveness. I can’t find the words. I am very sorry,” he wrote as the trial ended.View image in fullscreenAomar Aït Khedache, 68, was alleged to have masterminded the robbery.Photograph: Aurélien Morissard/APDidier Dubreucq, 69, was found guilty as well as Yunice Abbas, 71, who admitted to arriving at the scene with two accomplices on bicycles to “keep watch”. Abbas had told the court: “All I have to offer you is regret. I’m sorry.” Marc-Alexandre Boyer, the youngest member of the group, now in his 30s, was also convicted.In a statement after the verdict, Kardashian said she was “deeply grateful to the French authorities for pursuing justice”.She said: “The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family. While I’ll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all.”Kardashian, 44, a billionaire celebrity influencer and business owner who is now a criminal justice advocate in the US,attended the trialin Paris, telling the court her life had been changed by the robbery and she had feared she would be raped and murdered by the masked gunmen who entered her rented two-floor suite.On the day of the break-in, Kardashian and her reality TV star sister, Kourtney, had attended an exclusive lunch, then several fashion shows where they were photographed, followed by a dinner at a fashion house in the city centre, returning to their suite after midnight.Kim Kardashian’s Paris chauffeur told the court that everywhere she went there was a crowd of paparazzis on motorbikes. He said she always stayed at the same exclusive residence when in Paris and would take advantage of the photographers’ presence, getting out of the car a few metres from the residence’s front door “in order to get photographed” while she walked along.That night, Kourtney Kardashian changed clothes and went out again to aParisnightclub. Kim Kardashian insisted her bodyguard should accompany her sister. Meanwhile, she stayed home without security protection in the upstairs bedroom of her suite, while her stylist went to sleep in a downstairs room. Kardashian spent a while working on her computer and posting online. At that time, Kardashian routinely posted most of her daily movements and whereabouts on social media, where she also displayed her jewellery, including the large diamond engagement ring. Those details on social media may have facilitated the thieves’ targeting of her.Meanwhile, at 2am, the lobby of the residence was staffed only by one receptionist. Abderrahmane Ouatiki, 48, who is Algerian, was working as a night receptionist to fund himself as he completed a Sorbonne University PhD thesis on the semiotics of extremist discourse.Ouatiki said that after 2am he saw three masked men “with police jackets on” approach the glass door to reception and gesture to him to open up. Thinking they were police officers, he opened the door. Security camera footage from the street would later show that the men had arrived leisurely by bike or on foot, to avoid a car raising suspicions.He said they handcuffed him, showed him an automatic pistol and held another gun to his neck as they asked him: “Where is the rapper’s wife?” He knew that meant Kardashian because he had done some photocopying for her a few days before.Two of the masked men held a gun to Ouatiki and took him in the lift with them to Kardashian’s apartment. As they approached her bedroom, Ouatiki said Kardashian called out “Hello? Hello?”, thinking it might be her sister Kourtney returning from the nightclub.Kardashian told the court she was in a hotel robe ready to sleep having packed up everything including her pyjamas ready to fly back to New York the following day.She said: “I didn’t understand what was happening. I was just about to fall asleep. I was naked with a robe on and I pulled it.”The robbers only spoke French and she didn’t understand what they were saying. “I heard one of the men saying forcefully ‘ring, ring’ a few times over and pointing at his hand,” she said. The robbers found her diamond ring but were not satisfied and dragged her into another room where they found her jewellery box.Kardashian, who thought at first it was a terrorist attack, was held by the neck at gunpoint. She said: “They threw me on the bed and the smaller one started to tie my hands together with a zip tie. I was pretty hysterical. I looked at the gentleman who was the concierge and said: ‘What is going to happen to us? Are we going to die?’”She said her robe fell open and she felt certain she would be raped and shot dead.She asked Ouatiki to tell the men: “I have babies; I have to make it home. They can take everything but I have to make it home to my babies.” She said: “He just looked at me and said: ‘I don’t know what is going to happen to us.’”Kardashian was tied up, her mouth was taped over and she was dragged to the bathroom and left there while the men left the receptionist in a side-room near the hotel lobby and escaped. She later managed to loosen her hand ties against the edge of the bathroom sink.She told the court her life had changed. “It changed the way that I felt safe at home,” she said, adding that she now had up to six security guards there. “We never felt that we were unsafe before this. This experience changed everything.”In court, some of the men apologised to Kardashian. She said to Aït Khedache in court: “I forgive you for what has taken place but it does not change the emotion, the feelings, the trauma and the way my life is forever changed.”Explore more on these topicsKim KardashianParisFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

With Oman’s solutions to remove obstacles, there is a possibility of progress, but the negotiations are too complex to be resolved in one or two meetings.”A US official said the two sides had agreed to reconvene in the near future.“The talks continue to be constructive - we made further progress, but there is still work to be done. Both sides agreed to meet again in the near future. We are grateful to our Omani partners for their continued facilitation,” the official said.The Oman foreign ministry said in a statement: “We hope to clarify remaining issues in coming days to allow us to proceed towards a common goal of reaching a sustainable and honourable agreement.”The talks are being held against the backdrop ofrepeated threats by Israel to strike Iran’s nuclear sites. Israel has long feared Iran is preparing to build a nuclear bomb, and is not, as it claims, pursuing a civil nuclear programme.Donald Trump has been told by Gulf states that they do not want a further conflict in the Middle East that would be sparked by an Israeli attempt to bomb Iran, and the US president has shown a surprising willingness to reach an agreement with Tehran.Before the talks the US said it was a red line to prevent Iran undertaking any domestic enrichment, while Iran has insisted that as a member of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty it cannot be singled out by preventing it from continuing with a programme of domestic uranium enrichment.It has offered to put strict limits on the size of its stockpile and the purity of the uranium.The starkness of the public differences on both sides concerning enrichment led observers to fear that this fifth round of talks would lead to a collapse with unpredictable consequences for the Middle East.But although Oman did not immediately set a date for the next talks, there seemed to be a consensus that a further round would occur. Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, said on X there had been “some but not conclusive progress”.Countries such as the United Arab Emirates that have a small nuclear programme based on imported uranium have suggested Iran could follow this example by importing the required uranium, but Iran regards its position as different since it has had to undertake so much sacrifice in the form of US economic sanctions to pursue what it says is a peaceful civil nuclear programme. It believes it has a sovereign right to enrich uranium, and points out Israel has an undeclared nuclear weapon that the US does not demand it relinquish.Some mediators suggested as an alternative that Iran could pause enrichment for a fixed period, or that in addition to enriching domestically it could form a civil nuclear consortium with Saudi Arabia, so providing extra reassurance and knowledge about the nature of its domestic programme.For reasons not yet clear, Steve Witkoff, the US chief negotiator, left the meeting early, and the US, unlike Iran, issued no immediate statement on the talks. Before the meeting Witkoff had met Israeli officials, including the head of Mossad, David Barnea, as he had in the context of previous negotiating sessions with Iran.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranUS foreign policyOmanMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Rodriguez reportedly chanted “free, free Palestine” while being detained by security.This is the latest act of violence in a string of incidents that have affected Jewish,Araband Muslim communities in the US. A man in Illinoisattacked a six-year-oldand his mother, both Palestinian American, and killed the boy in 2023 soon after Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel, andthree Palestinian students were shotin Vermont in November 2023. Reports of antisemitism, Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism have soared since the war began.But an uptick in violence is not uniquely associated with the war in Gaza. It’s a feature of this “era of violent populism”, said Robert Pape, director of the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats. Between assassination attempts onDonald Trump, ongoing threats of violence against a wide swath of government officialsincluding judges, and anarson attackagainst the Pennsylvania governor, Wednesday’s shooting was not one that happened in isolation.“This is a chronic illness in our country,” Pape said. “This is not a set of isolated events.”People who commit acts of political violence often believe they will be celebrated by some portion of the public that supports the same goals, he said. The alleged killer’s supposed manifesto nods at this.“They think about how they want to be perceived and what they want the news to be saying about them afterwards,” said Liliana Mason, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University. “And it’s a very kind of self-oriented set of motivations.”“We know that this guy screamed Free Palestine. He probably thought that he was doing something political. But also, there are plenty of people who think we should free Palestine, who are not going to go murder a couple people.”A small portion of the pro-Palestinian movement has formally embraced the language of armed resistance, but the vast majority of those protesting against the war have been non-violent.In the day since the shooting, condemnations have come from all sides of the political spectrum, including from politicians who have opposed US involvement in the war and joined pro-Palestinian protests. It also sparked adebateover the distinction between antisemitism and anti-Israel political violence, in part because it remains unclear what the perpetrator knew about his victims.“My heart breaks for the loved ones of the victims of last night’s attack in DC,” said Rashida Tlaib, a congresswoman who is Palestinian American. “Nobody deserves such terrible violence. Everyone in our communities deserves to live in safety and in peace.”Trump offered condolences to the loved ones of the couple killed in the attack. “These horrible DC killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW!” he wrote on Truth Social. “Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA.”Jews in the US have said it is another example of the menace they are facing as people protest against the war. Josh Shapiro, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania whose residence was the target of an antisemitic arson earlier this year, said he was “heartbroken and horrified” by the attack. “May their memories be a blessing and a call to action for each of us,” he wrote on social media.A writer in the conservativeJewish publication Commentarywrotethat Jewish institutions would quickly work to increase security and that “Jews will be arming ourselves”.Pape’s surveys have tracked a growing acceptance of using violence to achieve political goals across the political spectrum.Apollhe conducted in partnership with the Anti-Defamation League in spring 2023, before the Gaza war began, found that Americans who are highly antisemitic were three times more likely to support violence to achieve political aims than the general population. (The Anti-Defamation League is known for tracking antisemitism, but its methods have come underscrutinyfor conflating antisemitism and anti-Zionism.)But the killings also show that the US is a “tinderbox” and that political violence is a slippery slope, said Pape. People tend to compartmentalize political violence – if there’s an act of violence against Jews, it’s only a Jewish issue, the thinking goes, he said. But violence tends to beget more violence, and more acceptance of violence.His surveys in 2024 foundincreasing support for violence against Trump alongside support for violence in favor of Trump, stemming in part from a belief that the electoral and political systems won’t address their grievances.“The more political violence there is against Trump, the more there will be political violence against Democratic leaders likeJosh Shapiro,” Pape said. “The more there’s political violence against Josh Shapiro, the more there will be antisemitic political violence. These are not compartmentalized issues.”Meanwhile, it’s not only those in the Jewish and Palestinian communities who are being affected, but also those who have taken part in demonstrations associated with the war in Gaza.Police have used force against protesters on campuses and off, seeking to quash the mass movements that have sprung up around the globe.Thousands of studentshavebeen arrested, suspended, kicked out of colleges, lost financial aid, had their degrees withheld. Others who were in the US on visas have seen their immigration threatened and face deportation.The killings in Washington will probably lead to further crackdowns by the Trump administration on the pro-Palestinian cause. Pape’s most recent survey, earlier this month, showed 39% of Democrats agreed that using force was justified to remove Trump from office and that only 44% of Republicans opposed Trump using the US military to stop protests.“We can sleepwalk into martial law pretty easily,” Pape warned.Explore more on these topicsWashington DCIsraelIsrael-Gaza warUS crimeMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Videos taken by a health official at al-Awda hospital showed walls blown away and thick black smoke billowing from the wreckage.The Israeli army said that its forces had attacked “military compounds, weapons storage facilities and sniper posts” inGaza. “In addition, the [air force] struck over 75 terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip.”The Palestinian Red Crescent and UN agencies are warning of famine after more than three months of anIsraeli blockade on humanitarian aid.Gaza starvation map“In the last couple of days we lost 29 children,” the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority health minister, Maged Abu Ramadan, told reporters, describing them as “starvation-related deaths”. He later clarified that the total included elderly people as well as children.The Palestinian Authority has partial control over the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967, but Hamas has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007.Gaza starvation chartFood aid is expected to start reaching Palestinians inGazathis week after Israel began allowing limited goods through after nearly 11 weeks of global pressure to lift the blockade.Even the US, a staunch ally of Israel, has voiced concerns over the hunger crisis.A total of 107 aid trucks belonging to the UN and other aid groups carrying flour, food, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals were transferred on Thursday into the strip, the Israeli military said on Friday.The UN secretary general said on Friday that Israel had only authorised for Gaza what “amounts to a teaspoon of aid when a flood of assistance is required” to ease the crisis.“Without rapid, reliable, safe and sustained aid access, more people will die – and the long-term consequences on the entire population will be profound,”António Guterrestold reporters.“The entire population ofGazais facing the risk of famine … The Israeli military offensive is intensifying with atrocious levels of death and destruction.”1:15Inside an Unrwa warehouse full of aid blocked from Gaza – videoAccording to UN officials, medical supplies were beginning to run low with more than 40% of essential medicines no longer available and rationing of bandages, gloves and similar items.The greatest shortages were of treatments for skin diseases, which is increasingly prevalent owing to the harsh and unsanitary conditions, and eye drops, internal documents seen by the Guardian show. Reactive agents for some diagnostic tests are also becoming scarce, doctors working in Gaza said.Aid has yet to reach the vast proportion of the territory’s population, though some has now been distributed to free bakeries in southern regions.Officials are trying to negotiate with Israeli officials to allow convoys to cross the Netzarim corridor, which bisects the territory, to reach northern Gaza.“Nothing has changed yet. Some bakeries have been supplied in the middle area and south but it is nothing compared with the needs. People are very, very hungry,” said Amjad Shawa, the director of the Gaza NGOs network.A World Food Programme convoy was attacked by looters on Thursday night and 15 of 20 trucks loaded with wheat flour hijacked and driven away. Two other trucks broke down.Aid officials said the threat of looting would continue to seriously hamper aid distribution, as it did before the ceasefire in January. In November, more than 100 trucks of aid were stolen in a single night.“People are talking a lot about getting baby food in but any child suffering malnutrition needs to be treated properly, and that is relatively straightforward but needs functioning health facilities and we don’t have them at the moment,” said one UN official working in Gaza.Israel imposed the blockade on all supplies in March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters – a charge the group denies.More than 750 people have been killed and 2,000 injured across Gaza over the past week, according to medical officials there.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed that the entire Gaza Strip would be under Israeli security control by the end of the war, said his plans for private US companies to deliver aid would prevent a humanitarian crisis, despite aid agencies and many governments saying such a crisis already exists.Israel still blocking aid for Gaza despite promise to lift siege, says UNRead moreMeanwhile, in Israel, Netanyahu’s decision to appoint the Israel Defense Forces’ Maj Gen David Zini to lead the domestic intelligence agency, Shin Bet – after months of legal and political wrangling over his attempt to sackRonen Barfrom the role – has drawn threats of a legal challenge.Netanyahu said on Friday his pick for the next domestic intelligence chief would take office ‘‘without delay next month’’.Bar, who was sacked by Netanyahu in March because of an “ongoing lack of trust”, had been investigating the prime minister’s close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including claims of leaking classified documents to foreign media and allegedly taking money from Qatar, which is known to have given significant financial aid to Hamas.On Wednesday, Israel’s supreme court ruled as unlawful the government’s decision in March to fire Bar, a move that had triggered mass protests in the country.With reporting byAssociated Press, Agence France-Presse and ReutersExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaAntónio GuterresUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

By Friday, dozens of villagers had already moved their flocks away, packed up their belongings and were dismantling the wooden and metal frames of their houses.Settlers stalked between Palestinian men who worked fast and largely in silence, grappling with the grim reality of leaving the place where most were born and grew up. A child cried as he was driven away on a truck loaded with the family’s red sofas.Violent Israeli settlers under UK sanctions join illegal West Bank outpostRead more“We are all leaving,” said one villager, who asked not to be named. Settlers threw stones at some trucks as they left, and celebrated on social media.Elisha Yered, an unofficial spokesperson for the extremist group Hilltop Youth, wrote: “This is what redemption looks like! This is a relatively large outpost that contained about 150 people from the enemy population, but it was broken.”View image in fullscreenA Palestinian dismantles a building in the Bedouin community of Mughayyir al-Deir.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianYered is subject to sanctions from the UK and the EU, which said he was “part of a group of armed settlers” involved in an attack in 2023 that led to the death of a 19-year-old Palestinian, Qusai Jammal Mi’tan.Two other settlers under UK sanctions, Neria Ben Pazi and Zohar Sabah, spent time at the illegal outpost this week, and Ben Pazi also worked on building a fence around Palestinian land.Other Bedouin came to help villagers pack up and leave, including some who understood their fear and pain intimately because violent Israeli settlers had also driven them off the land.The tactics used by the settlers this week were not new. The nearby hills are dotted with the ruins of abandoned villages, at least one, Wadi as-Seeq, also targeted by the UK-sanctioned Ben Pazi.Settlers had never before built an outpost so close to Palestinian homes and the speed and intensity of the campaign in Mughayyir al-Deir was a sign of their growing confidence, activists said.View image in fullscreenA man rests against a truck before departing the village.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianPolice patrolled through the village on Friday and Israeli soldiers stood nearby. None intervened, although a “stop work” order had been issued for the illegal outpost after it was thrown up, and several settlers who spent time at it were also known to Israeli authorities for extreme violence.A previous Israeli commander for the central region, Maj Gen Yehuda Fuchs, tried in 2023 to bar Ben Pazi from theWest Bankover violent attacks on Palestinians.The only other official Israeli visitor during the week was a far-right member of the Knesset, Zvi Sukkot, who came to back the settlers. Last week, Sukkot said in a TV debate that Israel “can kill 100 Gazans in one night during a war and nobody in the world cares”.One Palestinian family filed a petition with Israel’s supreme court on Thursday demanding an injunction and urgent hearing into why the military, police and local authorities did not act to prevent the forced evictions and protect Palestinians.A spokesperson for the Israeli military said troops operated “to ensure the security of the state of Israel and Judea and Samaria [Israel’s name for the occupied West Bank]”, and the government directs how the military should enforce orders about illegal construction.View image in fullscreenPalestinians dismantle a structure in Mughayyir al-Deir.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianThe military would respond to the legal petition in court, the spokesperson said. A hearing is scheduled for next week, although by the time judges hear it the village will be empty.For many of the families forced out, their move on Friday was a second displacement at the hands of Israelis, as their parents and grandparents had been forced from land near the Israeli city of Be’er Sheva when the state was formed in 1948.Explore more on these topicsIsraelWest BankMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The pair were named in aGuardian investigation into UK assets owned by allies ofBangladesh’s former autocratic ruler, Sheikh Hasina.All properties are owned via companies in the British Virgin Islands, Isle of Man or Jersey, according to Companies House records, and were acquired for prices ranging from £1.2m to £35.5m.The Rahmans are the son and nephew, respectively, of Salman F Rahman, a wealthy businessman who was arrested while allegedly attempting to flee during thestudent-led revolution that toppled Sheikh Hasina last year.Salman F Rahman, who is facing corruption charges inBangladesh, was Hasina’s adviser on private industry and investment and was seen by many in the country as the most influential figure in the regime.His son and nephew’s properties featured in a joint investigation between the Guardian and the campaign group Transparency International last year, which revealed £400m worth of property owned by allies ofSheikh Hasina.The properties frozen by the NCA include one in Gresham Gardens, north London.Sheikh Rehana, who is Sheikh Hasina’s sister and also the mother of the former UK City minister Tulip Siddiq, has lived at the property, according to the Financial Times, which first reported freezing orders on two of the properties, bought for £7.7m.Duncan Hames, the director of policy at Transparency International UK, said: “We urge UK law enforcement to continue their inquiries and to freeze all suspect assets without delay.”An NCA spokesperson said: “We can confirm that the NCA has secured freezing orders against a number of properties as part of an ongoing civil investigation.”Investigations by the interim government of Bangladesh into the former regime have also resulted in authorities thereissuing an arrest warrant for Tulip Siddiq, who stepped back as City minister in the light of the allegations. She has denied any wrongdoing.The Guardian has approached lawyers for the Rahmans and Beximco, the family corporate empire founded by Salman Rahman, for comment.A spokesperson for Ahmed Shayan Rahman earlier told the FT: “Our client denies any involvement in any alleged wrongdoing in the strongest possible terms. He will of course engage with any investigation which takes place in the UK.”They added: “It is well known that there is political upheaval in Bangladesh, where numerous allegations are being made against many hundreds of individuals.

I don’t understand why there’s such a problem with a brick with a hole in it. It seems ludicrous,” she said. “Why say your new legislation is a win-win for new homes and the environment and exclude the only measure that is a true win-win?“They are tone-deaf. This is such a tiny thing they could do, but it’s brewing such a distrust and sense of betrayal among the people who voted for them.”View image in fullscreenCampaigner Hannah Bourne-Taylor says the government are ‘tone-deaf’ over the issue.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianAlthough some housebuilders are incorporating swift bricks in new builds, a recent University of Sheffield study found that75% of bird and bat boxesdemanded as a condition of planning permission for new housing developments had failed to materialise when the housing estates were complete.Asked if he would meet MPs to discuss how to encourage the building industry to adopt swift bricks more widely, Pennycook said he would be happy to have conversations with MPs despite claiming hiscorrectly reported opposition to mandatory cavity-nesting brickshad been “spun” in a Guardian report.These comments follow Pennycook’s recent defence of the planning bill’s proposed amendments to the Protection of Badgers Act that MPswarned would lead to “hostile treatment” of the much-persecuted animalin which the minister joked: “I would just like to make very clear, for the Guardian article that will no doubt appear tomorrow, that I have no particular animus against badgers in whatever form.”Bourne-Taylor said she hoped that the swift brick amendment would now be championed by the House of Lords.If that fails, Bourne-Taylor hopes to take her campaign to the wider public once again. The risingnew petition for swift bricks“just goes to show the public concern,” she said. “The government are not listening to the public or the experts.”Explore more on these topicsBirdsPlanning policyLabourWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

A lot of people have already left campus and gone home for the holidays so many people are in an information vacuum, through no fault of the university’s.“There’s a lot of speculation about what this really means for us, whether it’s an ‘Art of the Deal’ [move], put something extreme on the table and then walk it back, or if this is the reality,” Nicholson said.He added there had been uncertainty circulating since the Trump administration first threatened Harvard and other universities with sanctions earlier this year, but that the latest crackdown, affecting all international students, still came as a surprise.“This is so unprecedented, if you’d have told any of us, when we were told we would have this fortunate year at Harvard, that all international students would be banned, just months ago it would have been inconceivable.“There was always this sense of: that won’t actually happen.”Nicholson now hopes that Harvard’s court challenge will provide some clarity, with his internship tied to his student visa status.“If there’s any message I’d take from this year, it’s that any longstanding assumptions you might have about the world or life, throw them out the window. Life is an uncertain thing,” he said.The restriction – first revealed on Thursday – would even affect those on prestigious awards funded by the Kennedy Memorial Trust, commemorating the former US president John F Kennedy.Adam Roble, who like Nicholson spent the year at Harvard on aHenry Fund fellowshipbut returned to the UK earlier this week, said he had sensed “growing anxiety” among international students.“Yesterday and today our group chats were going off – I’m in a fortunate position now that I’ve finished my programme but I feel for those who are halfway through and staying for longer. A mate of mine, he’s on a two-year programme and he’s just finished the first year – what’s he going to do?“They say you have to transfer to another institution or your visa is invalid. But it’s really hard to transfer at short notice, there are deadlines that have passed. The uncertainty that it has created for people’s futures, they are in limbo,” he said.Roble said the Trump administration’s initial attacks on Harvard had sent shock waves through the campus.“I was particularly surprised about how fast things were moving, and how in the midst of everything else that was going on in the world, anyone could be sent packing in a moment’s notice.“A particular turning point was when theyessentially snatched Rümeysa Öztürk off the streets at Tufts[a university in Boston], which is very near to Harvard, it’s only about 20 minutes away. I’ve been down similar streets to those. You almost think, am I really in America?”Roble said he feared for the long-term impact, not just on the international students affected but also on US students.“It’s unfair for the students themselves but it’s unfair for America as well. British and international students bring so much to America and American university campuses.“Even the semester when I was teaching American democracy to a class full of American students, I think they really enjoyed that, they gave glowing feedback. We contribute a lot and the administration should stop being so shortsighted in that regard.”Explore more on these topicsHarvard UniversityInternational studentsTrump administrationStudentsUniversitiesHigher educationnewsShareReuse this content"

But later that day, another judge discharged the injunction andthe agreement to hand over Britain’s last African colony was sealed.While much of the fallout has focused on the cost to the UK of leasing back Diego Garcia, which is home to a UK-US airbase, and perceived security threats from Mauritius’s relationship with China, many Chagossians feel sidelined.Chief among their concerns is that Diego Garcia is exempted from the right of return for Chagossians contained in the deal and that the Mauritius government will not do right by them.Dugasse, who was two-and-a-half when her family was forced to move to Seychelles, said on Friday that she was heartbroken. “I don’t know how to put it because the night before we won, and in the morning we lost – I’ve been betrayed by the British government,” she said.“I will have to keep on fighting the British government till they accept for me to settle there [on Diego Garcia]. Do I know if I’ll be able to be around to keep on fighting? I’m getting older and older and I’m losing my strength so I don’t think I can make it for very long.”The presence of the military base was the reason the UK severed the Chagos Islands – renaming it the British Indian Ocean Territory – from the rest ofMauritius, when it granted the latter independence in 1968. The British forcibly displaced up to 2,000 people in what has been described as a crime against humanity and one of the most shameful episodes of postwar colonialism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They don’t even mention us. When they expelled us, everything was hidden [as if] there were no human beings on the island, just some Man Fridays. And they’re not saying it [now], they’re not pronouncing the [same] words, but by their actions they’re doing the same thing. We’re being scammed over and over again.”Given their historic treatment by the British, it might seem strange that the legal challenge sought to keep the islands under British control, but the women explained that it was intended as a temporary arrangement.Dugasse said it would be “for the time being, until we are able to manage our island by ourselves”. She elaborated, likening the deal to going “out of the frying pan, into the fire”, and added: “Like my grandparents used to say: ‘Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t know.’”Of the Chagossians in Mauritius, many of whom support the deal, she said: “They forgot that in the past they were campaigning against the Mauritian government for dumping them in rough houses, dirty places.”Pompe and Dugasse pledged to continue the fight by urging MPs to vote against the deal in parliament and also through the courts. “I’m still feeling hopeful,” said Pompe. “[Thursday] was a little bit of a disappointment, but after that we’ve had so much support, especially from other Chagossian groups.“I’m going to keep working with my lawyers, and we’re going to bring another case. So it’s not over until the fat lady sings – and that’s me.”The government made no reference to the Chagossiansin its press releaseon Thursday. It described the agreement as a “legal necessity”, giveninternational court rulingswhich said it should return the islands to Mauritius, and said it had secured the future of the “strategically critical” Diego Garcia base.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsForeign policyForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeMauritiusColonialismnewsShareReuse this content"

They said the policy was being considered as part of the strategy but that no final decision had been made.“The government is determined to bring down child poverty. We’re not waiting to act,” the source added, pointing to measures already announced by the government, including the expansion offree breakfast clubs, a cap on school uniform items and increasing the national minimum wage.Experts say that scrapping the benefit limit would be the single most effective way of reducing child poverty. They say about 100 children are pulled into poverty every day by the limit, meaning up to 20,000 could be affected by a six-month delay. In addition, the benefit cap pushes 30,000 children into deep poverty when parents’ capacity to work is limited.Kendall and Phillipson are both understood to be in favour of scrapping the two-child limit. In March the Department for Work and Pensions’ own analysis of planned welfare cuts found that 50,000 children would be pushed into relative poverty by the end of the decade as a result.The former prime minister Gordon Brown urged Starmer this week to get rid of the “cruel” policy, arguing that it would be the most effective way of tackling child poverty, which was a “stain on the soul” of the country. Sources have suggested the policy could be tweaked rather than dropped entirely.There are concerns inside government that any further delay in acting on the limit beyond the autumn budget would mean the impact of scrapping it would not be felt before the next election, further reducing the political arguments for making the change.Sources suggested the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, did not want to commit to the estimated £2.5bn cost of scrapping the limit before knowing the total bill for other social security measures, which will be linked to September’s inflation figures and come into effect next April.Ministers are planning to announce a package of up to £750m to tackle child poverty at the spending review in June, the Guardian understands, although the final figure is yet to be agreed. It is expected to focus on measures to tackle the root causes of poverty, such as work, affordable housing and education. However, sources suggested this could include “rebadging” existing commitments “but putting child poverty in the press release”.Reeves hinted in aninterview with the Guardianlast week that the government was planning policies to tackle child poverty. “I want to lift people out of poverty, particularly I want to lift children out of poverty, and of course, we’ll set out more plans to do that,” she said.Thecuts to disability benefitsannounced in the spring statement have caused consternation among Labour MPs, dozens of whom are preparing to rebel against the policy in the vote expected next month. Backbenchers say more than 100 MPs have signed a private letter telling Labour whips they are unable to support the cuts.Seven Labour MPs were suspended from the whip for voting against the government on the two-child benefit cap in the king’s speech in July.Alison Garnham, the chief executive of the ChildPovertyAction Group, said: “There are 4.5 million children already in poverty and another 109 are pulled into poverty every day by the two-child limit alone. If this government is serious in its commitment to the nation’s children, it can’t keep waiting for the stars to align before taking action. It must urgently invest in children and their families, starting with scrapping the two-child limit.”Clare Moriarty, the chief executive at Citizens Advice, said: “It is deeply concerning that the government is watering down its commitment to publish a full and comprehensive child poverty strategy this spring. The need to tackle child poverty is urgent and the prime minister and chancellor should not let a point of process excuse them from taking decisions now.“Every day the two-child limit and benefit cap is in place, more children and families get sucked into poverty. Furthermore, these policies will act as a brake to any other action taken by this government to reduce child poverty.”Dan Paskins, from Save theChildrenUK, said: “Every month that goes by while Keir Starmer does not scrap the cruel two-child limit means thousands of children are plunged into poverty. We would like to see assurance from No 10 that this delay means their child poverty strategy contains bold ideas backed with the finance – starting with scrapping the two-child limit and benefit cap.”Helen Barnard, the director of policy at the Trussell Trust, said on social media: “Better a delayed child poverty strategy with measures to really protect children from hunger and hardship than one hitting the deadline but falling short on substance.”Explore more on these topicsPovertyChildrenWelfareSocial exclusionBenefitsKeir StarmerRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

They’ll be coming out again to do assessments of the structure,” Smith told the news outlet.The island facility has been closed since 1963, when then attorney general Robert F Kennedy ordered its shutdown amid high operating costs, limited space and multiple escape attempts.BOP director William Marshall toldFox Newsthat engineering teams are already surveying the site. “We’ve got engineering teams out there now that are doing some assessments, and so I’m just really excited about the opportunity and possibilities,” he said.In recent months, the US government has moved to reopen at least five previously closed detention centers and prisons.AlthoughCalifornialawmakers havedismissedthe Alcatraz proposal as a “distraction” and not a serious plan, the Trump administration is actively working – with the help of private prison companies – to reopen other facilities,some of which are already back in operation.A hard cell?

Therefore I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on theEuropean Union, starting on June 1, 2025.”Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump claimed the EU had “taken advantage” of the US and claimed the new tariffs would be imposed unless EU companies moved their operations to the US.“It’s time that we play the game the way I know how to play the game,” said Trump.Stock markets slumped in response to the news, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 1% as Trump also signalled plans to imposetariffs on Apple, Samsung and other phone manufacturers.

The EU would have to react and it is something that would really hurt the US and European economy.”EU negotiators have been locked in meetings with White House representatives since Trump’s so-called “liberation day” tariffs were first announced. Dozens of countries have been holding discussions to try to bring down their own levies before the 90-day pause elapses.The White House has relented on many of its most onerous tariffs, including loweringtotal tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%after what Trump declared were constructive talks with Beijing, which lowered its retaliatory border taxes from 125% to 10% in response.A week ago the US president appeared to acknowledge that Washington lacked the ability to negotiate deals with scores of countries at once, saying the US would instead send letters to some trading partners tounilaterally impose new tariff rates.Perceptions of an easing back on a hardline approach to trade brought a period of calm to stock markets, but Friday’s threat of a 50% levy on EU goods, plus a separate threatmade the same day of 25% tariffs on iPhones made abroad, have brought an end to the peace.The EU presented a fresh trade proposal to the US on Thursday. The offer included phased tariff cuts on non-sensitive goods, plus cooperation on energy, AI and digital infrastructure. The bloc was readying about $108bn in retaliatory tariffs if talks failed.To sweeten the deal, EU officials were also willing to extend a 2020 tariff-free arrangement on US lobster imports,according to the Financial Times. But it appears to have proved insufficient to persuade the US president to sign a deal allowing only his 10% universal tariff to apply to the EU, as it does the UK.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsInternational tradeGlobal economyDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Trump administration has since been reviewing the proposal.Under the arrangement announced by Trump on Friday, US Steel would remain in the US, with its headquarters in Pittsburgh, he stressed, announcing plans to hold a “big rally” in the state next week.“This will be a planned partnership between United States Steel and Nippon Steel, which will create at least 70,000 jobs, and add $14 Billion Dollars to the U.S. Economy,” the president claimed on Truth Social, his social network. “The bulk of that Investment will occur in the next 14 months.”Shares of US Steel soared 21% as investors interpreted Trump’s post on Truth Social to mean Nippon Steel had received his approval for its long-planned takeover, the last major hurdle for the deal.Trump says he is hitting EU with 50% tariff as trade talks are ‘going nowhere’Read moreUS Steel kept rising after-hours and reached $54, just shy of Nippon Steel’s $55-per-share offer price made in late 2023. While no details were released, investors expressed confidence that terms would be similar to those agreed upon in 2023. Investors said that eventually US Steel would no longer be publicly traded and they would receive a cash payout for their shares.Trump added that the bulk of that investment would occur in the next 14 months and said he would hold a rally at US Steel in Pittsburgh next Friday.Nippon Steel said it applauded Trump’s decision to approve the “partnership”. The White House did not immediately reply to questions about the announcement.This week, Reuters reported that Nippon Steel said that if the merger were approved, it would invest $14bn into US Steel’s operations, including up to $4bn in a new steel mill.The deal has been one of the most highly anticipated on Wall Street after it morphed into the political arena with fears that foreign ownership would mean job losses inPennsylvania, where US Steel is headquartered. It factored into last year’s election that saw Donald Trump returned to the White House.The Pennsylvania senator Dave McCormick, who also called the deal a “partnership”, on Friday said it was a “huge victory for America and the US Steel Corporation” that will protect more than 11,000 Pennsylvania jobs, and support the creation of at least 14,000 more.The United Steelworkers union had urged the president to reject Nippon’s bid, dismissing the firm’s commitments to invest in the US as “flashy promises” and claiming it was “simply seeking to undercut our domestic industry from the inside”.Trump’s position on Nippon’s approach has shifted significantly. Just in December, he declared he was vehemently opposed to the transaction. “As President, I will block this deal from happening,” he wrote. “Buyer Beware!!!”By last month, however, he had somewhat softened his stance, stating only that he wanted US Steel to remain in the US. “We don’t want to see it go toJapan,” he said.For investors, including prominent hedge funds, the news spells relief after more than a year of waiting for a resolution. “There were huge high-fives all around today,” one recent investor said, adding: “We understood Donald Trump’s psyche and we played it to our advantage here.”Investors said Trump appears to have won ground after the pledge for new investments was increased.“This deal ensures that steelmaking will live on in Pittsburgh for generations,” another investor said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationJapanSteel industryDonald TrumpUS politicsAsia PacificPennsylvanianewsShareReuse this content"

In return, the department would dismiss the fraud charge in the criminal case against the aircraft manufacturer.“Ultimately, in applying the facts, the law, and Department policy, we are confident that this resolution is the most just outcome with practical benefits,” a justice department spokesperson said in a statement.“Nothing will diminish the victims’ losses, but this resolution holds Boeing financially accountable, provides finality and compensation for the families and makes an impact for the safety of future air travelers.”Many relatives of the passengers who died in the crashes, which took placeoff the coast of Indonesiaandin Ethiopialess than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, have spent years pushing for a public trial, the prosecution of former company officials, and more severe financial punishment for Boeing.Families of victims appalled as Boeing seems likely to avoid prosecution over 737 Max crashesRead more“Although the DOJ proposed a fine and financial restitution to the victims’ families, the families that I represent contend that it is more important for Boeing to be held accountable to the flying public,” Paul Cassell, an attorney for many of the families in the long-running case, said in a statement earlier this week.Boeing was accused of misleading the Federal Aviation Administration about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight. Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about a new software system, called MCAS, that could turn the plane’s nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.The Max planes crashed after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned MCAS to make it less powerful and to use signals from two sensors, not just one.Boeing avoided prosecution in 2021 by reaching a $2.5bn settlement with the justice department that included a previous $243.6m fine.A year ago, prosecutors said Boeing violated the terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeingagreed last July to plead guiltyto the felony fraud charge instead of enduring a potentially lengthy public trial.But in December, US district judge Reed O’Connor in Fort Worthrejectedthe plea deal. The judge said the diversity, inclusion and equity (DEI) policies in the government and at Boeing could result in race being a factor in picking a monitor to oversee Boeing’s compliance with the agreement.Explore more on these topicsBoeingTrump administrationLaw (US)Plane crashesnewsShareReuse this content"

When Stefan de Vrij put Inter ahead via a corner after 20 minutes, they leapfroggedNapoliin the live standings, but the goal from the former Manchester United midfielder McTominay in the 42nd minute, acrobatically converting Matteo Politano’s cross, eased nerves in Naples.Serie A title decider: Napoli win the Scudetto to deny Inter – live reactionRead moreRomelu Lukaku doubled Napoli’s lead six minutes after the restart by latching on to a long ball, shrugging off a defender and calmly finishing past the Cagliari keeper Alen Sherri. The rest of the match turned into a celebration at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium as flares and smoke filled the pitch before the final whistle blew and fireworks lit up the Naples sky.McTominay’s night got even better when he was named Serie A’s player of the season after the title race was decided. The Scotland midfielder has been vital for Napoli, scoring 12 goals and providing six assists in 34 league matches. The 28-year-old told DAZN: “The sacrifice of every single player in this group is just incredible. The people deserve it, as they’ve been behind us from day one. For me to come here and experience this, it’s just a dream.”In Naples he now goes by the name “McFratm” among supporters, a playful fusion of his name and “Fratm”, the Neapolitan word for “my brother”. “My Italian is OK, I can understand, but speaking it takes more confidence and it’s not easy. It is much easier to do it with people who don’t speak any English. I can feel a lot of love,” McTominay said, adding that he just had learned the words “festeggiamo, andiamo”, meaning “let’s go celebrate”.While Joaquín Correa also made it 2-0 to Inter at Como’s Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia, it was not enough forthe Champions League finalists. Serving a touchline ban, the Inter head coach, Simone Inzaghi, rested several regular starters before the European final on 31 May but his side still had enough to win.“We did our part, we knew we were depending on others. We couldn’t have done more today, but we have to put it behind us and prepare for the final,” the Inter captain De Vrij told DAZN. “We didn’t deserve [the title] because if we’re not top after 38 games, then whoever is top deserves it, but there’s a feeling that we could have done more in the league.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Inter nearly doubled their lead but Reina, making his final career appearance, denied Mehdi Taremi with a sharp one-on-one save.However, the Spaniard’s farewell turned sour when he was sent off shortly before half-time after a VAR review for a last-man foul on Taremi. Correa doubled Inter’s lead six minutes into the second half, cutting inside a defender before finishing coolly. De Vrij added: “There’s a huge desire to play a great final next week.

Mick Thompson, the leading scorer last season, and Jack Bar, who was a captain, are among a handful of Canadians on the men’s hockey roster; 10 of the 13 members of the men’s squash team and more than half of the women’s soccer and golf rosters also list foreign hometowns.Harvard’s 42 varsity sports teams are the most in the nation, and Sportico reported last month that 21% of the players on the school’s rosters for the 2024-25 seasons – or 196 out of 919 athletes – had international hometowns. The site noted that some could be US citizens or green card holders who wouldn’t need one of the international visas at issue in an escalating fight premised by the administration’s assertions that the school failed to protect Jewish students from antisemitism.The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday revoked Harvard’s ability to enroll international students, saying the school has created an unsafe campus environment by allowing “anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators” to assault Jewish students on campus. The move could force as many as 6,800 foreign students at the school outside of Boston – more than a quarter of its total enrollment – to transfer or leave the country.Harvard called the action unlawful and said it is working to provide guidance to students. President Alan Garber, noting that he is himself Jewish, said last month after filing a lawsuit to halt a federal funding freeze that the school “will continue to fight hate with the urgency it demands as we fully comply with our obligations under the law. That is not only our legal responsibility. It is our moral imperative.”Harvard athletic director Erin McDermott previously declined an interview request from the Associated Press on the potential impact of the visa ban. A Harvard athletics spokesman on Thursday referred a request for comment to the school’s main media information office, which did not immediately respond. The AP also requested comment from three Harvard coaches, who did not respond.Canadian prime ministerMark Carney, a former Harvard hockey player, declined to comment when contacted by the AP. Massachusetts governor Maura Healey, a Democrat who played basketball at Harvard, said the athletes are among 85,000 foreign students who come to the state to “study, conduct research, start businesses, and create jobs and innovations”.“President Trump is punishing our students and hurting our economy, all as part of his agenda to silence anyone who disagrees with him,” she said. “The only ones who benefit from Donald Trump’s actions are China and other countries who are already recruiting these students. It’s the exact opposite of America First.”Explore more on these topicsCollege sportsHarvard UniversityUS sportsMark CarneyShareReuse this content"

But he is far from the only football player to deal with contract quirksOliver ConnollyFri 23 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 05.01 EDTShareAs contract clauses go, this one is pretty painful: Packers guard Sean Rhyan missed out on $2m after falling two snaps shy of picking up a bonus. The NFL has a built-in bonus pool designed to reward late draftees who see the field early in their careers. One of those performance benchmarks is a player’s volume of snaps. If they cross the 35% mark, they receive a chunky bonus. But Rhyan fell two snaps shy of that mark last season, missing the chance to see hisbase salary more than double.The performance escalator is one of the quirks of the league’s Collective Bargaining Agreement. With the CBA, rookie pay scale and hard salary cap, the NFL is typically a less chaotic contractual league than others in North America. There are none of the odd riders in players’ contracts – theunlimited sushi,30-year contracts, orSpringsteen guarantees– that litter other sports. Careers are short. Leverage is fleeting. The language is standardized. However, Rhyan’s situation is far from a one-off.The homework clauseFew positions in sports are as mentally taxing as quarterback. They have to ID and break down tricky coverages and deliver throws on target and in rhythm. It requires thousands of physical and mental reps.Peyton Manning could squeeze in upwards of 40 hours of extra tape study a week, leading to an arms race among young quarterbacks keen to show they were keeping up with the best. When he was drafted No 1 overall by the Rams, Jared Goff was so overwhelmed by the demands of the position that he built a film-watching bunker in his home.“I watch tape all day Monday, all day Tuesday, Wednesday we practice, Thursday we practice, Friday we practice, then I come home and watch film, then Saturday before the game, I watch film, and then Sunday morning, I watch film,” Tom Brady said in 2022. “It’s almost soothing. I can go four or five hours without getting up from the chair.”But not everyone is so … dedicated. Or at least their team doesn’ttrustthat they have Brady’s inner drive. In 2022, the Cardinals signed Kyler Murray to a five-year, $230m extension, making him the second-highest-paid player in the league. As part of the contract, the Cardinals included an “independent study” clause that mandated Murray watch four hours of film a week, independent of the team. Arizona planned to include a tracker in their team-issued tablet to ensure Murray’s focus was on the game tape, rather than movies or video games. The addendum allowed the Cardinals to terminate Murray’s contract if he didn’t complete his homework.Why would you hand $230m to a player you weren’t sure was doing the bare minimum for the position? Good question! After the news leaked, the Cardinals decided to remove the clause. But the stain still lives on; Murray continues to be hit with allegations that heisn’t as focused or engaged as the position’s elite, despite ripping off the best season of his career in 2024.The Dez RulesJerry Jones operates in a league of his own. In his 36 years as the Cowboys’ owner, no one has given more leeway to rogue personalities. But no one has enforced such strict rules, either.Some of the most intense treatment was reserved for Dez Bryant. After his 2011 arrest for assault, the Cowboys had their budding star receiver sign a “security agreement” to try to rein in his off-the-field activity. The team did not officially change Bryant’s contract, but he signed a three-year, four-page agreement withlongtime Cowboys fixer David Wells. The “Dez Rules” set out a series of guidelines:Bryant would be followed by a three-person security detail whenever he was away from the Cowboys’ training base.He would be driven to and from practice by Cowboys personnel.He would attend two mandated counselling sessions a week.He was banned from drinking alcohol.He was barred from attending strip clubs, given a midnight curfew, and only allowed to attend clubs where veteran Cowboys security staffers moonlighted as door staff.The rules even extended to putting security cameras inside Bryant’s home, so that Wells could track who was coming and going. And Bryant had to cover the security bill himself, with the $17,000 a month cost deducted from his salary. As Bryant earned more trust, the rules were scaled back. But, as invasive as the rules were, they worked. Bryant put together the best three-year stretch of his career on the field while staying out of trouble off it.The Bryant episode was not Jones’s first use of team-mandated security details – or the most invasive. “No, this is [not] the strictest at all,” Jones said in 2012. Adam “Pacman” Jones and Tank Johnson signed similar agreements with the team. But Pacman’s was voided after he was suspended by the league forgetting into a fightwithhis ownbodyguard.Weight clausesSometimes, going on a diet pays off.NFLteams have long included bonuses in players’ contracts if they hit a target weight. Ordinarily, a target is set for the start of training camp with a further trigger at the end of preseason if a player hits their goal weight. The Patriots took things to a different level with offensive linemen Trent Brown, inserting a clause in his contract that would trigger a $1.5m payday over two seasons if he kept his weight down.Brown, then the largest player in NFL history, was asked to trim down from 390lbs to 365lbs in time for the start of the 2022 season. Among other incentives, each week of preseason, Brown was given a new target to hit that would trigger a $75,000 bonus. At his weekly check-ins during the season, Brown could earn an extra $25,000 if he maintained his weight, totaling $450,000 in the regular season.Weight targets are standard practice for beefy offensive and defensive linemen. They’re less common, however, with more svelte skill-position players. But when the Seahawks signed running back Eddie Lacy as a free agent in 2017, roughly 18% of his salary was tied to the scales. Lacy turned up for his free agent visit with Seattle 36lbs overweight. The team still signed him to a base salary of $2.1m but included another $2.1m as incentives, with $385,000 tied to his weight. Lacy was given six months to get himself in shape, and the bruising running back began shedding pounds in time for training camp – he even hired the founder ofP90Xto help him. Like Brown, Lacy was weighed at the start of camp, with bonuses heading his way each week as he burned more fat. Once he hit his target weight, Lacy was paid an extra $55,000 a month to stick to his playing weight. Not bad business if you can get it.View image in fullscreenEddie Lacy was paid for keeping weight off.Photograph: Dylan Buell/Getty ImagesTeams have even used weight clauses to engage in some draft chicanery. The NFL’scomplicated comp pick formula, which rewards teams with draft picks, doesn’t take into account weight-related bonuses. The Eagles worked the system in 2018 when they signed receiver Mike Wallace. Wallace was a slender speedster, weighing around 200lbs for most of his career. To get around the comp pick formula, the Eagles signed Wallace to a reduced base salary and inserted a $585,000 bonus in his contract if he reported to training camp under 250 lbs. Whadya know? Wallace came in at 200lbs and pocketed the bonus. The move allowed the Eagles tosneak an extra sixth-round pickin the next year’s draft by layering Wallace’s contract in a way that kept it below the comp pick triggers.Akili Smith bets on himself (oops)The Bengals drafted Smith, a quarterback, No 3 overall in 1999, back before the NFL had a rookie scale that effectively tied a player’s salary to where they were selected in the draft.Smith held out for most of his rookie training camp while negotiating his contract (somehow, the Bengals are still incontract disputes with first-rounderstoday despite the rookie wage scale). He eventually agreed to a deal that converted most of his contract into performance incentives rather than upfront cash. Smith agreed to a dealthat gave him a $10.8m signing bonus, below market value at the time, but that included up to $56m in performance incentives.Smith bet on himself to at least be competent as a rookie. Oops. One of the key details was a so-called “escalation clause” that would trigger a $4m bonus if Smith threw for at least 1,600 yards in his rookie season, an easy target for a 16-game starter. But Smith never hit the figure. He was benched 11 games into his career after throwing for only 1,253 yards, in part because the Bengals were trying to avoid a hefty payday, and in part because they recognized they had a bust on their hands.Smith wound up starting only 17 games for the Bengals, throwing just five touchdowns with 13 interceptions. And he missed out on almost every performance clause he had negotiated. Four years later, he was out of the league.The end of the world clauseWhen the league first entered the salary cap era, players did not trust that owners would hold up their end of the bargain. After he was drafted No 2 overall by the Seahawks in 1993, Rick Mirer asked for a stipulation in his contract that would guarantee he would be paid no matter what happened … including the end of the world.Mirer’s agents, Don Yee and Marvin Demoff, included language pinched from the banking world that the quarterback’s contract would “survive and remain effective from the date of execution of this contract up to and including the end of the world.”Mirer did get paid. He also lost a ton of games over his four years as a starter in Seattle.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But in a shifting 2025 landscape, Gauff may finally be ready to rewrite the endingOwen LewisFri 23 May 2025 05.00 EDTShareIf she only had the fortune of being born seven years earlier,Coco Gauffmight have won Roland Garros three times already. Gauff, now 21 years old, hasn’t lost before the quarter-final of the tournament since she was 16, a run of consistency many top players would kill for. Good luck hitting through her on the slow clay surface, she is blindingly fast. She can rip her backhand down the line and offset her shaky forehand by loading the ball with topspin and fluttering it deep towards the opponent’s baseline.All this, on paper, makes for a modern clay-court great – or at the very least, the first American Roland Garros champion since (who else?) Serena Williams. But Gauff is yet to win the title at Roland Garros, or receive much credit for her clay-court pedigree. All thanks to the cosmically bad luck of sharing a generation with Iga Natalia Świątek.Świątek has won Roland Garros four times in the past five years, starting at age 19, an alarmingly Nadalian pace. Everybody else has suffered from her resolute gatekeeping, but nobody more so than Gauff. In the 2022 final, 2023 quarter-final, and 2024 semi-final, Gauff ran smack into Świątek, who dismissed her in straight sets each time. None of these sets have even been especially close. It gets worse: Świątek is 23, close enough in age to Gauff that Gauff can’t count on her rival aging out of contention first. Unless she can win Roland Garros – and she’ll probably have to beat Świątek to do it – Gauff is doomed to be perpetually underrated on clay. Setting the record straight might well be the ultimate challenge of her entire career.As a cautionary tale for Gauff, the Roland Garros YouTube channel has spent the past few weeks uploading full replays of Rafael Nadal’s 14 finals at the tournament, many of them against Roger Federer. To someone watching the dusty battles for the first time, they’re probably distinct. 2006 was the year Federer won the first set, he had a cataclysmic break point conversion rate in 2007, Nadal just flattened him in 2008. But to the hardcore fan, and probably to Federer, those finals all blend together into the same match. They’re athletically impressive and occasionally competitive but never quiteclose.Federer, one of the greatest players of all time, not only lost each time he played Nadal at Roland Garros but never even looked like winning.To her credit, Gauff has tried on several different styles in her attempts to unseat Świątek (a relative rarity in tennis; abandoning the core tenets of the play that helped someone reach the top 10 must feel like fleeing a loving parent for a stranger), but each has produced the same result so far. In 2022, Gauff’s first major final, the nervous then-18-year-old produced a shaky rendition of her standard game and got blown out. In 2023, she cut down on errors, but couldn’t match Świątek’s firepower. In 2024, she bravely attacked every forehand she could – Going For It, as we are so eager for athletes to do – acting as if she possessed Naomi Osaka’s fearsome forehand rather than her own. But the execution wasn’t there, and, as if being teased for her courage, Gauff won just six games, the exact same as in her 2023 loss.Matchups like this can feel mythically tragic after a while, like the task of beating the rival has been designed by cruel gods. Play badly, get erased; play well, get soundly beaten; overcome your limits, get your heart broken. In the second round of Roland Garros last year, Osaka became the first player to neuter Świątek for a prolonged period at the tournament, crushing groundstrokes with so much raw power – a power Gauff doesn’t possess even on her best day – that Świątek didn’t have enough time to muster a counteroffensive. Osaka dominated an hour-long stretch of the match, then, one point away from victory, crumbled and lost. You sort of knew it would happen. Sisphyus had his traitorous rock and Orpheus had a mandate against temptation; those hoping to win Roland Garros have Świątek.Gauff’s struggles have far less to do with finish-line nerves than the level of difficulty on the shots she has to hit to make headway against Świątek. There’s a point during their 2024 meeting that sums up her plight. Gauff actually wins the rally, but to do it, had to hit two shots into nooks of the court so vanishingly small that her confidence seemed to recede rather than grow. Likely too aware of how difficult those shots were to make, Gauff sprayed her shots wide of their targets and only won one more game for the rest of the match.To beat Świątek at Roland Garros, Gauff would have to maintain accurate helter-skelter aggression for a sustained two-hour period (ie shoot 100% on 20 three-pointers, bat for the cycle against the best pitcher alive, score a hat-trick twice over), or hope for a complete Świątek implosion. Maybe both.This year, there is reason to think that at least one of those two outcomes is possible. After losing 11 of her first 12 matches to Świątek, Gauff has won the last three in straight sets, establishing some physical and psychological patterns that might come into play at Roland Garros.In January, Gauff beat Świątek at the team-based United Cup event by ruining her confidence in her best shots. She relied on her legs to reach even Świątek’s heaviest haymakers, and they did. Gauff sent typically point-ending shots back into uncomfortable positions, a stupefying proposition. (“The balls she puts back into play are truly comical,” the tennis writer Giri Nathan told me of Gauff in 2023.) Gauff’s court coverage grew so stifling that Świątek had to squeeze her groundstrokes down ever-narrowing channels of space to hit winners, and inevitably missed more than she made. Gauff came away with an authoritative win that made it seem like she was the one with a yawning lead in the head-to-head.Still, there was reason to think it would be different on Świątek’s favored clay. On 1 May, she and Gauff met in the semi-finals of the Madrid Open. Both players had been in patchy form all week, and as always, Świątek was the favorite. But from the jump, Gauff took control, this time with her offense. She met fire with fire, hitting meaty forehands, and more accurately than she had at Roland Garros in 2024. Accustomed to breaking down Gauff’s forehand with ease, Świątek countered with desperate, blind aggression, and her usual accuracy warped beyond recognition. Gauff barely put a foot wrong, letting Świątek’s implosion run its course, and put up the most one-sided scoreline Świątek had ever suffered in a clay loss. The result suggested something was seriously amiss with the defending Roland Garros champion.Świątek, in fact, is in crisis. At the Olympics last year, played at her beloved Roland Garros grounds, Świątek shockingly lost in the semi-finals and had to settle for a bronze medal. In August, she tested positive for the banned substance TMZ – the InternationalTennisIntegrity Agency accepted a thorough explanation that the test was due to a contaminated melatonin supplement – and served a one-month ban.Since her return, she has seemed more tightly wound on court. Her form has dissolved since a loss at the Australian Open semi-finals, her first ever from match point up (at last she knew how it felt to play herself). At Indian Wells, a ballkid tossed Świątek a ball only for Świątek to bounce it hard over his head, making him flinch. The subsequent backlash prompted her to release a lengthy apology confessing to the stress and unhappiness she had felt over the previous months.Even at the Italian Open, a tournament Świątek had dominated three of the last four years, the trend continued. She lost in a harried two sets to Danielle Collins, looking just as lost as she had against Gauff in Madrid in the opener. Gauff, meanwhile, made it to the final before losing to the in-form home favorite Jasmine Paolini. Thanks to Paolini’s win, Świątek slipped down to fifth in the rankings. She has not been ranked this low, or lost to Collins, since 2022.In a sport as fiercely individual as tennis, Świątek’s crisis is hers alone. It’s fuel for her rivals. Everybody knows well that tangible chances to win Roland Garros will be few and far between as long as Świątek is on tour, and will play with even more vigor now that she seems vulnerable.Świątek paid for her new ranking in the draw. She could play Jelena Ostapenko, the quirky, inconsistent 21st seed who has beaten Świątek all six times they’ve played, in the fourth round. Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 1, is her slated semi-final opponent. Gauff is in the opposite half, away from Świątek, away from Sabalenka. She looks likelier than the defending champion to make the Roland Garros final, a radical shift from previous editions of the tournament.When playing on the Parisian clay again, Świątek’s woes might dissolve into the background as she shreds the field once more. But Gauff is now, for the first time, a genuine threat to beat her there, more so than Federer ever was against Nadal. She may not win Roland Garros this year – Sabalenka, who beat Gauff in the Madrid final, could be just as difficult an opponent as Świątek – but merely arriving at a place where winning seems plausible is a small victory. Świątek could lose to somebody else, but I suspect Gauff will want to do the job herself. If she does, the various challenges she faces for the rest of her career should pale in comparison.Explore more on these topicsCoco GauffIga SwiatekFrench Open 2025French OpenTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Euros final was fairly level to this in terms of testing my ability to manage the emotions of the day and occasion. I’m just going to enjoy it.Barcelona are big Women’s Champions League final favourites despite ‘worst’ seasonRead more“If I think that the fact that I’m an Arsenal fan is going to get in the way I have to shift, because that’s not my focus for the day – my job is to be a player, a player that wants to do it for the fan in me.”Williamson’s fandom and playing career have been intertwined from the moment she sidestepped her dad’s attempts to get her to support Tottenham. That included a trip to White Hart Lane and a new shirt that she had to take off before she got home; instead she chose their north London rivals, the team of her mum and grandma. On Saturday, it is her dad who will be donning a new shirt, having made a bet with her that if she ever got to a Champions League final with Arsenal, he would wear one.This may be the centre-back’s first European final, but it’s not her first wearing red and white, however. Looking down at the photograph of her 10-year-old self dressed in an oversized kit and clutching a mini football, Williamson grins. As a mascot for the second leg of the 2007 European Cup final, Williamson lined up alongside her under-10s teammates and a few other girls to witness an achievement that has become the benchmark for English clubs.View image in fullscreenThe Arsenal mascots before the second leg of the Women’s Uefa Cup final between Arsenal Women and Umeå in Borehamwood, England, in April 2007. Leah Williamson is sixth.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty Images“That’s my kit that I had to wash and wear again and again, but I loved it; it was something that was my own. I was just so happy to be part of Arsenal,” she says. “We had long-sleeved shirts if it was cold and if it was hot you just rolled them up. I broke my arm in my first game for Arsenal and when we got to the hospital, the woman said she was going to have to cut it off. I wanted a cast, as you do when you’re a kid, so I was saying it was painful but I switched to: ‘No. I’m fine. That’s OK. I’ll get it out.’ I wouldn’t let her cut it. It was broken, but I treasured that kit.”That European final was played at Boreham Wood FC’s Meadow Park, where her mum used to help out on the turnstiles; it was a sunny day and the small terraces were packed. Williamson did not quite understand the magnitude of the fixture – the first, and to date only, European triumph by an English women’s club – instead she was a little upset because they walked on to the pitch with Arsenal’s opponents, Umeå. “I wasn’t very happy about that,” she says.Seven years later, Williamson made her senior debut playing alongside some of Arsenal’s quadruple winners. “That for me was always the most humbling thing, playing with people that I idolised,” she says. “At one point they seemed so far away and then all of a sudden you’re in the same training session and you’re basically trying to not let them down.”Arsenal play their Women’s Super League (WSL) and Champions League home games at the 60,704‑seat Emirates Stadium, which displays a huge wraparound tribute to the 2006-07 quadruple winners next to the men’s Invincibles side. It depicts the players hoisting a giant European Cup with red ribbons while the men lift a gold Premier League trophy. “Whenever I approach the stadium it’s just there and I’mvery proud to be at a club that is as proud of them as I am,” says Williamson. “It’s also a reminder of the heights they reached and that incredible level of performance the club should aspire to be at. That’s the point of it all, to inspire people to climb higher.”View image in fullscreenArsenal scarves for sale in the images of Bukayo Saka, Beth Mead and Leah Williamson.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersDoes the weight of that legacy add pressure to the 2025 Champions League finalists? “It should do, but I don’t feel like it has,” she says. “It’s a fantastic opportunity and another step closer to getting the club back to winning ways, that’s how it’s seen by us, which is probably why the pressure doesn’t creep in.”Arsenal’s end to the domestic season was hardly consistent. After a thrilling 4-1 defeat of Lyon to overturn a 2-1 loss in the first leg of the semi-final, there were back-to-back defeats by Aston Villa and Brighton, losing 5-2 and 4-2 respectively, before securing second place in the WSL with a 4-3 win over Manchester United on the final day.“If we’d won those games I’d say to you: ‘It’s great preparation,’ and in losing those games I’ll say to you: ‘It’s great preparation, you just have to use it,’” says Williamson. “We had an opportunity against United to go out and to correct some of the things that had gone wrong in the previous games. Do I think there was a little bit of a hangover? Not mentally, in terms of concentration or commitment to the game, we prepared properly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I just think it was a concoction of a lot of different things, a little bit of rotation, a little bit of the unexpected, and then playing teams that are fresher is going to have an impact, but that’s not the standard we’re happy with.”Beating United at the Emirates Stadium was a chance to put things right. “The firepower that we showed, we looked like ourselves,” says Williamson. “I know they scored two late goals, but the nature of them is less concerning than those conceded in the other games. When you look at it holistically, we had a big task ahead of us to turn our form around and to re-engage with the fans at home after what they’ve done for us this season.”Despite having come from behind in the quarter- and semi-finals, Arsenal are the underdogs facing the holders and three-time champions, so knowing the likelihood of things not going their way at some point must be high.View image in fullscreenLeah Williamson is aiming high against Barcelona. ‘Getting to the final is an achievement and everybody should be happy about that, but we go there to win.’Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“It’s the one thing that you can’t force in football, that belief that you can turn it around, and it has to be organic and authentic,” says Williamson. “You don’t have it unless you’ve shown yourself that you have it.“You could argue that we’ve put ourselves in positions that we shouldn’t have, but ultimately to be able to turn it around and demonstrate to ourselves that we can overturn things means we have that inside us now – that belief, that calmness, and the comfort in being uncomfortable and just trusting.”That belief is liberating, but so is the feeling of being in a final. “A semi-final is hard because you’re not at the last step, there’s still another hurdle, but when you go to a final, you go free,” says Williamson. “That’s normally why you see the best football.“Getting to the final is an achievement, of course it is, and everybody should be happy about that, but we go there to win. That’s the only focus. I’m proud of everything we’ve achieved thus far and I hope no matter what happens there’s a performance to be proud of in the final.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueArsenal WomenWomen's footballBarcelona WomeninterviewsShareReuse this content"

The hope is that a decent percentage of the 80,000 Wembley crowd will be inspired to acquire this vital skill.Following Sheffield United in the hope of playoff success is a lifetime of hurtRead moreIf Lockyer’s presence places the losing finalists’ pain in important context, two managers who, in different ways, have breathed fresh life into their clubs will be desperate to avoid missing out on at least £220m in additional income next season. That is the prize awaiting the winner of football’s so-called richest game in the Premier League’s promised land.While United’s Chris Wilder has achieved five promotions with four clubs during a career embracing almost every level of English football’s pyramid, Régis Le Bris remains a relative novice.Not that a 49-year-old Frenchman who has spent most of his working life as a youth coach and became a manager – at Lorient – three years ago can be underestimated after his startling rejuvenation of an unusually young squad.For far too long playoffs have felt impossibly high altitude for a United side who havenever won promotion this way, losing four finals. Wilder has addressed theproblem by reminding his players that the Wembley air is really not all that thin and maintaining that history is bunk. His hopes of avoiding another demoralising repetition of the past should be enhanced by Gustavo Hamer’s presence. Two years ago the Brazil-born attacking midfielder scored for Coventry against Luton at Wembley and, as the Championship player of the season, he possesses the confidence and class to alter the Blades’ playoff story.View image in fullscreenRégis Le Bris said Sunderland must seize their opportunity.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersWhatever the result, the occasion will be poignant for everyone connected to United. “We’re incredibly sad George is not with us,” said Wilder, remembering the team’s much-loved former right-back George Baldock. The Greece defenderdrowned in his swimming poolin Athens last autumn, shortly after joining Panathinaikos.Baldock, known as “Starman”, was a big favourite at Bramall Lane who twice played an integral part in helping United win promotion to the top tier. “We’ve tried not to use George’s death as a motivational tool,” Wilder said last week. “But his spirit has been with us on the journey. His old shirt has always been in our dressing room, home or away, this season. As a player, and a person as well, George was incredibly driven, always wanting to be the best.”United’s hopes of holding their own at elite level were boosted in December when five financially challenged years under the ownership of Saudi Arabia’s Prince Abdullah were ended by a takeover.It placed a club relegated from the Premier League last spring under the control of COH Sports, a US-based consortium that immediately extended Wilder’s contract and bankrolled seven January signings including Ben Brereton Díaz, Tom Cannon and Hamza Choudhury.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wilder describes the quiet Devonian as “a librarian rather than a rockstar” but “extremely effective”.Sunderland,semi-final losers to Luton,with Lockyer on the scoresheet, two years ago, lack similar experience and finished the season 14 points behind Saturday’s opponents. Only two of the Sunderland XI that started the second leg of the semi-final against Coventry were aged over 25 but the squad bristles with the youthful verve and fearlessness epitomised by the 17-year-old Chris Rigg and 19-year-old Jobe Bellingham. It also contains the gamechanging skills of the Roma loanee playmaker Enzo Le Fée who, from the age of 10, was mentored through a troubled childhood by Le Bris.Wilder is suitably wary yet undaunted. “Sunderland have plenty of energy, quality and personality,” he said. “We need to be bang at it. This is one of the biggest games in world football and Wembley is not a place for losers. But we know how to win.”As Le Bris addressed reporters in Sunderland’s training ground on Thursday, a BBC radio commentator presented him with an elegant ribboned cake box containing a batch of the pink slices that remind the Breton of his favourite French patisseries.A manager noted for his capacity to create powerful connectivity and build strong bonds seemed touched by this good luck gift but those traybakes will taste infinitely better if it is mission accomplished on Saturday.“When I first met with the players last summer, and it was here, in this room, I asked them: ‘What is this season’s purpose?’” Le Bris recalled. “They said: ‘We want promotion’ – and here we are. We don’t know the future so, when you have an opportunity like this, it’s important to catch it.”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSheffield UnitedSunderlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Neville was scheduled to be part of Sky’s commentary team as both sides bid to secure Champions League football next season, but Forest have declined to grant him media accreditation. The East Midlands club declined to comment when approached.The former Manchester United defender Neville said on Instagram: “I was contacted bySky Sportsearlier on in the week and told that I would be commentating at the City Ground on Sunday for the Nottingham Forest v Chelsea match. I was informed yesterday by Sky Sports that Nottingham Forest would not give me an accreditation or access to the stadium as a co-commentator. I’ve had no choice but to withdraw from the coverage.Premier League race for Europe: who’s in, who needs what and how 10 could qualifyRead more“I’ve dished out my fair share of criticism and praise in the last 14 years of doing this job and have never come close to this unprecedented action. Personally, I think it’s disappointing that a great club like Nottingham Forest have been reduced to making such a decision. While they have every right to choose who they let into their own stadium, it’s symptomatic of things that have happened over the last 12 months with the club. I wish the coaching staff, players and fans of the club all the best in their quest to achieve Champions League football.”Neville has been highly critical of Forest and owner Evangelos Marinakis this season. He described Marinakis walking on to the pitch and exchanging words with the head coach, Nuno Espírito Santo, after therecent draw with Leicesteras “scandalous”.Neville urged Nuno to quit the club and his social media post further enraged Marinakis, who had threatened Sky with legal action over comments made by the pundit earlier in the season.AfterForest’s 2-0 defeat at Evertonlast year, the club issued a statement on social media questioning the integrity of the video assistant referee Stuart Attwell after claiming they had been denied three penalties. Neville’s response to that, comparing Forest’s actions to those of a “mafia gang”, prompted an apology from Sky after they had been contacted by Marinakis’s lawyers.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestGary NevilleSky SportsnewsShareReuse this content"

There was also a recall for Conor Gallagher. Toney has scored 29 goals in 43 games for the Saudi Premier League club Al-Ahli since his move from Brentford last summer. Tuchel could find no room for Harry Maguire or Dominic Solanke. Marc Guéhi misses out with an eye injury.Tuchel will train the squad in Barcelona from 2 June to get a feel for the heat that awaits teams at most of the World Cup venues in the United States, Canada and Mexico. One item on his extensive to-do list is to find out how best to accommodate Alexander-Arnold, who is poised toleave Liverpool as a free agentand sign for Real Madrid. He missed Tuchel’s first England camp in March because of injury.“I can see that sometimes he relies heavily on his offensive contributions and gives not so much emphasis on the defensive discipline and effort,” Tuchel said. “This major impact that he had for Liverpool over so many years … if he wants to have this impact in the English national team then he has to take the defensive part very, very seriously.“Because when we are talking, especially about qualifying football and then tournament football, the one defensive error, the one moment where you are not 100% awake, can be decisive. It can be the moment where you pack your suitcases and go home.”The Liverpool manager, Arne Slot, said earlier on Friday he was “not completely happy with every minute” of Alexander-Arnold in training when he began to work with him last summer. “In certain moments, I felt he could do a bit more, to say it mildly,” Slot said. “I told him: ‘You are a much better defender than people tell you but you don’t show it all the time.’ I said: ‘If you are at it and concentrated, there are not many players who can go around you.’ Because he is fast, agile, has a great mentality. But it is about showing that every single game.”Tuchel said there was “a point” to Slot’s comments: “We built [in] a back three [in his firstEnglandgames against Albania and Latvia], with Kyle [Walker] or Reece James staying from the back four and having Myles [Lewis-Skelly] moving into midfield [from left-back]. From a 4-1 it became a 3-2 in possession.View image in fullscreenThe England head coach, Thomas Tuchel, has promised to manage the minutes of the players who will go to the Club World Cup in the US.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA“That would not be ideal with Trent. It will not suit his strengths to be in the back three. It would suit his strengths from passing ability, passing range but it will be too deep and he would be in charge of recovery runs and being aggressive in the counter-pressing. That would just not suit his character. We need to find the role that suits him.”Tuchel promised to manage the minutes of the players going to the Club World Cup, who head to the US after the Senegal game, including Real Madrid’s Jude Bellingham, who will delay shoulder surgery until after the tournament.“He has played for many months – way too long, maybe – with this issue,” Tuchel said. “He plays with this huge shoulder strap under his shirt. From a purely medical point, it [the operation] should be yesterday. They keep delaying because of the importance of Jude.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tuchel has taken the decision to exclude Foden, who has battled an ankle problem since early April, for fitness and form reasons. He is scheduled to play at the Club World Cup with Manchester City.“With Phil, it is a mix between the performances since the last camp and his discomfort with his ankle,” Tuchel said. “Let’s be honest, even before that camp he was not in his best shape. He had not the impact and freedom in his game. We still picked him. I loved him as a person in camp and in training. But he could not transport it into the matches.“It got a bit worse after that in the club. It seems to be stuck, not falling into place for him. So he has not minutes. He is not involved in goals, chances. And considering all these points, together with the fact that he is still complaining about his ankle, I said I will look at other players.”Tuchel was asked whether it would be unwise for any player to pull out with less than rock solid reasons. “Very unwise,” he replied.Tuchel discussed how he might tailor his tactics for matches in extreme heat next summer, plus the steps he will take to monitor and prepare his players. “We have reflected already on a game model,” he said. “Can you play high-pressing; man-to-man; transition games? I am curious to go to the Club World Cup and see the stadiums and actually feel the heat.“We even have now in camp [in Barcelona] … we will test the players how they react to heat and all that stuff. Suffering is one of the headlines for this World Cup. I will be very surprised if we do not suffer.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandTrent Alexander-ArnoldThomas TuchelnewsShareReuse this content"

Slot said it would be a proud moment to raise the trophy in front of his predecessor, who built this title-winning squad, and that he would not have left Feyenoord but for Richard Hughes, Liverpool’s sporting director, making clear he was “the only one” the club wanted.“There was never one second of a doubt [about succeeding Klopp] and that was largely to do with the fact why they wanted me and how they tried to convince me to come,” said the head coach, who refused to be drawn on whether he expects to be offered a new contract this summer.Jerzy Dudek: ‘Carra said to do the spaghetti legs like Grobbelaar but I needed to study my book’Read more“I didn’t have to open my laptop one time to show them what I did or how I worked. They knew everything about me. Journalists in Holland wrote wrongly that I was one of the three or four candidates, but from the start it was clear to me. I told my agent that ‘if I am one of three [candidates] I am not interested, I’m only interested if they want me as the only one’. I didn’t want to go into another summer where I had to do all these kinds of meetings and then waiting, waiting, waiting. My time at Feyenoord was too good.”Hughes visited Slot at home in Zwolle last April and gave a presentation on why the Dutch coach was the ideal fit. Slot said: “Liverpool were so clear they wanted to have me, and they knew everything about me. Immediately it was: ‘OK.’ Richard knew many, many, many games and many of the assessments I’ve made during games – the changes I made in tactics. Julian [Ward, Fenway Sports Group’s technical director] visited the [Feyenoord] training ground and spoke with a lot of people trying to get some knowledge for the club and how I worked. There was not a stone unturned.”Slot has challenged Liverpool’s players to prove they can be serial winners next season and agreed, given Liverpool’s track record of retaining managers for long periods, that he could see himself emulating Klopp’s nine seasons in charge.“I could see it, but it is kind of arrogant to say it if you have only been here a year that you will be here for nine years,” he said. “I don’t think it will be enough if after five years I say: ‘Do remember that in my first year I won the league title.’ Maybe it is different in the modern era and compared to other clubs, but the reason Pep [Guardiola] is there for nine years and Jürgen was here for nine years is that they both won a lot as well. Maybe that is notthereason, but it is a reason.

David Moyes admits Everton are “a bit behind the black ball” in the race for the 22-year-old but, unlike their rivals, could guarantee he would be their first-choice striker next season.The Everton manager said: “We have had a chance to speak to him. He’s spoken to three or four clubs and he’s given us the opportunity to pitch our case. We’re probably a little bit behind the black ball but you never know what happens.”Everton are also considering a move for Doak, who would be the first player to cross the city divide in that direction since Gary Ablett in 1992. Whether Everton would meet Liverpool’s £30m valuation of the 19-year-old remains to be seen. Doak enjoyed a productive loan at Middlesbrough this season before sustaining a thigh injury that required surgery in January. He joined Liverpool from Celtic for a £600,000 compensation fee in 2022 and in January bids of £15m and £16m from Crystal Palace and Ipswich respectively were rejected.Jarrad Branthwaite will miss England’s attempt to retain the European Under-21 Championship in Slovakia next month through injury.

In public, clubs want to be seen to treat customers as adults. In private, they see the commercial benefit of flogging pints with pies. Punters noisily bemoan treatment as second-class citizens – you can have a beer while watching Scottish rugby – when in reality too many of them act in a manner befitting that status. When Ross County claimed a Livingston supporter spat in the face of their assistant manager at the conclusion to Thursday night’s playoff tie, the damning indictment was that this became instantly believable. Scotland’s national sport has a serious behavioural issue, one that threatened to spiral long ago as authorities turned blind eyes. Adding alcohol to the mix would be absurd.Jack MacKenzie has been deemed fit to play in Saturday’s Scottish Cup final as his Aberdeen team look to deny Celtic a domestic treble. Concern around MacKenzie had nothing to do with a hamstring or groin injury. Instead, the young defender was hit in the face by part of a seat afterDundee Unitedfans invaded the Tannadice pitch last Sunday. United had reached the giddy heights of fourth in the Premiership. Pitch invasions have become normalised in Scotland at all levels, further evidenced by Partick Thistle’s contingent at Ayr United during another playoff game. Celebratory in essence, perhaps, but routinely with an aggressive undertone.Cup Tied: scenes and stories from every round of the 150th Scottish CupRead moreWhat happened to MacKenzie comes amid growing, misplaced entitlement in the stands. Celtic’s goalkeeper Viljami Sinisalo said “30 to 40” objects were hurled at him during this month’s Old Firm derby at Ibrox. A wine bottle was lying in his penalty area at one stage. Shards of glass were in the same penalty area for the same fixture three years ago. TheCelticmidfielder Arne Engels was hit in the face by a coin at Ibrox in January. People are at risk of being assaulted at their workplace.The response to such incidents is as feeble as it is predictable; condemnation from clubs and the Scottish football authorities, adjoined to the insistence that the police deal with culprits. Supporters are emboldened by a rising culture of aggression – fuelled by drink and drugs – and the knowledge clubs will suffer no serious repercussions. When Uefa properly tackledRangersover sectarian singing two decades ago, it had impact. At home there was and is embarrassing inaction.A case in point arrived in March. The Scottish Professional Football League announced Celtic and Rangers would each be docked 500 tickets for the next League Cup tie both play at Hampden Park. That’ll show them. This came four months after unacceptable conduct at semi-finals and three after similar antics at the final which were ignored. If Celtic draw Motherwell and Rangers play St Johnstone in next season’s last four, the drop of 500 in “name your allocation” will be irrelevant. What this case proved, eventually, is that the SPFL has rules relating to supporter conduct, rules it has continually ignored. The clubs call the shots in Scotland. The upshot is lame, unsatisfactory governance.If Scotland’s football grounds were public houses, licences would be revoked. It remains curious the government or local authorities have not raised questions over safety certificates. Football clubs spend enough money on substandard players and the abomination that is the video assistant referee system; they should be put under pressure to hugely increase policing and security contributions.View image in fullscreenReferee Don Robertson (left) passes an object that was thrown from the crowd towards Celtic’s Arne Engels to a stadium official at Ibrox in January.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PAThere is merit in the theory this is a wider, societal issue. Yet it is one attaching itself to football, which makes it football’s responsibility. There is no equivalent when Glasgow Warriors host Toulouse. Rory McIlroy is not hit by objects when the Open Championship visits Troon. From the 1970s, Scottish football had challenges with various groups – skinheads, mods, punks, rockers, teddy boys, casuals – and dealt with them. Now it has to try again. The status quo is unacceptable and unsafe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Celtic and Rangers give the impression they wish they had not created monsters with the respective indulgence of the Green Brigade and Union Bears, who have become a law unto themselves. Last weekend, a banner at Celtic Park essentially called for the removal of the chief executive, Michael Nicholson, whose crime is to have a social conscience and be protective of the reputation of his club. The Green Brigade’s previous tifos included the heralding of an IRA member who bombed a Belfast bar in 1975. They see nothing wrong with that in a football environment.Fifty years on, there is not sufficient animosity to sense serious disorder between followers ofAberdeenand Celtic at Scottish football’s showpiece occasion. Still, the close season must be spent reassessing what the game wants its image to be. A noisy, angry minority are being assisted in dragging it into the gutter by the negligence of officialdom.Explore more on these topicsFootballScottish CupFootball politicsScottish PremiershipFootball violenceScotlandRangerscommentShareReuse this content"

We both have good game styles, so I knew it’d be a good match, competitive.“I started off pretty well, really feeling my shots, and she was coming back and testing me, but I’m glad that I was able to pull it out in the end of the set.”It was a generation game largely played on Joint’s racquet over the 39 minutes as the youngster dominated the early stages against the experienced 32-year-old, moving into a 3-0 lead for the loss of just two points with her crisp forehand proving hugely effective.Tomljanovic roared back to level the scores but folded near the end of the set as Joint applied the pressure, grabbing a set point from the older player’s poorly-executed drop shot and then sealing the stanza with a fine service return that her opponent couldn’t retrieve.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thehigh-street retailer Marks & Spenceris one of the most high-profile and recent victims in the UK this month.The Europeans led by the German crime agency, Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) released public appeals in its attempts to track down 18 suspects believed to be involved in the Qakbot malware family along with a third malware known as Trickbot.BKA and its international counterparts said the majority of the suspects were Russian citizens. The Russian nationalVitalii Nikolayevich Kovalev, 36, already wanted in the US, is one of BKA’s most wanted.He is allegedly behind Conti, considered to be the most professional and best-organised ransomware blackmail group in the world with Kovalev described as one of the “most successful blackmailers in the history of cybercrime” by German investigators.Using the pseudonyms Stern and Ben, BKA allege he is claimed to have attacked hundreds of companies worldwide and extracted large ransom payments from them.Kovolev, 36, from Volgorod, is believed to be living in Moscow, where several firms are registered in his name. He was identified by US investigators in 2023 as having been a member of Trickbot.Investigators now also believe he was at the helm of Conti and other blackmail groups, such as Royal and Blacksuit (founded in 2022). His own cryptowallet is said to be worth about €1bn.BKA said, along with international partners, of the 37 perpetrators they identified they had enough evidence to issue 20 arrest warrants.The US attorney’s office in California at the same time unsealed the details of charges against 16 defendants who allegedly “developed and deployed the DanaBot malware”.The criminal infiltrations into victims’ computers were “controlled and deployed” by a Russia-based cybercrime organisation that has infected more than 300,000 computers around the world particularly in the US, Australia, Poland, India and Italy.It was advertised on Russian-language criminal forums and also had an “espionage variant used to target military, diplomatic, government and non-governmental organisations” the indictment states.“For this variant, separate servers were established, such that data stolen from these victims was ultimately stored in the Russian federation.”Also on the Europe most-wanted list as a result of the German operation is a 36-year-old Russian-speaking Ukrainian, Roman Mikhailovich Prokop, a suspected member of Qakbot, according to BKA.Operation Endgame was instigated by the German authorities in 2022. The BKA president, Holger Münch, saidGermanywas a particular focus of cybercriminals.BKA in particular is investigating the suspected perpetrators’ involvement in gang-related activities and commercial extortion as well as membership of an overseas-based criminal organisation.Between 2010 and 2022 the Conti group focused specifically on US hospitals, increasing its attacks during the Covid pandemic. US authorities had offered a $10m reward to anyone who would lead them to its figureheads.Most suspects are operating in Russia, some also in Dubai. Their extradition to Europe or the US was unlikely, Münch said, but their identification was significant and damaging to them.“With Operation Endgame 2.0, we have once again demonstrated that our strategies work – even in the supposedly anonymous darknet.”Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeInternational criminal justiceInternetRussiaEuropeCanadaGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

Mars obsessives are flocking there – but some long-term locals are far from happyOliver LaughlandFri 23 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 05.51 EDTShareAlong a flat coastal highway in south-east Texas, surrounded by wetlands and open plains, the artefacts of a new American oligarchy appear in quick succession. Three towering rockets stand upright on the horizon. A fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks speeds by. A large mural of the Shiba Inu “doge” dog stares ahead, its arms crossed. There is a 4-metre-tall (12ft) bust of the world’s richest person, painted in bronze, facing a dusty roadside. “ELON aka MemeLord”, a plaque beneath reads. It’s not exactly romantic poetry, but the whole scene reminds me ofthe sonnet by Shelley: “Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!”While old Ozymandias may have seen his fiefdoms crumble, Elon Musk’s empire is possibly only just beginning. Here in Cameron County, on the southern tip of the Lone Star state, where Google Maps proudly displays the newly declared “Gulf of America” just offshore, Musk has situated his self-described mission to save humanity and populate Mars. Just a few miles from his painted bust is the Starbase industrial complex, a rocket-manufacturing facility and launch arena, which commands the vista for miles. It is also the site of the multibillionaire’s latest venture to acquire even more political power.Fresh from an extended stay in Washington as the de facto leader of the government-slashing,conflict-of-interest-riddled, so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), Muskhas returnedin time to see Starbase become its own city. We are here shortly before the vote, where there is little doubt that the 280 eligible voters (the vast majority of whom are employed by or connected to Musk’s space exploration company SpaceX) will approve the incorporation of a new, 4 sq km (1.6 sq mile) municipality.12:48How Elon Musk ‘colonised’ a corner of Texas to build his own space city - videoThere remain many questions about why the company, which did not respond to any of my written questions and interview requests, would move for such recognition. It brings limited local powers, including the ability to impose minor property taxes and grant building permits, as well as the mandate to create its own fire department and – to some alarm – police department. And yet, as the US lurches further into what many describe as an era of norm-shattering digital dystopia under the second presidency of Donald Trump, the goings-on here, in this remote enclave by the US-Mexico border, already bring a sense of grisly prescience.As we pull off the highway into the Starbase neighbourhood (Boca Chica village, before the vote), we are trailed almost instantly by two white security trucks with flashing yellow lights. We drive along the main residential drag, where dozens of shiny, silver Airstream trailers – housing forSpaceXstaff – sit in neat symmetry. We pass the newly renamed “Memes Street” (formerly it was Weems Street), marked with a black street sign accompanied by a small image of Musk’s pioneering Starship rocket.View image in fullscreenLocals on the beach before Starship’s third flight test last year.Photograph: Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesOn the adjacent LBJ Boulevard, lined with modest homes and customised Cybertrucks parked outside, we pass what isreportedlyMusk’s personal residence, a small bungalow winged by a high black fence. As I get out, I chat with the security guard who has trailed us for the past five minutes. He informs me with a smile that while the roads may be public, if I step on to the front lawns of any of the homes, he’ll seek to have me arrested. “It’s private property,” he says.Time to leave.While downtown Starbase may be a little averse to visitors, it’s a different story in the ranchlands outside. Muskfounded the facilityin late 2014, and its rapid expansion in recent years has drawn a small platoon of Mars obsessives to the area. A few miles away from the production site, at a staging location seen in the distance, a Starship rocket is preparing for a static engine test. Clouds of vapour cascade from the 170ft vehicle, and small groups of awestruck spectators congregate at intervals on the roadside.View image in fullscreenStreet signs in the Starbase neighbourhood are adorned with rocket ships and sophomoric jokes.Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The GuardianMany are livestreamers and photographers who document the minutiae of Starbase’s activities in extraordinary detail; surveying the serial numbers of components, the progress of launchpad construction and the particulars of planning documents, to assess when the next Starship launch is likely to take place.“When you’re standing here it’s a weird combination of the wild, wild west and the brand new future,” says a livestreamer named Caesar G, who works for an independent YouTube channel calledNASASpaceflight, which has 1.32 million subscribers. He’s focusing a long lens camera on the testing taking place a few miles away, arms flailing with excitement.“Take the politics out of everything,” he says. “This is the coolest thing that’s going on, engineering-wise. We are catching rockets!”While there is no doubt that the midair mechanical capture of a 232ft rocket booster,as happened here first in October of last year, is an extraordinary technological achievement, I do wonder how it is possible to distinguish it from politics, given the company’s owner is alsoaccused of making a fascist saluteduring Donald Trump’s second inauguration.View image in fullscreenAnthony Gomez, a manager of the Rocket Ranch campground: ‘There are asteroids floating around in space that can make the entire world wealthy.’Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The GuardianShaun Gisler, a self-described “aerospace histographer”, who is also livestreaming at the roadside, chimes in on this point. “He’s accused of a lot of things,” Gisler says. “A lot of that is just white noise. I’m looking at the result out here and I’m seeing success. We’re hoping this gets to a point where it becomes so big, it helps bridge the [political] gap.”The full engine test does not happen for another five hours, but both men are committed to waiting out in the humidity to film it.We drive a little farther inland to meet with Anthony Gomez, a manager of the Rocket Ranch campground, which caters to hundreds of travelling space tourists every year. Gomez moved here in 2021, abandoning his life in Florida to witness what he believes are the beginnings of a programme that will save humanity.We head to a viewing platform which commands an uninterrupted view of the launchpads and is fronted by a fire trench designed to protect visitors in the wake of a catastrophic rocket explosion. He wells up describing the feeling of watching a takeoff here. “Every cell and molecule is shaking with some form of elation,” he says. “It is overwhelming. It’s the apex of human technology. And when that thing takes off, somehowthatis communicated. Somehowthatinformation is delivered into your heart.”At the ranch, a cabin displays fragments of recovered Starship debris, and a large mural recreates Michelangelo’s ‘The Creation of Adam’, replacing God’s finger with one belonging to a Teslahumanoid robotnamed Optimus. We are meeting just days after a federal budget proposal by the Trump administration advancescrippling cuts to low-income housing assistancewhile greenlighting a$1bn investment in Mars programmes, which is likely to benefit Musk.View image in fullscreenVisitors surround the SpaceX Starship as it sits on a launch pad at Starbase last October.Photograph: Sergio Flores/AFP/Getty ImagesGomez, who does not identify as a Trump supporter, is unfazed by the apparent cronyism, arguing that homelessness is “the average human’s responsibility”, not that of the government. Plus, he argues, space exploration may one day allow us to retrieve gold- and platinum-encrusted asteroids to cure global poverty. “There are asteroids floating around in space that can make the entire world wealthy,” he claims. He acknowledges that the technology to receive such a planetary boon is probably centuries away, but argues that the new private space race should “give people a focus of hope”.It can be hard to unpick the politics here; a mixture of right-leaning libertarianism that feels largely mainstream, and visions of a tech utopia that seem more grounded in science fiction than reality. “If you want to take people to Mars, it’s going to include everyone on Earth,” Gomez says when I ask aboutMusk’s clear nods to white nationalism. “Why would you have any specific hate towards anybody?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How would astronauts be protected from cosmic radiation during the journey and while exploring the red planet? How would Starship refuel for a return trip? Can SpaceX even get Starship to orbit Earth in the first place? (The last two launches have ended inexplosive failure.)But perhaps the most pressing question is why humanity would want to spendtrillions of dollarson such a project while pervasive crises on Earth persist. You don’t need to look far in Cameron County to see this rammed home. This is a low-income, majority Latino community of just over 400,000 people,where almost a quarter of residents live below the poverty line.View image in fullscreenBrownsville resident Josette Cruz, who says her rent has significantly increased in the recent year.Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The GuardianIn the county’s main population hub, Brownsville, disdain for the Starbase facility and its impending city status seems to be the predominant view. While Musk’s foundation has madecharitable donations to the local school system and downtown revitalisation efforts, many people I speak to have seen little positive impact. Some complain that their homes shake during launches. Others say that the arrival of heavy industry has beaten up the county highways with little sign of repair. More object to ongoing gentrification.Josette Cruz, a local organiser and lifelong Brownsville resident, points to soaring housing costs associated with an influx of new residents tied to SpaceX expansion and increased tourism. Her rent, she says, has risen from $725 a month to an almost unaffordable $1,000 in just a few years. Realtor signs now spring up in her neighbourhood with images of cartoon rockets.“The fact that people can come here and say, ‘We’re going to have our own election, we’re going to build our own town’, what kind of mentality says that, if not one that is rooted in a colonial, settler mindset?” she says, shrugging. “They want to go to Mars to colonise it.”We take a trip back out past the Starbase facility to Boca Chica beach, a public state park just a few hundred feet from the Starship launch pads. The juxtaposition here is stark. Warnings not to disturb the nesting grounds of the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle are stationed across the beach entrance, framed by the giant launch pads and frantic construction work just metres away. In September last year SpaceXwas finedalmost $150,000 by the Environmental Protection Agency for spewing hundreds of thousands of gallons of polluted wastewater on to the surrounding wetlands after rocket launches. It is a charge the company has continued to deny.Using a low-income community for experimental rocket testing is another example of environmental racismWe meet local environmentalist Bekah Hinojosa, who in 2022was arrested by local policeover alleged involvement in the graffiti found on a Musk-sponsored mural in Brownsville. The three words, written in blue, read: “gentrified stop spaceX”. Hinojosa was apprehended in her pyjamas after plain-clothed officers arrived at her doorstep. Three years later, having pleaded not guilty to a class three misdemeanor, she is still awaiting a trial date.Like many generational residents, Hinojosa’s family have visited this beach for decades, coming to fish at the shoreline and enjoy the tranquillity. But every launch now means a beach closure, and many fear the incorporation of Starbase city will lead to further restrictions on access. “Using a low-income community for experimental rocket testing is another example of environmental racism,” she says, as a group of sandpiper birds paddle in the surf nearby. “Billionaires should not own a beach. We will continue speaking up because, for us, it’s about continuing to exist here.”View image in fullscreenA protest on Boca Chica beach, organised on the same day as the Starbase City vote.Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The GuardianJust coming down to the water’s edge can now feel like an act of resistance, it seems.The morning of the Starbase vote brings with it dark skies and torrential rain. We make a final trip to the complex and stand in the drizzle outside the polling station. It’s a cafeteria open only to SpaceX employees, but a small huddle of journalists seems to keep the security guards away this time.Most voters say they have been told by their employer not to talk to the press. But a stroke of luck allows us to meet one of the handful of residents who cast a ballot in opposition. She is one of the few hold-out residents, still living in a privately owned home on Memes Street. I can only imagine what it must be like to have your permanent address changed to a sophomoric joke.“I was here before SpaceX and I have no loyalty issues,” she says after casting her ballot and declining to be named. I ask how she feels about populating Mars. She grimaces and walks away.The vote ends uppassingby a majority of 212 to six. A 97% margin. The city’s new mayor,Robert Peden, is a SpaceX vice-president. He ran unopposed. Three days later the Federal Aviation Authority,an agency previously purged by Doge, approves an aggressive new SpaceX flight programme that will allow the company to quintuple its annual launches from five to 25.The next Starship is scheduled to take off later this week. Its hulking steel shell glistens in the rain as we drive away.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskSpaceSpaceXTexasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Does it add value or reflect YouTube’s increasing might?Fiona SturgesFri 23 May 2025 08.00 EDTShareIt is four in the afternoon at Pellicci’s, a family-run cafe on Bethnal Green Road in London that has been an East End institution for 125 years. Its famously loudmouthed owners, British-Italian siblings Nevio and Anna, have been serving fry-ups, soups, pasta and jam roly-polies since eight this morning. The cafe is now closed, but Anna and Nevio are just getting started on their second job as hosts of the podcast seriesDown the Caff, in which they interview people about food and life over a meal of the guest’s choosing. The conversations are sweary, chaotic and an absolute hoot.Their guests so far include actor and Pellicci’s regular Ray Winstone, Dexys’ Kevin Rowland, rapper Hak Baker and 86-year-old YouTuber Marge Keefe, AKA Grime Gran. Today’s interviewees are TikTok star John Fisher, AKA Big John, and his son, the boxer Johnny Fisher. When I tell Anna she must be due a lie down, she says: “Tell me about it. In fact, tell him!” pointing at their longsuffering producer George Sexton-Kerr, who is busy moving Formica tables around to make way for the film crew.Why the film crew, I hear you ask? Podcasts are for ears, not eyes, aren’t they? It’s because the past 18 months have brought a shift in how pods are consumed, with scores of shows moving into video. In February, YouTube announced it had 1 billion monthly users watching podcast content, meaning the platform has leapfrogged Spotify (which in 2023 reported 100 million regular podcast listeners) and Apple to become the market leader. Little wonder Spotify is trying to catch up, with many of its top podcasts, including TheJoe RoganExperience, The Mel Robbins Podcast and Call Her Daddy now publishing in video.This year, the BBC launched The Traitors: Uncloaked and Uncanny: Post Mortem in video as well as audio formats, while Business Insider has reported that Netflix is also preparing to move into visualised pods. Reflecting this trend, the British Podcast awards has this year added a new visual innovation award for “outstanding visual podcasting”. All of which means, like it or not, visualised podcasts – or vodcasts, as some are calling them – are happening.Speaking to both listeners and creators about this brave new audiovisual world, it seems opinions are divided. Dedicated audiophiles quite reasonably ask why they would want to watch a podcast when their TV to-watch list is already out of control, but others say they enjoy having a choice and it can be fun to see the hosts whose voices they know so well. I also spoke to several independent audio producers who don’t wish to be named, who worry about YouTube’s dominance over the industry and are sceptical of audio being restyled as “crap telly”.That’s not to say that visualised podcasts are expected to compete with mainstream TV: just as celebrity interviewer Amelia Dimoldenberg, the host of YouTube’s Chicken Shop Date, can exist alongside Graham Norton on the BBC, so can visualised pods exist in parallel with better resourced and produced television shows. Nonetheless, as a listener and podcast critic, I confess I too have reservations. For me, the delight of audio lies in the intimacy of having voices and soundscapes piped straight into my ears and sparking my imagination. Plus, I do most of my listening while doing other things such as cooking and walking the dog. The last thing I need is another form of entertainment that requires me to gape at a screen.Seeing fun, silly or serious stuff makes someone far more likely to hit Follow on the podcast appMatt DeeganI am, however, up for watching pods where the visuals have a clear purpose and Down the Caff, which launched last year, is absolutely one of those. Sexton-Kerr, a radio and pod producer who took two years to persuade Anna and Nevio to make the series, imagined it as an audiovisual package from the off. “I always wanted it to be a multifaceted thing. It’s partly about the food, and Anna and Nev, who are this brilliant double act. But it’s also about the beauty of just sitting in here over a cup of tea and having a chat. It’s a grade II-listed building with all this art deco panelling and you need to see that.”Nevio adds that, during the first couple of episodes, “Me and Anna didn’t know what we were doing, so it’s a lot of people shouting over each other. But we’ve got better, mainly because George has been telling us off. We’re thinking a bit more about how it will work [in audio and visual mediums] now.”When my producer friends talk about pods as “crap telly”, they are referring to interview pods and chat-casts that, in theory, lend themselves to a visual format. For productions such as Begin Again With Davina McCall, Fashion Neurosis With Bella Freud or Call Her Daddy, this means you see hosts and interviewees on TV sets arranged like fancy living rooms complete with coffee-table books and mood lighting.Often, though, it’s a camera squeezed into a sound booth or, worse, a crummy Zoom recording. One such offender isThe Rest Is Politics, the chart-topping series presented byRory Stewart and Alastair Campbell. Since the hosts are rarely in the same place, viewers invariably watch them in split screen, each beaming in fuzzily from their respective hotel rooms or home offices. Not for nothing did YouTube executive Pedro Pina recently say that The Rest Is Politics “feels like a high school [production]”, adding that “viewers determine the production values that they’re prepared to accept” – a polite way of saying that the show’s audience don’t care about quality.Matt Deegan, a partner at the podcast marketing company Podcast Discovery, says: “For some audiences it’s less about consuming a podcast and more about consuming ‘a show’. There are definitely younger audiences who don’t listen to audio podcasts but are very comfortable on YouTube.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

For a podcast looking to grow its audience, says Deegan, “the repetition of seeing fun, informative, silly or serious stuff from a show makes someone far more likely to hit Follow on their podcast app”. This is echoed by Sexton-Kerr, who notes: “We’re sticking minute-long Down the Caff reels up on Insta and TikTok and we’re getting more than 400,000 views on some of them. You can’t pay for that kind of publicity.”For interview pods, the benefit of video content is clear, not least because it’s straightforward to make. Turning a narrative podcast into a decent visual proposition is a far bigger challenge, though there are already podcasters giving it a go. George Mpanga (AKA George the Poet) and Benbrick, creators ofHave You Heard George’s Podcast?, the Peabody award-winning series about race, history and culture, are in the process of going back over their audio episodes and remaking them for a video audience.“We need to go where the audience is,” Benbrick explains. “Even if your strategy is audio-first, it is insane to leave out [YouTube]. And if you’re going there, you might as well give that content the best chance to resonate. It kind of feels you can do anything right now, so we’re trying it out and seeing what it could look like. I don’t think it’s in its final form yet.”Does all this spell doom for audio? While some in the industry worry that visualised content could further squeeze indie podcasters out of a crowded market, Benbrick believes it will create space “for productions that really consider their audio. With video content it’s hard to do really intricate audio work and, as a producer, I want what I put out to sound beautiful. This is a moment to make exceptional work.”Back at Pellicci’s, as Nevio plonks down two enormous platefuls of jam tart on our table, Sexton-Kerr says he is certain it will all shake out. “It’s like that song Video Killed the Radio Star, isn’t it? But we still have radio stars. I have podcasts that I still love listening to, so I think there’s space for both. They’ll just live next door to each other.”Explore more on these topicsPodcastsYouTubeSpotifyVideo on demandDigital music and audiofeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s an architectural puzzler in which you explore a transforming mansion left to you by an eccentric relative. The place is filled with secrets, and whenever you reach a door you get to pick the room on the other side from a handful of options. The whole game is a rumination on houses and how we live in them. Nostalgic and melancholic, it feels designed to make us look harder at what surrounds us.The Edison mansion, Maniac MansionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Lucasfilm GamesThis Addams’-style Queen Anne with clapboard facades and dark windows is a classic haunted house, reportedly inspired by theSkywalker Ranch. The great twist of this early LucasArts adventure is that all kinds of spooky things are happening, but the fiends and monsters you meet are often surprisingly charming – the odd hamster-in-a-microwave incident aside. Maybe not a great place to live, but these guys would make memorable neighbours.Spencermansion, Resident EvilView image in fullscreenPhotograph: CapcomNestled amid the foreboding Arklay mountains outside Raccoon City, the Spencer mansion is what would have happened if the murderer from the Saw movies had become an architect. This vast country pile in theSecond Empire styleis lusciously adorned with oil paintings, antique furniture and hidden rooms. However, any potential buyers should know it’s essentially a vast trap, filled with puzzles and monsters, designed to kill anyone wanting to investigate the massive bio-research facility beneath it.Finchhouse, What Remains of Edith FinchView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Giant SparrowBased onGoose Creek Tower in Alaska, Finch house is a monument to the doomedfamily who once lived there, which explains why the bedrooms are sealed off like museum exhibits. Floors are piled up haphazardly and navigating the interior can feel like moving through the transformations of a pop-up book. Living here would be fascinating, but you’d need good joints, what with all the stairs. On the plus side, the bookcases are filled with works such as Gravity’s Rainbow, Slaughterhouse-Five and House of Leaves, so you’d get to catch up on your postmodernist reading.The mansion, Jet Set WillyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: YouTubeOne of thegreat video-game homes, this strange mansion is left in disarray after an almighty booze-up. The rooms feel very much like a lurid hangover, incorporating stomping boots, chomping toilet seats and at one point, an entire tree. What makes this classic platformer so haunting is the juxtaposition of domesticity and surreal horror. The bedroom is out of bounds and the refrigerator threatens to extend for miles. Oh, and there’s an entrance to Hades on the floorplan.Island cottage, Animal Crossing: New HorizonsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: NintendoNintendo’s dreamydeconstruction of capitalismis so close to being a doll’s house for adults that it makes sense that you get your own home to decorate. Beyond choosing the wallpaper and adding just the right indoor plants, you also have an option to fill the air with recordings of music performed by a local dog. This sounds childlike, but the compulsion to refine layouts feels like a very middle-aged kind of obsession, and in one of many brutal lunges at realism, you don’t even get to enter your house without first being handcuffed to a gigantic mortgage.Snowpeakruins, Zelda: Twilight PrincessView image in fullscreenPhotograph: NintendoWhat’s your favourite Zelda dungeon? Allow us to make the case for Snowpeak ruins, from the slightlyunder-loved Twilight Princess. There have been better puzzles in Zelda, and better rewards for beating a boss, but this cosy getaway high in the mountains is easily the most warmly domestic space in the entire series. It’s not just down to the warmth radiating from the many hearths or the juxtaposition to the icy chill outside. It’s the presence of two gentle Yetis, wandering around despite your dramatic arrival, tending to bubbling pots of stew.Croft Manor, Tomb RaiderView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Square EnixLara Croft’scountry housemay have started as a place for the games to tuck away a tutorial section, but the Manor quickly evolved into a vital part of the series’ appeal. Croft isn’t just gymnastic and deadly, she’s absolutely minted. Her house is filled with the strangely proportioned rooms you often got when PS1 games ventured indoors, and there’s often a hedge maze alongside a gymnasium. Croft has a room just for her harpsichord! And she has a butler who’s happy to wearily plod along behind her and endure an eternity locked in the freezer.Luigi’s MansionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: NintendoLuigi’s Mansionwas the first game to give either one of Nintendo’s plumbers much in the way of a personality. It’s tempting to argue that’s because Luigi’s thrown in among ordinary domestic clutter here, rather than being let loose to jump and dance through worlds of colourful whimsy. The mansion in question may be filled with ghosts, but it’s also filled with bookshelves, hallway carpeting, light fixtures and a decent-sized kitchen. It’s the perfect place for the ever-roving Marioverse to settle down for a moment and offer a sustained depiction of a single place.The lighthouse, Beyond Good and EvilView image in fullscreenPhotograph: MobygamesJade is a photojournalist rather than a soldier, exploring a fantasy world that’s based on Europe rather than the US or Japan. No wonder, then, that instead of a mansion or hi-tech HQ, she gets tolive in a lighthouseon the misty shores of a quiet water world. The lighthouse doubles as a refuge and orphanage, and it’s a delight to spot the little details the designers have included, whether it’s the chummy mess in the living spaces, or the crayon drawings on the woodwork.Botany ManorView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Whitethorn GamesPlayers are drawn to Botany Manor by the puzzles, which revolve around uncovering the conditions required to allow a series of flowers to grow and thrive. But the space itself is arguably the thing that draws everyone back until the game is complete. Here is a version of early 20th-century English elegance pitched somewhere between the worlds of Jeeves and Flora Poste. The colours and sense of expectant stillness, meanwhile, could come from a piece of Clarice Cliff Bizarre Ware pottery.The Carnovasch Estate, PhantasmagoriaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: SierraWhen novelist Adrienne Delaney moves into this remote New England property seeking inspiration, she loves the giant fireplaces, labyrinthine corridors and authentic gothic chapel but isn’t so keen on the presence of a wife-murdering demon intent on decapitating, stabbing or squashing residents to death.

Why aren’t Gazans being protected in the same way?Fri 23 May 2025 14.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 14.01 EDTShareOn 20 May, the secretary-general for humanitarian affairs at the United Nations stated that 14,000 babies would bedeadunless the blockade was lifted immediately. The day before, the former Knesset member Moshe Feiglinsaid: “Every child inGazais the enemy.” And now, world leaders in the UK and Francethreatenvague “concrete actions” ifIsrael“does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid”. But undefined “concrete actions” are woefully insufficient. To those leaders I say: Gaza’s children cannot eat statements.Bezalel Smotrich,the Israeli finance minister,declared last week:“We are destroying everything in Gaza, the world isn’t stopping us.” So let’s say what must be said, without apology: military intervention to defend Gaza is not only justified – it is required. It is humanitarian. It is overdue. Israel must be stopped.A no-fly zone must be set up around Gaza to prevent further aerial bombing; and a coalition of willing states should come together to form a corridor to 1) end Israel’s colonial mechanism that is set totake 65%of Gaza’s land and 2) allow for the immediate dispersal of humanitarian aid. Military intervention should not merely be aimed at pausing the killing – it should be used to protect Palestinians’ right to exist as a people, with dignity, sovereignty and full unconditional control over their land and futures.The Guardian view on the calls to save Gaza: Palestinians need deeds, not words | EditorialRead moreThe latest UN announcement about the risk to Gazan babies follows others from the Israeli prime minister’s office that make Israel’s intention to destroy Gaza unmistakably clear. On the recommendation of the Israeli army, theysaidthey would allow in a “basic amount of food” to the south of Gaza – but not out of mercy, not to save lives. The stated reason: to prevent famine from undermining the coming ground invasion, to clear space for “intense fighting”. In other words, aid would be permitted only to fuel further ethnic cleansing. Food not as relief, but as relocation. Nutrition as a tool for displacement. Netanyahu claimed that international pressure, including from pro-Israel Republican senators and the White House, required the appearance of humanitarian intervention. “Our best friends in the world – senators I know as strong supporters of Israel – have warned that they cannot support us if images of mass starvation emerge,” hesaid.Israel recognizes that their mass extermination can only continue as long as world leaders are able to forego any criticism for allowing starvation, they allow the world to absolve their guilt so long as Gazans can be bombed with quarter-full stomachs. But world leaders cannot claim ignorance now. After all, Netanyahugavehis Amalek speech on 28 October 2023, in which he said the “entire people” of Gaza are “an evil” and that Israel is “committed to eradicating this evil from the world”. Intentions were always clear.It came days after thelaunchof Operation Gideon’s Chariots, a military campaign named after a biblical flood. The leaflets dropped over Gaza showed parted waters swallowing buildings, the Star of David glowing like a weapon. A “righteous conquest”, they called it. This is not subtle. This is a manufactured to make genocide look like a holy war. It is genocide marketed as prophecy. And still, no western leader has intervened to stop this madness.But here we are. Counting the dead and then doubting them. Watching 61,700 people be exterminated while the world argues about food trucks. And still – still – they tell us that help is coming. That humanitarian aid is arriving. That the system is working.Let’s be honest. Humanitarian aid is not arriving. Law is not arriving. The only thing arriving in Gaza is morebombs.What did you do during the genocide in Gaza? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreWe have tried the petitions. We have written the letters. We triedpeaceful protests and encampments. We have submitted the evidence. We have watched the Geneva conventions recited like prayer, while their every clause is violated. We have waited for the ICC to act while the United States rushesmore weaponsto the border. We have watched food convoysbombed, aid workersexecuted, newbornsstarved. We are not unreasonable. We are simply not willing to die politely.Military intervention is not some imperial fantasy we borrow from the west. It is a mechanism built into the very structure of international law.Article Iof the genocide convention requires states not only to punish genocide but to prevent it. The responsibility to protect doctrine (R2P), adopted in 2005 by every member of the United Nations, asserts that when a state is “manifestly failing” to protect its population – or, as in our case, actively trying to destroy it – other states are obligated to intervene, not encouraged, obligated.And yes, there is precedent. In Kosovo, Natointervenedin 1999 after mass killings and the threat of further ethnic cleansing. In East Timor, a multinational forcedeployedto halt atrocities committed by militias supported by the Indonesian army. In Libya, security council resolution 1973authorizedmilitary action “to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas under threat of attack”. Each time, the world acknowledged that force was the only viable form of protection. That sovereignty could not shield slaughter. That delay meant graves.So why not now? Why not for Palestinians? Is it that our children starve too quietly? That our bodies do not make for good television? Is it because the bombs are labeled “Made in America”?No one is asking for occupation. No one is asking for invasion in the name of oil, democracy or flags. We are asking for survival. We are asking for the same intervention that has been carried out for others when the death toll passed a certain threshold.Gazais not asking to be exceptional. Gaza is asking not to be abandoned.Military intervention is not violence – it is what stops violence. It is not the failure of law – it is its fulfillment. And it is the last remaining form of aidIsraelhas not managed to bomb, blockade or twist into a weapon of war. Airdropping rice into craters is not aid. Aid is removing the cause of the starvation. Aid is opening the checkpoints, not filming them. Aid is armored vehicles securing corridors for ambulances that no longer have to lie about their destinations to avoid being blown apart. Aid is ending the killing – not watching it with subtitles.If aid doesn’t enter Gaza now, 14,000 babies may die. UN peacekeepers must step in | Michael FakhriRead moreBecause at some point, the diplomatic language stops sounding like caution and starts sounding like complicity. And if the people who write the laws will not enforce them, then we must conclude what Palestinians have always suspected: international law is an illusion and one not meant for us.Before October 2023, I never thought I would see a father carrying the parts of his son in a bag. I never thought I’d hear a child whisper from beneath rubble, her voice small, her terror enormous: “Come get me.” I never thought I’d watch families burn in white tents outside bombed hospitals, or find toddlers swollen from hunger in the arms of mothers too weak to weep. I never thought I’d see doctors stitch wounds without anesthesia, perform amputations with kitchen knives, sterilize blades with cigarette lighters. I never thought I’d live through the genocide of my people was broadcast live – and still called “complicated”.But if there is still a use for law, if there is still any value to the wordhumanitarian, then act like it. The last aid left is force. Gaza cannot wait any longer.Ahmad Ibsais is a first-generation Palestinian American, law student and poet who writes the newsletter State of SiegeExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warOpinionGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuUnited NationscommentShareReuse this content"

Soon afterwards, Russia’s Sputnik service began broadcasting on the frequency left vacant in Lebanon. That detail illuminates a larger picture. China, Russia and others see global-facing media as central to their global ambitions and are investing accordingly – pumping out propaganda to muddle or drown out objective, independently minded journalism. These outlets are state-controlled as well as state-owned.Meanwhile, conspiracy theories and disinformation proliferate online,attacks on press freedom intensifyand the Trump administration isdismantling media organisationsincluding Voice of America and Radio Free Asia (RFA), which have been essential sources of information for audiences under repressive regimes. Official Chinese mediawere gleefulat what RFA’s president, Bay Fang, called “a reward to dictators and despots”.The BBC World Service, and its accurate reporting borne of deep knowledge of places, has rarely been needed more. At its best it is a beacon of truth in times of war and crisis, as well aslife-transforming for listenersin a myriad less dramatic ways. Yet it is already scrabbling to compete with lavishly funded foreign rivals for both audiences and resources. The government boosted its contribution for 2025-26, but is now asking the BBC toidentify tens of millions of pounds’ worth of cutsover the next few years. Since 2014, the World Service has been primarily funded by the licence fee. But the government contribution is mostly funded from official development assistance, which Sir Keir Starmeris slashingto increase defence spending. Even an alternative budget, with funding remaining flat in cash terms, would make deep cuts inevitable when global inflation is running at well over 4%.The World Service faces tricky decisions too. Most future users are unlikely to come via radio, but shortwave services remain central in some areas and can reach listeners even when internet access is cut. The decision to axe Arabic radio services looked all the more ill-judged in light of wars in Gaza andSudan. Bosses are struggling to balance the competing demands to constrain spending, ensure reach and maintain standards of quality and depth. One current pilot is alow-budget model in Polish, which will mostly repurpose existing BBC journalism.In the long run, the BBC argues that the governmentshould fully resumeWorld Service funding. That sounds more like a negotiating position than a serious prospect. What is absolutely clear is that it needs more money to compete, not less, and a long-term settlement. Its authority depends on the capacity and institutional memory it has established, and the fact that it is not seen to respond to the imperatives of the government of the day: it represents national values, not a politician’s fiat. Those are all imperilled when it must battle over money year by year. Once weakened, it will not easily recover.Research conducted for the BBC found it to be the UK’s most recognised cultural export internationally – ahead of the Premier League and British universities. Its hundreds of millions of usersare more likely to favour the UK, as well as more likely to support democracy. The World Service is a precious and irreplaceable asset. The former UN secretary general Kofi Annanonce described itas “perhaps Britain’s greatest gift to the world” in the 20th century. But the giver enjoys rich returns, and would be foolish to squander them.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We should follow their exampleFri 23 May 2025 10.05 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 14.13 EDTShareThe next time a breathless news anchor talks about the prospect of a war-ending “deal”, with Ukraine “ceding land for peace”, I want to sit them down with Adeline. In Lviv last week, Adeline showed me on her phone map her lost home in Russian-occupied Nova Kakhovka, just across the Dnipro River from the Ukrainian-liberated territory around Kherson. Look, she said, with tears welling up in her eyes, here on this satellite snapshot you can see the ecological disaster that followedRussia’s destructionof the Kakhovka dam in 2023. And here’s the place where she dreamed of setting up a small art gallery. “Why should I give up on my home?” she cried. Why indeed.The territory occupied byRussiais the size of Portugal and Slovenia combined. It’s difficult to get accurate figures, but perhaps some 5 million people live there, while at least another 2 million refugees from those territories are now elsewhere. Inside the occupied territories, Ukrainians face brutal repression and systematic Russification. Outside, refugees like Adeline are left with only their memories, old photographs and the keys to lost homes. We should not whitewash this monstrous ongoing crime of occupation with the soothing words “land for peace”.No one in Ukraine believes that any “deal” will end the war for good, even if negotiations eventually produce a fragile ceasefire. It’s not just “land” that Russia has taken by brutal conquest; it’s the homes, family histories, lives and livelihoods of millions of individual men, women and children. Ukraine is not “ceding” territory any more than I “cede” my car if a criminal steals it and I can’t get it back. Above all, this will not be peace. A just peace, with Adeline going home following the liberation of all Ukrainian territory, reparations being paid by Russia andVladimir Putinon trial in The Hague, is unachievable in the foreseeable future. But anything seriously meriting the label “peace” requires the achievement of durable military security, economic recovery, political stability and European integration for the roughly four-fifths of its sovereign territory that Ukraine still controls. That will take years.No one wants peace more than the Ukrainians. Obviously Volodymyr Zelenskyy must try to keep Donald Trump on side, so the American bully doesn’t completely sell Ukraine out to Putin. In recent polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, only 29% of Ukrainians said they could accept Trump’s peace plan but 51% could live with the alternative plan proposed by European leaders. What all Ukrainians know is that, even as the world talks of peace, Russia has continued launching massive drone and missile attacks against them. Meanwhile, the emissary whom Putin dispatched to Russo-Ukrainian talks in Istanbul, Vladimir Medinsky, harked back to the great northern war of 1700-21,telling the Ukrainian delegation: “We fought Sweden for 21 years. How long are you ready to fight?”So the real issue is whether Ukraine can continue to defend itself and build up its long-term resilience, with increased support from Europe to compensate for vanishing support from the US. The most encouraging conversations I had in Kyiv were with people engaged in the defence industry. Ukraine now leads the world in theinnovative developmentand manufacture of drones, with more than 2m produced last year. It could do even better if more partner countries followed Denmark’s example andgave contracts directlyto Ukrainian arms manufacturers. Its biggest problem is the shortage of fresh recruits. One frontline commander told me he now has adequate arms and ammunition, but his battalion is only at 30% manpower strength. In the east, he said, there are empty trenches defended only by drones.Russia seems to be planning new ground offensives, but western military experts thinkUkrainecan continue to defend most of the territory it currently controls. Gradually, it can build up ways to fend off the Russians at sea (where it’s already successful), on land (with a drone-enforced “virtual wall” and deep strikes behind Russian lines) and, most challenging of all, in the air. With the advent of the new German chancellor Friedrich Merz, plus the somewhat unexpected Churchillism of the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, Europe’s “coalition of the willing” is strong. The most useful thing it can plan for is not “boots on the ground” but multilayered aerial defence to create a sky shield over the western half of the country.The three military essentials still needed from the US are its intelligence capabilities (very hard to replace), US-made Patriot air-defence interceptors (the only ones totake down Russia’s ballistic missiles), and large quantities of 155mm ammunition (although Europe is stepping up on that). If Trump can be persuaded not to block those three, Ukraine can survive with increased European support. Then, especially if Europe can also ratchet up economic sanctions on Russia, the squeeze could slowly become tighter on Moscow than on Kyiv. At some point, even Putin may begin to think it was time to stop the hot phase of this war, accept a ceasefire “line of control” and command his domestic propaganda machine to declare a famous victory. Nothing in this scenario is certain, and Putin’s regime may no longer be able to risk peace, but this is the least unrealistic path to ending the largest war in Europe since 1945.Trump has brought Ukraine-Russia peace talks back to square one – just where Putin wants them | Olga ChyzhRead moreUkraine would immediately face daunting new challenges. How to preserve the national unity of wartime when the guns fall silent? How to reintegrate more than 3 million veterans? When to hold an election and how to ensure it’s free and fair? The Ukrainian politics will be messy and full of recrimination, against each other and the west. Putin, for whom politics is the continuation of war by other means, will have ample opportunities to stir the pot, fostering acrimony and division.Meanwhile, Europe’s attention could rapidly turn away, as it did from Bosnia after theDayton accordsin 1995. Virtually all Ukraine’s non-military budget is today funded by international support. Hundreds of billions more euros will be needed before a reconstructed economy can acquire its own dynamism. From Portugal to Poland, Europe’s surging populists will tell voters they shouldn’t go on footing this bill. Only if Merz swings his weight behind confiscating Russia’s frozen assets will that kind of money be found.Earlier this month, four European leaderstravelled to Kyivthe day after what in English is known as VE (Victory in Europe) Day, marking the total defeat of Nazi Germany. Alas, there will be no simple, single VU (Victory in Ukraine) Day, marking the total defeat of Putin’s Russia. A durable peace won’t come any time soon, and certainly not from some hasty, unbalanced deal. Only if both Ukraine and Europe have the foresight, stamina and unity for a long struggle may something genuinely deserving of the name of peace be achieved by the end of this decade.Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionEuropeRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinDonald TrumpUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

It was his “gotcha!” moment after four months of relentless social media attacks, executive orders, boycotts, and threats of economic and diplomatic sanctions.As the video played, a smug Trump claimed it was proof of “white genocide” inSouth Africaand mumbled: “It’s a terrible sight, never seen anything like it.”It was all lies. The crosses in the video did not mark actual graves. It was a memorial made in September 2020 after two white people were killed on their farm a week earlier. The crosses were meant to represent farmers who had been killed over the years. The idea that it is “genocide” has beendebunked so many timesover the past 10 years that it is extraordinary that the US president is not ashamed to repeat it in public. The state department under Trump released areportin late 2020 pointing out that, according to official South African statistics for the 2018-2019 period, “farm killings represented only 0.2 percent of all killings in the country (47 of 21,022)”.Ramaphosa withstood Trump’s bizarre ambush – but he let down South Africans | Zanele MjiRead moreSo here we have a man who has the mighty US state department, the wily Central Intelligence Agency and numerous other resources at his beck and call to help him discern the truth, relying on a badly made propaganda video sourced from aracist, rightwing, anonymous South African X account. Instead of embarrassing Ramaphosa on Wednesday, Trump merely illustrated just how low the US has fallen.His poorly produced Oval Office show, taken with the 28 Februaryattempt to humiliateUkraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, demonstrates that the country is now run by a man so steeped in discredited online conspiracy theories, so uncritical in his thinking, so poor in his grasp of global affairs, so careless in his exercise of power, that it is incredible that he is one of the most powerful figures in the world today. Such a figure’s power heralds instability and even danger for the world.The ambush of Ramaphosa is therefore not just spectacle. It is illumination. It underlines and emphasizes that Trump’s US is a fact-free, science-free, reality-television production lot whose leader daily defies court orders, alienates supporters of democracy, and tries to dismantle key practices such as the right to due process. It is an ugly place in which facts mean nothing and lies reign supreme.I was born under apartheid and lived under that heinous system until it was defeated in 1994. Those first 24 years were lived in Pretoria, in an impoverished village just an hour from Musk’s sumptuous family mansion in the suburb of Waterkloof. When I was teenager I walked the streets of Musk’s suburb, working as a “garden boy” or caddie, constantly harassed by police asking for my “pass book” – papers allowing me to be in the area designated “whites only”.I know apartheid. I grew up with it, breathed it and lived it every day. It is sickening to hear Trump compare the free, non-racist, democratic country that is South Africa today to the violent, murderous, hateful, system declared a “crime against humanity” by the United Nations in 1966.I know South Africa. I grew up in its brutal, cruel, divided past. I thrived in its hopeful democracy. I was one of the chroniclers of itspolitical descent in the 2010sas its institutions came under assault from a leader with anti-democratic instincts. I visited my mother there last week. There is no genocide in South Africa. Yet, Trump recently posted on hisTruth Socialthat he would not visit South Africa for the G20 summit when “white genocide” was happening there. Just more than 430,000 Americansvisited South Africa in 2023, up 37.4% from 2022. I know of not a single one who can point to a genocide happening in the country.This is the president of the United States peddling lies.One is therefore not surprised by the numerous assaults on the American constitution by this administration. The kidnapping of student activists, the trampling upon of citizens’ constitutional rights, the assaults on institutions such as the judiciary, the shamelessness ofpoliticians and their families and croniesenriching themselves – all this is typical of these kinds of corrupt regimes.What is going on in America? Kseniia Petrova, the Harvard Medical School researcherheld for monthsin Louisiana for failing to declare samples of frog embryos she had carried from France at the request of her boss,toldthe New York Times: “I feel like something is happening generally in America … Something bad is happening. I don’t think everybody understands.”Petrova, who fled Putin’s murderous regime as darkness fell over Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, understands the profound cloud hanging over the US. Those of us who grew up in regimes such as apartheid understand this ominous period.Trump’s actions are scary enough. It is, however, the silence of the US asassaults on American constitutional principlesunfold that is most disturbing.This is not a lament for SouthAfricaand how badly it is being treated by the US. It is a lament for myself, for those of us who grew up under systems such as apartheid believing that the US would uphold the rule of law, stand up for truth and speak up for these principles, and for a better world. A monarchical Trump, defying the supreme court and abandoning fact-based decision-making, imperils it all. With every student bundled by masked men into a van, this vaunted republic becomes smaller, lesser. It becomes Putin’s Russia, it becomes something akin to the way I lived under apartheid – a place where a contrarian thought led to detention without trial, to disappearance and for many, to death.There was a telling moment in Wednesday’s interaction when Trump revealed himself. It was a moment which reminded one that corruption, or the smell of it, now sits in the White House. Trump had just referred to a reporter as a “jerk” and an “idiot” because he had confronted him about why he wasaccepting the “gift”of a jet from Qatar to use as Air Force One.The Guardian view on the US and South Africa: Trump looks to his base and partners look elsewhere | EditorialRead more“Why did a country give an airplane to the United States air force? So they could help us out, because we need an Air Force One,” Trump fumed.Ramaphosa quipped: “I’m sorry I don’t have a plane to give you.”Trump didn’t detect the disdain in Ramaphosa’s voice and doubled down on the corruption inherent in accepting such a gift.“I wish you did. I would take it. If your country offered the United States air force a plane, I would take it,” Trump said.And there was the emperor, naked: an unethical leader who worships the dollar and has no concept of how corrupt his actions look to the rest of the world. This is what Wednesday was all about: an America led by a man susceptible to lies and lacking in a moral centre.Wednesday was not about South Africa. It was all about America today.Justice Malala is a political commentator and author of The Plot To Save South Africa: The Week Mandela Averted Civil War and Forged a New NationExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionSouth AfricaCyril RamaphosaAfricaUS politicsUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Republicans will have to answer for itFri 23 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 06.01 EDTShareIf you can bear to hear it, there are still more than 1,300 days remaining in the Trump administration. That’s an interminably long time given all the havoc the president has been able to wreak since January alone; the chaos and cruelty of the term so far also happen to have used up his political capital remarkably quickly. The New York Timesaverageof polls, which found him at 52% approval on inauguration day, had him at 51% disapproval on Wednesday. That collapse is less a problem for Trump specifically ⁠– assuming, perhaps optimistically, that he won’t appear on a ballot again ⁠– than it is for the Republican party, which will have to answer for the mess he’s made in next year’s midterms and beyond. And one of the challenges they seem likely to face is a changed public opinion landscape on immigration ⁠– a strength that Trump’s barbarism, just as in his first term, seems to be turning into a liability.While it remains his strongest issue, polls have shown the public’s confidence in Trump on immigration declining steadily since January ⁠–averagessuggestthe public is newly and evenly split on his handling of it and some polls taken around the 100-day mark even foundanoutrightmajorityof Americans disapproving. It’s no mystery why. The shock-and-awe campaign the administration is waging against immigrants legal and not has produced a steady stream of headlines that sound awful to all but Stephen Miller and the nativist fanatics driving Trump’s agenda. Thedeportationof a four-year-old citizen suffering from a rare form of cancer. The end of temporary protected status for9,000 Afghan refugeeseven as the administration welcomesAfrikanerssupposedly fleeing “white genocide”, a myth most voters who don’t frequent white supremacist forums are probably unfamiliar with. The use of the immigration enforcement apparatus to pursue and persecute critics of Israel’s war in Gaza. Even as voters succumbed to a panic over the migrant surge under Biden, moves like this under Trump and a public backlash to them were inevitable.What should be especially dismaying to the president’s supporters ⁠– and especially heartening to the rest of us ⁠– is the administration’s absolute failure to win over the public on the Kilmar Ábrego García case. That battle was probably lost as soon as it wasconcededthat he was deported by mistake, but it’s notable that none of the efforts to muddy the waters and obfuscate the main issues at hand with lies and character assassination have worked. The escalatory rhetoric ⁠– Ábrego García is not an innocent man but a member of MS-13, not merely a member of MS-13 but one of “the top MS-13 members”, not merely one of “the top MS-13 members” but aterrorist⁠– has been almost comic. The complaints thatthe mediahas been stretching the facts of the case have been pathetic. “Based on the sensationalism of many of the people in this room,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, fumed last month, “you would think we deported a candidate for father of the year”.The administration was surely pleased when the domestic violence claims made by Ábrego García’s wife several years ago, which she dismisses now, began picking up traction in the press. And it is just as surely disappointed thata majorityof Americans believe Ábrego García should be returned to America anyway ⁠– which suggests that the principles at stake in the case matter more and matter to more people than cynics might assume. Wholly irrespective of who Ábrego García is ⁠or what he might have done – and there remains no solid evidence at all that he belongs to MS-13 – he is entitled to due process under the law and fair treatment by our government. The fact that many Americans remain committed to this ideal here ⁠– despite the president’s best efforts to render Ábrego García unsympathetic, despite all that’s been done to frame undocumented immigration as an invasion and a society-breaking crisis ⁠– is one of the brightest glimmers of light against the pall Donald Trump and the right have cast over this country.Bright as it is, there are Democrats who are determined not to see it. Infamously inAxioslast month, one anonymous House member ⁠– some nameless, brainless invertebrate, croaking from the bottom of a boot ⁠– warned the party against defending immigrants like Ábrego García or the makeup artist Andry Hernández Romero, also deported as a gang member for having tattoos. Trump, they said, was “setting a trap for the Democrats, and like usual we’re falling for it […] we’re going to go take the bait for one hairdresser”. In an appearance on Fox News Radio, the Democratic congressman Henry Cuellararguedthat Ábrego García, in particular, was “not the right case” for Democrats to take up. “This is not the right issue to talk about due process,” he said. “This is not the right person to be saying that we need to bring him back to the United States.”Fortunately, most Americans disagree. And there is an opportunity here, for those with the good sense and courage to take it, to use the public’s dismay at the Ábrego García case and the realities of Trump’s immigration agenda to sell it on an alternative vision for our immigration policy and an alternative set of culprits for the problems immigrants have proven easy scapegoats for.Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents supposedly on the prowl for the thugs and thieves who’ve ruined communities and degraded our public infrastructure would be better off kicking down the doors of Congress thansmashing the windowsof asylum seekers. And, of course, if preserving law and order means that criminals who are sucking our public resources dry and who pose a danger to women ought to be dealt with harshly, we should insist on bringing the convict, grifter, and accused rapist in the White House to justice. The chief priority of his administration is terrorizing people for committing the crime of coming to this country and working harder for it than he ever has. His agenda here is corrosive to our values. It is degrading to our society. It materially profits no one. In important ways, it hurts us all.More and more Americans are wising up to this. Fewer and fewer are willing to stand for it.Osita Nwanevu is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionDonald TrumpMigrationRepublicansUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But vanishingly few can see itFri 23 May 2025 12.56 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 13.52 EDTShareIsat this week with Hussein Agha, a man who has given his working life to seeking peace between Israelis and Palestinians, negotiating from the Palestinian side of the table. He was gloomier than I have ever seen him, adamant that peace between the two sides can never, ever come. Because, Agha explained, this conflict was not about mere lines on a map or forms of words, the goods in which diplomats trade. This was about emotions, and specifically hatreds. Hatreds that, he feared, are becoming too murderous to contain. “It’s biblical,” he said.What he had in mind was the fury that drove Hamas to slaughter around 1,200 Israelis on a sleepy Saturday morning nearly 20 months ago and the fury that has driven the government of Benjamin Netanyahu to bombard Gaza ever since,killing more than 50,000, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry, and, over the last 80 days,denying foodto those who remain. He fears that the hatreds that fuelled these events, and that are fuelled by them, will grow larger and more venomous until nothing and no one is left. The whole land shall be laid waste and made desolate.A biblical rage is one that devours all reason. It is blinding. It prevents those who are gripped by it from seeing anything other than their own side. It prevents them holding two apparently opposed thoughts in their minds, even when both are true. Take, as an example, two statements we can make about the events of this week.Israel’s use of hunger as a weapon of war, keeping humanitarian aid out of Gaza for some 11 weeks, is a morally indefensible act that has, rightly, outraged the world. The partial lifting of the blockade supplies the tiniest fraction of what is needed and represents, by Netanyahu’s own admission, the“minimal” amount he can get away withto keep US political support. That is a fact.View image in fullscreenPalestinians gather outside a charity kitchen in Gaza City to receive limited food rations, 18 May 2025.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAThe deadly assault on the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington DC on Wednesday night was a morally indefensible act that lefttwo young people dead. The pair were staffers at the Israeli embassy, but all the evidence suggests they were struck at random. Even if he was heard chanting “Free Palestine” or “I did it for Gaza”, the gunman’s target was a Jewish institution filled with Jews. That makes it an antisemitic act. That too is a fact.And yet, people struggle to hold both facts at once. They fear that by acknowledging one, they will somehow weaken the force of the other. Some seized on the killings in Washington to downplay the killings in Gaza; others did the reverse.In the first category were those who used the deaths of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim to argue that even to speak about the agony currently inflicted on Gaza by Israel is to incite terrorism. That was the move made by Netanyahu himself, a man never slow to exploit Jewish suffering for his own narrow political purposes. Earlier in the week, France, Canada and the UK had joined together todenounce Israel’s escalating offensivein Gaza and especially its policy of hunger, described in March by Israel’s defence minister as one of the country’s “main pressure levers” against Hamas. The shootings in DC gave Netanyahu an opening to hit back.“I say to President Macron, Prime Minister Carney and Prime Minister Starmer, when mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you’re on the wrong side of justice,”the Israeli PM said,before deploying a phrase once favoured by the left:“You’re on the wrong side of history.”View image in fullscreenMourners attend a vigil outside the White House to honour Israel embassy staff members Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, 22 May 2025.Photograph: Leigh Vogel/UPI/ShutterstockHis argument amounts to the claim, often made, that those who draw attention to the consequences of Israeli policy are guilty of “delegitimising” Israel. It does not occur to Netanyahu or his allies that what might undermine Israeli legitimacy in the eyes of a watching world is not the condemnation of Israel’s actions, or the reporting of them, but the actions themselves.Again, two statements, apparently in tension, can be true at the same time. Journalists whothis week demandedthat Israel and Egypt make Gaza accessible to international news organisations were right to do so: the facts need to be known. Those facts, once known, may well drive people into a state of rage – even murderous rage – which is why they have to be handled with scrupulous care.And so, the UN humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, has been right to be clear and full-throated in his demands for Israel tolet food and medicine into Gaza, but was wrong to suggest that 14,000 babies in Gaza would die within 48 hours – a statement thatlater had to be corrected, because that warning applied to what would happen if the state of siege was maintained not for another 48 hours, but for a full year. Grave enough, but not the same. Deep and lethal hatreds are at work here; people can be stirred to violence very easily. There is little room to be casual.I would say the same of Yair Golan, a former general and now leader of Israel’s opposition Democrats party. He deserves credit for demanding Israelis face up to and look hard at what so many prefer not to see. This week he warned, “Israel is on the way to becoming a pariah state, like South Africa was, if we don’t return to acting like a sane country,” adding that “a sane country does not fight against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not give itself the aim of expelling populations.” That reference to baby-killing, the use of the word “hobby”,immediately allowed his criticsto say he was reviving the antisemitic blood libel that cast Jews as the ritual slayers of Christian children.This whole terrain is perilous and has to be navigated with great care, whether from within the conflict or without – and, again, that means realising that two things can be true at once. Yes, it’s true that anti-Zionism is not always antisemitic. But that doesn’t mean it’sneverantisemitic. Gary Lineker thought he was posting an anti-Zionist video. He failed to see itcame attached to antisemitic imagery, in the form of a rat, a favourite Nazi shorthand for Jew.That episode was a reminder that, much as we might want these categories to be neat and hermetically sealed – “Zionism” over here and fair game for attack; “Jews” over there and protected by anti-racism – the boundary between them is blurred and porous. A man in Washington was angry with Israel and it was a Jewish museum that ended up under deadly fire.There are countless distinctions like that to be made; complex, apparently contradictory statements to be held in mind all at the same time. But it’s impossible to see them when blinded by a rage and loathing that will not be quelled, when blinded by mutual hatred of biblical proportions. Agha no longer likes to speak in terms of peace or resolving the conflict, but rather of more modest “arrangements” that might keep these furies in check. Either way, one way or the other, this needs to end.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The reality is quite differentFri 23 May 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 07.25 EDTShareAmid all the acrimony surrounding Keir Starmer’s recentremarks on immigration– a row that could follow him into retirement and beyond – there has been one little-examined area of agreement between the prime minister and his critics. “When people come to our country,” Starmer said, “they should also commit to integration.” You may believe that integration is not best achieved by government decree, yet in conversations about what sort of society Britain should be, it has long been generally accepted that integration is a good thing – not just for immigrants but for everyone.Mixing, empathising and collaborating with people who aren’t like you has benefits, the argument goes, for individuals and the country as a whole. Perspectives are broadened. Inequalities are softened, at least a little. Lives are enriched, and feelings of loneliness and alienation are diminished. Who would want to live in a country without such social exchanges – in other words, in a segregated society?Actually, it appears that many of us do. For centuries, this country has been synonymous with segregation – by class, education, manners, dress, accents, leisure habits and housing. Since the early 1980s, when Thatcherism began to erase the more integrated and equal postwar Britain, these ancient divisions have been compounded by a further polarisation in incomes and between regions.“The UK – England in particular – has some of the deepest spatial inequalities … among the OECD countries,” noted the socioeconomic data website the Economics Observatory last year. “These differences have been increasing for over three decades.” Deep segregation also exists within cities, towns and villages. This week, research published by the pollsters More in Common showed that44% of Britons“say they sometimes feel like they are strangers to those around them”.Much of modern life seems to be about separation: wearing headphones in public, driving cars with tinted windows, looking at your phone rather than people around you. The wealthy seem especially keen to distance themselves from other Britons, minimising their taxes, choosing private schools and private healthcare, and living in enclaves behind electric gates and entry phones, high up in towers or down private roads.In his immigration speech last week, Starmer said he wanted Britain to be “a nation that walks forward together”, which acknowledged “the obligations we owe to one another”. This wish may be genuine. Some of his policies, such as abolishing the non-dom tax status, removing some inheritance tax privileges from farmers, imposing VAT on private school fees and partly equalising the balance of power between employers and employees, can be seen as efforts to create a more cohesive country. The fury of some of those affected by these modest adjustments to the established order reveals just how entitled they feel to separate treatment.Yet it’s striking that despite these welcome reforms, the government, like most of its British predecessors, rarely if ever tells elites to integrate more with the rest of society. Nor does Starmer criticise other Britons with separatist tendencies, such as white voters who move out to the suburbs from multiracial urban areas, or long-established rural residents who don’t welcome incomers. Instead, the integration lecture is reserved for immigrants.Patronisingly, this approach ignores the fact that immigration is by definition an act of integration: you are in effect blending your original national identity with one of another country. Even if you don’t try very hard to learn the language or meet the locals – a narrow-mindedness not unknown among British expats, as this country likes to euphemistically label its emigrants – you are sharing the same weather, built environment, natural landscape and social and political context as your new neighbours, and a gradual blurring of boundaries usually results. Immigrant communities rarely remain totally inward-looking and monocultural for long. Often, they start mixing with locals from day one – either because they want to, or because they have to.Having spent most of his adult life in multicultural British cities, Starmer must know this. “Migration is part of Britain’s national story,” he said last week. Britain is “a diverse nation”, he also said, “and I celebrate that”. The great immigrant integration panic, like the fear and hostility towards immigrants in general, is partly a reaction to social frictions and dislocations that rarely happen – or at least not on the scale claimed or imagined by socially conservative voters, journalists and politicians – in places where most immigrants to Britain actually live. As in other policy areas, Labour is doing itself no favours, politically or morally, by trying to legislate in ways that satisfy the British right’s gloomy and distorted view of the modern world.In recent years, with immigration at unusually high levels, the government has published an annual “community life survey”, measuring how Britons view their neighbours and neighbourhoods. Its findings have consistently been more positive than much of the media or this week’s downbeat More in Common poll would lead you to expect. According to thelatest survey, “81% of adults definitely or tended to agree that their local area is a place where people from different backgrounds get along well”. Since 2013, that figure has never fallen below 80%. Despite all modern Britain’s divides and disorienting social shifts, for most of us, Starmer’s “island of strangers” does not yet exist.One hot afternoon last summer, I was waiting for a bus in King’s Lynn in Norfolk, a usually Tory constituency that voted for Brexit by two to one, when I wanted a cup of tea. The first, traditional tearoom I tried in the town had closed early, so I followed a small cafe sign next to the bus station into an unpromising-looking, windowless building. Inside, to my surprise, was a classic Portuguese bar, with dusty Portuguese football scarves hanging from the ceiling and elderly Portuguese immigrants drinking dark Portuguese liqueur from tiny glasses. The bar felt both foreign and, in its confident approach to cultural difference, quite British.Were the bar staff and their customers completely integrated with the rest of King’s Lynn? On the basis of a brief visit, it was hard to say. But they made a very good cup of tea.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Wellsbourne GP practice in Whitehawk, EastBrighton, has just been told it is losing its contract. NHS Sussex, the local integrated care board (ICB), is provisionally handing it over to a distant Leeds-based company whose main business is in owning and managing healthcare properties. This is a story about how parts of the NHS can slip awayto profit-makers, despite the government’s aim to put community first. The company, One Medical Group, won the bid by undercutting on price and proposing to add a walk-in centre. It’s not a lone case: some other ICBs erroneously put good NHS community services out for tender, and feel obliged to take the lowest bid.To give you a rough portrait, in 2019 Whitehawk was ranked within the top 10% of England’s most deprived areas, and the most deprived in Brighton.According to a doctor from the practice, life expectancy in the area is 10% lower than it is on the other side of the city.The renowned Marmot review on health inequalities and their underlying social causes drew on Whitehawk as a study of deprivation. It’s the type of place that needs exceptionally socially committed GPs.It’s not, in other words, where you would expect a private company to make money. Indeed, the last private company managing the GP practice quit, leaving services in disarray. The GPs of Wellsbourne now work as part of a not-for-profit community interest company. “We’re here because this is the kind of work we want to do,” said Posy Greany, a doctor at the surgery. Although they would be re-employed by the new company, she tells me they are likely to leave, as “working for a private for-profit provider doesn’t fit with our view of the NHS”. As Greany wrote in a local publication,Sussex Bylines: “It will dismantle a model that is working. It will scatter a team that has fought to earn trust.”Within days of the news, a petition opposing the handover of the practice gathered more than 2,000 signatures. Wellsbourne is a hive of community activity. It works closely with Whitehawk’s food bank, community sports centre and youth centre. Artists run community projects there and volunteers tend to a community garden with patients. All of these services could now be at risk. The Care Quality Commission rates the practice as “good”, in an area where reaching all of the regulator’s targets is hard.Here’s the puzzle. Andrew Lansley’s calamitous system that opened theNHSto “any willing provider” to compete for contracts was supposedly swept away in 2022, replaced with ICBs that strove for cooperation across all NHS and social services in England. Yet some ICBs still apply the old competitive impulse to NHS services, even though they now have an obligation to ensure that tenders help to reduce inequalities.To be fair, the entire NHS is the under the whip toeliminate its £6bn deficit. The government has instructed ICBs to reduce their running costs by50% by October this year; the Sussex ICB has to achievecost reductions of 30%by 2025-26. Some ICBs are fading away. The government has introduced “integrated neighbourhood teams”, but the10-year planexplaining what these do still hasn’t been published. In my decades of reporting, the NHS was always on the verge of, or just recovering from, a major reorganisation. No matter how reasonable these might seem, their true cost is never counted. Re-disorganisations “take far longer than you think, end up costing far more than you anticipate, and leave you with a distracted and demoralised workforce,”writes the King’s Fund policy director, Siva Anandaciva.View image in fullscreenPeople working in Whitehawk’s community garden.Photograph: FacebookCost-saving in Whitehawk may be just one accidental fallout of the 2022 reorganisation. After all, the surgery’s privatisation goes against the coming plan to shift health into the community and emphasise social prevention. Greany told me that about 60% of her patients have long-term conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and mental health problems. They have specialfocused care practitionersgiving extra social support.The Sussex ICB told me that national regulations meant it “had to follow an open procurement process, with the ability for all parties with interest in providing services to this community to submit an application”. Otherwise, its spokesperson said, private companies would challenge them in court. But King’s Fund experts told methat there is no obligation for ICBs to tender out existing NHS services – and that they can reject cheaper bids in favour of best “social value”.The “social value” requirement sent most private operators into retreat. The large US company Operose hassold its GP surgeries,while Babylon hascollapsed. Beccy Baird, a primary care expert at the King’s Fund, told me the number of private companies running NHS GP surgeries has fallen by three-quarters since its peak a decade ago: now just 63 practices are run by private companies, amounting to about 1% of all practices across Britain.Labour has stressed its willingness to use private services to clear waiting lists, but this is proving costly. Profits are still being made: just before the election, an ICB let out a huge contractworth up to £1.3bnto the private equity group HCRG Care (once Virgin Care), covering all community services across Bath, north-east Somerset, Wiltshire and Swindon. Meanwhile, long waiting lists are driving patients to buy one-off private treatments. According to the Health Foundation, the overall proportion of privately funded elective operations rose from 7.4% in 2019-20 to 8.3% in 2022-23.Wellsbourne seems to be caught in Lansley’s competition-era time warp. With no experience of writing tenders, its current GPs hadn’t a hope against companies that have entire teams of people who specialise in tender-writing. The GPs have appealed, and the ICB could still change its mind. If not, they could appeal to Whitehall. Their local MP, Chris Ward, is defending them vigorously. “I’m strongly opposed to a for-profit provider replacing a local community one,” he told me. “This is a matter of principal, it’s what theLabourparty stands for.”If this reaches Wes Streeting’s desk, surely he would reverse a decision that flies in the face of his own community policies. Setting that public example would halt other misguided ICBs wrongly still tendering out community services to private companies, and quietly privatising parts of our NHS.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionHealthGPsDoctorsInequalityLabourBrightoncommentShareReuse this content"

The BBC risks coming apart over the Gaza warJane MartinsonMistakes have been made by both the star and the corporation. That shouldn’t compromise urgent coverage of the conflictFri 23 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 10.07 EDTShareWhenGary Linekerbids farewell to the BBC on Sunday, his former bosses will be hoping for an end to their problems with headstrong stars harder than England football fans do at major tournaments. And, like England fans, they are sure to be disappointed.For Lineker was just the highest-profile example representing two existential challenges for the BBC: how to maintain its reputation for impartiality, and how to do so in a toxic and divisive age. Few issues are so difficult, or are being so badly handled by the BBC right now, as the Israel-Gaza conflict.Lineker blew the final whistle on his BBC career by sharing a video on Instagram that featuredan image of a rat over an explanation of Zionism. He followed with agenuinely contrite apologyin which he admitted he had not even seen what he called an “emoji with awful connotations”, but the damage had been done.His departure had been a long time coming. In 2023, Lineker – never a journalist – tweeted criticisingthe government’s asylum policy, which led to the corporation drawing up guidance for “personal use of social media”for journalists and “flagship programme presenters”. Lineker became the litmus test for the meaning of impartiality in the institution.The guidelines were meant to draw a line in the sand, while recognising that for its star presenters, building a media brand online is increasingly vital in an age in which more and more media consumers are moving away from traditional platforms.While there is no debate that antisemitism or racism of any kind should be banned, Lineker and his supporters believe outrage over dying Palestinian children is not akin to taking sides. Read the interview in which he said that, no matter the rhetoric on either side, he simplyfeels “sick”when he sees so many innocent lives lost. Yet, some Lineker critics in the Jewish community continue to believe he has “baited” them by failing to criticise Hamas or mention the 7 October attacks.This issue can be difficult to navigate for all media companies, but particularly the BBC, where problems are never just about one presenter or mistake. One of the biggest issues affecting trust in BBC journalism, both externally and internally, is its handling ofGaza. And it’s a terrain that the BBC is clearly struggling to deal with.The best example of this is perhaps its decision to indefinitely delay broadcasting a documentary about Gaza while it “investigates” another documentary broadcast in February.The BBC pulled Gaza: How to Survive a Warzonefrom iPlayer after it emerged that the 13-year-old narrator was the son of a member of the Hamas-run government. The BBC chair, Samir Shah, a respected former journalist, made his feelings clear when he told MPs that such failings were a “dagger to the heart” of the BBC’s claims of impartiality and trustworthiness. His call for swift action has so far resulted in the appointment of Peter Johnston, the BBC’s director of editorial complaints, to investigate. Insiders believe the report could still be weeks away.In the meantime, Medics Under Fire, an investigation into how all 36 hospitals have been attacked in Gaza with more than 100 doctors killed and many incarcerated,has been shelved. Basement Films, the award-winning producer, point out that their film gives voice to doctors in a war zone from which the world’s media has been excluded. The essence of public service journalism, in other words. Basement has asked the BBC to release its contract rights on the film so it can be shown elsewhere. A BBC statement said it won’t make any decision “while we have an ongoing review into a previous documentary”.View image in fullscreenPeople queueing for food aid in Gaza City on 22 May 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesTheBBCappears to fear putting out what could be seen as another documentary supporting Palestinians. BBC 2 was able to release Life and Death in Gaza, but that was in October 2024. More recently Louis Theroux’s recent well-received exposé of the settler movement in the West Bankwas released. Butthe programme was outside of the news purview, and helped along by well-placed internal champions including those that “no longer worried about the edicts that came down from on high”, one BBC insider told me.Such criticism points to the fact that not only does the BBC face external tension, but there are continued rumours about pressures from within. Several people told me a sense of weakness is behinddeclining levels of confidence in the managementin the most recent staff survey. “If things stay as they are, the BBC will never put another what would be seen as pro-Palestinian or pro-Gaza documentary out,” said one.In this febrile atmosphere, Jeremy Bowen being able to use the word “genocide” in a recent piece was seen as brave, even though he was simply quoting the view of Palestinian agencies.None of this is easy of course. The BBC has some of the best Middle East correspondents in the world and no one thinks that reporting on a conflict zone from which the world’s media has been excluded is straightforward.Difficult editorial decisions always take nerve, care and a great deal of courage. The BBC made a stupid mistake by not identifying the background of a documentary narrator, Lineker made one by posting something he seems not to have watched properly. But if the consequences of these mistakes grow out of proportion and affect the way BBC journalists and presenters report, the damage will be far greater.

And it’s spreadingGaby HinsliffIn this new climate, having an enviable job, while not being a straight white man, is grounds for suspicionFri 23 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 01.06 EDTShareWayne Brown was a trailblazer, a man who made his own small piece of history by becoming Britain’s first black fire chief.He worked his way up as a young firefighter, rising through the ranks, serving the public through dark times including the 2005 London terror attacks and the Grenfell fire.But in January of last year, at the age of 54,he took his own life, leaving a note that read: “I can’t do this any more.” An inquest heard Brown had become increasingly distressed after being bombarded for years with hostile social media posts, complaints to his employer, freedom of information inquiries and emails from an anonymous account that seemed to be mounting a campaign against him. Days before he died, Brown had learnedhe would be formally investigatedfor claiming on his CV to have an MBA, which in truth he had started but never finished.Whether these were vexatious complaints – what Brown’s female deputy called “constant harassment from multiple individuals” – or perfectly legitimate whistleblowing was not for the coroner to decide, and nor was it her job to investigate why a senior black officer seemingly attracted so many of them.Yet there was something in the picture friends and family painted of a man in an already stressful job, carrying an extra burden that will at the very least be familiar to other “firsts” in their field: the uncomfortable feeling that the world is just waiting for you to fall flat on your face, the relentless sniping that you’re not up to it, and the whispers that you’re what the very online British right is starting to call a “DEI hire”.The acronym is a giveaway: DEI is the American version of what Brits more often call EDI, or equality diversity and inclusion, ground zero of Donald Trump’s war on woke. The president’s bizarre and seemingly evidence-free attempt to blamea fatal mid-air collision between a helicopter and a planein Washington this January on DEI hiring policies was disturbing enough, but it was the speed with which some Americans embraced the idea that was genuinely chilling. An incoherent ball of online rage took shape, alighting horribly swiftly on Captain Rebecca Lobach, the female army helicopter pilot killed in the crash. Her grieving family and friends were forced on to the defensive, pointing out that she’d been in the top 20% of graduating cadets, information seemingly not required of the male crew on board. But to the DEI warriors, her qualifications didn’t seem to matter. She was a woman, wasn’t she? So obviously she must have been the weak link.Weeks later, Trumpfired the black air force general Charles Q Brown Jr, identified by his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, as a champion of “woke shit” in the military, along with Admiral Lisa Franchetti (who was the first woman to lead the US navy) and three other senior Pentagon figures. Gen Brown was a former fighter pilot with 40 years of distinguished service to his country, while Hegseth is a former Fox News pundit who never rose above the rank of major in the Army National Guard, and whose nomination as defence secretary prompted reports that he had left two jobs in veterans’ organisations afterallegations of financial mismanagement, aggressive drunkenness and sexist behaviour, which Hegseth has repeatedly denied. “Was it because of his skin colour? Or his skill? We’ll never know, but always doubt,” Hegseth once wrote of Gen Brown. Such doubts might seem unfair, Hegseth conceded, but “since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn’t really much matter”. To be scorned as a DEI hire, a liability on the job who should never have been allowed to rise this high, you don’t have to be proven incompetent or even to have been hired through any formal diversity scheme. Just having an enviable job, while not being a straight white man, is grounds for suspicion – especially if you have the audacity to champion lifting others up the ladder.Britain is not America, or at least not yet. We are still the country where it was “just not that big a deal” (asRishi Sunak put it) in the end to have a British Asian prime minister, and where Nigel Farage’s ominous suggestion that diversity officers in newly Reform-led councils should start looking for new jobs elicited sharp warnings from unions that in this country people can’t be fired at will for political reasons. (They could also have added that diversity officers aren’t some suspicious lefty affectation but mostly people employed to ensure councils meet their legal obligations under the Equality Act, as some Reform councillors may be about to discover.)But the playground taunt of “DEI hire” nonetheless feeds an age-old grievance, a lurking sense that someone has a job that could have been yours. It creates a climate where what was fast becoming unsayable in polite company can, once again, be said with confidence. And perhaps most corrosively of all, it feeds the nagging voice of doubt already lurking inside the most outwardly confident of people.Successful women, and increasingly often successful men from non-traditional backgrounds, sometimes complain of “impostor syndrome”, or the irrational fear that any minute now someone is going to rumble you as a fraud. You don’t belong; you shouldn’t be here; you’ll get found out, less for doing wrong than for intrinsicallybeingit. Though everyone makes mistakes, impostor syndrome makes them loom larger and more shamefully inside your head than they should.View image in fullscreenPete Hegseth sits next to JD Vance in the Oval Office, 21 May 2025.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersFor politicians and others in the public eye, social media long ago turned what were once snarky whispers behind your back into an incessant and very public barrage of sexist or racist abuse that chips away at the confidence of even the most rhino-skinned. You can complain to platform moderators if you like, but a fat lot of good it will generally do you – which leaves a choice between leaving or learning to ignore it, a choice nobody would consider acceptable if the same insults were driving minorities out of a pub. The race equality thinktank British Future argues, in a submission to the Commons equality select committee’snew inquiry into community cohesion, that platforms whose reporting mechanisms do not ensure that female and minority users enjoy the same service as everyone else could be in breach of the Equality Act 2010. At the very least, there’s arguably a case for the Equality and Human Rights Commission to make its presence felt.But the real risk, perhaps, is of the same playground taunts and knee-jerk prejudices spilling back out into real life conversations. Britain is not America, not yet.

Even the Tories attacking him know thatFri 23 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 09.16 EDTShareFor the Tories to attack Keir Starmer’s first step towards a Brexit reset is monumental hypocrisy. Their Brexit led to£4.7bn being spenton implementing post-EU border arrangements, according to the National Audit Office, including a vastly expensive “take back control” border post at Sevington in Kent. No other country in the world can have erected such ludicrous barriers against its biggest trading partners. All are now wasted. At least the nonsense can stop. Memorial plaques to Boris Johnson should be pinned to their gates and passersby invited to sign a 50-page customs form in his memory.Meanwhile, Starmer should hang his own head in shame. He was Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit henchman back in 2019, whenLabourvoted down Theresa May’s bid to negotiate a soft Brexit deal that would certainly have gone beyond what was signed this week. It was Starmer who helped to scotch at least a possible Commons coalition against hard Brexit and in favour of sanity. It was Corbyn and Starmer who could have stifled five years of the greatest act of self-harm by a British government since the Great Depression.After the British public voted to leave the EU in 2016, themain reason they gave pollsters was immigration. There was little evidence of opposition to EU trade or membership of Europe’s wider economic community. So-called hard Brexit was adopted entirely by Johnson and those round him as a tool to oust May from Downing Street. Mendacious garbage was issued by his campaigners to claim it would benefit Britain. Public interest was hijacked by power.The outcome was and is glaring. All serious estimates, official and unofficial, accept that Brexit has made Britain poorer to the tune oftens of billions of pounds. The result can be seen in slowed growth and worse public services. There is not a remote chance of recouping the losses in the foreseeable future. Deals reached with Australia, India and the US cannot begin to redress the harm of hard Brexit.This week’s political reaction to Starmer’s deal was absurd. The UK’s negotiating strength with the EU was crippled by Brexit. Of course Britain must sign up to EU food standards if it really wants to trade. The EU is the bigger market, as is the US. Of course extended fishing rights for European fleets is a concession, though it reflects a concession already made by Johnson. So too is freer movement for Europe’s young people. Does Nigel Farage really regard this as “abject surrender”? Does he really want to keep open theSevington border checkpointand ban e-gate use at airports? Unwilling to put his case to Starmer in the Commons this week, he scurried through an e-gate for a holiday,apparently in France. To him, Brexit has always been a game.I once opposed EU membership as I thought on balance that a looser free trade area, like the European Free Trade Association, was more in line with Britain’s place in the world. In retrospect, I was wrong. The stability of westernEuropeover the past half a century has vindicated British membership. Margaret Thatcher was right to negotiate the 1986 single market agreement, but John Major was right at Maastricht to avoid greater union, as was Tony Blair to avoid the euro. Throughout history, Britain’s relations with Europe have always been best when semi-detached.Since Brexit, two changes should now influence the debate. First, the issue of immigration is consuming all of Europe, desperately requiring international cooperation. The EU’s internal borders have begun to harden and the open door ofSchengen has begun to close. Within Britain, theoverwhelming majority of annual immigrants are legal, authorised with government visas for work or study. Recruiting immigrants to the labour force was Tory policy. How Brexit was ever expected to reduce this is a mystery.Meanwhile, and despite public feeling on immigration, polls show a strong majority now regrets Brexit, with55% of Britonssaying it was wrong compared with the 52% of those voting , or 37% of the electorate, who supported it nine years ago. Just three in 10 people now approve of Britain having left the EU. People realise they were lied to. British companies can only “take control” of trading by not trading.That realisation has now been curbing not just farming and food, but manufacturing, services, academic and cultural exchange, and tourism. Evenorchestras have had to stop touring. Other European states outside the EU have not so isolated themselves. Hard Brexit was xenophobic, economically illiterate and narrow-minded. I am sure most public figures who supported it, for whatever reason, know this is true but lack the guts to admit it.From the dayBrexitarrived, the laborious reset process that began this week was inevitable. When public opinion is allied to economics and common sense, something has to give. But it will be slow. The EU owes Britain nothing for its behaviour over the past decade.An apology from the Brexit lobby is too much to hope for. Silence might be a relief.

I would sit them on an angled louvre, the humid Brisbane air drifting in, and play at writing.I think I derive some pleasure in the friction of pencil on paper itself, surfing the feint-ruled lines. There is electricity – lightning, back through memoir – that links to my early tactile sense of the world. Perhaps, eventually, we’ll be able to see AI for what it is and take solace in human traces – an interest in process and practice will deepen. This is happening already, but there’ll be more focus on the open studio or the singular, lifelong accumulation of skill and intelligence of any artist, musician or writer – something AI lacks. A painter slowly perfecting a subtle un-mimicable line via studies or works-in-progress.AI promises to free up time. But what if it spares us from learning, writing, painting and exploring the world? | Joseph EarpRead moreI’m writing this sentence in pencil. I write most of my first drafts by hand; it’s something I’ve done for nearly 15 years. What prompted me was a fancy exercise book I was once given as a gift: almost waxy, caramel-coloured paper with fine, milky feint-ruled lines. It whispered to be pencilled on.I’m happy to escape the computer and travel lightly – in a cafe, gallery or wilderness.I can hand-write faster, too – well, probably slower than I can type, but it’s a fast-blur sort of writing; being left-handed, this scribbly sentence vanishes below my hand and wrist, out of mind. I concentrate on a calm centre where the graphite sizzles against the paper, resisting the urge to edit.Japanese pencils and notebooks, German sharpeners. Sun-bitten Australian hands.My habit is quaint, I know, and there are downsides – deciphering my scribbly handwriting is like trying to communicate with the dead. And I’m accumulating piles of smudgy notebooks and stubs of pencils that I can’t bring myself to throw away. But I’m beginning to think all this is more important than I first anticipated.A writer friend recently posted that after updating her version of Microsoft Word, it invited itself to collaborate on her novel in progress, offering to work on 2,000 words at a time. Instead she workshopped her panic with fellow writers who helped her unplug the tech. But this is where we’re at. The question blooms by the day – how are we to know if any creative text, novel, essay, poem or short story is AI assisted, or even authored? In time, will it be impossible to tell?At present, the best we seem to have is an honesty system where authors put their hand up if they’ve used AI. I recently submitted some poems to an Australian literary journal – something I’ve been doing for more than a couple of decades – but for the first time I noticed a checkbox with the line “I haven’t used AI” next to it. It’s easy to tick, but how are we to trust that work is genuine, especially given several well-documented cases of plagiarism in Australian literature?This has me realise – for those who value non-AI-generated literature, the focus will shift to this: how do we prove wedidn’tuse AI? My first thought is: practice with a ‘c’. It’s what sets us aside from AI-generated content, right? Artists’ practice.I have been an AI researcher for 40 years. What tech giants are doing to book publishing is akin to theft | Toby WalshRead moreAs someone working in the literary realm with a pencil, I struggle to trust AI as anything but a numb wrecker – docile, tonally one-dimensional, static, fattened with stolen literature. I almost liken it to an empty hoax, but it has nothing on Ern Malley.In 1943, conservative poets Harold Stewart and James McAuley invented a poet called Ernest Lalor Malley, made ornate mock-wacky poems and presented them to the young editor of the modernist magazine Angry Penguins. We also know that the hoax worked very well – Ern was the centrepiece of a 1944 Angry Penguins edition, with Malley-inspired cover art by Sidney Nolan, no less. But the hoaxers were a little too good – the poems became some of the strangest and best and most influential in Australian literary history.This is not to suggest we need another hoax, only to compare this complex richness against the generative-AI world which is so much less knotty or interesting – there is no cascading human archive in it. Can AI fragilely misstep like Stewart and McAuley? It was the charm and vulnerability and improvisational flair in their – let’s face it – beautiful failure. In AI, are we to find this allure or scribbly imaginative interstice?For me, and perhaps many writers, it’s this unravelling illegible sentence here on this off-white paper between the vein-blue lines that is, hopefully, an authenticity stamp. The drafts of art making will take on a significance – they are where the work begins, and a good guide to how it came from the body and mind, building up a physical archive. Librarians may be pleased to hear that just as the book object won’t be diminished, the archive may become more significant than ever. An artist with an object-led, mapped, pencilled, human-drafted trail will go well. It’s not sexy – well, pencils are a little bit sexy, aren’t they? – but the archive might shield the artist against the threat to literature itself: the dumb cunning of the robot.Luke Beesley is a poet and singer-songwriter.

It was repulsive. I looked it up.” His curiosity is innate and all-consuming. When he was 16 and starring in a school production of My Fair Lady, he took it upon himself to visit the tenements on Tottenham Court Road in London where his character would have lived. At an even younger age, he secretly imitated the stooped walk of a stranger he spotted in the street. Not to be cruel. “I just wanted to know what it was to walk like that. How it felt inside. I still find myself doing it now. I’ll see somebody moving a certain way and I’ll try and copy that to feel where it comes from. I suppose that’s why I do what I do.”As he talks in his fascinated way, the low-speed London traffic trundles past and the morning sun blazes through the canopy of trees above us. It all feels rather like being on holiday, and Spall is dressed for the part: untucked white shirt, cobalt blue jacket, loose striped linen trousers. “I’m partial to a stripe,” he says, admiring a leg and turning a Chelsea-booted foot this way and that. “I bought these in a shopping centre on the Strait of Messina. I just hope it doesn’t look like I shat myself then knocked on someone’s door to borrow their pyjamas.”View image in fullscreenSpall as Peter Farquhar in The Sixth Commandment.Photograph: Amanda Searle/BBC/Wild MercuryAt 68, the Battersea-born actor has played sad-sack taxi drivers and world-class painters. He has been a Death Eater in theHarry Potterfilms, Britain’s last hangman,Ian PaisleyandWinston Churchill(twice in fact, as well as publicly reading Churchill’s VE Day radio addressearlier this month), as well asSanta Clausand even Margaret Rutherford. Some of his most exceptional work was seen recently on television: as a bewildered Duke of Norfolk inWolf Hall, and the university lecturer Peter Farquhar, tormented and murdered by the young man with whom he believed he had found love, inThe Sixth Commandment. That performance, which won Spall a Bafta and an International Emmy, amounts to a moving reclamation of a man who could have been seen as a victim but was instead rendered noble and even inspiring because of his ingenuous faith in love – and the actor’s skill in embodying that quality.What could be left for Spall to play? One answer is: a lovable old ham who fancies that his former role as a TV detective has imbued him with the skills to solve crimes. What’s more, he turns out to be not entirely deluded. This is the BBC’s new “cosy crime” series Death Valley, its title flagging both the show’s carousel of murders and its Vale of Glamorgan setting.Spall is John Chapel, an actor dimly remembered for playing theMaigret-likeTV sleuth Caesar, who came complete with his own cheesier-than-Caerphilly catchphrase: “Crime waits for no man.” Chapel’s glory days are behind him. But when DS Janie Mallowan (Gwyneth Keyworth) – who is also a Caesar fangirl – knocks on his door during a routine appeal for witnesses to a murder, he brings his thespian training (“Character is action!”) to the investigation and helps Janie find the guilty party. It turns out that years of fathoming the behaviour of fictional characters has left him with some practical crime-fighting skills. The opening episode even gives Chapel a Poirot-esque revelation scene in which he reveals whodunnit and why to the gobsmacked suspects – in between posing for selfies.That success, and his rapport with Mallowan, leads him to be a regular source of counsel on her subsequent cases. The generation-gap dynamic isn’t unprecedented:Only Murders in the Buildingfeatures a young woman sleuthing withtwoluvvies, one of whom also made his name as a fictional TV detective. But Death Valley has a wryly parochial strain of humour. (Accused of being a hermit, Chapel protests: “I’m not a hermit. I went to Swansea last month!”) The show also gets a lot of mileage out of fusing buddy-comedy conventions with a weekly whodunnit and an affectionate ribbing of its thespian hero, who in one episode turns up as Claudius in an am-dram Hamlet.As a seasoned pro himself, Spall helped develop the character. “I lampooned some aspects of acting and brought in some of the pretensions, the whole arse-ache embarrassment quality, but also the sincerity.” Bad behaviour among actors isn’t as common as people assume, he says. “The show is playing, coquettishly I suppose, with people’s preconceptions. But I’ve seen remarkably few displays of egotism in real life. We all just want to be brilliant, we’re all shitting ourselves and none of us want to look like twats. You want to give good value for money.”This is an idea to which he often returns. “As I’ve got older, I’ve realised that you’ve got to do it for the audience. It’s our duty to give value for money. Stories can just be entertainment but they can alsomeansomething.”Death Valley falls into this category. “It’s lovely, isn’t it?” he says in between sips of his cappuccino. “Me, I always want the darkness. I try to turn everything into a Lithuanian art movie. And it’s not that, is it?” Not by a long chalk. The epitome of sparkling Sunday evening entertainment, Death Valley has even been bumped to BBC One from its intended home on BBC Two. “I had a feeling that might happen when we dropped the fruity language,” he confides.View image in fullscreenScene of the crime … Gwyneth Keyworth and Spall in Death Valley.Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC StudiosOf course, Spall has been in plenty of art movies, if not Lithuanian ones. Among his earlier film roles was an overgrown mummy’s boy inBernardo Bertolucci’s majestic and desolate The Sheltering Sky. “Fourteen-hour trips across the Atlas Mountains,” he marvels. “Debra Winger, John Malkovich. My first scene was in a souk. Character names on the backs of the canvas chairs. I remember going: ‘Fucking hell, I’m in the movies!’ Then doing a scene with Debra and being so nervous and Bernardo saying afterwards: ‘Bellissimo.’ I’m thinking: ‘This is all right. I’ll remember this.’” He snorts at his younger self. “You’re the first person I’ve told.”That African adventure came six or seven years after Spall had experienced overnight fame in his mid-20s as the droning Black Country electrician Barry in the ITV seriesAuf Wiedersehen, Pet. That was a hit in 1983, the year his actor son Rafe (the middle child of three) was born. Although Spall has never had a Caesar-style albatross of a role – he once turned down a TV detective series that felt too close to Robbie Coltrane’s Cracker – it is Barry, if anyone, who follows him around. “It disappeared for a while but then it was constantly on Dave or Bob or Colin.

In Leigh’s TV play Home Sweet Home, Spall played a postal worker (coincidentally his father’s occupation). He was soon one of the film-maker’s most cherished collaborators, and won the best actor prize at the Cannes film festival for his visceral performance as JMW Turner, painting and grunting and rutting away, inMr Turner. (Spall later became a painter himself.)He was in his tuxedo on the red carpet for the Cannes premiere, flashbulbs popping away, crowds cheering. “I’m thinking: ‘Cannes, eh? This is the life.’” Then a lone, loud voice called out in an exaggerated Black Country accent: “All right, Barry?” Laughing now, Spall shakes his head. “I was straight back down to earth. You just go: ‘Fair enough.’”View image in fullscreenSpall as JMW Turner in Mr Turner.Photograph: FILM4/AllstarIt is Leigh’sSecrets & Lies, in which he played a patient but put-upon high-street photographer, that has an enduring place in his heart. While the film was scooping the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1996, Spall was in hospital with acute myeloid leukaemia. The movie became both a showcase for him and a placeholder while he was out of action. “I was in bed, hooked up to this electric soup, all these brilliant people trying to save my life, and wondering whether I was going to make it or not. As that was happening, Secrets & Lies was out there. And when I had the audacity not to peg it, I came back and found I had a film career!”Not half. He enjoyed a Hollywood spell, working alongside Amy Adams (Enchanted), Tom Cruise (Vanilla Sky,The Last Samurai) and Johnny Depp (Sweeney Todd). One of his proudest recent experiences was playing the Queen’s equerry, opposite Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana, in the pleasingly bananas biopicSpencer.Perhaps it is Spencer from which a passing stranger, somewhat the worse for wear, recognises him this morning. He stops at our table, waggles a thumbs-up in Spall’s face, and bellows: “Famous!” The actor knows how to handle this. “’Allo mate,” he replies affably, then watches the interloper stagger off into the distance. Once he is out of earshot, Spall mutters: “Cor, he’s lived a life.” The words are tinged with wonder and concern. You can sense him logging the details for later. He’ll be doing that stagger on his walk home for sure.Death Valley begins Sunday, 8.15pm, BBC One.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTimothy SpallDramainterviewsShareReuse this content"

It makes reading the signs now that bit more difficult: the bizarre event on the Croisette boulevard this year was apalm tree falling over. If it happened in a film, the metaphor would be unbearable.Whether 2025’s Cannes movies are going to spark a new burst of overwhelming excitement remains to be seen, though this year’s vintage feels good – often excellent, although even the biggest names can get it wrong: former Palme d’Or winner Julia Ducournau presented anincoherent drama called Alpha.This was a Cannes competition whose great movies were about political cruelty and tyranny.Jafar Panahi’sA Simple Accidentwas about a fortuitous event that unearthed horrifying memories in Iran. Kleber Mendonça Filho’s glorious, sprawling, Elmore Leonard-esque film from Brazil,The Secret Agentwas about the 1970s dictatorship – interestingly, both films showed petty officials taking bribes. Filho’s wretched cops are bought off with some cigarettes – Panahi’s crooked security guards carry a debit card reader so they can take contactless payments. But for sheer existential grandeur of evil nothing could touch Sergei Loznitsa’sTwo Prosecutors– about the Stalin 30s, with its Dostoyevskian and Kafkaesque moments of despair.And to go with these views of the patriarchy, there were daddy issues. Joachim Trier’sSentimental Valueshowed Stellan Skarsgård being insufferable with his daughters – the preening Egyptian movie star played by Fares Fares in Eagles of the Republic infuriates his son, and Josh O’Connor’s hapless art thief in Kelly Reichardt’s The Mastermind is a very neglectful dad. And in the Dardenne brothers’ compassionate and poignant movie Jeunes Mères, about a care facility for teenage mothers, the fathers were conspicuous by their absence.So here are my prize predictions, followed by my extra Cannes Braddies, my personal awards in other sections which should exist, but don’t.Palmed’OrThe Secret Agent (dir Kleber Mendonça Filho)Grand PrixTwo Prosecutors (dir Sergei Loznitsa)JuryprizeA Simple Accident (dir Jafar Panahi)BestdirectorCarla Simón for RomeríaBestscreenplayMascha Schilinski for Sound of FallingBestactorJosh O’Connor for The MastermindBestactressYui Suzuki for Renoir (dir Chie Hayakawa)Braddies for prize categories that don’t exist but shouldBest supporting actorStellan Skarsgård in Sentimental Value (dir Joachim Trier)Best supporting actressTânia Maria for The Secret Agent (dir Kleber Mendonça Filho)CinematographyDavid Chambille for Nouvelle Vague (dir Richard Linklater)Production designRoger Rosenberg for Eagles of the Republic (dir Tarik Saleh)Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsAwards and prizesJafar PanahifeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’re still here’: Wolf Alice on ambition, ageing and why new bands are strugglingRachel AroestiThey were the chart-topping, Corbyn-supporting band taking potshots at the Tories – so why do they sound so jaded about politics? As they gear up for album four, the alt-rockers explain their journey to self-discoveryFri 23 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 23 May 2025 05.42 EDTSharePaper tablecloths, blazing sun, spitting grill, plastic chairs, dishes of tzatziki, an expectant cat sidling up to diners: we could be in Greece. “It’s like a holiday,” marvels guitarist Joff Oddie, sipping an enormous iced coffee. ButWolf Aliceare not on a Mediterranean jaunt – they’re at a restaurant on an industrial estate in Seven Sisters, north London, a few doors down from the studios where they wrote their upcoming fourth album The Clearing and itschart-topping predecessor, Blue Weekend. “We used to call this street Anchovy Mile,” reminisces front woman Ellie Rowsell. “Because it smelled like fish.” That might be the tip round the corner or, thinks bassist Theo Ellis, a nearby brewery (“something to do with filtering through fish scales”). Either way, such an odour would only cement the seafront ambience of “Costa del Tottenham”, as Ellis names it.The only thing that could disrupt the serenity of this scorching Wednesday lunchtime is a spin of Wolf Alice’s new single. Bloom Baby Bloom is a genre-bending rock bonanza: squealing guitars, bone-shaking bass, ostentatious drum fills, but also honky tonk piano and a dreamy pop chorus. Throughout Rowsell veers between breathy folk croon and a hair metal wail. To underline the retro vibe – and the vocal gymnastics – the video has Rowsell writhing in a sparkly, glam cut-out leotard amid aFame-style dance troupe; in the promo images she is clad in cherry-red hot pants and matching knee-high boots.The band aren’t just going hell for leather aesthetically. After 2021’s Blue Weekend, the foursome left indie label Dirty Hit and signed with Columbia Records, part of Sony. The move to a major means more money for spangly Lycra – but is it also a sign of prospective world domination?“English bands are so hesitant to ever admit ambition, but I am ambitious with this record,” says drummer Joel Amey. Sony has the ability to spread the word globally, says Oddie: “I’d like every person to be able to have the opportunity to say whether they like or don’t likeWolf Alice.” Ellis looks bemused: “That’s a dangerous thing to wish!”By many measures, Wolf Alice are already colossally successful. They are Brit and Mercury award-winners, and Grammy-nominated. Blue Weekend reached No 1, while their first two albums only narrowly missed the top spot. In 2016, they were the subject of aMichael Winterbottom film; the director called them “the best band in the world”. They’re high up onnext month’s Glastonburybill. “In many ways, bucket lists have been filled like five years ago,” admits Amey.They have transcended the folk-punk shoegaze of their formative years to become omnivorous guitar music masters, incorporating hardcore, chamber pop, country, industrial, funk and psychedelia. On The Clearing they nod to krautrock, glam and trip-hop; one song sounds like a bossa nova Carpenters, another recalls Steely Dan’s Reelin’ in the Years. Yet what made the band an instant success story remains the same – Rowsell’s precise, poetic millennial vignettes, and an ability to make every song stylish and memorable. As a genre, rock is experiencing a decades-long decline; there are no journeymen any more. “Our peers have come and gone,” says Amey. “We’re still here.” The only way to be a rich and famous – or even solvent and vaguely recognisable – rock band in this day and age is to be exceptionally good at it.View image in fullscreenColossally successful … the band winning the Mercury prize in 2018.Photograph: Jo Hale/RedfernsAnd yet, you might also consider Wolf Alice underrated. They’ve never had a hit single. Gratifyingly, their most popular song on Spotify is also their best – 131m streams for 2017’s Don’t Delete the Kisses, which preserves the turbulent ecstasy of fledgling love in hypnotic indie electronica – but that’s mostly due to a “really big” TV sync. Which was …? They puzzle over the answer. Heartbreaker? suggests Rowsell. Heartstopper! says Ellis, suddenly remembering the name of Netflix’s queer teen drama phenomenon. While Oddie seems the most business-minded (he tells me the band “wouldn’t work if it wasn’t making money”), Ellis and Rowsell clearly can’t fake an Ed Sheeran-style stats fixation.It’s a decade since Wolf Alice’s debut album My Love Is Cool. Oddie’s face lights up when reminiscing about the low-stakes euphoria of nascent rock stardom. “Everything was a win. People coming up to you and saying that they liked your music; being buzzed about 20 people turning up to a gig in Leicester!” At that point they had been a proper band for less than three years – originally Wolf Alice was an acoustic duo comprising Oddie and Rowsell, who met via an internet forum. But nostalgia makes Rowsell shudder: she can’t believe her youthful chutzpah, performing songs she didn’t know on instruments she couldn’t play. “I didn’t even know …”“Where A was?” says Ellis.“I still don’t know where A is …” she mutters mordantly.I first met the band in the run-up to that album’s release, and they remain meticulously self-deprecating. Ellis and Rowsell both grew up in north London and still live here, as does Oddie (Amey has moved to Hastings). On The Clearing’s sweetly harmonic closer, The Sofa, Rowsell reflects on youthful fantasies of escape to California, but sounds almost relieved at the prospect of being “stuck in Seven Sisters” for ever.But Wolf Alice are not immune to the march of time. They are all now in their 30s, and The Clearing is a meditation on the first stage of the ageing process, a time when the “frantic” struggle to navigate adult life begins to ease, says Rowsell.On Play It Out, a kind of self-soothing lullaby, Rowsell contemplates the rest of her life: a future without children and, eventually, parents. She wonders whether she’ll still be valued and adored “when my body can no longer make a mother out of me” – an anxiety partly prompted by acquaintances on social media posting about “their mums or their partners being mums. It was the nicest things I’d ever heard coming from men about women. I was like:oh myGod, I hope that you can not be a mother and people can think you’re that amazing.” The proverb “the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world” was also stuck in her head: on Play It Out, Rowsell attempts to make peace with the inescapable spectre of motherhood, even if it only exists in the form of “an empty pram in my mind”.Rowsell has an extraordinary ability to whittle her internal monologue into lyrics, but on The Clearing she begins to doubt her instincts. Opening song Thorns reflects wryly on Blue Weekend’s account of a devastating breakup – that she must be a “narcissist” to literally make a “song and dance” about the split. At the time, she claimed Blue Weekend was her least autobiographical album. “Yeah, I was lying!” she laughs.In reality, the album combined real details with fictionalised elements, which often felt like the worst of both worlds. “I was like, maybe it’s not truthful, or it makes it sound worse.” Did she regret writing it? “I wasn’t sitting there being like:nooo,” she says, miming anxious despair. “Well, actually I was …” Rowsell still doesn’t know how much of her real life to put into her music. “What is the stuff that’s supposed to be kept for your DMC [deep meaningful conversation] with your mate? If I’m such a private person then why am I doing this?!” Does she find writing about her problems cathartic? “I must do because look how much stress it’s caused me!”View image in fullscreen‘If I’m such a private person then why am I doing this?’ … Ellie Rowsell.Photograph: Rachel Fleminger HudsonOn the new album, Amey – too unwell to come to lunch, so we speak the following day – offers Rowsell a brief respite by taking the mic and pouring his own heart out. The sonic touchstones for the song White Horses were The Sunshine Underground by the Chemical Brothers, and Can; the lyrical inspiration was the lifelong mystery surrounding his heritage.Previously, the 34-year-old had no handle on it. Taxi drivers routinely asked “if I was from where they’re from because of my dark colouring”, but he couldn’t say either way, because his mum and aunt were adopted. Then Amey’s family found out his grandmother was from Saint Helena – a discovery that chimed with the “strange in-perspective bullshit that starts happening in your 30s”. The resulting track alludes to his grandmother’s “very tough” journey to England and doubles as a love letter to his chosen family: his friends and bandmates.Everyone agrees that they’re in Wolf Alice for the long haul. But while getting old in a band is par for the course for men, there’s an added self-consciousness for women. Rowsell ends Play It Out with an optimistic manifesto: she wants to “age with excitement – go grey and feel delighted”. She is “less worried” about her future as a frontwoman than she used to be, she says, partly thanks to a selection of inspirational peers, including Charli xcx, Caroline Polachek and Self Esteem.All three of those women are knowingly camp and committed to mining cool from unlikely places – all of which Wolf Alice are doing in their flamboyant new era. When Rowsell, 32, was growing up in the 00s, zeitgeisty rock was “quite cold and aggressive, black and white, not warm” – think angular post-punk revivalists such as Interpol. The Clearing skews instead towards “softer and more colourful” 1970s guitar music; Fleetwood Mac, Pentangle and Steely Dan were all references. Liking soft rock was “embarrassing for so long”, she continues. “I don’t care any more.” The bold new look is an extension of this. When Rowsell was younger she agonised over wearing the right thing. “Now I’m so tired of caring that I just want to do something fun.” Not funny, though. “I don’t want people to think it’s a joke,” she says. “It’s self-aware, but not self-deprecating.”The Clearing was recorded in LA, with Adele’s producer Greg Kurstin, but its gestation period ran from spring 2023 to the end of 2024. Rowsell says that witnessing everyone “noodling” and “pottering” in Get Back, Peter Jackson’s epic Beatles documentary trilogy, inspired a leisurely, tech-free, in-person writing process. Yet the band assure me it is merely a coincidence that the beginning of the album sounds so Beatlesque: Thorns’ pared-back piano intro and swelling strings land somewhere between Let It Be and I Am the Walrus. “Every song sounds a bit like the Beatles,” says Oddie. “They invented everything.”View image in fullscreenWolf Alice play the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury 2016.Photograph: Samir Hussein/RedfernsThey are well aware that having such space and time is a luxury for a band, especially in the current economic climate. Costs of touring have almost doubled since they started, Oddie explains, but ticket prices have only increased by a small amount. Plus, it was hard enough back then – the foursome were only able to make tours viable by cramming themselves into a single small hotel room or sleeping on friends’ floors. The tacit agreement was that the stay would turn into a party, say Oddie. “You’d be having big nights out for weeks on end, it was exhausting.” But even that didn’t last. “If your friends start leaving uni and you’re doing a regional tour, you’re like: I don’t actually know that many people in Sheffield now I’m 23,” says Ellis.Last week, Oddie told MPs in a parliamentary meeting that he didn’t know how his band would survive if they were starting out today. He was giving evidence as part of an effort to safeguard the future of live music in the UK amid rocketing costs and shuttering venues, suggesting a £1 levy on tickets for larger gigs, with the proceeds going to support up-and-coming acts on tour (the band are donating £1 from each UK ticket sale to help grassroots venues).His appearance recalls the late 2010s, when Wolf Alice were never far from the cut and thrust of Whitehall. The band heavily endorsed Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 election, played anti-Tory marches and kicked off their2018 Brixton Academy showwith Danny Dyer’s expletive-riddled viral rant about Brexit, in which he called David Cameron a “twat”.Back then, they were driven by a genuine optimism about Corbyn’s message and the excitement of being part of a genre-uniting “youthquake”; 2017 was the year Stormzy paid tribute to the Grenfell victims and participated in pro-Corbyn chants at Glastonbury. It all seems like a very long time ago. Can they see themselves speaking out about politics again? “It depends if we’re represented by someone,” says Ellis. “Personally, I don’t feel particularly represented right now by many things.” Oddie thinks they should use their platform “sparingly – if you talk all the time about something, people switch off.”‘People think I’ve gone crazy’: indie sensation Cameron Winter on leaving crowds in tears with his wild lyrics and supernatural voiceRead moreThe band’s focus is now on some secret-ish Irish dates (they never officially announced them; they sold out anyway) to warm up for that Glastonbury performance and Radio 1’s Big Weekend, although Ellis is concerned he might have forgotten “how to stand”. For their end-of-year arena tour, they’re hoping to transform their usually straightforward live show into a spectacle: the current West End production of Cabaret, which Rowsell recently took Ellis to see, may be an influence; there might be a wind machine. With an exceptional – if characteristically unconventional – new album and major label money behind them, perhaps Wolf Alice will also take things to the next level commercially this time. But global superstardom isn’t the be-all and end-all; to be honest, they seem more than happy on Anchovy Mile.Bloom Baby Bloom is out now on Columbia Records.

Let’s go with karate man. He’s in the basement of his house in Los Angeles. “My daughter’s working upstairs, my son’s working, I’ve been relegated to the dungeon,” he says. I continue: “So exactly how good are you at karate?”Forty-one years since he first became Daniel LaRusso, Macchio is back in the role for Karate Kid: Legends. In this fictive universe, it’s three years since the end ofNetflix series Cobra Kaiand LaRusso has settled into his gardening gloves and embraced the spirit of his own mentor, Mr Miyagi, whose graceful, defensive karate style, Miyagi-Do, was all about never looking for a fight. Jackie Chan (reprising the role of Mr Han from the 2010 reboot The Karate Kid) comes to beg of him one more job.No spoilers, of course, but to have been winning at this for more than 41 years, the mask must surely have become the face: he must be really good? “I should really be the world champion,” Macchio says. “If I truly had trained for 41 years, every day, that’s probably where I’d be, or I would have so many broken bones and pulled muscles that I’d have moved on. It was easier when I was in my early 20s, now it’s much tougher. I’m not as limber. But I passed my black belt in Gōjū-ryū, that Miyagi-Do style we did in the Cobra Kai series. It’s far more defensive and less flamboyant than some of the super flippy styles.”View image in fullscreenMacchio and Chan promoting Karate Kid: Legends in London this month.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAIn Karate Kid: Legends, Mr Han is mentoring a teenager, Li Fong (Ben Wang). He’s the key svengali, no doubt, but LaRusso arrives midway through, to introduce some karate to boost the kung fu. “You make a Karate Kid movie,” Macchio says, “you better have a great kid, right? He’s wonderful.” Heiswonderful – with a funny, slightly anxious face, like a trainee accountant who thinks he doesn’t like parties, but is really stoked to have been invited to one. “He’s my favourite thing in the movie,” says Macchio. “He does almost all his own stunts, he’s really doing the work.”The whole film is a love letter to fighting with heart. I would not have predicted how enjoyable that would be. Macchio makes a stab at explaining the charm of the choreography. “The camera’s very inside the fights – the Karate Kid films that I made, certainly the first movie, was very cinematic, wide, you saw everything happen. This has a lot of cuts, it’s a bit jarring but it’s exciting. It’s 2025, this is how they make movies now. The Marvelisation of fight scenes, along with the video gamification-isation, and the desensitisation of the younger viewers, it’s nice to bring it back and feel that you’re in it.”But you can’t understand the longevity of the Karate Kid franchise without engaging with the sport itself. “Hopefully the through-line, which has always been the theme of the Karate Kid universe, is that fighting is always the last answer to the problem,” Macchio says. “It’s all about training and how to build confidence and how to defend yourself, but always with the question: at what point do you use these skills? When everything else has failed. Those roots are the grounding of martial arts, which were never intended to build warriors to kill people.”After the first Karate Kid iteration, Macchio made other films, notably My Cousin Vinny, “a late-for-dinner movie. You’re just going to be late for dinner because you have to wait for every scene, the way it sets up and pays off.” But he didn’t get a lot of work. “I was doing smaller roles or writing more and directing shorts,” he says of these lean years, “but I had a lot of time for my kids.”View image in fullscreenMacchio as Daniel LaRusso in Cobra Kai.Photograph: Album/AlamyThey weren’t wild about the Karate Kid films. “When you’re four years old, you don’t really want to watch your dad get beat up,” he says. And he didn’t try to instil any martial arts. “No, not only did I not teach them that, I didn’t teach them how to use the chopsticks. They think I can catch flies with them, but that was a little bit of movie magic.”It was more than the school run that kept Macchio on the margins of Hollywood for basically 20 years. “Being a celebrity is what I didn’t take to. I’ve always kept one foot in and one foot out. And sometimes you need to have both feet in to survive the game.” He might have also been a little too pure. “At the end of the game, it’s showbusiness,” he says, never sounding more Italian American than with that emphasis, “so they’re trying to say, OK, how can we milk this and create the next return on investment, while I’m trying to protect the truth of the character.”He appeared in HBO’s series The Deuce, which is brilliant, but his role was small. He didn’t mind that. “Four scenes or an arc in a great indie film, that’s attractive as well. Being the guy, being the franchise, it comes with a lot of responsibility and pressure.” In 2005, Pat Morita, who’d played Mr Miyagi, died of kidney failure, and Macchio and Billy Zabka, who played LaRusso’s original arch-enemy Johnny Lawrence, were in the same room for the first time in years.“If you would have told me then, Billy Zabka would be one of my best friends … There was about 20 years that I hadn’t seen him. We were at the funeral, it was a really poignant moment. I was nervous because I was about to speak, there was a bunch of emotions. I looked across, and I saw Billy, and for the first time, it was like we were on the same side of the mat, because we were both there to honour our friend.”View image in fullscreenMacchio with Pat Morita as Mr Miyagi in The Karate Kid (1984).Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyZabka was much more open to revisiting the Karate Kid franchise; Macchio says he’d said no “for thirtysomething years”. Then Cobra Kai came along. Its creators,Josh Heald,Jon HurwitzandHayden Schlossbergare “some of the biggest Karate Kid fans I’ve ever met,” Macchio says. “They know way more about that film than I do. Listen, it’s 65 episodes. That’s a heck of a run, during the pandemic and everything else. We were the comfort food when there was nothing else to watch.”Karate Kid: Legends is an incredibly warming, quite innocent, ensemble piece, in which you really root for the young cast in harmony, like watching Fame. Their personal triumphs and disasters are all routed through physical discipline, but it takes such a reassuring rhythm that you never have any doubt they’ll get there. I remember my kid saying, “What I take from this is that literally everybody can become the best person in the world at karate.” Which is kind of the point of the original film, that any kid can win, just by trying. It’s an elegy to stickability that it seems nobody can get enough of, whatever their generation.“I was just in Mexico City,” says Macchio. “There must have been 10,000 people looking at the entrance to the film premiere, chanting my name, ages eight to 80, as if I was a matador. Come on! That’s a wonderful thing to be a part of.”Karate Kid: Legends is released on 28 MayExplore more on these topicsFilmThe Karate KidinterviewsShareReuse this content"

I’d had a terrible, scarring artistic collaboration a couple of years prior, and it broke me. And on top of that, I wasactuallybroke, financially. So I decided to give up playwriting, move to Los Angeles and make some money writing for film and television. But just as I’d made that decision, I received a three-year grant from the Mellon Foundation. It came with a significant chunk of money, so I was thrilled. Only it also came with conditions: one of which was that I needed to write a new play. “Fine,” I thought. “I’ll write a very short one-act to fulfil the requirements of the grant and then be done with theatre for ever.”Months later, I was on an aeroplane listening to in-flight radio when Led Zeppelin’s cover of Babe I’m Gonna Leave You came on. I knew the haunting opening chords because when I was little my brother used to play them over and over to teach himself guitar. Until that moment, though, I don’t think I’d heard the actual song. What struck me most was the absolutely searing, raw vocals of Robert Plant. He was threatening a breakup, but the threat was delivered partly as a seduction, partly as a nervous breakdown. Underneath the “I’m gonna leave you” was the opposite: “I can never ever leave you and don’t you dare leave me!” Listening to his hypnotising vocals, I began to imagine what it must have felt like in that studio, the strange intimacy amid the technical weirdness of an analogue recording studio. I instantly knew it was the setting for a play.The song was a little like a Freudian rebus: it glittered cryptically with my fraught emotions about the theatre, and my brother, and past relationships. But on that flight the only things I consciously knew were: 1. I would write a play about a band making a record; 2. It would be set in a music studio in the 1970s; and 3. The set would function almost like an art installation, with soundproofing, mics and speakers part of the theatrical apparatus to tell the story.View image in fullscreen‘I was asking too much of everyone’ … the cast of the Broadway production of Stereophonic.Photograph: Julieta CervantesI wanted this play to be different from anything I’d ever written, and I wanted to find a new way of working, so I decided to write it in concentrated bursts that would culminate in brief workshops I would organise a few times every year. And I wanted to build my creative team in advance, before writing a word, just based on a premise. I first approached Daniel Aukin to direct. He roped in musical director Justin Craig and Ryan Rumery, our sound designer. I had been trying to work with David Zinn for years, and he agreed to do the set. And then a friend introduced me to Arcade Fire’s Will Butler; he had no idea who I was, but for whatever reason agreed to write the music for these snippets of songs we would hear over the course of the play.My problem at the outset was that I knew nothing about the recording process. I meannothing. I watched lots of documentaries and took notes and wrote down technical-sounding phrases such as “I like the tremolo effect” and “put more EQ on the amp” (which I later learned didn’t really mean anything). I constructed a few loose scenes and in 2014 did a very rough workshop, which Daniel directed. The “band” was a bunch of actor friends who played toy instruments. What I knew at this point was there were five members of this fictional Anglo-American band: Simon, the drummer; Peter, the exacting lead guitarist; Diana, the self-deprecating lead singer, who is also Peter’s girlfriend; Holly, who plays keys; and Reg, Holly’s substance-addled husband, who plays bass. The band has just started recording their sophomore LP when their first album unexpectedly climbs back up the charts, and the pressures of this new, imminent fame cause fractures in their personal and professional relationships.View image in fullscreen‘The process of collaboration was enigmatic’ …(from left): Tom Pecinka, Will Brill and Sarah Pidgeon in the Broadway production of Stereophonic.Photograph: Julieta CervantesHalfway through the first day I said to Daniel, “Shouldn’t there be more people in the studio?” Daniel then said that I had forgotten to put in an engineer. So in 2015, I added Grover, the engineer character, and took my increasingly bigger jumble of pages to John Kilgore, who had engineered for people such as Philip Glass in the analogue 1970s. John agreed to advise us. Daniel and I sat in his studio one afternoon as he pored through the rough draft page by page and painstakingly noted everything I’d gotten wrong. John also felt my engineer would need an assistant – a note which really opened up the play for me. Grover and Charlie, the two engineers, become a sort of comically beleaguered Rosencrantz and Guildenstern – a way in for the audience. John walked me through all the phases of recording: laying down tracks, overdubbing vocals, adding in harmonies, mixing and so on. I started to realise that if I wanted to show how an album gets made in a painstaking, granular way that subverts how rock bands are traditionally depicted in dramatic works, then this was not going to be a slim one-act.The play grew to two acts, then three and then four. I knew the length and technical demands would probably make it un-producible, but I put on my playwright blinders (deny reality and pretend everything you write is viable until further notice!) and kept going.We continued like this for the next few years, developing the play one workshop at a time. My creative team became trusted advisers and, in some cases, my dramaturgs. I spent an entire afternoon grilling Ryan on how one might fix a drum sound, and how that fix would make the sound worse, and how one might try to fixthat, and howthatfix would make it evenworse,and so on. From this conversation, I built a sequence that became the opening of the second act.View image in fullscreenCrazy experiment … (from left): Lucy Karczewski, Zachary Hart, Jack Riddiford and Chris Stack in the West End production of Stereophonic.Photograph: Craig SugdenI dictated whole scenes to my assistant, Julia, and had her read back what I’d extemporised in character; we’d then finesse those lines for hours, and with her help I’d score everything out on the page. David made us a little model for the set and cardboard figures we could move around between the sound and control rooms to figure out who was in what room when, as the logistics were starting to make us crazy.In the spring of 2019, four and a half years after he agreed to be part of this crazy experiment, I finally had a draft to show Will. He and I met Justin, Ryan and Daniel, and we all read the play aloud. At this point I knew precisely how many songs I needed, what they were meant to feel like, when they would recur in new arrangements and so on. Will now had something concrete to respond to, so he went away for a bit to do what he called his “Stanislavski work” (which I thought was so cute).The process of getting the music we needed was not so easy or immediate, but Will was very invested in getting it right. His Stanislavski thing involved getting into the minds and histories of the characters as written, and imagining where their heads were at in the summer of 1976, and who their musical influences might be from the 50s and 60s. He then sent a batch of songs to Daniel and me – two of which, Masquerade and Seven Roads, made the cut. There was a great song for Holly we couldn’t use called In Your Arms but Will later ended up recording it for the cast album. Another song in that first batch was meant to be Diana’s big number in act one, but I thought the lyrics felt too angry and punishing. I loved the melody, but wanted the lyrics to have more of a feeling of uncanniness – like something is starting to surface to awareness but she’s not there yet. Somehow this led to Will speeding up the song and turning it to something akin to a moody Giorgio Moroder synth thing. I really loved it, but I knew it wouldn’t fit Diana’s arc dramaturgically. So we ended up giving that song to Holly, and Will had to write a new song for Diana, which turned out to be Bright.View image in fullscreenDavid Adjmi accepts the best play award for Stereophonic at the Tony awards in New York in 2024.Photograph: Brendan McDermid/ReutersIt wasn’t merely character stuff Will had to deal with; there were carefully constructed problems centring on the creation of the songs themselves – though when I wrote the draft the songs didn’t exist, so Will had to reverse-engineer everything. For instance, characters in act two argue over a bass riff, one that would be debated repeatedly over the course of the play. Will’s task was to make each version of the riff make not only musical sense, butdramaticsense in a way that built the stakes. In act two, Simon can’t get a drum to sound the way Peter wants it, and I wrote detailed descriptions of Peter’s complaint (around a drum part that didn’t yet exist) in the dialogue. So Will took the details around that complaint as written and wrote a song that did all the drum stuff Peter demanded in that moment.Stereophonic review – dazzling 70s-set music saga is a Broadway triumphRead moreJustin worked his magic in a similar way, figuring out orchestrations to Will’s songs which, according to the story, are meant to go from pretty good to greatin real time, sometimes over the course of a single scene. The process of collaboration was enigmatic, and none of this should have worked: I was asking too much of everyone, and I required a degree of expertise from my collaborators in areas that weren’t really anyone’s areas of expertise. But everyone loved what we were making and they rose to the challenge. Stereophonic is a play about artistic collaboration that was born from a soul-crushing collaborative process – but our collaborative process was heaven on earth. I just happened to fall in with a group of crazy geniuses who were mavericks and up for anything. I got very, very lucky.Stereophonic is at theDuke of York’s theatre, London, 24 May-11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsWest EndBroadwayArcade FireLed ZeppelinMusic industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The theme is woman, the theme is marginalised people, the theme is to be a voice to the voiceless community.”Mushtaq, from the Karnataka region of southern India, has been “awake all night”, she says, as we speak on the morning after she won theInternational Booker prizein London for her book Heart Lamp. The prize is shared between Mushtaq and her translator Deepa Bhasthi, who is also present – and also had no sleep.View image in fullscreenIt’s a year of firsts for the International Booker: this is the first time that a collection of stories has won; it’s the first winner from the Kannada language; and it’s Mushtaq’s first book to appear in English. At 77, she is also the oldest winner.Yet Mushtaq, a lawyer and social activist as well as a writer, has been publishing stories since 1981; Heart Lamp represents just a selection from her career. They are powerful accounts of the lives of Muslim women in Karnataka, portraying terrible experiences – domestic violence, deaths of children. In the final story, a woman is glad she gave birth to a boy instead of another girl. “At least we had not created another helpless prisoner of life like me.”Do these stories reflect how things still are for women in the region? “Yes,” says Mushtaq. “Even today. It starts from the home itself.”But the stories have wider application too. For example, any parent can empathise with the woman in one story,Red Lungi, struggling to entertain her children during the summer holidays. “Even though these stories are set in a certain community in a certain geographical location,” says Bhasthi, who was born and still lives in Madikeri in the Western Ghat mountains, just 60 miles or so from Mushtaq’s home town. “I think the ideas and stories are absolutely universal.”How does Mushtaq’s work as a lawyer and activist inform her writing? “They are the fields where I sow the seeds of my stories. When people come to me with a legal issue, they want to share all their feelings […] which haunt me like anything. It goes on growing and then one day, I craft it into a short story.”Can stories change things, the way a legal case can? “Of course, because people will not know what rights they have got, and how silent suffering is not the solution. They can fight back. That insight is given through my stories.” In the story Black Cobras, a woman is informed that Islam does allow women to be educated and to work, but the scriptures are “twisted” by scholars for their own benefit. “Do not beg,” she is told. “Demand justice.”Amid the darkness of Mushtaq’s stories there is comedy too: in A Decision of the Heart, a man seeks a new husband for his widowed mother; but one of her suitors, a “dandy” with “the womanising disease”, is chased out of town covered in shit from a septic tank. Jokes, Mushtaq explains, enable her to be honest without causing offence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

If I do it in a very serious tone, I will be liable for whatever consequences there are. So I give it a sarcastic turn. I intentionally use that strategy instead of undergoing self-censorship.” Bhasthi adds that in this story, “The underlying theme is that women are being controlled by men, even when it comes across as a joke.”Mushtaq writes in the tradition of Bandaya Sahitya (literally “protest literature”), a “brief but highly influential movement”, as Bhasthi puts it, which arose in the 1970s against a literary landscape that was “mostly male, mostly upper caste”. The movement, whose slogan was, “If you are a writer, you are also a fighter”, “encouraged women and minority writers to write in their own registers” and, adds Mushtaq, “opened a gateway to all the downtrodden, marginalised and ignored people who didn’t have a voice”.And although Mushtaq’s work has always been popular inIndia– “my literature is people’s literature”, she says – her openness sometimes gets her in trouble: those “consequences” she spoke of earlier. In 2000, she was subject to a fatwa – an Islamic legal decree – after saying that “Islam had never prohibited women from entering mosques and praying there” but rather that the patriarchs in certain mosques were “denying it unlawfully”.So, she tells me, “some mosque authorities got offended and laid a fatwa against me, saying you are not among Muslims, you cannot socialise with Muslim people”. They lifted the fatwa “after three months, but during that time I suffered a lot due to it. But nowadays,” she adds, “theyareallowing women to pray inside the mosque”.Things are improving for women and minorities in India in some ways, Mushtaq says. “They’re progressing in higher education. But even then there are issues due to the patriarchy. If a girl of one community wants to marry a boy of another community, there will be issues.”Bhasthi agrees. “It’s better than yesterday,” she concludes, “but there is still a very, very long way to go.”Explore more on these topicsBooksInternational Booker prizeAwards and prizesFictionFiction in translationIndiainterviewsShareReuse this content"

Does it add value or reflect YouTube’s increasing might?Fiona SturgesFri 23 May 2025 08.00 EDTShareIt is four in the afternoon at Pellicci’s, a family-run cafe on Bethnal Green Road in London that has been an East End institution for 125 years. Its famously loudmouthed owners, British-Italian siblings Nevio and Anna, have been serving fry-ups, soups, pasta and jam roly-polies since eight this morning. The cafe is now closed, but Anna and Nevio are just getting started on their second job as hosts of the podcast seriesDown the Caff, in which they interview people about food and life over a meal of the guest’s choosing. The conversations are sweary, chaotic and an absolute hoot.Their guests so far include actor and Pellicci’s regular Ray Winstone, Dexys’ Kevin Rowland, rapper Hak Baker and 86-year-old YouTuber Marge Keefe, AKA Grime Gran. Today’s interviewees are TikTok star John Fisher, AKA Big John, and his son, the boxer Johnny Fisher. When I tell Anna she must be due a lie down, she says: “Tell me about it. In fact, tell him!” pointing at their longsuffering producer George Sexton-Kerr, who is busy moving Formica tables around to make way for the film crew.Why the film crew, I hear you ask? Podcasts are for ears, not eyes, aren’t they? It’s because the past 18 months have brought a shift in how pods are consumed, with scores of shows moving into video. In February, YouTube announced it had 1 billion monthly users watching podcast content, meaning the platform has leapfrogged Spotify (which in 2023 reported 100 million regular podcast listeners) and Apple to become the market leader. Little wonder Spotify is trying to catch up, with many of its top podcasts, including TheJoe RoganExperience, The Mel Robbins Podcast and Call Her Daddy now publishing in video.This year, the BBC launched The Traitors: Uncloaked and Uncanny: Post Mortem in video as well as audio formats, while Business Insider has reported that Netflix is also preparing to move into visualised pods. Reflecting this trend, the British Podcast awards has this year added a new visual innovation award for “outstanding visual podcasting”. All of which means, like it or not, visualised podcasts – or vodcasts, as some are calling them – are happening.Speaking to both listeners and creators about this brave new audiovisual world, it seems opinions are divided. Dedicated audiophiles quite reasonably ask why they would want to watch a podcast when their TV to-watch list is already out of control, but others say they enjoy having a choice and it can be fun to see the hosts whose voices they know so well. I also spoke to several independent audio producers who don’t wish to be named, who worry about YouTube’s dominance over the industry and are sceptical of audio being restyled as “crap telly”.That’s not to say that visualised podcasts are expected to compete with mainstream TV: just as celebrity interviewer Amelia Dimoldenberg, the host of YouTube’s Chicken Shop Date, can exist alongside Graham Norton on the BBC, so can visualised pods exist in parallel with better resourced and produced television shows. Nonetheless, as a listener and podcast critic, I confess I too have reservations. For me, the delight of audio lies in the intimacy of having voices and soundscapes piped straight into my ears and sparking my imagination. Plus, I do most of my listening while doing other things such as cooking and walking the dog. The last thing I need is another form of entertainment that requires me to gape at a screen.Seeing fun, silly or serious stuff makes someone far more likely to hit Follow on the podcast appMatt DeeganI am, however, up for watching pods where the visuals have a clear purpose and Down the Caff, which launched last year, is absolutely one of those. Sexton-Kerr, a radio and pod producer who took two years to persuade Anna and Nevio to make the series, imagined it as an audiovisual package from the off. “I always wanted it to be a multifaceted thing. It’s partly about the food, and Anna and Nev, who are this brilliant double act. But it’s also about the beauty of just sitting in here over a cup of tea and having a chat. It’s a grade II-listed building with all this art deco panelling and you need to see that.”Nevio adds that, during the first couple of episodes, “Me and Anna didn’t know what we were doing, so it’s a lot of people shouting over each other. But we’ve got better, mainly because George has been telling us off. We’re thinking a bit more about how it will work [in audio and visual mediums] now.”When my producer friends talk about pods as “crap telly”, they are referring to interview pods and chat-casts that, in theory, lend themselves to a visual format. For productions such as Begin Again With Davina McCall, Fashion Neurosis With Bella Freud or Call Her Daddy, this means you see hosts and interviewees on TV sets arranged like fancy living rooms complete with coffee-table books and mood lighting.Often, though, it’s a camera squeezed into a sound booth or, worse, a crummy Zoom recording. One such offender isThe Rest Is Politics, the chart-topping series presented byRory Stewart and Alastair Campbell. Since the hosts are rarely in the same place, viewers invariably watch them in split screen, each beaming in fuzzily from their respective hotel rooms or home offices. Not for nothing did YouTube executive Pedro Pina recently say that The Rest Is Politics “feels like a high school [production]”, adding that “viewers determine the production values that they’re prepared to accept” – a polite way of saying that the show’s audience don’t care about quality.Matt Deegan, a partner at the podcast marketing company Podcast Discovery, says: “For some audiences it’s less about consuming a podcast and more about consuming ‘a show’. There are definitely younger audiences who don’t listen to audio podcasts but are very comfortable on YouTube.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionNo matter the production values, the video versions can be easily clipped up for social media, boosting audience awareness of the shows. For a podcast looking to grow its audience, says Deegan, “the repetition of seeing fun, informative, silly or serious stuff from a show makes someone far more likely to hit Follow on their podcast app”. This is echoed by Sexton-Kerr, who notes: “We’re sticking minute-long Down the Caff reels up on Insta and TikTok and we’re getting more than 400,000 views on some of them. You can’t pay for that kind of publicity.”For interview pods, the benefit of video content is clear, not least because it’s straightforward to make. Turning a narrative podcast into a decent visual proposition is a far bigger challenge, though there are already podcasters giving it a go. George Mpanga (AKA George the Poet) and Benbrick, creators ofHave You Heard George’s Podcast?, the Peabody award-winning series about race, history and culture, are in the process of going back over their audio episodes and remaking them for a video audience.“We need to go where the audience is,” Benbrick explains. “Even if your strategy is audio-first, it is insane to leave out [YouTube]. And if you’re going there, you might as well give that content the best chance to resonate. It kind of feels you can do anything right now, so we’re trying it out and seeing what it could look like. I don’t think it’s in its final form yet.”Does all this spell doom for audio? While some in the industry worry that visualised content could further squeeze indie podcasters out of a crowded market, Benbrick believes it will create space “for productions that really consider their audio. With video content it’s hard to do really intricate audio work and, as a producer, I want what I put out to sound beautiful. This is a moment to make exceptional work.”Back at Pellicci’s, as Nevio plonks down two enormous platefuls of jam tart on our table, Sexton-Kerr says he is certain it will all shake out. “It’s like that song Video Killed the Radio Star, isn’t it? But we still have radio stars. I have podcasts that I still love listening to, so I think there’s space for both. They’ll just live next door to each other.”Explore more on these topicsPodcastsYouTubeSpotifyVideo on demandDigital music and audiofeaturesShareReuse this content"

This claim is based on the fact that KKR is a major investor in the German media company Axel Springer, which runs ads for developments in the occupied territories on Israel’s Yad2 classified ad site, owned by Springer.In June 2024, KKR, a US investment company with an estimated $710bn (£526bn) in assets, paid €1.3bn (£1.09bn) to acquire the entertainment company Superstruct and with it a controlling interest in 80 music festivals across 10 European countries and Australia.KKR’s portfolio includes energy companies, the US publisher Simon & Schuster and Thames Water.Spain’s culture minister Ernest Urtasun said that KKR is “not welcome in Spain”, adding that “for many years it’s been policy that companies with economic interests in illegal settlements in Palestine cannot operate normally in the European Union”.Sónar issued a statement in which it dissociated itself from KKR’s financial activities, over which it has no control, and reaffirmed its commitment to diversity and human rights.KKR declined to comment on the allegations of its links to Israel and referred the Guardian to Superstruct’s statement in which the latter company says it is “horrified by the scale of suffering” in Gaza, adding that, despite KKR’s acquisition, Superstruct remains “independently run, making its own decisions based on what is in the best interests of our fans, artists and colleagues”.Asked what more Sónar could do, given that it didn’t choose its owner, Lolo of Lolo & Sosaku, said: “What I don’t get is people who defend Sónar saying it isn’t KKR when in some sense it is, because Sónar was a family and now it isn’t. When you sell yourself to something like Superstruct you know what’s going to happen and you’ve lost touch with the essence of what you were about to begin with.”The Netherlands-based Animistic Beliefs cancelled their Sónar show because they claim KKR profits from “war, climate destruction and systems of oppression”, adding that “we know no space is free from contradiction but somewhere the line has to be drawn”.The band La Élite say they are boycotting the FIB festival in July which is held in Benicassìm, near Valencia, because of its association with KKR.“People are frustrated and feel a need to dissociate themselves from these festivals and obviously no one wants their money to go directly to these bastards,” the band told the Guardian.“The ways things stand, the mere fact of calling things by their name, that is, genocide, amounts to making a stand,” they said. “Beyond that, it’s up to everyone and their conscience to do what they can.”At least 15 artists have also pulled out of this weekend’s Field Day festival in London, also owned by Superstruct. In a statement, Field Day, which says it had no say in the KKR takeover, said: “We would like to say, clearly and directly, that we stand with the people of Gaza and support the peaceful aims of the Palestinian civil organisations and everyone working tirelessly to give them a voice.”Last year Sónar+D, a programme that runs alongside the festival dedicated to innovation and technology, received around €880,000 (£740,000) in subsidies from the Catalan government,Barcelonacity council and the EU. Neither the regional government nor the city council subsidises the music festival.Explore more on these topicsFestivalsDance musicIsraelSpainBarcelonaEuropeIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian has contacted representatives for Bambaataa for comment.Judge Alexander M Tisch granted the plaintiff a default judgment “without opposition” in New York state’s supreme court.Bambaataa has faced numerous allegations of molesting boys.In 2016, the Democratic party activist and former music industry executive Ronald Savage alleged that Bambaataa had repeatedly abused him in 1980, when he was 15 and Bambaataa 23. In 2024 he recanted his allegations, saying that he met Bambaataa at a club he had used a fake ID to enter.“Bambaataa is not a paedophile and, in my eyes, he was doing something that was consensual with someone that he thought was of age,” he told AllHipHop. “I wish, back in 2016, I remembered about the fake ID.”At the time, the allegations prompted more alleged victims to come forward, with Rolling Stone reporting that 12 men in total – not including Savage – have accused Bambaataa of sexual impropriety.A man claiming to be a former bodyguard for Bambaataa, Shamsideen Shariyf Ali Bey, said: “I’ve walked in on stuff where I say: ‘What the fuck is going on.’ He travels with late teens. Those are the ones he takes overseas with him. When I went with him on tour in the states, I would stay in one room and he would have boys in the room with him.”The musician denied all allegations in a 2016 interview with Fox 5 News, but left his position as the head of his Universal Zulu Nation organisation: “I never abused nobody. You know, it just sounds crazy for people to say that, to hear: ‘You abused me.’ You know all my people back then, you know the hundreds of people that been around me. If something like that happened, why you never went to none of them?”Alongside DJ Kool Herc, Bambaataa was one of the originators of hip-hop and began throwing block parties in the South Bronx in the 1970s.In the UK,Rape Crisisoffers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 inScotland, or 0800 0246 991 inNorthern Ireland.

It was because believing in the possibilities of peace was then, and is now, a rebellious act; and some would say a ridiculous one.”Speaking in London, he said: “To believe peace was attainable between your country and ours, between our country and itself was a ridiculous idea because peace creates possibilities in the most intractable situations and lord knows there’s a few of them out there right now.”He added: “Hamas, release the hostages, stop the war.Israel, be released from Benjamin Netanyahu and the far-right fundamentalists that twist your sacred texts.”He also called for the protection of aid workers: “The best of us. God, you must be so tired of us, children of Abraham, in the rubble of our certainties. Children in the rubble of our revenge. God forgive us.”Charli xcx named songwriter of the year at Ivor Novello awardsRead moreSunday Bloody Sunday was released in 1983, and takes its theme from the 1972 massacre in which the British army shot and killed 14 unarmed protesters, the highest shooting death toll during the Troubles.Bono has previously dedicated U2’s 1984 song Pride (In the Name of Love)to the victims of the Supernova music festivalattack in October 2023. In January, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Joe Biden.Bono recently confirmed that U2 were recording a new album, and said “it sounds like the future to me. We had to go through some stuff, and we’re at the other end of it.” U2’s last album was Songs of Surrender. Released in 2023, it comprised stripped down re-recordings of 40 songs from the band’s catalogue.A film of Bono’s stage show, Stories of Surrender, debuted last week at the Cannes film festival. “Impressively, Bono does his best to descend from rock god to rock human,” Guardian film critic Peter Bradshawwrote in a three-star review.Explore more on these topicsMusicBonoU2Ivor Novello awardsAwards and prizesIsraelIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

She is one of five female performers, of varying ages, inhabiting this domestic setting – sofa, coffee table, lamp, pot plant – where the ordinariness swerves into the surreal. Suddenly one woman is smooshing a tomato into her face. Another’s head becomes disjointed from her body in an amusing bit of optical illusion. There’s a blankness about these women, but also a hunger.View image in fullscreenUnpretty but powerful … Becky Namgauds’ The Heat at Sadler’s Wells.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellThe Heat is inspired by Paula Rego’sDog Woman paintings, depicting women behaving like dogs, with animalistic poses and bared teeth. It’s an unpretty side of womanhood, but powerful too. Namgauds has also definitely watched some Pina Bausch (just look at all that long hair swishing luxuriously!) with these absurdist set pieces, only it’s a more suburban version: admonishing a sofa cushion, feeling frisky while vacuuming and so on.The pivotal scene begins when one woman puts a fuchsia-pink vibrator on a table; switched on, it starts to do a little dance of its own. Across the room, a different woman suddenly starts vibrating. Then it’s catching, soon they’re all quaking: pure instinct, pure sensation-seeking, desperate for friction. Poor Henry the Hoover is all I will say.This is an unapologetic depiction of female instincts and what’s suppressed beneath the surface. Namgauds has got something, for sure. But is there enough of it in this piece? It feels like a strong 40 minutes stretched to 60. Still, she’s one to watch.AtSadler’s Wells, London, until 23 May, then atthe Lowry, Salford, on 3 JuneExplore more on these topicsDanceTheatrePaula RegoSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Johnny’s copy of what he later identifies as A Susan Sontag Reader is an heirloom. It has been extensively underlined by his mother, who has just died, and by his estranged half-brother Lawrence. Johnny wonders if reading Sontag, or his family’s other heavily annotated books, will “unlock a secret or hint at one, offer a glimpse of their dreams or invite them into mine”.A Susan Sontag Reader includes Sontag’s 1968 defence of Jean-Luc Godard, the great modernist and Marxist provocateur of French New Wave cinema. If Johnny, in search of family connection, happened to read that essay, he would encounter a paragraph that rather neatly describes the novel that he is in the process of narrating. Godard’s films, Sontag writes, “show an interrelated group of fictional characters located in a recognisable, consistent environment: in his case, usually contemporary and urban”. But “while the sequence of events in a Godard film suggests a fully articulated story, it doesn’t add up to one […] actions are often opaque, and fail to issue into consequences”.There is almost always a kind of ulterior quality to the debut novel of a very good critic, stemming perhaps from a willed suppression of all that the critic knows about novels – how they can go wrong, how they must go right. And a very good critic is what Leo Robson is. For years he has been publishing long, formidably intelligent essays and reviews in venues including the New Statesman, the New Yorker and the London Review of Books. He is one of a handful of working critics worth reading not merely for the rigour of his arguments but for the pleasures of his unfailingly witty prose. He is a great articulator of minority opinions, having dared, among recent sallies, to defend the unfashionable oeuvre of Joyce Carol Oates, diss the films of Pedro Almodóvar, and express deep scepticism about Paul Murray’s widely belovedThe Bee Sting.Johnny’s older half-brother, Lawrence, is the book’s magnetic core: half hooligan, half intellectualWith such a reputation, the actual production of a first novel could be construed as either reckless or brave. And the fact that The Boys more or less begins with its narrator reading Susan Sontag might perhaps ring alarm bells, not least because Sontag herself, a superb critic, wasn’t much cop as a novelist. But one of the interesting things about The Boys is the way in which it both invites and refuses a “literary” or “critical” reading. As in Sontag’s account of Godard’s films, The Boys goes to some trouble to avoid being obviously “novelistic”. It has no clanging symbols or coy thematic statements. Scenes and even sentences appear ready to lurch toward event, toward meaning, only to collapse abruptly into a bemusing bathos. It is a pottering-about sort of book. It delivers great pleasure, actually, at the level of humble perception, of anticlimax.It does indeed remind you of a French New Wave film – not one of Godard’s spiky assaults on bourgeois complacency, but perhaps something gentler by François Truffaut (who is not mentioned) or Eric Rohmer (who is). Setting and period are hyperspecific: certain parts of London, in and around Swiss Cottage, during the 2012 Olympics. (In some ways it’s a London-geography novel, a tube-nerd’s dream.) The narrator, Johnny, seems to be looking for love – but is he? He has a girlfriend, whom we barely meet, named Chloe. He muses on the history of his family, Viennese Jews who fled to London during the second world war. His older half-brother, Lawrence, is the book’s magnetic core: half hooligan, half intellectual, passionate about city planning and social care. Around Lawrence’s charismatic instability, the Voghel family revolve and reshuffle their priorities.A plot, sort of: Johnny and Lawrence repair their estrangement; Lawrence’s teenage son Jasper is having a baby with his girlfriend LouLou; Johnny, in trying to find Lawrence a job, discovers himself, in the novel’s longest section, deeply attracted to two young postgrad students at the university where he works as an administrator, Harvey (male) and Rory (female). This is a bit Jules et Jim, except that it doesn’t quite go anywhere. Instead, Robson lets us hang out with his characters until we find ourselves thinking of them as real people.The Boys, in its prose and in its structure, is almost entirely made up of odd kinks of specificity – as are we all, of course, and as is the world. Hardly bothering with the conventions of “the novel”, it nonetheless – or perhaps I mean therefore – creates a mood that is less like fiction and more like life. It is a rather luminous, eccentric and memorable book.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s a high-octane, unpredictable mix, only unified by the fact that when Debbie is on the decks, the energy is up.Bringing this ungovernable, quickfire sensibility to club lineups alongside the likes of Welsh producer Kelly Lee Owens and American rapper Zack Fox, Ijaduola has recently been releasing her own productions, seemingly taking inspiration from the need to get her crowds moving and to keep them on the floor. Her debut release, 2024’s Juicy for Ya, easily fulfilled that premise with its chipmunk-tuned vocal sample and skittering kick drums, primed to reverberate through the body when firing out of a large speaker stack, while this year’s No Signal channels an Eric Prydz-style trance synth.It might sound like an irreverent set of tunes but on her upcoming debut EP Jellyfish, Ijaduola gets more serious. Darker, heavier and intensely propulsive, across its seven tracks there are shades of Goldie’s Rufige Kru alias on the hammering drum’n’bass of Medusa, Special Request’s chopped breakbeats on the title track and Coki’s bass weight on Float. This is lively music to inspire the late-night crew. And yet, in Medusa there’s also a joyous sample of what sounds like Homer Simpson screaming; on Jellyfish a jazz Rhodes lick tastefully rolls through, maintaining the chaotic playfulness that ultimately makes Ijaduola’s music so hard to resist.Ammar KaliaThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenHeartwarming … Wednesday.Photograph: Graham TolbertWednesday – Elderberry WineElderberries can heal – but make you puke when eaten raw, says Wednesday’s Karly Hartzman, taking them as inspiration for this pedal-steel-sweetened heartwarmer about striking the right balance in relationships.LSKieran Hebden and William Tyler – If I Had a BoatAfter 2023’s Darkness, Darkness, the guitarist and producer unveil a full-length album, led by this 11-minute Lyle Lovett cover: fine acoustic chiming fractures into pointillist, dancing electronics.LSMark William Lewis – TomorrowIs PerfectThe superb London singer-songwriter, who sits somewhere between Dean Blunt and Prefab Sprout, is the first signing to A24’s in-house label.

Recorded with drummer Mark Richardson in recovery and bassist Cass undergoing chemotherapy, their first album in nine years confronts such issues with candour and defiance. Opener An Artist Is an Artist stridently lays down the manifesto: over an infectious collision of electro-pop and post-punk, singer Skin insists that a true creative will not be denied by ageing or menopause. The vocalist subsequently addresses challenges ranging from the hedonistic rock lifestyle to her own family history.View image in fullscreenSkunk Anansie: The Painful Truth.Musically, producer David Sitek of TV on the Radio has urged them to throw off the shackles of their 90s rock sound and be unafraid to go wherever experimentation takes them. Songs hurtle through electronic rock, ska, dub and even tinkling pianos as moods shift from urgent to ethereal. Singer Skin digs deep into her personal well for Shame (“I got the love from my mother, the pain from my dad”), but allows a moment of euphoria on the catchy My Greatest Moment. The album’s sense of emotional investment and creative rejuvenation reaches a sublime apex with the closing track, Meltdown. Skin’s delicate vocals give the song about a lonely breakdown a raw, disarming beauty.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Karen is in remission from a schizophrenic episode, but as her mental state deteriorates again, the quartet’s private despairs about love, God and creativity surface in traumatic fashion.SWSaturday 24 May, 6.45am, Sky Cinema GreatsShrekView image in fullscreenYou’ll watch this happily ever after … Shrek.Photograph: ReutersDreamWorks’ gag-a-minute2001 animationtook a wrecking ball to classic fairytales and ended up writing its own enduring fable (three sequels and counting). Mike Myers tries out his Scottish accent as the titular grumpy green ogre, who is blackmailed by evil ruler Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) to rescue a trapped princess, Cameron Diaz’s Fiona, from a dragon. With Eddie Murphy on great form as Shrek’s comic relief sidekick Donkey and a wealth of parodic cameos – from Pinocchio to the Three Blind Mice – you’ll watch this happily ever after.Sunday 25 May, 5.05pm, ITV2The Importance of Being EarnestView image in fullscreen‘A handbag?!’ … Joan Greenwood, Michael Redgrave and Michael Denison in The Importance of Being Earnest.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyOscar Wilde’s scintillating dialogue transfers well from stage to screen in Anthony Asquith’s definitive 1952 version of his drawing-room comedy. Michael Redgrave and Michael Denison are the two young men whose romantic designs on Joan Greenwood and Dorothy Tutin’s English roses lead them into a pseudonymous tangle. But despite the comic skills of Greenwood and Margaret Rutherford as governess Miss Prism it’s Edith Evans’s intimidating Lady Bracknell who rules the roost. “A handbag?” will never sound the same again.Monday 26 May, 11.10pm, Talking Pictures TVskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The plot also pivots round the Wolverine-tested metal adamantium, which is a source of conspiracy and conflict. But with actors of the calibre of the noble Mackie, plus Giancarlo Esposito and Tim Blake Nelson as the Cap’s new foes, and Harrison Ford as dubious new US president Thaddeus Ross, the performances should more than compensate.Wednesday 28 May, Disney+The Big HeatView image in fullscreenSparky and witty … Gloria Grahame and Glenn Ford The Big Heat.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyShe may only have a supporting role, but Gloria Grahame’s sparky, witty turn as a gangster’s girlfriend is the principal joy of Fritz Lang’s propulsive1953 crime drama. Headline name Glenn Ford is a solid presence as honest cop Dave Bannion, whose investigation into the suicide of a fellow officer leads him to a city mob boss. Bannion’s persistent dog-with-a-bone riles the criminal’s psychotic right-hand man Vince (Lee Marvin), with the latter’s girl Debby (Grahame) among the collateral damage as the detective edges closer to the truth.Wednesday 28 May, 6.10am, Sky Cinema GreatsBono: Stories of SurrenderView image in fullscreenThe sweetest thing … Bono: Stories of Surrender.Photograph: Courtesy of AppleThe U2 frontman’s one-man show, based on his memoir, isnow a filmcourtesy of Andrew Dominik – who has form in the field of rock star confessionals, notably about Nick Cave. It is an intimate, engrossing piece, shot in crisp black-and-white with sparse lighting. Bono is a confident raconteur, as he relays anecdotes from his life – meeting his future wife and starting the band in the same week; Live Aid and his political campaigning; chatting in the pub with his dad – candidly and self-deprecatingly, while excerpts from U2’s songs act as commentary on his experiences.Friday 30 May, Apple TV+Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe seven best films to watch on TV this weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Q“Do you ever wonder why people hate you?” Carl Morck (Matthew Goode) never seems unduly concerned about this question. Carl is a rogue cop: brilliant on his day but relentlessly abrasive and traumatised by a shooting. His bosses don’t know what to do with him, so they bury him in a back office with a couple of other misfits and dump a huge file of cold cases on his desk. It’s difficult not to think of Slow Horses, butDept Qstruggles to hit similar heights. The characters lack comparable depth and the dialogue never quite stings or soars. However, as Morck reopens the case of a missing prosecutor, his relationship with lackey turned saving grace Akram (Alexej Manvelov) adds levity.Phil HarrisonNetflix, from Thursday 29 MayAdultsView image in fullscreenRoomies … Jack Innanen as Paul Baker, Amita Rao as Issa in Adults.Photograph: Rafy/FXGetting houseshare comedies right is tricky; living circumstances can’t be too bleak but err in the opposite direction and you’re left, Friends-style, with waiting staff occupying prime New York real estate. This latest attempt (by Tonight Show writers Ben Kronengold and Rebecca Shaw) is at least scrappier and more plausible than that – the slightly boilerplate gen Z characters work dead-end jobs and ponder OnlyFans stardom to boost their meagre incomes. There’s hedonism, romantic misadventure and existential doubt. It all feels a little broad but, as is the case with adulthood generally, it’s fine once it gets going.PHDisney+, from Thursday 29 MayCold Case: The Tylenol MurdersView image in fullscreenPuzzling … James Lewis in Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThis documentary series explores an extraordinary (and still unsolved) true crime story from the US. Inlate 1982, people started dying after using over-the-counter painkiller Tylenol. It soon became obvious why when tests found pills tainted with cyanide. But how did it happen? Theories abound, all of which are explored here. But an extra layer of complexity arrived in the shape of James William Lewis, who attempted to extort $1m from the manufacturers of the drug by offering to stop the murders – but whose timeline seemed to clear him of the poisoning itself.PHNetflix, from Monday 26 MayF1: The AcademyView image in fullscreenNeed for speed … (from left) Bianca Bustamante, Abbi Pulling and Doriane Pin in F1: The Academy.Photograph: NetflixTheF1 Academyis an unforgiving school: young drivers have just two years to prove themselves. This latest behind-the-scenes sport series follows the 15 young women of the academy through the 2024 season and delves into their backstories. As the tension mounts, individual rivalries develop and cracks begin to show. The racing itself feels less predictable than the often process-driven world of F1, so it’s an exciting prospect for petrol-heads, but also a trailblazer for increased female participation in a traditionally male-led sport.PHNetflix, from Wednesday 28 Mayskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This intense Thai drama is a loose telling of a true story and involves a bitter rivalry in the world of express delivery couriers. Eager young driver Santi decides to launch his own company, but when he approaches tycoon Kanin to suggest a partnership, the ruthless entrepreneur simply steals his idea. Cue a tale of underdog business ambition that doubles as a revenge thriller – before long, the rivalry between the two companies escalates to a dangerous degree.PHNetflix, from Thursday 29 MayLulu Is a RhinocerosView image in fullscreenUltra-cute … Lulu Is a Rhinoceros.Photograph: Apple TVJason and Allison Flom’s children’s book – about a bulldog who looks in the mirror and sees themself as a rhinoceros – was an LGBTQ-coded parable about diversity, self-identification and acceptance. This animated TV version is set in an ultra-cute world in which no setback is a match for Lulu’s relentless positivity and kindness. It’s a message that (sadly) feels timely and even gently subversive in the current climate. Lulu is voiced by Auli’i Cravalho (of Moana fame) while Leland (the resident songwriter on RuPaul’s Drag Race) provides the soundtrack.PHApple TV+, from Friday 30 MayExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe seven best shows to stream this weekTV streamingShareReuse this content"

With no previous gardening experience, the owner Sue Manners began to work on the garden alone after buying the old hall in 1989 with husband Mike. Nowadays, the gardens are among the finest in the country. As you wander, you’ll discover a rich variety of rare and unusual flowers mingling with striking trees and beautiful shrubs. Over 100 roses bloom alongside vibrant collections of delphiniums, peonies, and irises, all set within lush, flowing borders and thoughtfully arranged island beds. Because Thornton Hall is a working farm, the gardens are onlyopen on nine daysthis summer (£10, 10am-4pm).Mike LadymanBuzzing with bees, Gotha Gardens, HertfordshireView image in fullscreenGotha Gardens was an arable field until 1990The site of the family-ownedGotha Gardensat Pembroke Farm, north Hertfordshire, was an arable field until 1990. The original plan was to create a woodland walk with plants to attract pollinators and other wildlife, but then topiary and formal areas were added. On our visit, purple delphiniums and alliums buzzed with bees, and we watched water boatmen and damselflies around the pond. Wandering through the different sections felt like visiting separate open-air rooms, with places to sit and enjoy them. We also loved the tea and scones at the garden’s small outside cafe.It’s openFriday to Monday each weekand costs only a fiver to get in.Sharon PinnerProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Stepping into this sunken Victorian garden feels like entering another world. With time to kill before catching a train home, we spent a happy afternoon exploring the 1.2-hectare (three-acre) site, walking the woodland paths and admiring the view from the Italianate terrace before enjoying a cup of tea and homemade cake to the sound of a live jug-band (part of a summer music programme). Entrance costs just £2 and the place is open 9am-6pm in spring and summer and 9am-4pm October to March. For those lucky enough to be local, each summer they host plays, music and exercise classes.LisaWild beauty by the Menai Straits, GwyneddView image in fullscreenThe Lucombe oak in Treborth Botanic Garden was first spotted in 1762.Photograph: Tracey Whitefoot/AlamyWhen I visitedTreborth Botanic Gardenin May, it was buzzing with life. Covering 18 hectares along the shores of the Menai Strait, the gardens are owned by Bangor University and blend wild beauty with careful horticulture. Informative labels guided me through a collection of fascinating plants, while a wildlife area featured a pond teeming with tadpoles and vibrant dragonflies. Glasshouses (restricted entry) host cacti and orchids. Paths through ancient woodland led down to the Menai Bridge, offering spectacular views across the strait. Treborth also boasts award-winning gardens, including a Chelsea flower show gold medal winner. It’s free to enter and open every day in daylight hours.PamelaCornwall’s perennially gorgeous peninsulaView image in fullscreenThe Orangery, Mount Edgcumbe Park.Photograph: Roy Perring/AlamyThe formal gardens at Mount Edgcumbe country parkare tucked away in the tranquil hills of the Rame peninsula, but are only a short foot-ferry trip from Plymouth. They are free to enter and cover three hectares and 500 years of historical garden design within a hedge-maze honeycomb. Bay arches serve as portals between 18th-century Italy, 19th-century France, and the distinctive flora of New Zealand. There’s ice-cream in the Regency Orangery and shady serenity in the Fern Dell. It’s not only human visitors who enjoy this area: the park is also the UK’s first reserve for rare Cornish black bees. The park and lower gardens are open all year.Charlotte RobinsmithHorticultural masterpiece, Harlow, EssexView image in fullscreenGibberd Garden has several water featuresTheGibberd Garden, just outside Harlow, Essex, is testament to one collector’s determination. From architectural salvage picked up and saved from developer’s bulldozers, to contemporary sculptures, to Staffordshire figurines displayed in the house, architect Sir Frederick Gibberd collected them all and used them to enhance the steep, stream bordered plot he bought with his wife. He diverted the stream slightly to create a moated fort for his grandchildren – complete with working drawbridge– put up a swing, a tree house, a grotto and completed the magic with imaginative planting including a glorious mosaic beech hedge. Find small treasures to delight and monumental features repurposed to impress, enhancing every twisting turn and vista. Open Wednesdays and Sundays and bank holiday Mondays; adults £6, under 16, £1.

Designed by the influential gardener Margery Fish, it’s a haven of winding paths, quirky plant combinations, and uncommon treasures tucked into every border. I visited on a drizzly spring morning and had the place almost to myself – just the scent of damp earth, the hum of bees, and the joy of discovering rare hellebores and old-fashioned roses around every corner. My tip? Go on a weekday and linger – the nursery has incredible finds to take home, and the tiny cafe serves up tea that tastes twice as good after a ramble through such quietly magical surroundings. The gardens are open Tues-Sat (10am-5pm) and cost £7 to enter, with under-16s going free.Mahesh Lakhani17th-century walls, north-west LondonChurch Gardensis a hidden gem on the outskirts of Harefield village, a few miles north of Uxbridge. The couple who own it – Kay and Patrick McHugh, a musician and an architect respectively – have worked hard for about 25 years to bring the hectare (three acres) of 17th-century walled gardens back from dereliction. The kitchen garden is a patchwork of beautifully designed features including 56 geometrically arranged organic vegetable beds. The orchard is believed to be the remains of a historically significant Renaissance pleasure garden; with a unique arcaded wall comprising 33 identical niches, very few gardens of this type survived the landscape movement. The gardens are open on Sundays (12-5pm) and bank holiday Mondays (11am-5pm), adults £7.50, children £3.Sarah BayleyIncredible vegetables, MorayView image in fullscreenSweet peas at Gordon Castle.Photograph: John Bracegirdle/AlamyWe loved our summer visit toGordon Castle’s walled garden, which is between the River Spey and the Moray coast, 50 miles east of Inverness. At about three hectares (eight acres), it is full to the brim with vegetables, fruit and flowers that inspired us in our own growing. Friendly gardeners were happy to give us insights in to what was growing and told us about their own lovely adventures in gardening. The cafe uses the garden’s delicious produce and it also has a brilliant shop. All that for £10 for adults (child, £5) in summer (or free for RHS members on Thursdays). It’s open every day, 10am-4pm, but the cafe is not open on Mondays and Tuesdays.SiobhanWinning tip: a garden dripping with temperate rainforest decorations, ArgyllView image in fullscreenRhododendrons at Ardkinglas.Photograph: Image Professionals/AlamyLovers of trees and wilder gardens must make time to head west toArdkinglas Woodland Garden, near Inverary in Argyll. At the modest price of £5 (children £2.50, open all year dawn to dusk) you can wander under towering North American conifers alongside Himalayan shrubs and native UK trees, all dripping with that lush temperate rainforest decoration of mosses and lichens. Visitors can spot red squirrels jumping on beautifully chaotic deadwood, try forest bathing in dappled light with the sweet smell of resin, and watch dippers along the burn. Ardkinglas combines a formal arboretum with the wild wood, and does it rather splendidly.LiamView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsParks and green spacesReaders' travel tipsUnited Kingdom holidaysDay tripsGardensTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I loved the flavour combinations, and was keen to incorporate similar herbaceous notes into a drink that would represent one of the four elements, as well as our new restaurant. I’ve used citrus in the form of yuzu to introduce another flavour dimension that blends in harmoniously. At the restaurant, we make big batches of the citrus syrup from spent lemons and limes, to save on wastage.EarthServes2For the syrup100g finely chopped mixed lime and lemon peel50g finely chopped basil100g sugarFor the drink80ml gin– we useDownpour Original30ml yuzu liqueur– we useChoya150ml basil and citrussyrup– see above and method30ml lime juice40ml egg white(from about 1 large egg)4 slices dehydrated lime, to garnishPut all the syrup ingredients in a medium pan, add 100g cold water and put on a medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar, for six to eight minutes. Take off the heat, leave to cool and infuse overnight or, better still, for 48 hours, then fine-strain into a clean jar, seal and store in the fridge, where it will keep for about three weeks.To build the drink, measure all the liquids into a shaker, add the egg white, then dry shake to set the white. Add ice, shake again, to chill and dilute, then fine-strain into two coupes, garnish each drink with two slices of dried lime and serve.Connor Wren, bar manager,Elements, GlasgowExplore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"

The scent can be elusive, but occasionally, on a warm, sunny day, the breeze catches those golden flowers and diffuses their distinct, sweet scent – a mingling of coconut, vanilla and almond. I’ve added lime to freshen things up, should those flavours prove a little heady or rich.Coconut, vanilla and almond cake with strawberriesWhen strawberries aren’t in season, chopped pineapple also works beautifully here.

Transfer the cake in its tin to a rack, leave to cool completely, then unmould.When you’re almost ready to serve, make the coconut icing. Combine all the ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on medium-high until the mix thickens to soft waves.Spread the icing on top of the cooled cake, then arrange the strawberries on top. Scatter over the toasted coconut, grate the zest of the lime all over the top, then slice and serve.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotFoodBakingDessertFruitNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"
