Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesAs part of the Guardian’s Against the tide series, readers aged 18 to 30 share what they love about living in their coastal town, the challenges and why they often choose to leaveByJane ClintonandAnandita AbrahamSeascape: the state of our oceans is supported byAbout this contentFri 26 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTShareIsle of Wight: ‘There are lots of retirees’View image in fullscreenMegan, a 24-year-old from theIsle of Wight, is very familiar with saying goodbye. She decided university wasn’t for her and remembers how, one by one, she waved off her friends who left the island to study. Many never came back.“I was 18, working in a pub, and I thought, ‘what am I going to do next?’” she says.Megan secured an apprenticeship and now works for an arts organisation on the island, but says her situation is unusual among her friendship group.“I’m definitely an anomaly in that I have a job that I am really passionate about and I really want to be doing,” she says. “Some of my friends here work in very seasonal, part-time employment, centred around hospitality and tourism. They work loads over the summer, but then over the winter they’re on fewer hours and a very low income and are still living at home.”She says there are few affordable housing options and as lots of properties are second homes or Airbnbs, the number of rental properties is limited, “particularly for young people, as most landlords prioritise families or ‘working professionals’”.“There’s also not a lot of opportunity here in terms of social activities for my age group – there are no nightclubs, for example,” she says. “There is an older demographic, with lots of retirees, and it feels like 18- to 35-year-olds are a missing group here.”Between the last two censuses in 2011 and 2021, the number of people aged 65 to 74 on the islandrose by 26.7%. The average age in the area is 51, markedly higher than the average in England of 40.Megan says that the prevailing narrative encouraging young people to “escape” is frustrating.“Adults saying you have to leave the island to succeed and if you don’t leave that you’re ‘settling’ is unhelpful,” she says. “Then they complain there are no young people here.”Berwick-upon-Tweed: ‘Everyone I know loves it’View image in fullscreenAt the other end of England, in Berwick-upon-Tweed, which borders Scotland, the two phrases often uttered by Colette, 23, and her friends are: “I need to get out” and “we’re so lucky to live in a place like this.”Most young people leave because they don’t have opportunities or their friends have already left“There is an urge to leave and go to see the rest of the world, to leave a town with an ageing population, an empty high street, closed-minded views, and a place where everyone knows each other,” she says.“But there is also a pull to stay: the increase of independent businesses, the supportive community, the festivals, the increased funding into the arts, and of course the beautiful beaches and hills.”Many of Colette’s friends moved away from Berwick because of a lack of jobs. Others have pursued training or education away from the town.Of those, many won’t be coming back.“Most young people don’t want to leave because they hate the town,” she says. “Everyone I know absolutely loves Berwick. They leave because they don’t have opportunities or their friends have already left.”Colette did return to Berwick after her degree at the University of Bristol. She has been working in a clothes shop and has applied for jobs in the town, but says others were better qualified for the roles. This has prompted her to return to university, this time to study for a master’s degree.“Can I see myself coming back here long term if there were more jobs in the creative fields? Yes. But am I studying with the idea of staying? No, I’m probably studying to leave,” she says.Great Yarmouth: ‘A culture of conservatism’View image in fullscreenJacob, 28, who is from Gorleston-on-Sea in Great Yarmouth on the east coast ofNorfolk, felt “disconnected” from his home town growing up.“My memory of looking back isn’t sunny days on the beach – it’s cold, harsh and foggy walks,” he says.“I’m a gay man, but I came out very young, when I was around 12 or 13, and I’m from a conservative town. There is a kind of culture of conservatism in the area, and so being openly gay very early meant I felt a big disconnect from my local place.“I spent a long time when I was younger with an angry mind space because leaving felt more like ‘getting out’. It felt like, ‘this place offers nothing for me.’”Sun, sea and struggle: growing up in England’s coastal towns – podcastRead moreAfter his BA degree, he moved back home and briefly worked at a college.“When you ask young people what they want to do when they grow up, they don’t know because they don’t have a frame of reference,” he says. “A lot of people will be interested in fashion or photography, but they don’t want to move away. It’s a confidence thing and a sense of inertia that comes with the depression of the place.”Jacob moved to London to do his MA, and is now trying to make a career as an artist in the capital.Ilfracombe: ‘I felt lucky to have a steady job’View image in fullscreenTom, 23, believes he would struggle to live and work in his home town of Ilfracombe, northDevon, without support from his parents.“Ilfracombe is a wonderful place to live if you enjoy outdoor sports like I do,” he says. “Every time I go up on the cliffs at sunset I feel extraordinarily grateful to live here.In terms of big career prospects, it’s pretty dire. That’s a big problem in these areas“But there are challenges. There is a distinct lack of job opportunities in the area, and combined with the high cost of housing, it feels almost impossible for someone like me, who grew up here, to have a sustainable living without my parents’ support.”Central Ilfracombe is the most deprived neighbourhood in Devon and among the 20% most deprived areas nationwide, according to theIndex of Multiple Deprivation, as reported by Devon Community Foundation.Tom had been looking for jobs in Manchester and Bristol, but secured a temporary position with a local authority close to home, and then landed a permanent role.“I feel very lucky to have a steady and salaried job, as there aren’t many like it here,” he says.“I am living at home, my expenses are very low, and I am saving money, so I could possibly have a deposit a few years down the line, but a lot of people are renting and in low-paid seasonal work, living hand to mouth, so they are just not able to save and are unable to buy a property. In terms of big career prospects, it’s pretty dire. That’s a big problem in these areas, unless you can move away, build a career and then maybe come back.”Eastbourne: ‘I told my kids, you’ve got to get out’View image in fullscreenIt’s not just young adults who got in touch. Marty, a teacher from Eastbourne, has two children: one 19-year-old son and a daughter who is at university.“There are no opportunities here for young kids,” she says. “I told my kids you’ve got to go to university, you’ve got to get out.“I have been here 25 years and throughout that time there’s been talk of better transport links – that hasn’t happened. Eastbourne has been ‘the next Brighton’ and ‘up and coming’ without anything actually changing.”As for what Eastbourne will be able to offer her children in the future, she is not optimistic.“I’m glad I brought my kids up here, but I worry about what is there for them as they grow into adulthood. I have to tell them, ‘there’s life beyond the Downs.’”TheAgainst the tideseries is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographerPolly Bradenand reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and WalesExplore more on these topicsAgainst the tideYoung peopleChildrenSocial exclusionIsle of WightDevonEast SussexfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Celia farts! It’s 2025’s most jaw-dropping TV momentsFrom shock Strictly news to shock flatulence, plus a roundup of the most hilarious news fails, here are the year’s wildest bits of televisionScott BryanFri 26 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 06.01 ESTShareAdolescence grips the worldOne of the mostcritically acclaimedand most watched shows of the year was Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham’s staggering Adolescence. At the heart of the plot: why did an innocent-looking kid called Jamie (Owen Cooper) commit such a brutal murder? The third episode lifted the lid. As Jamie is interviewed by psychologist Briony (Erin Doherty), we see him slowly reveal that he’s not an innocent kid, but warped by misogyny and a twisted sense of entitlement. The episode was captivating in its acting, but it stayed with you: from Jamie’s sudden switch from vulnerability to manipulation, to the moment the camera zooms in on Briony’s face as she registers who Jamie really is. Horrifying.Celia fartsNot only did The Celebrity Traitors have the best reality show casting of all time, but there were also so many scenes of hilarity and joy that it resulted in some of the best television of the year. It peaked with something no one could have anticipated:Celia Imriefarting in a tense moment at the start of a challenge. “It’s nerves, but I always own up,” admitted Imrie, as everyone else corpsed around her. Bafta has a TV moment of the year award, so I look forward to May 2026, when an acclaimed actor with a five-decade career wins a Bafta for … passing wind.‘You Ain’t My Mother’ 2.0EastEnders has had a belter of a year, from its faultless 40th anniversary live episode to an opening scene of Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden)yelling at a chicken. The soap also had a homage to one of its greatest andmost quoted scenes, when Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) yelled “you ain’t my mother!” to Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), who responded … “YES I AM!” Zoe’s high-profile return took place on the same street, in the rain, with the characters spaced just as they were when the exchange took place. Goosebumps.The Doctor regenerates into … Who?!When the BBC teamed up with Disney to help fund and distributeDoctor Who, it was anticipated that this supercharged “Whoniverse” would herald an exciting new era for the long-running sci-fi show. Yet despite some ambitious Russell T Davies storytelling, ratings sagged, Ncuti Gatwa quit and Disney decided not to renew the deal.Yet this wasn’t the most surprising part. It was the ending to the series finale The Reality War, where The Doctor regenerated into … 2005 companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper). Although we don’t know yet if she is actually The Doctor, or this is Rose again and The Doctor is somewhere else. Such a baffling cliffhanger makes you wonder … dotheyevenknow?!Tess and Claudia call it a dayAllow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

News of their departure not only blindsided viewers, but also the show’s judges, dancers and contestants. The timing was weird, too. Was it to get ahead of a tabloid paper? And why didn’t the BBC press office announce their departure at the same time? Strange.Bob Mortimer bosses itPrime Video shows are usually a hodge podge of random ideas drawn out of a hat (Lord of the Rings and the short-lived reboot of Neighbours, for instance). This year they had a bona fide hit with a super simple premise: put a bunch of comedians in a room and make them compete to get each other to laugh – without laughing themselves.It resulted in some truly unhinged television: Joe Wilkinson’s surrealspeech on the RNLI, Daisy May Cooper imitating a rollercoaster ride witha leaf blowerand the fridge being opened to find acackling Alison Hammond. The format was a playground for Bob Mortimer, who made Judi Love laugh simply bysitting on a chair. His steely resistance to humour made him the outright winner, evenbeating strong competitorRichard Ayoade. The fact that Mortimer has already been confirmed to return in the second series almost makes up for him not being in The Celebrity Traitors.Bake Off #bingate is backIn 2014, Bake Off contestant Iain thought his baked alaska was doomed after fellow contestant Diana temporarily took it out of the freezer. It resulted in him dumpinghis mixture in the bin, which he laterpresentedto judges Paul and Mary.I know. A simpler time, but I digress. Almost 10 years on, Iain, a different contestant with the same name, decided to make a tribute to the moment in his showstopper. Not by baking a baked alaska. No. He baked us the bin.Paul Hollywood later criticised the bin’s flavours (a sentence I never thought I would write). Iain (the 2025 baker) responded: “Those were Iain’s original flavours. I’m not trying to pass the buck!” Hollywood then broke the fourth wall addressing 2014 Iain. “I really didn’t like the bake. I’m so sorry.”James Acaster punches a polar bearSaturday Kitchen is usually the home of cooking demonstrations, old Rick Stein clips and if you’re lucky, somespectacular unintended innuendo. However, one episode this year went off the rails. When the public had to vote on whether James Acaster and Ed Gamble’s “food heaven” was to be cooked, loser Acaster did a dramatic overreaction,punching a polar bearthen attacking a Christmas tree. Bon appetit.‘We’re sorry we upset you, Carol’Pluribus,Vince Gilligan’s Apple TV serieswhich is like Breaking Bad meets Lost, started with protagonist Carol (Rhea Seehorn) watching on in horror as everyone around her convulses without explanation. Carol races home, turns on the television and flicks through the channels, hoping to find some reassuring news. Instead, in an almighty twist, Carol finds a man in the White House press room asking her directly to ring the number on the screen, who breaks the news to her that humanity has been taken over by a happy hive mind. But don’t worry Carol, he reassures her. “Your life is your own.”Joel’s brutal endYou can tell an OG fan of video game adaptation The Last of Us by whether they knew aboutthe death of Joel (Pedro Pascal)before it actually happened. Joel’s death was particularly brutal. A revenge attack by Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) after Joel killed her father, he was shot and repeatedly beaten with a golf club and then stabbed. Ellie (Bella Ramsey) could only look on in horror, as she saw Joel’s demise.Louis Theroux gets shovedOne of the standout documentaries of the year was when Louis Theroux saw first hand how Israeli settlements have accelerated in the West Bank. In one encounter, settlers point a laser sight through the window of a Palestinian home he visits. In another scene, he asks a balaclava-wearing armed Israeli soldier not to touch him while visiting a high-security area of Hebron with a Palestinian resident.Towards the end of the episode, we see a tense exchange between Theroux and Daniella Weiss, a leading figure in the settler movement. After Weiss denies settler violence against Palestinians, Theroux presses back that there’s video evidence. Weiss responds by unexpectedly shoving Theroux, hoping that he responds, as part of her explanation that such video evidence does not show the full picture. “That seems sociopathic,” responds Theroux. Ouch.Zero star hellDespite an A-list cast of Kim Kardashian, Glenn Close and Sarah Paulson, Ryan Murphy’s female-fronted legal drama All’s Fair becamethe 18th zero-star reviewin the Guardian’s 204-year history.It might end up being the only accolade the show will ever get. Described bythe Guardian’s TV criticLucy Mangan as “so awful, it feels almost contemptuous,” the plot, pacing, acting and script were all diabolical, resulting in, at one point, a 0% rating on thecritic website Rotten Tomatoes(it has since nudged upwards, but it’s still under 10%.)“I personally think that the first three episodes were the weakest,”Close later admitted in an interview with Variety. “That was a tough way to start. I’ve seen all nine episodes, and I think it actually adds up to something.” What a ringing endorsement!No longer Serving KantView image in fullscreenStill serving … Miriana Conte at Eurovision.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersEurovision this year was once again overshadowed by thetalk surrounding Israel’s inclusion, but one other story that came out from the contest was Maltese entrant Miriana Conte being told that if she wanted to compete, she would have to changethecontroversial C-word referencing lyricsof hersong Serving Kant.“It does sound as if you’re trying to use this sort of quite popular millennial phrase,” Newsnight’sFaisal Islam quizzed Conte, carefully skirting around what the popular phrase actually was.“To me, it means ‘serving singing’,” Conte said. However, as Conte’s performance saw her singing in front of a screen of a giant pair of open legs, I’m pretty sure everyone knew what she was referring to anyway.Rylan refuses to bareback liveAllow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

Rylan refused to participate in the discussion in case the chat went off the rails, which it inevitably did anyway.‘We’re soft-skinned, soft-skinned’Acclaimed Northern Ireland police drama Blue Lights has a knack for luring you in with a false sense of security (here are the coppers having a nice snack in their police car!) before an unexpected twist or heart-rending scene that leaves you on the floor.Episode five was a textbook example, when officers joked andplayed a song from Westlifefollowed swiftly by an altercation where Shane (Frank Blake) became unable to use both legs after being attacked in the thigh with a wine glass.Yet that wasn’t even the most tense moment. It was that episode’s cliffhanger: an active threat against a vehicle being driven by Constable Grace Ellis (Siân Brooke) with the attackers following them in the car behind (“Is your vehicle armoured or soft-skinned?” “We’re soft-skinned, soft-skinned.” “Shit.”) Yikes.Mummy Pig is pregnant!Good Morning Britain usually consists of two people with opposing views yelling at each other about a non-essential issue at 7.45am. Yet this year, the breakfast show went in a more surreal direction with Peppa Pig’s Mummy Pig announcing live on the programme that she was pregnant with her third piglet.Naturally, the country and all news media lost all sense of proportion. When Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig presented new baby Evie outside the Lindo Wing, the same hospital where the Princess of Wales had her baby a decade earlier, the Daily Mail reported concerns about why Mummy and Daddy Pig had both gone private rather than going with the NHS. No, I am not taking any of this out of context.Cunk does Who Do You Think You Are?Diane Morgan, the comedian behind the spoof documentary presenter Philomena Cunk, was the subject on the genealogy seriesWho Do You Think You Are?Inevitably, it resulted in her delightfully taking the mickey out of the show and the genre while appearing on it. At one point, she said“I wonder how much wandering aimlesslyI’ll be doing during this” before we got a shot of her doing just that. “My only reservation of doing this was the slow head rotation at the start. It makes me cringe just watching it,” Morgan told Who Do You Think You Are?, as her head started rotating slowly. Classic.Paul Merton takes on AndrewMountbatten-WindsorHave I Got News for You has a knack for recording an episode when major news breaks, such as its post-2015 election special when both the then Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg coincidentally stood down mid-recording.Earlier this year, another such event happened again. When news came that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor had lost his royal title, the production team slipped the development to guest host Jason Manford, who revealed it to a shocked audience.Jason Manford: “Andrew is no longer a prince.”Paul Merton, as always, came backwith a perfect quip.“The bad news is he’s become king.”MasterChef was cookedAllow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueWhen Gregg Wallace was sacked, and John Torode’s contract wasn’t renewed, the production company that made MasterChef had the unenviable task of re-editing an upcoming series to seemingly remove any jokes or banter, as well as two contestants who didn’t want to be there any more. The inevitable frantic re-editing led to a bizarre sequence noticed by viewers, when the exact same shot of Wallace appeared three times in less than a minute.‘How much is a 69 in your area?’It wouldn’t be a TV moments list without a few British news fails. Howler of the Year went to Sky News, with a guest on their paper review commenting that it was “great” that Pope Francis was feeling better from double pneumonia, only for it to be followed by breaking news thathe had in fact died.Innuendo of the Year was a heated battle between East Midlands BBC Weather presenter Rob Rose who said “and you can probably see Uranus as well” (he was actually talking about the clear night sky) and the Irish breakfast television presenter who asked viewers “how much is a69 in your area?” when he meant to say 99.Yet it was Peter Levy on BBC Look North who won overall, after commenting “mine’s only a small one but it did go up this weekend”. He was referring, of course,to a Christmas tree.The Maryam Moshiri Award went to BBC News presenter Maryam Moshiri, who this year failed toshow the middle fingerbut did do animpression of a peacock.The most coveted prize, Fail of the Year, went to an event on radio rather than on television, when BBC Radio Derby presenter Ian Skye had severe cramp while introducing a record. Forgetting to put the fader down, listeners heard Skye yell “FUCKING HELL,” followed by a grovelling apology.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAdolescenceCelia ImrieThe TraitorsDoctor WhofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yes, endless influencers promise that they have tweaked, tested and fine-tuned the process of revving up for the day, but how history’s most productive peopleactuallyget things done is so varied that it’s hard to draw definitive conclusions. Beethoven, reportedly, used to count out exactly 60 beans for his morning cup of coffee, while Victor Hugo downed two raw eggs after reading a daily missive from his mistress. Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, wakes at3amfor pre-workout prayer, chasing up his gym time with a few holes of golf and a jolt in the cryo chamber before he even thinks about doing any work.It is clear, though, that having some sort of routine is key: a set of automatic actions that you do every day, to ease you into your responsibilities with a bit of momentum and a fresh frame of mind. And there is some stuff that seems beneficial enough that everyone should be doing a version of it, even if individual methods differ: one person’s meditative bean arithmetic, after all, is another’s mindfulness. But if you want to finesse your routine, the key is to add one change at a time.“When you focus on a single behaviour,” says the behaviour change specialist Dr Heather McKee, “you build confidence through quick wins, and give your brain the clarity and dopamine hit it needs to automate that action. Once that habit feels natural, you free up mental space to layer in the next change.” But what habits should you be building?View image in fullscreenDogs are the perfect excuse to get a dose of morning light.Photograph: Posed by model; Olga Rolenko/Getty ImagesGet up, get outFirst things first: there’s no single best time to get up. If you have the luxury of picking your own window, it’s probably best to start by roughly working out your chronotype, which boils down to if you feel and perform best earlier in the day, you can probably get away with getting up a bit earlier (if you do your best work at night, of course, it would be ideal to sleep in).Most adults need between seven and nine hours’ sleep to feel fully functional, and you probably have a good idea of where you fall in that range. In an ideal world, you shouldn’t need an alarm to wake up: if that means going to bed at 10 so you’re feeling fresh by 6am, that’s the way forward.Ellie Hambly, a clinical psychologist specialising in helping families deal with stress, advises getting outside in the morning light. “This is getting harder with daylight hours reducing, but trying to manage your diary around getting some daylight can make a huge difference in your mood.” Morning exposure to natural sunlight plays a key role in keeping our body clock working properly. It suppresses melatonin, boosts serotonin, gets you ready for the day – andseems to help people sleep betterat night. If you have a dog or a running habit, great – but it’s even worth poking your head out of the door while you enjoy your morning coffee. “If you can make the time for a short walk without your phone in the morning, the combination of movement and lack of stimulation can help to activate your brain’s default mode network – the set of brain regions engaged in introspection and daydreaming,” says Hambly. “That can help with creative problem-solving and coming up with new ideas. If you don’t have time for a walk, even taking a shower without a podcast can work.”View image in fullscreenGetting outside in the morning light can make a huge difference.Photograph: Posed by model; Brook Pifer/Getty ImagesPut the kettle onRecently, it’s become fashionable among self-optimisers to claim that you should wait 60-90 minutes to drink your first coffee to avoid an afternoon crash. This sounds plausible, but areview of studiespublished in 2024 concluded that there’s no evidence this happens – and caffeine has also been shown to increase exercise performance in a variety of ways, so it’s definitely worth having a coffee if you’re going to work out (giving it 20-30 minutes to let the effects kick in). Otherwise, just do what’s most comfortable for you.View image in fullscreenGo with your natural flow.Photograph: Posed by models; Thomas Barwick/Getty ImagesShould you exercise first thing? If you can face it, yes: at least a bit. The best time of day to hit the gym seems to vary depending on your chronotype, specific goals and preferred workout style: morning exercise, for instance,can help with burning fat, and strength-building sessions are alsoprobably slightly betterif your aim is muscle. But it’s possible that you can “retrain” your body to work out more effectively at different times of day by doing it consistently (one study on swimmersfound that both chronotype and habitual training time are important). However, morning workouts seem to have a host of benefits all of their own, fromreducing body fat to improving sleep.On a more basic note, it’s also just easier to ensure you get your workouts done if you schedule them first thing, with no chance of a random pub invite or work demand getting in the way. If you can’t face a full-on run or dragging the dumbbells out from under the bed, it helps to have a pre-set, full-body routine that’s simple enough to do in your living room while everyone else dashes around eating toast and doing last-minute homework. The “slow” burpee is a winner here: squat down low, put your hands on the floor (between your feet if you can), then step one foot back at a time until you’re in a plank position. Do a press-up if you’ve got it in you, then reverse the whole process to come back to your feet: a handful of these will hit your arms, legs and core while also helping you stretch out stiff joints. Start with five, and work your way up.Read a line of poetry, sip your tea, write a quick reflection, or get through a couple of pages of a bookCold comfortsHow cold should your morning shower be? Again, this depends on what you’re going for. There is some evidence that hosing yourself down with frosty water in the morning can offer physiological benefits: cold exposure can trigger the release of endorphins and help your parasympathetic nervous system (the restful one) kick in, so even if it doesn’t feel like it in the moment, it’s probably cheering you up. On the flipside, a cold shock is potentially going to jolt you out of any default mode network thinking that’s helping you to solve problems or think creatively. But there’s a best-of-both-worlds approach. “I recommend to my coaching clients that they introduce hot and cold cycling as part of their morning routine for both the physical and mental benefits,” says the wellness expert Tana Hoffman Cook. “For people who are just starting out, even ending your shower with a cold blast can offer health benefits – cold exposure has been linked to increased dopamine levels, making it a powerful addition to anyone’s morning routine when they want to start their day feeling alert, clear-headed and with a mood-boost.”.View image in fullscreenJudgment-free scribbles can boost physical and psychological health.Photograph: Posed by model; Luis Alvarez/Getty ImagesScribble it outWhat about journalling, which is frequently recommended? A 2018review of studiesfound that writing about stressful or emotional events for a few minutes resulted in improvements in physical and psychological health in non-clinical and clinical populations. “Morning pages”, as they’re sometimes known, can work as a sort of lower-stakes version of that: aiming to fill a page or two with judgment-free scribble (that you’re definitely allowed to throw away afterwards) might help you reorganise your thoughts before you go about your day, or at least get your biggest worries down on paper. If you’re struggling to get anything out, use a prompt as an easy starting point: “What’s the biggest thing I’m worried about?” or “What’s one thing I want to focus on today?” Or you could be more specific with something like: “How am I actually going to get this project done on time?”Mindfulness on the goView image in fullscreenMeditation can be alternated with breathing techniques.Photograph: Posed by model; pixdeluxe/Getty ImagesAs for meditation, the benefits arewell established– they range from reduced anxiety to a boosted immune system – but if your mornings are too chaotic to sit in a quiet space (or plug into an app for 10 minutes), it might be worth starting with something a bit simpler. “I use something called the Ease morning routine to start the day with nervous system regulation rather than jumping straight into hustle mode,” says the wellbeing coach and yoga teacher Chloe Markham. “We begin with an Exhale, or stillness. If I don’t have time to meditate, I’ll use the 4-7-8 breathing technique: breathe in gently through your nose for a count of four, hold for seven, and breathe out through your mouth for eight. Next, we Anchor – this is where we clock in with the way our body feels and maybe set a soft intention for the day.” Spend a second listening to your body, she suggests, and maybe change your goals accordingly. “If you’re feeling energised, great! If not, maybe scale things back a bit. The next step is movement, or Shift – this is about moving our bodies in ways that feel good – and the final step is to Engage in something nourishing: read a line of poetry, sip your tea, write a quick reflection or get through a couple of pages of a book.”You could try to sneak in a bit of mindfulness while you do the washing-upWhether it takes five minutes or 95, she says, “this sort of routine cannot only prepare us for a calmer day, but also can strengthen our nervous system’s ability to self-regulate more quickly. The magic comes from consistency rather than perfection.” And if all that takes too much time, you could try to sneak in a bit of mindfulness while you do the washing-up: inone paper from Florida State University, a group of volunteers who read a text that encouraged them to focus their thoughts on the sensations evoked by the activity they were doing reported increases in elements of “positive affect” (such as inspiration) and decreased nervousness.“You don’t need a 5am wake-up call or a one-hour ritual to have a ‘good’ morning,” says the yoga teacher Maysun Hassanaly. “What matters is consistency. Think small daily doses of feelgood moments to lift your mood, that are useful and doable. Think of your mornings in three layers: must-do, nice-to-have and optional. On busy days, stick to your must-dos: the simple actions that ground you or energise you. On slower mornings, add a nice-to-have or two. It could be something as small as putting on your favourite song and having a quick dance, walking one extra bus stop, or taking a moment to notice the morning light. Tiny rituals like these help you feel calmer and in control of your day, without sacrificing sleep or overloading your to-do list.” You can’t micromanage everything that’s going to happen for the rest of the day, or everything that’s going on in the world – so for 10 minutes after you wake up, why not just be a bit nicer to yourself?Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingHow to have a better dayYogaMental healthMindfulnessHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not any moreThe president’s professed satisfaction with his cabinet may reflect how hard it would be to get a replacement confirmedDavid Smithin WashingtonFri 26 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 11.17 ESTShareFor more than a decade he built his brand on two words: “You’re fired!” And in his first term in the White House,Donald Trumpdid not hesitate to show his staff the door, often via an abrasive tweet.But since resuming the US presidency in January, Trump, the former host of the reality TV showThe Apprentice, appears to have become an uncharacteristically bashful boss, more disposed to hiring than firing.Whereas his first term was marked by chaos – his first 14 months saw thehighest cabinet turnoverof any president for a century – his second has been comparatively stable, with a team remaining almost entirely intact.“I think my cabinet is fantastic,” Trump said recently, dismissing reports of dissatisfaction with his defence secretary,Pete Hegseth, or his homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem. “I read these same stories that I’m unhappy with this one or that one – and I’m not. I think the cabinet has done a great job … We have just a fantastic cabinet.”The 12 days of Trump-masRead moreThat confidence has persisted despite a steady drumbeat of controversy. Hegseth has come under scrutiny for his misuse of the Signal messaging app and handling of military operations in the Caribbean. Noem has faced criticism over her extravagant spending anda feudwith the border czar, Tom Homan.The FBI director, Kash Patel, has drawnbipartisan opprobriumover his stewardship of sensitive investigations, while the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, raised eyebrows earlier this year after warning, in a video message, that the world was “on the brink of nuclear annihilation”.The closest brush with dismissal came when the then national security adviser, Mike Waltz, was quietly replaced by Marco Rubio – only to berecycled as Trump’s nomineefor US ambassador to the United Nations.Critics say the reason is simple: the president has assembled a court of loyalists, bound less by institutional independence than by personal allegiance. They point tocabinet meetingsin which secretaries strive to outdo each other by lavishing bountiful praise on their boss.Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said:“They’re functioning in an environment now when it’s loyaltyüber alles. If you are loyal and a fighter, the scales will tend to tip in your favour, even if you make mistakes. The mistakes are secondary and the loyalty and constant aggression are primary. I’m sure Trump loves the fact that Hegseth never backs down, never admits error.”There are further reasons for Trump to say you arenotfired. Axing a cabinet member would mean having to find a replacement, and that could involve a messy confirmation process in the Senate. Even when Trump was at the zenith of his power earlier this year, Hegseth wasconfirmed by just one votewhile Gabbard and Robert F Kennedy Jr, now the health secretary, cleared the bar by two.Now, with Trump’s approval rating plummeting and midterm elections looming, the Senate might prove more sceptical about the president’s unconventional choices.Galston, a former domestic policy adviser to Bill Clinton, added: “It’s fair to say thatRepublicansin Congress are less compliant than they were a year ago because they have surely noticed that the president’s standing with the public has declined remarkably and that they could be dragged down with him.“You can imagine that the confirmation proceedings would be arenas for unfavourable reviews of what had happened in those departments or agencies under the prior leadership during the first year, and that wouldn’t be good either.”Rick Wilson, a former Republican strategist, agreed. He said: “Trump knows at this point there are fewer possibilities for a Senate confirmation for the kind of people he wants now. He’s not going to get another Hegseth, he’s not going to get another Gabbard, he’s not going to get another RFK Jr. Those days are done.”In addition, Trump does not want to admit that he made a mistake. Wilson, a co-founder ofthe Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, added: “Trump doesn’t want to fire anybody. The reason is he feels like that lets the media win. He thinks the media gets something when he fires people.”The president’s restraint this time around marks a contrast with a first term punctuated by high-profile sackings: the FBI director James Comey, dubbed “the worst leader in the history of the bureau”; White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, abandoned on a rainy tarmac; and secretary of state Rex Tillerson, reportedly dumped while sitting on a toilet.No one embodied the turmoil and turbulence better than Anthony Scaramucci, dismissedafter just 10 daysas White House communications director because of a crude verbal tirade against other members of Trump’s staff.The difference now is partly one of familiarity. Trump 1.0 appointed figures such as Jim Mattis, a revered former general whom the president barely knew and who later resigned as defence secretary over foreign policy disagreements. Hegseth, by contrast, has been in Trump’s orbit for more than a decade and is an unstinting praise singer.Tara Setmayer, co-founder and chief executive of the Seneca Project, a women-led super political action committee, said:“This time around the reason you don’t see the same amount of firings is because the sycophancy is the point. Trump has loaded his cabinet up with people who are loyalists first and foremost and not competent.“He’s neutered Congress in a way that is unprecedented. With the combination of lack of accountability and loyalists at a level we didn’t see in the first term, it’s not a surprise that you haven’t seen high turnover. They’re doing everything Trump wants them to do at great expense to the country.”But there have been purges of a different kind. Trump began his presidency by encouraging millions of federal workers to resign and has removed holdovers from advisory councils, while the justice department has dismissed dozens of career prosecutors – including those linked to investigations involving Trump himself.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationPete HegsethKristi NoemRobert F Kennedy JrRepublicansUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their purrs are a consistent hum in the quiet that has come with decades of population decline.But less so since March, when rapturous celebrations marked a rare occurrence: the birth of a child.Lara Bussi Trabucco is the first baby to have been born in Pagliara dei Marsi in almost 30 years, bringing the village’s population to roughly 20.Her christening in the church opposite her home was attended by the entire community – including the cats – and such is the novelty of having a baby in the village, she is now the main tourist attraction.View image in fullscreenPaolo and Cinzia received a one-off payment of €1,000, courtesy of the policies of Giorgia Meloni, on top of monthly child support.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The Guardian“People who didn’t even know Pagliara dei Marsi existed have come, only because they had heard about Lara,” said her mother, Cinzia Trabucco. “At just nine months old, she’s famous.”Lara’s arrival is a symbol of hope, but also a sobering reminder of Italy’s worsening demographic crisis.In 2024, births in the country reached a historic low of 369,944, continuing a 16-year negative trend, according to figuresfrom Istat, the national statistics agency. The fertility rate also fell to a record low, with an average 1.18 children born to women of child-bearing age in 2024 – one of the lowest in the EU.Reasons for the decline are myriad, from job insecurity and the huge wave ofyouth emigrationto inadequate support for working mothers and, as in other countries, therise in male infertility. Furthermore,an increasing number of peopleare simply choosing to not have children.View image in fullscreenPagliara dei Marsi, a village in the vertiginous west of Abruzzo, is undergoing drastic depopulation.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianIstat’s preliminary data for the first seven months of 2025 points to a further decrease, and of Italy’s 20 administrative regions, nowhere has it been more acute than in the already sparsely populated Abruzzo, which between January and July had a 10.2% drop in the number of births compared with the same period in 2024.Pagliara dei Marsi is tiny, but it is emblematic of a country-wide landscape that is becoming dominated byageing populationsandemptying schools, putting pressure on public finances and presenting daunting economic and social challenges for leaders at local, regional and national levels.“Pagliara dei Marsi has been suffering from drastic depopulation, exacerbated by the loss of many elderly people, without any generational turnover,” said the local mayor, Giuseppina Perozzi.View image in fullscreenCinzia, who wanted to start a family far from a city, has bumped her village population up to about 20 by having Lara.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianPerozzi, who lives a few doors away from baby Lara, said she was grateful to Trabucco, 42, and her partner, Paolo Bussi, 56, for starting a family and hopes it will inspire others to do the same.Their situation is uncommon. Trabucco, a music teacher, was born in Frascati, close to Rome, and worked in the Italian capital for years before deciding to move to the village where her grandfather was born because she had always wanted to raise a family far from the chaos of a city. She met Bussi, a construction worker from the area, a few years ago.The couple benefited from a €1,000 “baby bonus” after Lara’s birth, a one-time payment for each child born or adopted since January 2025, introduced byGiorgia Meloni’s far-right governmentas part of its pledge to tackle what the prime minister has called Italy’s “demographic winter”. They also receive a child benefit payment of about €370 a month.But their main struggle is juggling childcare around work. Italy’s childcare support system is chronically insufficient and Meloni’s administration, despite depicting the birthrate crisis as a battle for national survival, has so far fallen short in its promise to boost the number of nurseries. Many women who become pregnant are forced to leave the workforce and later struggle to re-enter.View image in fullscreenThe region of Abruzzo, in which Pagliara dei Marsi lies, underwent a 10.2% drop in births in the first seven months of this year.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianThe couple worry about Lara’s future schooling, too. The last time Pagliara dei Marsi had a teacher – whose home doubled-up as the school – was decades ago. There is an infant and primary school in nearby Castellafiume, but given theschool closuresacross Italy due to the birthrate decline, it remains to be seen whether there will be enough children to sustain the facility over the long term.Trabucco said financial incentives were not enough to stymie the trend. “The entire system needs to be revolutionised,” she added. “We’re a country of high taxes but this does not translate into a good quality of life or good social services.”About an hour’s drive from Pagliara dei Marsi is Sulmona, a once-thriving city where the hastened pace of depopulation over the past decade has led to a battle to save its maternity unit, located at Annunziata hospital, from closure.View image in fullscreenLara’s entry to the world came amid a historic low number of annual births in Italy.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianThe unit, which serves the city and nearby towns, delivered 120 babies in 2024, well below the 500 required for maternity units to maintain funding. If it closes, pregnant women would need to travel to L’Aquila, the regional capital, about an hour’s drive away, posing risks in emergency situations.“The region is vast and especially in winter, travel conditions can be treacherous,” said Gianluca Di Luigi, a gynaecologist at the hospital who recalled a woman in labour who got stuck in a snow storm for eight hours. “By the time we got her to the hospital, we had to do an emergency caesarean. This was her first child and she was traumatised by the whole experience.”Those fighting to keep the unit open argue that the figure of 500 births a year, established in 2010, is no longer realistic. “We never did reach the magic 500 here,” said Berta Gambina, a midwife who has worked in the unit for 39 years. “Even in the best of times, we averaged about 380 births a year. But I will do all I can to keep it open – my biggest fear is abandoning pregnant women.”View image in fullscreenBerta Gambina, a midwife, has worked at the maternity ward in nearby Sulmona for 39 years.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianOrnella La Civita, a city councillor with the centre-left Democratic party, said financial incentives to encourage births were welcome. “But how can you give women money to have babies but not guarantee them a safe and secure place to give birth?”One often overlooked topic in Italy’s birthrate debate is preserving fertility, said Di Luigi, through means such as freezing eggs. “Ideological thinking in Italy has always been a block,” he added. “But if we want newborns, then we need enlightenment too – yes, provide young people with dignified jobs but let’s start teaching them about preserving fertility.”Explore more on these topicsItalyPopulationChildrenParents and parentingEuropeFertility problemsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But now AI may be about to change thatFri 26 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 09.11 ESTShareThis summer, I found myself battling through traffic in the sweltering streets of Marseille. At a crossing, my friend in the passenger seat told me to turn right toward a spot known for its fish soup. But the navigation app Waze instructed us to go straight. Tired, and with the Renault feeling like a sauna on wheels, I followed Waze’s advice. Moments later, we were stuck at a construction site.A trivial moment, maybe. But one that captures perhaps the defining question of our era, in which technology touches nearly every aspect of our lives: who do we trust more – other human beings and our own instincts, or the machine?The German philosopher Immanuel Kantfamously defined the Enlightenmentas “man’s emergence from his self-imposed immaturity.” Immaturity, he wrote, “is the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another”. For centuries, that “other” directing human thought and life was often the priest, the monarch, or the feudal lord – the ones claiming to act as God’s voice on Earth. In trying to understand natural phenomena – why volcanoes erupt, why the seasons change – humans looked to God for answers. In shaping the social world, from economics to love, religion served as our guide.Humans, Kant argued, always had the capacity for reason. They just hadn’t always had the confidence to use it. But with the American and later the French Revolution, a new era was dawning: reason would replace faith, and the human mind, unshackled from authority, would become the engine of progress and a more moral world. “Sapere aude!” or “Have courage to use your own understanding!”, Kant urged his contemporaries.Two and a half centuries later, one may wonder whether we are quietly slipping back into immaturity. An app telling us which road to take is one thing. But artificial intelligence threatens to become our new “other” – a silent authority that guides our thoughts and actions. We are in danger of ceding the hard-won courage to think for ourselves – and this time, not to gods or kings, but to code.ChatGPT was launched only three years ago, and already one global survey, published in April, found that82% of respondents had used AIin the previous six months. Whether deciding to end a relationship or who to vote for, people are turning to machines for advice. According to OpenAI, 73% of user promptsconcern non work-related topics. Even more intriguing than our dependence on AI’s judgment in daily life is what happens when we let it speak for us. Writing is now among the most common uses of ChatGPT, second only to practical requests such as DIY or cooking advice. The American authorJoan Didion once said: “I write entirely to find out what I am thinking.” What happens when we stop writing? Do we stop finding out?Worryingly, some evidence suggests that the answer might be yes. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology used electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor thebrain activity of essay writersgiven access to AI, search engines like Google, or nothing at all. Those who could rely on AI showed the lowest cognitive activity and struggled to accurately quote their work. Perhaps most concerning was that over a couple of months, participants in the AI group became increasingly lazy, copying entire blocks of text in their essays.The study is small and imperfect, but Kant would have recognised the pattern. “Laziness and cowardice,” he wrote, “are the reasons why so great a proportion of men … remain in lifelong immaturity, and why it is so easy for others to establish themselves as their guardians. It is so easy to be immature.”Sure, AI’s appeal lies in its convenience. It saves time, spares effort and – crucially – offers a new way to offload responsibility. In his 1941 book, Escape from Freedom, the German psychoanalyst Erich Fromm argued that the rise of fascism could be explained in part by people preferring to surrender their freedom in exchange for the reassuring certainty of subordination. AI offers a new way of surrendering that burden of having to think and decide for yourself.AI’s greatest allure is that it can do things our minds can’t – sift through oceans of data and process it at unprecedented speed. Sitting in the car in Marseille, this was, after all, why I chose to trust the machine instead of my friend in the passenger seat (a decision she took as an insult). With access to all the data, surely the app must know best – or so I thought.The problem is thatAI is a black box. It produces knowledge, but without necessarily deepening human understanding. We don’t really know how AI reaches its conclusions – even the programmers admit as much. Nor can we verify its reasoning against clear, objective criteria. So when we follow AI’s advice, we are not guided by reason. We are back in the realm of faith.In dubiopromachina: when in doubt, trust the machine – that may become our future guiding principle.AI can be a formidable ally to humans in rational inquiry. It can help us invent drugs, or free us from “bullshit jobs”, or doing our taxes – tasks that demand little thought and offer little satisfaction. All the better. But Kant and his contemporaries did not plead the case of reason over faith just so humans could build better shelves or have more spare time. Critical thinking was not just about efficiency – it was a practice of freedom and human emancipation.Human thinking is messy and full of errors, but it forces us to debate, to doubt, to test ideas against one another – and to recognise the limits of our own understanding. It builds confidence, both individually and collectively. For Kant, the exercise of reason was never just about knowledge; it was about enabling people to become agents of their own lives, and resist domination. It was about building a moral community grounded in the shared principle of reason and debate, rather than blind belief.With all the benefits AI brings, the challenge is this: how can we harness its promise of superhuman intelligence without eroding human reasoning, the cornerstone of the Enlightenment and of liberal democracy itself? That may be one of the defining questions of the 21st century. It is one we would do well not to delegate to the machine.Joseph de Weck is a fellow with the Foreign Policy Research InstituteExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionPhilosophyComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

Late on Thursday a courtgranted hima temporary restraining order to block any attempt to remove him from the US or detain him.Ahmed told the Guardian he believed he had been singled out for his work seeking greater accountability and transparency for social media and AI firms, which has led to Elon Musk’s Xunsuccessfully suing CCDH.Ahmed, who is a friend of Morgan McSweeney, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, said it was another attempt to deflect accountability and transparency.“This has never been about politics,” he said, adding that his organisation had worked successfully with the firstTrump administrationand would do so again if asked.“What it has been about is companies that simply do not want to be held accountable and, because of the influence of big money in Washington, are corrupting the system and trying to bend it to their will, and their will is to be unable to be held accountable,” he said.“There is no other industry, that acts with such arrogance, indifference and a lack of humility and sociopathic greed at the expense of people.”View image in fullscreenThe former European internal market commissioner Thierry Breton is among those to have been hit with a visa ban.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesAs well as Ahmed, the state department has barred the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton. It accused the five people of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”.Sarah Rogers, an official at the state department,posted on X: “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.”The sanctions are being seen as thelatest attack on European regulationsthat target hate speech and misinformation. Campaigners in the UK have said the British government could be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation.Ahmed, who began his career working with Labour politicians in Westminster, said he had not yet formally received any notification from the US government, and that he believed its case against him was unfounded. “I’m very confident that our first amendment rights will be upheld by the court,” he said.The next court hearing, due on Monday, is expected to confirm the protective order that prevents the US government from detaining him, said Ahmed, who spent Christmas away from his wife and infant daughter amid the legal battle.He said this was “a rational thing for us to do, given that in every other case to date where someone has had a green card withdrawn in the last few months, they have been arrested and detained and often spirited hundreds or thousands of miles away from their friends, family and support networks.”The CCDH has previously angered Musk over reports chronicling the rise of racist, antisemitic and extremist content on X since he took it over. Musk tried unsuccessfully to sue the CCDH last year before calling it a “criminal organisation”.More recently, the CCDH released a report warning aboutharmful answersproduced by the latest version of ChatGPT when asked about suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.“We’ve seen that social media and AI companies are increasingly under pressure as a result of organisations like mine,” Ahmed said. “No one likes being exposed as mendacious or hypocritical, but they call their friends in government or they call their pitbull litigation lawyers and start suing.”‘Money mule’ cases surge as criminals target young people on social mediaRead moreAhmed said it was particularly jarring to be targeted given that hate speech and misinformation was increasingly a bipartisan issue, raised as a concern by some Republican politicians as well as Democrats.He said he was nonetheless ready to respond with a swift legal response when he heard the news. “When you take on the world’s biggest corporations and when you’ve had the experiences we’ve had, being sued by the world’s richest man, you dissociate and compartmentalise immediately.”There had been a cost already, he said. “Nothing I’m going through compares to any of the parents I sit with who’ve lost their children,” Ahmed said. “I chose to take on the biggest companies in the world, to hold them accountable, to speak truth to power. There is a cost attached to that. My family understands that.“The only time I felt any sadness at all is last night when my wife told me that our child said her sixth word, and then I cried a bit.”Asked whether he thought UK politicians should continue to use X, Ahmed told PA: “Politicians have to make decisions for themselves, but every time they post on X, they are putting a buck in Mr Musk’s pocket and I think they need to question their own consciences and ask themselves whether or not they think they can carry on doing that.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

At the same time, the number of nurses and midwives joining the NHShas fallen sharplyover the past year.Dickson is the chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents the professional interests of the UK and Ireland’s 220,000 doctors, including GPs, surgeons, anaesthetists and A&E specialists.She said that without the contribution of foreign doctors and nurses the NHS “could quite easily fall over” and find itself without “a critical mass of people there to run the service safely”.Foreign-born doctors and nurses were being put off by antagonism by politicians towards migrants, media coverage of immigration, the racist abuse of international medical graduates by NHS colleagues and racist aggression by patients toward minority ethnic NHS staff, she said.“My feeling is we are creating a culture where the rhetoric is ‘foreigner bad’. If you have never visited Britain and are looking at our media, the social media, press media, print media, what our politicians are reported as saying, I think that it’s not unreasonable to see that as a hostile environment,” Dickson, an NHS consultant clinical oncologist, told the Guardian.“Because [foreign health staff] see Britain retreating from Europe, ‘we can go it alone’. They see attacks on synagogues, they see anti-Muslim protests. They see the rhetoric that immigration is bad, [that] immigration is a major problem for the country.“Why would you go somewhere where people are going, ‘we don’t need you, we don’t want you’? For them that makes Britain appear unwelcoming, racist. The prevalence of it [hostility to migrants] is significantly more [than] 10 years ago.”While the NHS has relied on overseas staff since its creation in 1948, this dependence has reached its greatest extent. For example, 42% of all UK doctors qualified abroad,General Medical Council (GMC) figures show.The atmosphere in the UK towards migrants is now so unpleasant that some foreign-born NHS staff feel unsafe in their everyday lives, Dickson added.Selina Douglas, the chief executive of the Whittington health trust in London, told a public meeting last month that hospital and community-based staff were experiencing a rise in racism.Referring to overseas nurses who have worked here for 25 years, Douglas said: “Those staff are being racially abused in our hospital. I have had staff spat at walking up the hill [from the tube station].”In a warning to abusive patients, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said last month that “your right to access free healthcare in this country does not come with the freedom to abuse our staff on any grounds”. However, it is unclear what action NHS trusts or the police take against abuse by patients.Workforce data collected by the GMC and theNursingand Midwifery Council show that more and more foreign medical and nursing graduates are “voting with their feet” by either not coming to the UK or leaving to work elsewhere, Dickson said.She voiced her concerns at the end of a year in which Streeting has said NHS staff areoften the targets of an increasingly overt “1970s, 1980s-style racism”and an NHS trust leader expressed alarm that Black and Asian staff visiting patients’ homes had been “deliberately intimidated”by the placing of England flags.She claimed that the Labour government was partly to blame for doctors deciding not to come to Britain because it was prioritising UK medical graduates over those who qualified overseas in the allocation of places in specialist medical training. This is a key issue alongside pay in theresident doctors disputein England between ministers and the British Medical Association.That may prove shortsighted, Dickson suggested, given that there was a global shortage of doctors, who can earn more money and enjoy easier working lives outside the UK.She added: “You have a population who have retreated from internationalism through Brexit. There is a secretary of state who is also saying ‘we would prioritise UK graduates for jobs’.“There’s always been a cohort [of doctors] who’ve gone back to their country of origin or another country. More worryingly to me [is] the number of overseas graduates who wanted to enter the country is diminishing as well. And I think that’s partly about the prioritisation argument that’s being pushed forward.“Doctors have a lot of portable skills, as do nurses. There’s an international shortage [of both]. If the country is not looking as welcoming, or people don’t feel as safe, and Canada, Australia and New Zealand are opening their doors more, then I find it unsurprising that people are leaving.”Anti-migrant sentiment expressed by unnamed politicians could prompt so many overseas staff to quit that the NHS “could quite easily fall over”, she warned.“If we have significant outward migration, and continue with the rhetoric nationally that immigration is bad and also ‘we’re prioritising UK graduates’, then I do worry about us coming to a point of not having a critical mass of people there to run the service safely.”She said Keir Starmer, the prime minister, and Streeting should make clear to the public that foreign-born frontline NHS doctors and nurses were welcome because “they provide an invaluable service to patients but also to the NHS and their colleagues, because without them we’d all be completely snowed under. The ones who are already in the UK, we absolutely need to make them feel welcome and go out of our way to make them feel welcome”.Responding to Dickson’s remarks, a spokesperson for the Department ofHealthand Social Care said: “The NHS benefits hugely from its international staff, and we’ll continue to support and attract talented overseas staff who want to dedicate their time, energy and skills to the health service.“Discrimination against patients and staff alike undermines everything our health service stands for – and the NHS has a zero tolerance for racism.”They added: “However, a failure to train enough medical professionals has left us reliant on international recruitment to plug the gaps. It’s only right that British taxpayers should see a return on the investment they make in training homegrown medical talent which is why our 10-year health plan commits to prioritising UK medical graduates and others who have worked in the NHS for significant periods for speciality training roles.”Explore more on these topicsNHSDoctorsNursingHealthImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

Over the next 14 years, he performed more than 400 shows, playing on some of the band’s best-known tracks, such as Friday I’m in Love, High and A Letter to Elise.Bamonte, who was born in September 1960 in London, left the Cure in 2005 after the band was reconfigured as a trio. In 2019, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside the Cure.The Cure: Songs of a Lost World review – as promised, ‘very, very doom and gloom’Read more“He rejoined the Cure in 2022, playing another 90 shows, some of the best in the band’s history, culminating with theShow of a Lost World concertin London on 1 November 2024,” the band wrote on their website, adding: “Our thoughts and condolences are with all his family. He will be very greatly missed.”Bamonte was also the bass player in supergroup Love Amongst Ruin, alongside former Placebo drummer Steve Hewitt and Julian Cope collaborator Donald Ross Skinner. The group have released two studio albums, their self-titled 2010 debut, and Lose Your Way, released in 2015.The musician was also interested in fly fishing and built a career as an illustrator, contributing to the magazine Fly Culture.In a tribute on Instagram, Bamonte’s former bandmate, drummer Lol Tolhurst, wrote: “So sad to hear about Perry Bamonte passing.

Of the people who were rescued, two were checked by paramedics and one was taken by ambulance to hospital as a precaution.In a statement posted on Upham’s Instagram account, his family said: “Our family is heartbroken by the loss of our beloved family member Matthew Upham, who was reported missing on Christmas morning.“Matthew is deeply loved and will be forever missed.“We would like to express our sincere and heartfelt thanks to the emergency services who responded, particularly the RNLI and coastguard, for their dedication, professionalism, and tireless efforts during this extremely difficult time.“We are profoundly grateful for their compassion and support.As we grieve and support one another, we kindly ask that our family’s privacy is respected.“We thank everyone for their understanding, kindness, and condolences.”Upham, from Budleigh Salterton, ran an antiques business called Matthew Upham Antiques in the Devon town.A coastguard search for the two men has been called off.On Boxing Day, police said both men were still missing. A spokesperson added: “Police inquiries are ongoing. A police presence remains at the scene.”The coastguard stopped searching the water at 5pm but police said onshore inquiries continued into the evening. The men’s families had been informed.While there is no official weather warning in place on Boxing Day, some sea swims have been cancelled and police in Devon and Cornwall have urged people not to get into the water.Map of DevonOn Christmas Day, Det Supt Hayley Costar, of Devon and Cornwall police, said officers had responded to “a truly tragic incident” in Budleigh Salterton. “Our thoughts remain firmly with the families and friends of the two men who are currently missing and to all who may have witnessed and be impacted by the incident,” she said.“There have been weather warnings in place this week and a number of official and unofficial swims have already been cancelled. While there are no official warnings in place for tomorrow, we urge anyone with plans to go swimming in the sea on Boxing Day not to.”The coastguard said its search was stood down at 5pm. A spokesperson said: “Alerted at around 10am, Exmouth and Beer coastguard rescue teams, RNLI lifeboats from Exmouth, Teignmouth and Torbay, coastguard search and rescue helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft were sent to the scene to assist, alongside police and ambulance service.“Searches have continued throughout the day to find two men believed to still be in the water. After extensive shoreline and offshore searches, the coastguard part of the search was stood down at 5pm.”Julia Robb, a resident who had been watching swimmers at the beach before the men went missing, said it had been a “very cold and windy” day and the waves “would have been at least 6ft”. She said it was only when she heard helicopters it became clear something was wrong.Robb added: “It was a sad thing to happen on what had been such a positive morning. I just feel sorry for those who have been affected. I think it will be shocking for the whole community. We are a small town. People are very friendly. I think it is important to think of the friends and families of those who have been affected.”Explore more on these topicsDevonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The [Pentagon] is always ready, so ISIS found out tonight – on Christmas. More to come … Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation. Merry Christmas!”Nigeria’s foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, said on Friday that the US strikes, which came after Trump had locked the countries in a diplomatic dispute when heaccused Nigeria’s governmentof failing to stop Christians being killed in the country, were “part of joint ongoing operations”.Trump said on Friday that a US military strike targeting Islamic State militants inNigeriawas originally supposed to take place on Wednesday, but he ordered that it be delayed by a day.“They were going to do it earlier,” Trump told Politico in an interview. “And I said, ‘nope, let’s give a Christmas present.’ They didn’t think that was coming, but we hit them hard. Every camp got decimated.”Nigeria is officially secular and its population is almost evenly split between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%). Violence against Christians has drawn attention from the religious right in the US, which has framed it as persecution, and Trump’s supporters broadly welcomed the strikes. Nigeria’s government has pointed out that armed groups target Christians and Muslims.Nigeria provided intelligence for theairstrikes in Sokoto state, Tuggar told the country’sChannels Televisionon Friday. He said he had spoken to his US counterpart, Marco Rubio, for 19 minutes, then called the Nigerian president, Bola Tinubu, to get his go-ahead, before speaking to Rubio again for another five minutes.“We have been working closely with the Americans,” Tuggar said. “This is what we’ve always been hoping for, to work with the Americans, to work with other countries, to combat terrorism, to stop the death of innocent Nigerians … It’s a collaborative effort.”The US military’sAfricaCommand said the strikes in Sokoto state had been carried out in coordination with Nigerian authorities. An earlier statement posted on X and then removed said they had been conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities.map of NigeriaTrump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday: “Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!“I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was. The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing.”Trump positioned himself as the “candidate of peace” in the 2024 US presidential election, campaigning on a promise of extricating Washington from decades of “endless wars”. However, the first year of his second term in the White House has been notable for a number of military interventions overseas, with strikes on countries including Yemen, Iran and Syria, as well as ahuge military buildupin the Caribbean targeting Venezuela.Neither the US nor the Nigerian authorities have said if anyone was killed in the airstrikes. Asked if there would be more, Tuggar said: “You can call it a new phase of an old conflict. For us it is something that is ongoing.”Residents in the Sokoto village of Jabo, where the strike hit, said there had been no casualties and that security forces had cordoned off the area.Some in the village described panic and confusion as the US missiles hit. “As it approached our area, the heat became intense,” Abubakar Sani told the Associated Press on Friday. “The Nigerian government should take appropriate measures to protect us as citizens. We have never experienced anything like this before.”Sanusi Madabo, a farmer, said the sky glowed a bright red for hours from what he learned only later had been a US airstrike. “It was almost like daytime,” he said.US planes conducted surveillance missions over the region earlier this month. It is believed they used an airport in neighbouring Ghana as a base.Forests in Sokoto, which is bordered by Niger to the north, have been used as bases by gangs of armed bandits and members of Islamic State – Sahel Province, known locally as Lakurawa. Some analysts say the IS branch started when a group of herders joined together to fight bandits in the absence of state support. The state is mostly Muslim.Why is Donald Trump threatening military intervention in Nigeria?Read moreFor residents of Sokoto, the US strikes brought back memories of when the Nigerian air forcemistakenly bombed an areajust an hour away from Jabo on Christmas Day last year. The villagers received compensation only five days ago, according to the air force’sFacebook page, which said 13 civilians had been “unintentionally killed” and eight injured.Clashes between Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities in parts of Nigeria have been aggravated by ethnicity and religion but their roots lie in competition for land and water.Priests and pastors have increasingly beenkidnapped for ransombut some experts say this may be a trend driven by criminal incentives rather than religious discrimination.Tuggar said the operation was about “protecting Nigerians and innocent lives”, not one religion or another. “The president emphasised yesterday, before he gave it the go-ahead, that it must be made clear that … it is a joint operation,” he said. “It is not targeting any religion, nor is it simply in the name of one religion or another.”A day before the Sokoto strikes, a Christmas Eve suicide bombing at a mosque in north-east Nigeria killed at least five people and left more than 30 seriously injured. The Nigerian army attributed the attack to the jihadist group Boko Haram, which has waged an insurgency in the region for almost two decades, mostly separate to the violence in the north-west.There have been almost 6,000 incidents of violence in Nigeria in 2025, about half of them attacks targeting civilians, according toArmed Conflict Location & Event Data, a non-profit conflict monitor. The state of Katsina, another Muslim-majority state two states to the east of Sokoto, had the highest number of incidents at 706. Sokoto had the fourth highest, 353.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaUS foreign policyUS militaryTrump administrationUS politicsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I know I am Black. I was born Black. And I love being Black. So tell me something I don’t know.”Those words, uttered 50 years ago as a young nurse facing regular racial abuse from patients on a London hospital ward, were a turning point in Allyson Williams’s life and career.Williams had come to the UK in 1969 from the anglophile culture of the postwar Caribbean – where children of all ethnicities learned English literature, grammar and history by heart – only to be attacked in “the mother country”.She is now among those who, having dedicated their lives to theNHS, fear the UK still does not properly appreciate the outsize contribution made to UK healthcare by Black, ethnic minority and overseas-born or trained staff – decades after Windrush generation nurses held up the service in its earliest years.Those professionals included Deloris James, who was born a British citizen in St Kitts and Nevis and moved to Cardiff as 10-year-old in 1964. She was “pushed” into a career in the NHS, following after her mother who was a midwife – 12 other relatives also worked in the health service.View image in fullscreenWilliams in uniform during her nurse’s training at Whittington hospital in Highgate, north London.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian“The stories I hear, it seems as if things have got worse than when I was in the NHS,” said James, 71, who worked as a nurse and midwife. “I’m not saying there wasn’t racism, but it seems so much more prevalent.”Thenumber of overseas nurses and midwives coming to the UK is collapsing, with rising racism and changes to immigration rules blamed for the fall. In an interview with the Guardian, the chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, Jeanette Dickson, said the NHS was being put at risk because foreign health professionals increasingly saw the UK as an “unwelcoming, racist” country.Between April and September, 6,321 nurses and midwives from abroad joined the register of those licensed to practise in the UK, compared with 12,534 who did so in the same period in 2024. In October, the Royal College of Nursing revealed the number of reports by nurses of racist incidents at work had risen by 55% over three years.Meanwhile,overseas-trained doctors are leaving the UK in record numbers, with 4,880 doctors who qualified in another country leaving the UK during 2024, a rise of 26% on the 3,869 who did so the year before, according to the General Medical Council.Williams, a writer who came to the UK in 1969 and spent 40 years in the NHS as a nurse, midwife, manager and clinical leader, said: “It’s been over 50 years and nobody has learned any lessons. Nobody has seen fit to congratulate or to thank the multi-ethnic people who have come – in our generation to ‘rebuild the country’, that was how it was put to us.“I came at a time of brain drain when so many English people had gone to Canada and America and Australia. When I got into the hospital, and in my class, there were 30 girls who were training. One was English, four Irish and the rest were West Indians and west African – of the West Indians, there were 14 of us from Trinidad alone.“The training and the social life was amazing, but there was a lot of racism from the patients. They would slap you or hit you or push you away. I was called the ‘N’ word. I was told I was nasty. It was quite disturbing.”After a year, Williams told her mother “she couldn’t take it any more”, that she felt as if she was “walking on glass”.But her mother told her: “You have a dream. You have wanted to be a nurse since you were small. The racism is their problem. You just get on with your career and find a way to deal with them.”“It actually led me to make that big stand on the ward,” Williams, who celebrated the moment in the title of her autobiography,Tell Me Something I Don’t Know, said. “I don’t know where it came from … it was the most empowering statement I’ve ever made – from that point on, [racism] just never bothered me.”Williams would move on to midwifery, where there was much less racism and where she found “bringing life into the world was such a privilege”.She said: “Every now and then you would get a woman saying she doesn’t want to have a Black midwife. But the managers then were very strict. They would say ‘they’re all we have and they’re the best – you either have a Black midwife or you pack up and you go somewhere else’.”View image in fullscreenWilliams during her time as a midwife, writing up notes after a home birth at a mother’s home.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianDecades on, and not every Black, ethnic minority, or overseas-born or trained medic feels they can rely on colleagues for support.The NHS’s most recentworkforce race equality standard reportrevealed Black or minority ethnic (BME) women (15.6%) were most likely to have experienced discrimination from other staff in the last 12 months, and 51% of NHS trusts reported BME staff were over 1.25 times more likely than white staff to enter formal disciplinary processes. At 80% of NHS trusts, white applicants were significantly more likely than BME applicants to be appointed from shortlisting.Alison Hewitt is the second generation of her family to devote her working life to the NHS. Her aunt was a Windrush generation nurse and her mother was a children’s nurse – but Hewitt broke the mould to train in radiography 35 years ago, when Black radiographers were a rarity.She said: “I think a lot of the Windrush nurses kept their mouth shut. Whereas nowadays, you’re constantly battling HR.”But despite the discrimination and disparities, 28.6% of staff in NHS trusts are Black or minority ethnic and about 20% non-UK nationals.“There’s at least 27 countries represented where I work,” Hewitt said. “If the Black staff, the Asian staff and the foreign-born staff all went home, the NHS would collapse within hours. We’ve always been brought in to do the difficult work.”Nonetheless, Hewitt believes that if anything is driving turnover of staff in the NHS, it is “economic betterment” – and Williams agrees.“Where do you go in the world where there is no racism?” Williams said. “It’s a global, international problem. But what you might find [outside the UK] is that the wages are better or there’s something else to compensate for it.”Saada Maida, a 41-year-old gynaecologist from Leamington Spa who came to the UK as a refugee from Syria, said NHS staff of all backgrounds shared the common challenge of coping with patients with diverse needs in a “systematically underfunded” system, but stressed he had been made to feel welcome – and felt “the UK is one of the least racist nations”.He added: “The common denominator between these people leaving is feeling somehow that they’re not appreciated in the NHS – if you take a contract in the Gulf, we know it’s systematically full of inequalities, more so than the UK, but the pay is better. I think all doctors or healthcare professionals leaving the NHS, I think the incentive, whether they admit it or not, is to a great extent financial.”Having seen so many members of her family devote their lives to the NHS, James worries that the service she knew will be lost tocutsandprivatisation, as well as the pressures facing its “wonderful” staff.“It makes me feel very sad,” James added. “Here we are again, back to the 50s, when people were invited to come to Britain to work and rebuild and, when they do arrive, then they face these hostilities.”Explore more on these topicsNHSRaceCommonwealth immigrationHealthImmigration and asylumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As director of theFoundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development(FCDS), he has spent years mapping the transformation of this fragile landscape from the air.His team has logged more than 150 overflights, covering 30,000 miles (50,000km) to track deforestation advancing along the roads, illicit crops and the shifting frontiers of human settlement. “We now have the highest road density in the entire Amazon,” says Botero.View image in fullscreenA route through the Amazon forest to the river. Colombia now has the highest road density in the Amazon.Photograph: Rodrigo Botero/FCDSYet the infrastructure he describes is not necessarily a sign of progress or social development, but mostly a network of illegal routes expanding in southernColombiaacross the Amazon forest, which covers42% of the country. Since 2018, various armed groups have built more than8,000km of roadsthere, spreading like arteries through the jungle.The layout of this new network almost exclusively benefits organised criminals, who control the vast region and use the roads to export illicit goods, which also add to the environmental devastation.“OutsideColombia, there is demand for cocaine, gold and meat; the Amazon supplies that demand. In our environmental deterioration, there is an international shared responsibility,” says Botero.In its report,Amazon in dispute, the FCDS says the north-western region of the Amazon – which has 17 illegal groups operating in nearly 70% of its municipalities – hasone of the world’s highest numbers of socio-environmental conflicts.The report states: “It is a problem of macro-criminality that connects armed groups, gangs and cartels with political intermediaries and business conglomerates that, in addition to taking over natural resources and destroying ecosystems, seek to exercise territorial and population control over the region.”Another thinktank, theIdeas for Peace Foundation, also notes shifts among the factions operating in the country.View image in fullscreenA member of the Colombian police carries a shotgun confiscated from a suspected deforester at the Natural National Park in La Macarena.Photograph: Raúl Arboleda/AFP/Getty Images“The distinction between insurgent actors and organised crime groups has become increasingly blurred,”it saysin a report. “The structures have shifted from hierarchical models, such as the major drug cartels of the 1980s and 1990s, to more federated organisations with dynamic interactions that have formed a complex criminal network.”This degradation intensified after the 2016peace agreementsigned between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), which used the jungle as a hideout and protected it for strategic convenience. New groups emerged, often with more local than national ambitions and in conflict with each other.The current list, in addition to the old National Liberation Army (ELN), includes the Gaitanistas (also known as the Gulf Clan, Urabeños, and Gaitanist Self-Defence Forces of Colombia, or AGC), Central General Staff (EMC), General Staff of Blocks and Front (EMBF), Second Marquetalia and Border Command (CDF), among others.“When the peace was signed, several Farc dissidents announced they would not surrender their weapons, and immediately an increase in deforestation became evident: 150,000 hectares [370,000 acres] in 2018,” says Botero. Now700,000 hectareshave been devastated.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Ernesto Che Guevara front, part of the National Liberation Army guerrillas, at a camp in the Chocó jungle in 2019.Photograph: Raúl Arboleda/AFP/Getty ImagesAccording toGlobal Forest Watch, Colombia lost about 56,000 sq km (21,000 sq miles) of total tree cover and about 21,000 sq km of primary rainforest between 2001 and 2024. A large portion of that land, in the north-western Amazonian arc, is now used for cattle, whose numbers have also increased – doubling from 1,600,000 to 3,200,000 in the last eight years.Several experts attribute the current crisis to the missteps of the leftist president Gustavo Petro, a leader whopromised to bring peace to a countrylong torn apart by civil war, and to protect the environment. His critics argue that Petro was unableto extend state controlover remote areas of Colombian territory or prevent the withdrawal of the Farc leading to the emergence of splinter guerrilla groups and new criminal cartels that now dominate the cocaine market.Can a wildlife paradise on a Colombian island survive the arrival of a military base?Read moreKyle Johnson, a researcher at the Bogotá-basedConflict Responses Foundation(Core), says it is not just a failure of this administration. “The figures show that the last two governments had very different approaches to the problem, and neither worked. The lack of implementation of the peace agreement is the main cause behind the growth of armed groups in the Amazon.”The peace agreementpromised comprehensive rural reform, including an agrarian development plan and access to land for farmers. It also proposed a strategy to sustainably replace illicit crops such as coca.In its promise to democratise access to land in Colombia, the Petro governmenthas allocated 15,000 sq kmto farmers. Still, inequality persists: thewealthiest 1% owns 47% of private rural land, according to the Agustín Codazzi Geographic Institute, Colombia’s state cartographical agency.View image in fullscreenThe government has allocated 15,000 sq km of land to farmers and has a strategy to replace illicit crops.Photograph: Camilo Erasso/Long Visual Press/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesJohnson believes that “Total Peace”, Petro’s ambitious initiative to disarm all groups across the country, would have fared better if it had focused on fulfilling the peace agreement with the Farc.“That agreement has tools to advance peacebuilding, and by applying it, the government sends a message to the new groups. They may think that if the government doesn’t implement the previous agreement, there’s no guarantee it will do so with the new ones,” Johnson says.Ultimately, the state finances a speculative land market. That’s the backdrop: land is the big businessRodrigo Botero, FCDS thinktankHe says the breach of the armistice with the Farc is the main argument used by emerging groups to remain armed. They also denouncemore than 400 murdersof ex-combatants of that guerrilla group.But the underlying reason is that the Amazon holds vast resources for the factions that exploit it.Along the rivers and deep in the jungle, in hard-to-reach areas dominated by armed groups, everyone must pay tribute to these de facto powers: merchants, transporters, cattle ranchers, farmers and anyone in commercial activities. Some groups have conducted detailed censuses in the areas they control and know how each hectare is used so they can profit from those activities – and threaten those who resist extortion.View image in fullscreenA dredge on fire in the Amazon river at Río Puré National Natural Park in 2023 as part of a police operation to dismantle illegal gold-mining sites.Photograph: HO, Prensa Policía Nacional/AFP/Getty ImagesThe government has promoted theForest Development Centres, a programme that seeks to turn deforestation hotspots into areas with environmental market potential. But the institutional response remains insufficient. In many areas of the Colombian Amazon, armed men prohibit officials from the environment ministry and the Codazzi Geographic Institute from entering.This limits the information the government can obtain from disputed territories and hinders the implementation of public policies aimed at their inhabitants.Sebastián Gómez, an adviser to the country’s Peace Agreement Implementation Unit, acknowledges failures in the approach. “From the start, the government insisted that coca-growing families eradicate their crops without offering them alternatives. And soon they replanted,” he admits.In 2017, several Amazon regions experienced a crisis in the coca economy. According to Gómez, this allowed the entry of international criminal networks from Mexico and Europe, fostering new illicit economies such as extensive cattle ranching and mining – two major drivers of deforestation and river pollution. Increasing amounts of cocaine, meat, timber, gold and other valuable minerals such as coltan are exported along the jungle’s illegal roads.For Gómez, the solution to this expanding illegal market is complex, and goes beyond military intervention. “More than a punitive approach, what is needed is one that transforms local economies. We have to build a special agricultural economic proposal for this region, one compatible with forest preservation,” he says.View image in fullscreenA Colombian soldier patrols near the police station attacked by Farc dissidents in Morales, in an incident that left four dead in May 2024.Photograph: Ernesto Guzmán Jr/EPAFor millennia, Indigenous communities in the Amazon survived in the jungle and benefited from it – a balance disrupted by the large-scale arrival of settlers seeking profit.A study published by the Rio de Janeiro-based Igarapé Institute and the Amazon Investor Coalition confirms that the rising demand for commoditiesexacerbates environmental and security risksin the Amazon. The report recommends joint action by the governments of the nine countries that share the territory to “strengthen territorial governance, empower local communities and align political ambition”.Land ownership is central to the problem. The exploitation of timber, cattle, coca and minerals generates a steady cashflow for criminal cartels, which they use to expand their operations by recruiting more people and weaponry. But in the longer term, wealth lies in owning land.‘Drug trafficking, extortion, kidnapping’: the lawless rush for rare earth minerals in VenezuelaRead more“Bringing all those deforested hectares into the market means the land gains value with cattle, water and power lines. Ultimately, the state finances a speculative land market. That’s the backdrop: land is the big business,” says Botero.Johnson remains pessimistic. “In the short term, there is no solution. The state must offer those men options other than money – ones that are attractive enough to encourage demobilisation.“We must identify other incentives: family, peace of mind, the desire to retire and the desire to see their children,” he suggests. “They are criminals, but they are also people. In the Colombian Amazon, we must blend the environment with peace.”Explore more on these topicsColombiaSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanAmazon rainforestFarcAmericasDeforestationConservationTrees and forestsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It can also be fraught. How do you choose something the receiver will enjoy or find meaningful? And must you act pleased if you receive a tub of anti-cellulite cream?Eleven Guardian readers shared the best and worst gifts they have ever received. Can we learn anything from their experiences? Perhaps not: “Don’t just give something that appeals to you,” writes one, and “Always gift something you want,” writes another.No wonder so many of us have a hard time figuring it out.‘It’s a bat’s head’Best: My husband took me on a cruise up the Nile river for my birthday. It was the trip of a lifetime.Worst: One winter evening at college, a fellow student came up to me and declared: “This is for you. It’s a bat’s head.” It was a very heavy box. He had never expressed romantic interest in me before, and I was so surprised I said nothing. It was cold, so I hurried back to my dorm room. I had feared it was an anatomical specimen, but what I found was a mass of hardened plaster of paris. My roommate and I went to the dumpster and dropped it in.Brenda, PortlandAn unwelcome beauty productBest: When my son was 13, he started working as a paper boy in the afternoon, six days a week. MyChristmaspresent from him that year was a food processor, which I could not afford to buy myself as a single, low-income mother.Worst: A male colleague gave me Lancôme anti-cellulite cream.Guri, 72, Norway… Another unwelcome beauty productBest: My parents weren’t gift givers. Mostly they just didn’t buy anything, but for Christmas when I was 10, they bought me a new bike, and a trip to Germany to visit a friend by myself. I thought this was incredible. In hindsight, now that I have kids, I think maybe they were just trying to get rid of me for a break.Worst: When I was 17, my mum’s friend bought me cellulite-reducing tights.Kelly, BrightonA stinky ice trayBest: My daughter surprised me with a trip to Kauai, Hawaii. The trip was magical. We watched giant sea turtles coming up on the beach and sunset to rest.Worst: Silicone ice cube trays. The giver said he saw me struggling with a regular tray. I thought it was a strange thing to be considered a gift. It also smelled bad.Anonymous, CaliforniaTim Curry (good) and Tim Curry (bad)Best: As a massive Tim Curry fan, I was surprised to find one of my former colleagues knew and liked his work. She gave me a mug printed with his most prominent characters. I’m too scared to use it. It’s special.Worst: The drawback of being a Tim Curry aficionado is that he’s in a lot of films of doubtful quality. I think the worst is Four Dogs Playing Poker. My dad gave it to me for Christmas. I regifted it to an unsuspecting frenemy.Bonnie, 42, NetherlandsMarital highs and lowsBest: Ruby earrings from my soon-to-be second husband.Worst: A vacuum cleaner which was the beginning of an eventual divorce.Anonymous, VirginiaGurus and fire ritualsBest: My then-guru gave me a beautiful, large bronze Quan Yin, seated on a dragon.Worst: One year, my friend gave me an ugly wooden carved gnome face. She loved and collected them. I was horrified. It felt evil! I’d been invited to a new year’s fire ritual, and it immediately went into the flames.Anonymous, North CarolinaFloor mats and singing fishBest: Rubber floor mats for my first car, a Saab 900S. I lived in Chicago and needed to protect the car’s carpet. It was the only thing I wanted and I was so happy to get it.Worst:Billy Bass. Who needs a singing fish on a wall plaque?AnonymousA quilt for a quiltmakerWorst: I have 30 years of experience making quilts. One Christmas, my mom bought me a Walmart quilt. I’ve never figured out why.Susan, retired, GeorgiaDeadly nutsBest: I used to work for a homeless charity, and one of my responsibilities was to supervise a workshop where people could learn woodworking skills. It had been a difficult year with a funding crisis looming. Out of the blue, the trainees presented me with a beautiful wooden candle box, crafted from cherry wood. It’s still in use, and it holds red candles for my advent wreath.Worst: I received a large, fancy box of assorted nuts. I have a severe nut allergy, which most people are aware of. Or so I thought.Anonymous, ScotlandThoughtful tea towelsBest: This will probably sound like many people’s idea of a “worst” gift, but my husband got me two dozen new tea towels. We use them for cloth napkins and all sorts of household tasks. Getting more was thoughtful, and a sign my husband was listening to what I wanted rather than buying me something more conventional that I’m supposed to want.Maria, 40s, MinnesotaExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He sought to engage the widest possible readership in Dickens’s work, and to bring into the public domain all those writings that still lay in the shadows cast by the canonical novels and popular Christmas books.His biography Charles Dickens: A Life Defined by Writing (2009) gives a detailed account of Dickens’s life and the full range of his work, bringing out the web of connections between the two. He produced a four-volume edition of Dickens’ Journalism (1994-2000, with volume four co-edited with John Drew), and from 1993 was series editor of the multi-volume Everyman Dickens: all the novels, most of the minor works, the travel books, the writings for children, and the mass of hitherto neglected short stories culled from Dickens’s journals. Michael was excited by the range, richness and diversity of Dickens’s writings, and wanted them to excite others. His work significantly advanced Dickens’s reputation and opened new fields for research.View image in fullscreenIn order to counter the divide between Dickens’s academic and “lay” readerships, he edited The Dickensian (1968-77), the journal of the Dickens Fellowship, introducing a new academic rigour and sophistication to its articles and formatting, while preserving its old literary-fellowship features. A similar bridging project came with his inauguration in 1986 of a Dickens Day at his academic base of Birkbeck College, London, a one-day conference combining fellowship members, academics and students.For several decades he was an academic adviser and a trustee of theCharles Dickens Museum, housed in the writer’s former home in Doughty Street, central London. He helped to secure for it two collections of Dickensiana from private ownership, producing an annotated catalogue (1975) for one of them, the magnificent Suzannet collection.Michael’s pioneering book Dickens and Women (1983) combined analytic accounts of Dickens’s own relationships with women and his representations of female characters in the novels. It countered some of the myths that had grown up about his relationships, illustrated clearly the variety and unresolved complexity of Dickens’s attitudes to women, and led indirectly (and to his surprise) to his appearances on stage in London theatres to answer questions from the audience in Miriam Margolyes’s popular one-person show, Dickens’ Women.The Great Charles Dickens Scandal (2012) examined Dickens’s relationship with the young actor Ellen Ternan. It became public only in the late 1930s, with sensational headlines in the national press, and consequences for Dickens’s reputation within and beyond the literary world.Born in Reading, Berkshire, Michael was the son of Valentine (nee Clément), from northern France, where, in 1915 she had met her husband-to-be, Jesse Slater, as a British soldier in the first world war. He remained in the army into the 1920s, and by the time of Michael’s birth was a travelling salesman for Palmolive soap.View image in fullscreenMichael Slater admitted that Dickens “has to a large extent been my life”.Photograph: Gresham CollegeMichael was seven or eight when he first tasted Dickens in Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby. Like the wide-eyed young heroes of these novels, at Wilson primary school and Reading school he took in the characters he encountered, such as, for instance, a French master in plus-fours and with a waxed moustache, who would literally dance with rage before the class at any misbehaviour. Such episodes, he later recalled, “must have seemed entirely continuous with the weird and wonderful world I was discovering in Dickens’s novels”.He believed that Dickens’s distinctive genius lay in his humour and his creation of characters who live “in a perpetual summer of being themselves” (as he used to quote GK Chesterton). The humour was easier to celebrate than to analyse, and as it went missing from the more earnest discourses of lit-crit over the last half-century or so, Michael promoted these convictions with passion and eloquence, as a teacher, formally and informally, and through his readings from Dickens.After school, by way of national service he learned Russian at theJoint Services School for Linguists (JSSL)in Bodmin, Cornwall. He was then stationed at a listening post in West Berlin, eavesdropping on the mundane conversations of Soviet pilots.In 1957 Michael went to Balliol College, Oxford, to study English. There he was told that the BA literature curriculum ended at 1832; “After that, it’s only books,” explained his tutor.When it later proved difficult to find anyone at Oxford to supervise his planned doctorate on Dickens, Michael gravitated to London and the tutorship of Kathleen Tillotson. She and John Butt at Edinburgh were the leading Dickens scholars in the UK. There and in the US there was a significant new wave of academic interest in the writer, which Michael’s work built on. On receiving his doctorate in 1965 he was appointed to a lectureship in English at what is now Birkbeck, University of London, where he remained for 36 years, becoming professor of Victorian literature in 1991 and retiring as emeritus a decade later.View image in fullscreenMichael shared his apartment home in Bloomsbury with his partner, John Grigg, whom he had met on the Russian course. It was a summer-visit focus for the many overseas friends he’d made during his frequent lecturing tours.As an international organisation, the Dickens Fellowship, of which Michael served as president (1988-90), brought him invitations from branches and universities around the world. He was also president of the Dickens Society of America. In 2014 he was appointed MBE.One of Dickens’s obituarists wrote that the master “brought all that he saw and felt into a magic circle of dramatic creation”. Michael had something of the same impulse, and with a similar histrionic flair. Each anecdote from his repertoire of personal misadventures lengthened over the years as he elaborated scenes and characters to the point where life seemed to be impersonating Dickens. He admitted that Dickens “has to a large extent been my life”.John Grigg died in 2013. Michael is survived by four nephews and a niece.Michael Derek Slater, literary scholar, born 29 December 1936; died 27 November 2025Explore more on these topicsCharles DickensBiography booksFictionobituariesShareReuse this content"

While the Orkney Islands enjoy extended daylight during the summer months, winter brings grey, wet and miserable weather, she says. “It’s that feeling of being enveloped by the darkness, especially when the rain is battering against the window. You don’t feel like going out, and it does bring your mood down.”There’s a waiting list for the boxes, which are also available in more remote areas from the mobile library van, known locally as Booky McBookface. “The way things work in Orkney is very much word of mouth, so we’re hoping more people will hear about it and be better able to cope through the winter,” says Copland.The development of the Wintering Well boxes is part of a UKRI-funded research project, Living with Sad, led by Prof Hester Parr of the University of Glasgow. It follows a successful pilot further south in East Dunbartonshire libraries last year.Feedback from those box borrowers was effusive – people felt more able to start their days thanks to the kit, and more than half changed their daily routines to include walking in daylight hours and spent more time noticing seasonal changes in nature and in the sky above them. Staff noted that Winter Well users also got excited about other library facilities.Sad is a historically contested condition, says Parr. It was given its own diagnostic category in 1987, which was later removed, with a continuing critical discussion about whether it exists on its own or as a subset of depression.Beyond this, however, there is a clear social recognition of how winter light affects individuals, she says. “The public absolutely understand this experience and recognise what it means: that we are all of us, obviously, affected by light.”View image in fullscreen'We are all of us, obviously, affected by light,’ says Prof Hester Parr, of the University of Glasgow School of Geographical and Earth Sciences.Photograph: Martin Shields/Wintering WellThe light boxes are designed specifically so that people are “not just passively receiving light but creatively engaging with it”, adds Parr, arguing that coping with Sad “depends on the attitude that comes with the latitude”.“People in Scandinavian countries tend to have different attitudes towards winter because they’ve had to, embracing winter light and embracing their relationship with the season.”Ultimately Parr would like to see these boxes of light in every public library, given how these buildings can be important health and wellbeing hubs, particularly in rural areas. “We plan to take over the world,” she says brightly.Explore more on these topicsScotlandMental healthWinterHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s made them feel targeted for who they are, the band sayFri 26 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTShareJosh Breslaw was looking forward to a homecoming gig with his band of two decades’ standing. Oi Va Voi, a predominantly Jewish collective mixing traditional eastern European folk tunes with drum’n’bass and dance, were due to conclude a spring tour of Turkey with a gig in May at Bristol’s Strange Brew club, plus one in Brighton where Breslaw lives. But then, after protests from local activists about both the band’s past performances in Israel, and with Israeli singer Zohara, Strange Brew abruptly cancelled, citing “the ongoing situation in Gaza”.To be told they hadn’t met the venue’s “ethical standards” was devastating, says Breslaw, the band’s 52-year-old drummer: “It felt so unjust.” But worse came when his home-town venue cancelled in solidarity. “It changed how I felt about the city, how I felt about parts of the music industry. And it changed how I felt about the political home I always felt I lived in.” Although the Brighton promoter swiftly apologised, only in November did Strange Brew issue a statementsaying it had “made a mistake”, adding that the band likely only attracted scrutiny because they are “a Jewish band performing with an Israeli singer”.Feelings clearly remain raw when I meet Breslaw and fellow band member Steve Leviin north London’s JW3 community centre. It offers everything you’d expect from a neighbourhood arts venue: posters advertising a panto, children’s craft – and one thing found only in Jewish spaces, namely thorough airport-style security frisking at the gate.Since the Manchester synagogue attack, inwhich two worshippers died in a car and knife attack on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, the community has stepped up already tight security, says Breslaw: buy tickets for a small Jewish play or book reading, and the location may be disclosed only 24 hours before. Levi, the band’s 49-year-old clarinet player, hates the fact they had to hire extra security for a recent gig at north London’s Islington Assembly Hall: “Musicians shouldn’t have to look over their shoulder when they’re on stage.” Although this interview was conducted before the 14 December terror attack on Jews celebrating Hanukah on Bondi beach in Sydney, Australia, at the time of writing the Gaza ceasefire is fragile and the climate in Britain remains febrile.Against this backdrop, Oi Va Voi aren’t alone in their reservations about a regalvanised cultural boycott campaign, which asks artists to sever links with Israeli counterparts in solidarity with Gaza. This longstanding campaign, echoing tactics used against apartheid South Africa, insists it’s strictly peaceful. But the Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood – who recently played Tel Aviv – had two UK gigs with the Israeli musician Dudu Tassa cancelled after credible threats to the venue. There are signs, too, of the line between boycotting Israelis and targeting Jews blurring. Two British Jewish comedians, Rachel Creeger – whose show is about motherhood – and Philip Simon, had shows cancelled at this year’s Edinburgh festival fringe, over what the venue called staff safety concerns over additional security measures needed. Simon had a second run of shows cancelled after the venue cited his “views concerning the humanitarian situation in Palestine”, including social media posts criticising the actors’ union Equity’s support for a Palestine march. (Simon said he had “never expressed support for anything other than freeing the hostages and finding a path for peace” and that he was being “cancelled just for being Jewish”.)View image in fullscreenOi Va Voi on stage.Photograph: Tariana GorilovskyWhat worries Breslaw is what he sees as the creeping normalisation of the idea that British Jews are somehow suspect. Although he stresses he isn’t in any sense comparing cancellation to the Manchester attack, for him there’s a connection: “It’s deciding that this group of people is responsible for something and they’re a threat, when they couldn’t be further from a threat; they’re a vulnerable group of people that are under attack in this country. And the people who are putting us under attack need to take a look at how that’s happening, because itleadsto Manchester.”Oi Va Voi were, he argues, subjected to scrutiny that other musicians aren’t “because we were known as a Jewish band”. And it’s the singling out of a minority on ethnic grounds, in an arts scene that prides itself on inclusion, that he fears.Oi Va Voi formed in the early 00s out of a group of friends experimenting with combining klezmer melodies – folk tunes from their grandparents’ time – and the sounds of their own era, from drum’n’bass to breakbeat, soul and jazz. Breslaw and Levi are the only enduring members of a lineup that was “basically people discovering music that their parents thought was a bit naff”, says the former. But it was also, says the latter, about keeping the old songs alive. Across two decades they have played Glastonbury, won two BBC Radio 3 World Music awards, featured a young KT Tunstall as guest singer and even gigged at the Kremlin (though not for Vladimir Putin, they stress; “I think it was Russian Jewish man of the year or something”). Until May, they’d played across Europe without incident – including in predominantly Muslim Turkey, where some fans went so far as getting Oi Va Voi tattoos. Their music often addresses feelings about exile and migration, with resonance well beyond the Jewish community.Amid the cancellation furore, a young Iranian messaged Breslaw on Instagram, saying he had listened to the band’s 2003 hit Refugee daily before leaving to seek asylum in Germany. “And I was like: ‘OK, these people that are cancelling us have no concept of what we have tried to do with our music,’” he says. “Refugee was always about the human story: how does it feel to be on that journey, to be that lost and alone?”Promoters don’t want the heat … They think: You know what, it’s not worth the troubleIt is against this background that in May, Strange Brew asked them to explain activists’ allegations of playing “occupied Palestinian lands”. (They say they have gigged in Tel Aviv, which isn’t in the occupied territories – though activists who don’t accept Israel’s right to exist sometimes deem the entire country occupied.) There were also objections to the cover of an album Zohara made separately from the band, Welcoming the Golden Age, which featured her naked in a field gathering watermelons in a wheelbarrow. Her bandmates say she meant it only as a statement about “femininity, going back to nature”, and didn’t realise that the cut fruit – whose colours echo the Palestinian flag – has become a popular symbol of Palestinian resistance, especially on western social media.“I’ve spoken to some Israeli people who have never heard of this watermelon thing,” says Levi. Breslaw points out that there are easier ways of determining Zohara’s politics than reading sinister meanings into album covers: in Tel Aviv she’s been a very active anti-war protester, whose recent single denounced the Netanyahu government’s reluctance to end the war. “She’s being criticised not for who she is, what she stands for, but where she was born.”Zohara herself posted on Instagram at the time that the row was secondary to “the only thing that truly matters: ending the starvation in Gaza, bringing all the hostages home and stopping Israel’s bombardments”.Yet at the time Oi Va Voi chose not to defend themselves by taking a stance on the war, and even now they won’t say exactly what they think about it: first on the grounds that British Jews aren’t accountable for a foreign government; and second that they don’t see why they can’t just get on with making music. “I don’t understand this need for all the artists out there to make their statement, as if – if they didn’t make it – people would assume that they must really love the war,” says Breslaw. “Come on, it’s ridiculous.” Nor, he says, do they want their cancellation weaponised for dubious political ends. “We don’t want to be dragged into a culture war from the hard right.”What they will say, to anyone confused as to how British Jews can be offended both by being treated as synonymous with Israelis and by the rap duo Bob Vylan chanting “death to the IDF” on stage, is that diaspora emotions are complicated. Many British Jews, Breslaw explains, have loved ones in Israel. “That doesn’t mean they support what’s going on, it just means they’re more connected. So if you call for the destruction of that place, it’s going to make people feel worried and uneasy.”Moreover, he won’t rule out Oi Va Voi playing in Israel again. Cultural boycotts can, he argues, isolate and push away the very creatives trying hardest to find solutions. “What does it do to an artist like Zohara who spends most of her time on the streets protesting against her government, fighting really hard, making music that is specifically anti-war? The people in the boycott organisations say: ‘Well there’s got to be some collateral damage’ but no I don’t really see the need.” Although he understands the strength of feeling, “if people think that by cancelling Oi Va Voi or posting aggressive comments [on messageboards] they’re inching closer to solving the Middle East peace process then I think they’re very wrong”.So do they agree with the Jewish protesters calling recently for the cancellation of a Bob Vylan gig in London? “I’m not into the cancelling of things. But I do think if someone wants to play they should be responsible, and they shouldn’t be calling for hate and death,” says Breslaw. Levi argues that the line is crossed “when you’re inciting racial hatred, because that’s illegal”. But mostly, they’re wary of political statements, preferring the music to do the talking.It was Levi’s idea to respond to cancellation with exuberant dance track Back to My Roots, built round a klezmer melody. All about “standing proud, restating what you’re about, that we’re still playing as a band”, it includes synagogue-style cantorial singing and a blast of shofar, the ram’s horn traditionally blown at the Jewish new year.“That’s about calling you back to who you are every year,” Levi says.Through several newer songs – including Dance Again, a response to the Nova festival massacre, and the title singlefrom their new album The Water’s Edge – runs the idea underpinning many Jewish religious festivals, of defying adversity with hope. “It’s about a persecuted minority surviving,” says Levi.Returning to live gigging is, for the band, also an expression of that desire not to be erased. But post-cancellation, says Breslaw, some bookers seem wary. “I think it’s just they don’t want the heat of the intimidatory tactics of the people that want to see bands like us cancelled. They think: You know what, it’s not worth the trouble.”He understands the fear of losing business, he says; the sense across the arts world that it may be easier to give in than risk a backlash. “But if everyone does that, where does that leave us?”Explore more on these topicsCultureFolk musicDance musicJudaismReligioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

I can’t tell you exactly, but a couple of weeks ago, I had 11 cats living in my terrace house. And I can say with confidence this is absolutely, definitely too many.At time of writing, I still have seven.Somehow, my home has, against my will and better judgment, become something of a cat rescue centre, and an illustration of whatCatsProtection has described as a growing crisis of abandoned felines.This all started last summer, when I convinced my husband, Michael, that we needed a kitten as company for our grumpy old ginger boy Phillip, which would bring our number of cats to the completely normal and socially acceptable number of two.We contacted a local rescue centre, and they in turn convinced us we didn’t need one kitten, we needed two. Taking two, they said, would mean they would entertain each other; it would be less work for us. The fact that they were overrun with kittens they needed to rehome was, I’m sure, merely coincidental.So, Joanne and Susan (combined with Phillip – they’re named afterthe Human League) came to live with us; their mother had been found heavily pregnant a few weeks before, by some bins in an alley, and taken to the rescue centre. And we were more than content with our Feline League.View image in fullscreenHannah and Michael hope to be down to a more acceptable number of cats soon.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianUntil one day in September when a neighbour, Viv, came knocking on our back door. She’d found some kittens in the back alley and didn’t know what to do. (Presumably she thought Michael and I would be best placed to help with excess cats, as we already had more cats than anyone else in the street.)We live in Levenshulme, inManchester, where terrace houses back on to alleyways. We’ve always had the odd stray, and our neighbours look out for them, leaving out food and beds. But in recent months, the problem had grown from the odd stray into something of a cat colony. Viv had gone to take out the blanket from a carrier to wash it and found three five-day-old black kittens inside.I thought I knew exactly what to do in this situation. I rang a cat rescue charity, who would just come and collect them. Except every single one I tried was full. I rang the RSPCA; because the cats weren’t sick or injured, it wasn’t in their remit. My options, it transpired, were “leave them there or take them in”.It could only ever be the latter. We named the three babies (then of unknown sex) Leslie, Stevie and Toni and also took in the mother, calling her Phillipa, after Phillip. This seemed like a great idea when the plan was to rehome her, but we’ve decided to keep her, and even though she now goes by Pippa, we must appear to have a distinct lack of imagination.We had a steady stream of neighbours drop round with cat food, treats and even cash (to help cover Leslie’s vet bills, as she was found with a bad eye infection).Dog and cat abandonment soars in UK as owners struggle with cost of livingRead moreI’d got in touch with Cats Protection, who had, over the course of several weeks, trapped, neutered and returned seven cats who were still living in the alley, and I’d even managed to find homes for three of them. Viv is still hoping to find patient and experienced cat owners for the others.By the end of October, with the seven alley cats largely dealt with, and the seven cats in our house more or less peacefully coexisting, things felt a bit more settled. We thought that must surely be all that the cat distribution system had in store for us.Then, just before Halloween, a message popped up on the WhatsApp group for our streets: “Can anyone help with this? We’ve found a mumma cat and four kittens.”The 12-week-old black-and-white kittens were running around in the alley and into the road; we spoke to the owner of the mother, who said she was “trying to get rid of them” and agreed to surrender the kittens to us.And so we found ourselves walking home with our second litter of kittens in as many months, bringing the total number of cats in our house up to 11.I’d been fine with three, fine with seven, but with 11 in the house my eyes were itching, my nose started running and I was rooting through the bathroom cabinet for the antihistamines.View image in fullscreenAnother of the kittens.Photograph: Hannah Al-OthmanOur house is a two-bedroom terrace, with an open plan downstairs, which is lovely for letting the light flow through but less ideal for storing multiple litters of kittens.As we have a cat flap on the back door for our existing cats, who have come to be known as the “downstairs cats”, we needed to keep all of the new unvaccinated and unneutered arrivals upstairs and behind closed doors.Michael had already moved his computer from his office to the dining table to accommodate the first litter, but with our only spare room already full of cats, we had no option but to keep the second set of kittens in our bathroom.After experiencing the least peaceful bath of my life the day after they arrived, I did not attempt a second one until they’d gone. Luckily, the second litter were old enough to be rehomed straight away, and three days later we had our bathroom back and I could breathe through my nose again.Pippa’s kittens will be old enough to go to their new homes soon, and we’ll be down to the almost reasonable number of four cats. But we fear it may be only a matter of time until the next resident litter.With the cost of living increasing,fewer people are paying to neuter their pets. Figures from Cats Protection’s annual study of cat ownership and welfare found that neutering numbers had fallen to 82%, down from 85% in 2024 and 88% in 2020.Younger cat owners are also less likely to have neutered their pet, with 71% of cats owned by those aged 18 to 34 neutered, compared with 95% of those belonging to people aged over 55.“In the last 12 months, around 5,100 stray cats came into the care of Cats Protection, representing around 18% of all cats taken in by the charity,” said SuiLi Weight, a senior community operations outreach manager for the organisation. “However, centres and branches across the UK regularly reach capacity, meaning it’s vital to prevent cats from becoming strays in the first place.”“We’re seeing a worrying rise in the number of stray and abandoned cats, which is putting huge pressure on animal rescues across the country,” Alice Potter, cat welfare expert at the RSPCA, added.“Our centres are full, and we currently have more than 300 cats being cared for in private boarding facilities. The soaring cost of living and fewer cats being neutered are clearly having an impact.“Many owners are struggling with vet costs or delaying neutering, which has led to more unwanted litters. Cats can breed from as young as four months old, and a single female can have up to 18 kittens a year – so numbers can quickly spiral.”And don’t we know it. “Are you sure you’ll be fine with having three?” I asked a neighbour, as she came to pick up two of the second litter. She’d already taken in one of the neutered alley cats. “Sure,” she replied, “what’s three when you’ve already got one?”Unfortunately, this kind of dangerous thinking is exactly how we got ourselves into this mess in the first place. What’s three when you already have one? What’s seven when you already have three? And what is 11 when you already have seven?Explore more on these topicsCatsAnimal welfarePetsNorth of EnglandManchesterAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The visitors’ problem was a lack of cutting edge. Towards the end Joelinton pulled the trigger with the goal begging but drilled only into Senne Lammens’ gloves. Joe Willock did the same with a cross. Then, Anthony Gordon spurned one more clear chance.Manchester United v Newcastle: Premier League – liveRead moreSo, missing Bruno Fernandes for only the fourth time of a five-year, 308-appearance United career, Ruben Amorim’s men finished the night happy, particularly as the captain was one of seven unavailable.Factor in how they ended with a backline containing the 20-year-olds, Leny Yoro and Tyler Fredricson, Ayden Heaven (19), plus Tyrell Malacia, who last featured in January, and you understood why the head coach was pleased.“Yes, especially if you see the second half, we managed to defend sometimes with a back six [were forced to] and we suffered together. If we always have this spirit we are going to win so many games. It is something we need to feel – that we can win games with spirit and togetherness,” said Amorim.Of Dorgu, he said: “Maybe the game today with a lot of transitions is good for his ability to drive with the ball. He did well.”For the first time, Amorim’s configuration featured a flat back four even when defending and stationed Dorgu as a right-winger, with Mason Mount chief orchestrator in attacking midfield.The former Chelsea man was a cocktail of industry and creation A gilded chance for Casemiro came when Mount’s corner dropped on to his head: unmarked, the Brazilian twitched his neck muscles and missed – poorly. Then Mount hassled Lewis Hall, pilfered possession, and passed to Dorgu. The Dane’s cross went to Benjamin Sesko whose pivot was followed by an aimless shot.Punch and counterpunch was the pattern. Sandro Tonali popped a corner in from Newcastle’s left, Bruno Guimarães nodded on, and in a near-post thicket Lammens squeezed the ball away.Eddie Howe’s unchanged XI were on top so Dorgu’s blistering strike was succour for United. Matheus Cunha’s devilry claimed a throw-in which Diogo Dalot lobbed into Newcastle’s area, Nick Woltemade’s header looped to Dorgu, and an instant left-foot volley flashed past Aaron Ramsdale in the visitors’ goal.View image in fullscreenManchester United’s Lisandro Martínez (No 6) was cleared of handball, despite Newcastle’s appeals.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesOne-nil to United and a feather in the Amorim cap for switching the effervescent Dorgu to attack. He and his teammates now hurtled at their visitors in a red blur. Balletic Dorgu feet bedazzled on the right and brought Mount in but his touch was laboured. Luke Shaw careered along the left and hoped to put Sesko in but failed. Cunha, too, tried to locate the Slovenia forward and was thwarted. A Dorgu break followed by an effort that Ramsdale saved, and the sight of Manuel Ugarte scheming were all part of the show Amorim’s men were putting on.They were breathless and exhilarating, direct and potent – in attack. Yet as the goals against column showed at kick-off – 30 conceded – defence is their issue. When Sesko dawdled and was robbed in his own half, instantly United were turned. The ball went to Jacob Murphy and a skimming ball over was missed by a stranded Lammens.United were missing Matthijs De Ligt, Harry Maguire, Kobbie Mainoo, and Fernandes, all injured, plus Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui, and Amad Diallo, who are on Africa Cup of Nations duty. But at the interval Amorim’s team – captained by Lisandro Martínez, in his first start since February – walked off to applause, fine tidings for the head coach as his bench was crammed with five academy youngsters, including the Fletcher twins, Jack and Tyler, who were together in a matchday squad for the first time.Jack was brought on for Mount by Amorim who saw a slick Woltemade backheel find Jacob Ramsey. He manoeuvred into space then fell over, comically, in instalments.United’s bad habit of falling asleep directly after the break was again present. Newcastle, scenting blood, forced a medley of corners. At one, the ball bounced to Fabian Schär and his snapshot was deflected away by Dorgu.Amorim, seeing enough, brought Joshua Zirkzee on for Sesko, whose final act was to crash the ball off Ramsdale’s bar, as Yoro replaced Casemiro. None of this halted Newcastle’s flow. Hall skirted past Ugarte and also hit the bar. Schär wanted handball by Martínez but the video assistant referee ruled this was inadvertent, the defender’s effort hitting him on the underarm.Newcastle have won away from home only once in the league this season, 4-1 against Everton. Howe said: “You could make an argument we should have got something today but ultimately we haven’t.”He needs to remedy this – fast.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Jukebox Man, though, had met it slightly wrong and conceded what appeared to be a crucial quarter-length before finding an immense final effort that saw him squeeze between Gaelic Warrior and Banbridge and get a flared nostril down right on the line.The margins were the minimum of a nose and the same, with just a half-length back to Jango Baie in fourth, and while the TV cameras zeroed in on The Jukebox Man and Ben Jones as the winners, Redknapp was less convinced that he had just achieved the biggest win of his long career as an owner. He stepped away from the crowd of well-wishers near the winner’s enclosure, alone with his thoughts as he awaited the judge’s verdict, but when the announcement came – “First, number eight” – there was a huge roar of approval from every corner of the track.“It is a dream to have a horse that good,” Redknapp said. “Just to run was a great thing for me as I was so proud of having a runner here, but to have the winner is special.“What a race he has run. He has jumped unbelievable. I thought he was beat when they came to him and I thought he will finish fourth, but he has come again. The guts the horse has shown is just amazing.”Redknapp has owned horses both on the Flat and over jumps since the 1980s, and knows well that it is a game where occasional triumphs will – hopefully – cancel out the many disappointments. He even warned Ben Pauling, The Jukebox Man’s trainer, that he was “an unlucky owner” before first sending him a horse about eight years ago, but they have enjoyed a near-constant run of success ever since including a first win for Redknapp’s coloursat the Cheltenham festival in March 2024.“It is right up there with my best achievements,” Redknapp said. “Football is my life, so when you are winning the FA Cup final for the fans [as he didwith Portsmouth in 2008] it is an incredible feeling. We had a lot of support here today and I love the racing and the people in it, so to have a winner on the big stage is fantastic.“Ben trained Shakem Up’Arry to win at Cheltenham, which was a dream, and then to come here today is great so Ben has done amazingly well for me. We’ve not had a bad horse, touch wood.”The Jukebox Man went into Friday’s race as the least exposed runner in the field, making just his fourth start in a chase. Having proved himself worthy of a place against the Madrids and Barcas of the racing world, attention now turns to the sport’s showpiece meeting in March – a rough equivalent of the Euros as the elite jumping horses from Britain, Ireland and France converge on Cheltenham.View image in fullscreenBen Jones riding The Jukebox Man, centre, to victory in the King George VI Chase at Kempton.Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty ImagesPauling did not hesitate to point The Jukebox Man towards the Cheltenham Gold Cup, over an additional quarter-mile, and his chaser will not race again before the festival.“What a very special day,” Pauling said. “It really is the moment where you score the winning goal with a minute to go, that was as tight as it gets.“I think you would be daft not to go to the Gold Cup now if he comes out of it well, and what a race that will be as well.”Collectors Item just the ticket for Welsh NationalJonjo and AJ O’Neill were forced to shut down operations at their Jackdaw’s Castle stable in early November as a virus swept through the yard but their string was showing a signs of a revival before Christmas, with four wins from 15 runners, and their eight-year-oldCollectors Itemhas an obvious each-way chance in the Coral Welsh Grand National at Chepstow on Saturday.Collectors Item was one of his yard’s first runners after a three-week closure when he lined up for the Grand National Trial at Chepstow in early December, a race that has been won by the subsequent big-race winner on 27 December in three of the last four seasons.Enchantingly old-school Mr Vango can thrill with Welsh Grand National winRead moreHe could not a find way past his fellow front-runner, Jubilee Express, another leading contender for Saturday’s feature race, but was running for the first time since April and has every right to come on for the outing.Collectors Item lines up off the same mark on Saturday and while he likes to race prominently, which is generally an advantage at Chepstow, he may be able to sit just behind what promises to be a very strong pace, with Mr Vango and Jubilee Express among those setting out to make the running.The popular Mr Vangowould be a major danger to all on deeper ground, but it is officially good-to-soft at Chepstow with little or no rain in the forecast.In any case,Collectors Item (2.55)was just a length-and-a-half behind Mr Vango in last season’s London National at Sandown and is nearly a stone better off with that rival on Saturday.

This abject surrender came just six days after Quins were thumped 40-14 by Bristol at Twickenham.“The boys care for the club – but there’s a difference between caring for the club and doing something about it,” the Queenslander said pointedly after his players conceded 31 second-half points without reply. “We will be looking hard at the squad in terms of what next year looks like.”Sale squad’s ‘honest’ meeting with owners has reset ambitions, says SandersonRead moreAfter a sixth defeat from eight in the league, Quins can almost certainly forget about the playoffs. But things are finally looking up again for Sale, who reduced their visitors to so much rubble with five second-half tries.Sale’s recent dismal league run, culminating in a 47-21 defeat at Northampton last weekend, prompted the club’s wealthy owners to meet Alex Sanderson and his players. The basic message from Simon and Michelle Orange was “raise your game” and it was heeded.At half-time, though, surely not even Sanderson, a positive person by nature, could have foreseen his side winning so convincingly.“I’m quite emotional now actually but the owners have been really supportive,” said Sale’s director of rugby. “I just thought we were physically brilliant all game. We were down on the scoreboard at half-time, but that didn’t represent the physical dominance we had in that first half.“It was a case of ‘more of the same, please’ and sometimes the plan just comes together, so I couldn’t be prouder of the lads. We desperately needed the win but could I have seen that second half coming? Not the scoreline.“It blew out but I thought we were good value for the win. Even though we were 17-12 down at half-time, the lads stuck at it and they got their reward.”View image in fullscreenAlex Sanderson was under pressure after meeting the Sale owners this week but his side delivered for him.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesIf they could not beat another side struggling so badly in Quins, could Sale really consider themselves ready to start climbing the table?It was a nightmarish start, though, for Sanderson and his players as Quins led early on when Marcus Smith dived over from close range.Smith converted but Sale steadied themselves and hit back in the eighth minute with a slick try from Alex Wills from Rob du Preez’s exquisite long pass.George Ford missed the conversion but his intricate probing came increasingly to the fore for Sale, who had their second try when their England and Lions hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie went over from close range.Jack Walker’s close-range effort – and Smith’s conversion – put the visitors 17-12 up at the break but there was an impressive physicality about Sale and they were rewarded in spades during a ludicrously one-sided second half.The flanker Jacques Vermeulen produced two smart tries to secure the bonus point and Sale, self-belief coursing through their veins, began to move through the gears in devastating fashion.Centre Rekeiti Ma’asi-White finished off some delightful handling for their fifth before scrum-half Raffi Quirke pounced on an awful error from Smith to score Sale’s sixth. Quirke chased his own kick and Smith, inside his own in-goal area, dithered and allowed the ball to bounce beyond him, inviting Sale’s scrum-half to pounce and score.It was a sweet moment for Quirke, who was switched to the wing at the end of the first half after Tom O’Flaherty moved to full-back to replace Joe Carpenter.Smith was taunted by the home stands and, when they chanted “Marcus, Marcus, give us a wave” he responded, much to the delight of the Sale fans.There was still time for the replacement hooker Nathan Jibulu to crash over from close range amid scenes of mounting euphoria. But for Quins the problems continue to mount.Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbySaleHarlequinsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

So deep that he decided it would be best if his wife and two small children spent Christmas in their native Sweden while he continued to put in long days on Teesside.Given that the Hellberg family will soon be reunited in a new home in North Yorkshire and Blackburn’s visit represented the first of four games in nine days it seemed a sensible sacrifice – even if such pragmatism failed to pay the desired Boxing Day dividends. The former Hammarby head coach had hoped to celebrate the completion of his first month in charge at the Riverside Stadium after succeeding the Wolves-bound Rob Edwards with three points but Blackburn, and their irrepressible midfielder Todd Cantwell in particular, had different ideas.While this draw keeps Boro second in theChampionship, eight points behind the leaders Coventry, it raised question marks about the long-term suitability of Hellberg’s narrow 4-2- 2-2 formation.Championship roundup: Coventry go eight points clear while Leicester lose againRead moreBefore last weekend’s 2-0 defeat at Bristol City, the 37-year-old had presided over four straight wins and Boro appeared to be turning into wingless wonders. Here though his preferred configuration looked overly compact and a system built on plenty of slick, short, sharp one and two-touch passing through midfield malfunctioned a little.Admittedly the resultant congestion probably helped limit Cantwell’s room for manoeuvre behind Blackburn’s front two but he remained influential enough to make longstanding home fans pine for a Stuart Ripley or a Stewart Downing offering an outlet down the wings.Boro’s own attacks were invariably constructed in central areas and, although players naturally drifted wide at times the resultant lack of crosses often made life relatively straightforward for Valérien Ismaël’s back five.Hellberg preferred to blame the execution of his gameplan rather than the blueprint itself. “I think we passed the ball too much instead of driving forward,” said Edwards’s impressive, eloquent replacement. “The performance was not good enough. We didn’t deserve more than a draw. But that’s life, you have days that are tough.”Ismaël’s post-match delight certainly seemed a testament to Boro’s potential. “It was tough, as we expected, but we played a great away game,” said Blackburn’s manager. “Middlesbrough might be the best side we’ve faced so far this season in possession but we managed that well. I’m very proud of the boys. We just needed to be more clinical in the final third.”Indeed, Ismaël’s side would have taken a late first-half counterattacking lead had Yuki Ohashi not dragged his shot wide at a moment when Hellberg’s defence had come completely undone.Suitably stung, the hosts were very nearly ahead themselves a couple of minutes later after David Strelec and Hayden Hackney conjured a fine break that concluded with Morgan Whittaker watching in disbelief as his right-footed shot rebounded off the inside of a post.View image in fullscreenMiddlesbrough’s Morgan Whittaker reacts after seeing his shot come off the inside of a post.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAHellberg liberated Sverre Nypan’s midfield skills from the bench at the outset of the second half but the 19-year-old Manchester City loanee and Norway international was eclipsed by Cantwell’s increasing vision and determination.The former Norwich and Rangers creator has recently recovered from injury and wore an enormous bandage on his already heavily strapped right knee but he refused to allow it to weigh him down.Cantwell’s cause was helped by the introduction of Moussa Baradji in the heart of the Rovers midfield. On for the injured Ryoya Morishita, the Frenchman delighted in reducing Hackney’s control in the centre of the pitch.Tellingly, a clearly frustrated Hackney seemed fortunate to be shown a yellow rather than a red card after kicking out aggressively at Taylor Gardner-Hickman with the ball long gone.Granted Blackburn did not force Middlesbrough’s goalkeeper Sol Brynn into a single significant save, let alone take advantage of the injury-induced withdrawal of three home defenders in Alfie Jones, George Edmundson and the Newcastle loanee Matt Targett. But the way they stifled Boro’s creativity bodes well for Ismaël’s future.On this evidence his improving Rovers should soon allay any lingering fears of a springtime relegation skirmish but Middlesbrough may arguably need to adopt a slightly less one-dimensional approach when Hull visit Teesside on Monday night.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipMiddlesbroughBlackburn Roversmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

This was, after all, the first grand slam final between the two players who seemed set to lead men’s tennis for many years to come.For three hours and 43 minutes Sinner had dominated Alcaraz and he earned three championship points while leading 5-3 in set four. Just before the Italian’s second championship point, I thrust up my phone and took a quick photo before my hand returned to my laptop, ready to file immediately an article that hailed his third consecutive major title and first triumph in Paris.Carlos Alcaraz saves three match points to beat Sinner in epic French Open finalRead moreInstead, it would take another hour and 46 minutes for a winner to be decided on Court Philippe-Chatrier in June. What unfolded was one of the greatest comebacks and matches as Alcaraz returned from the abyss to produce an astounding 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) victory.Even now, six months removed from that day, it is difficult to fully comprehend those events in Paris. For hours Alcaraz had been outhit and outplayed by his biggest rival and the then world No 1 in a major final. His dire unforced errors to fall 0-40 down at 3-5 in set four seemed to seal his fate. No one in the stadium believed a comeback was possible.No one except Alcaraz. First he dragged himself back to deuce, completely locking down his game, then he soared. By the time he closed out his service game for 4-5 with an outrageous running forehand winner, the energy inside the stadium had shifted and the crowd met the moment spectacularly.The stadium shook as most of the 15,000 present punctuated every successful point from Alcaraz with roars of encouragement and delight, to which the Spaniard responded by cupping his ears, pumping his fists and doing everything in his power to take advantage of their encouragement.Once the momentum had been wrestled back, it seemed as if he would not let go. Alcaraz methodically worked his way through the fourth set, then broke serve at the beginning of the fifth and maintained his advantage until he led 5-3. Had he calmly closed out the match at his first opportunity, this would still have been a classic.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz lies on the clay of Court Philippe-Chatrier after finally triumphing in five hours and 29 minutes.Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesThe final 30 minutes, however, are what truly established this contest as one of the all-time greats. Sinner, having spent the fifth set hobbling around the court, his energy destroyed, suddenly found a second, third and fourth wind all at once.He retrieved the break and the level of play ascended into the stratosphere as, driven by desperation and adrenaline after five hours of battle, both players swung with total freedom.Despite all that had already unfolded, the most memorable moment came in the form of the defensive slice Alcaraz struck deep in the fifth set as Sinner hunted his fourth championship point at 6-5, 30-30. No other player would have even put a racket on the ball, yet Alcaraz somehow turned that critical point around in one stroke.He ended lasering winners at will from every part of the court as he closed out his fifth grand slam title in a match tie-break to seal his biggest triumph.Alcaraz’s ridiculous victory over Sinner sets tone for next decade of rivalry at top of tennis | Tumaini CarayolRead moreNo matter how much more the 22-year-old achieves, this will surely be the defining moment of Alcaraz’s career. In the past he has been known to lose focus quickly in some matches, chasing highlight-reel winners and offering cheap unforced errors. He can be a master self-saboteur.However, in the biggest moments of the most consequential matches, Alcaraz has an unprecedented ability to lock in and produce his very best, most fearless tennis under suffocating pressure. There is no deficit he can not overturn.What was it like to cover such an event? It was a delight and horror in equal parts. The thrill at being able to watch such an encounter up close is obvious, but those emotions are paired with the tension that comes with trying to instantly make sense of a result that makes no sense.I ended up writing four reports: Sinner winning in four sets, Alcaraz winning in five, Sinner winning in five and then the final report. My brief panic after Alcaraz broke back for 5-5 was quelled only by the adrenaline that took over for me too.Most of all, it is a privilege to witness these moments. It was reasonable to conclude after the dominance of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer that it might take some time for the next legends to emerge. In their first grand slam final together, surrounded by so much hype and expectation, Alcaraz and Sinner showed the world that two such talents are already among us and the sport is now theirs.This article is the second in a series from our correspondents on the most memorable moments of 2025.

The Black Cats, for all their impressive displays, have only scored one goal so far in four outings in December, Chemsdine Talbi’s effort against Liverpool. Sunderland have three strikers in their ranks in Brian Brobbey, Eliezer Mayenda and Wilson Isidor – the latter of whom is their top scorer with four league goals – and Brobbey was the latest of that trio to find the net, scoring against Bournemouth in November.Katy Murrellshelms our liveblog withLouise Taylorreporting from the Stadium of Light.Premier League4.30pmCrystal Palace v Tottenham liveWith both clubs having to bear damaging defeats last weekend, there’s an extra frisson to this London derby, particularly as Palace sprung a double over Spurs last season. Palace are set to be without Chris Richards after the defender required stitches in a cut foot during the Carabao Cup exit to Arsenal. Oliver Glasner said that goalkeeper Dean Henderson will return despite stand-in Walter Benítez’s impressive display against the Gunners. Tottenham will be missing their captain Cristian Romero and Xavi Simons due to suspension.

Cameroon won by the same scoreline against Gabon after Karl Etta Eyong’s early strike. The Indomitable Lions, five-time Cup of Nations winners, have been to more World Cups than any other African country but have struggled of late.

Still, would that be so bad? “It could be better or worse, it depends when or why. If it’s because you want it, or if it’s because somebody told you to go.”If soaking up rays sounds like anathema to Cuesta it is because, in a remarkable ascent, he has barely wasted a minute. In June, shortly before turning 30, he took the reins at Parma and became theyoungest head coach in Serie A since 1939. Half of his short life had been spent building up to that moment, the realisation crystallising in his late teens that no other calling would do. “I felt that I needed to coach,” he says. “It was like an inner necessity that I had inside of me.”Havertz near to Arsenal return with Arteta hoping for ‘different dimension’ in attackRead moreCuesta had been coveted long before his arrival in Emilia-Romagna. It was during a five-year spell as one of Mikel Arteta’s assistants at Arsenal that he matured from inquisitive, ferociously diligent tyro into an elite manager in waiting. Nobody involved with the Premier League leaders would play down Cuesta’s influence; the public received a glimpse when he featured in the club’sAll or Nothing documentarythree years ago. Parting ways brought its own agony.“It was maybe the most difficult decision of my life,” he says of the moment Parma called. Cuesta had to weigh the sense he was aboard a rocket ship against the privilege of being sought by a club feted for itssuccess in the 1990s. “I was incredibly happy at Arsenal, surrounded by incredible people in an incredible project. Not only with great players and a path that is only growing and growing, but with a person who has been incredibly important for me, which is Mikel.”View image in fullscreenCarlos Cuesta with Declan Rice at Arsenal last year. Cuesta says he was ‘incredibly happy’ at the club.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesArteta would never have stood in Cuesta’s way. Other clubs had long been hovering. “I needed to consider a lot of things but in the end I had a great feeling with the people atParma,” Cuesta says. “It’s an amazing, historic club. You can feel there has been success here and, at the same time, there have been many ups and downs. Right now, we are trying to create our own path and our own chapter.”To Parma, all the way from Palma. Cuesta was born in Mallorca, the youngest of four siblings, then 12, 11 and nine. “I was like the penalty,” he quips, but the age gap with his sister and two brothers meant there was little sparring. “It was the opposite,” he says. “They are like extra dad or mum figures. They’ve helped a lot in my education, my standards, my way of approaching life. I guess, through my childhood, I was living in a process that helped me mature a little bit earlier than usual.”He played for Santa Catalina Atlético, a local lower-division side, until 18 but knew his prospects were limited. “I was a footballer that was on the pitch but not making a difference,” he admits. Life nonetheless revolved around the club. His mother ran its coffee shop; he would go there after school, hang out into the evening, immerse himself in the institution’s rhythms. “In this kind of way, I think it got into my blood,” he says.By 15, he had been invited to coach youngsters at Santa Catalina. What had the club’s elders spotted? “Passion for the game, I guess. And maybe a kid that had some time off, spending so long there! Perhaps when I was playing I was a little bit vocal too. But I was watching a lot of games and trying to understand the ‘why?’, trying to understand how things can improve.”The die was cast. Cuesta was confident, academically bright and ambitious. He wanted a career around football and for a short time considered sports journalism. The inner cry to make his name in coaching had become overwhelming by the time he began a sports science degree in Madrid.“I tried to be proactive in order to make it happen,” he says. Social media proved invaluable. Cuesta followed a number of staff from Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid on Twitter, eventually striking up conversations that brought a role in the latter’s academy alongside his studies. Atlético was “almost like the real university”: their coaches had spotted a precocious talent and he began working with their under-nines, eventually taking charge at under-14 level.View image in fullscreenCarlos Cuesta says of the challenge facing him at Parma: ‘We’re trying to create the competitive mindset we need to overcome adversity and develop.’Photograph: Fabio Fagiolini/IPA Sport/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockCuesta was motivated “to try and spend time with people that could add value for me”. During a year out after leaving Atlético he crammed in visits to clubs, managers, seminars and tournaments. Among the yields was a connection with Juventus, where he spent two years with the under-17s and under-23s. He was 22. “If Atlético was the university, Juventus was the master’s,” he says. “An incredible experience. Learning things like the attention to detail on tactics, on defensive aspects of the game.”Then came the call from Arteta, who was eight months in atArsenal. The pair had forged a relationship during Arteta’s time at Manchester City when Cuesta “had the opportunity to share some thoughts” with a coach whose outlook he already admired. He became one of Arteta’s most trusted lieutenants and the pair still communicate regularly. His face illuminates with every chance to extol his mentor’s virtues.“An incredible person,” he says. “He has always been extremely supportive through the whole process and still is. I can’t speak well enough about who he is, not just as a leader and a coach but as a human being.”The clarity, single-mindedness and intensity Cuesta exhibits during an hour-long conversation at Parma’s training centre bring easy comparison to the Arteta who, before his playing days wound down, was sketching out detailed visions of a life in management.Sometimes Cuesta finds himself rising at dawn and finishing work at 10pm, although he will try to at least operate from home in the evening. Long hours are an Arteta trait and so is a pragmatism that Cuesta, in trying to keep Parma from the relegation zone, may need to deploy at the expense of idealism.“You have your own sensibility and beliefs about what the game is, but I think it’s very important to have this flexibility to understand what the context requires,” he says. “It’s not always possible to do what you like, but you always have to do what is needed. There will be moments where what you like is needed or possible, but there will be many others where you just need to maximise the resources at your disposal and do your best.“That’s why I think, the bigger the spectrum of your knowledge and ability to convince players to do certain things, the better a coach you will be. I try to learn from many.”View image in fullscreenCarlos Cuesta reads voraciously and frequently dips into a translation of the Chinese text Tao Te Ching.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The GuardianHis initial role at Arsenal was individual development coach, which involved one-on-one work with players focusing on aspects of their game. The dressing room of Arteta’s early days was not outwardly the easiest to enter, even before considering Cuesta was 25 and almost unknown. Senior players embraced him swiftly though; the All or Nothing clip in which he animatedly, yet concisely, talks Ben White through his “world-class” attributes is a widely available example of his talents.“I tried to observe, to listen, to intervene only when I thought I could add some value, and from there to slowly try to get their credibility and trust,” he says. “When the player feels you can do that, and that you’re a good person with honesty, good intentions and good values, they follow and respect you.”Any flicker of fame from becoming a minor television star was, he says, blanked out by obsession with the day-to-day. That focus continues at Parma, where he oversees the third-youngest team in Europe’s top five leagues. We meet soon after a win at Pisa that pulls them well clear of the drop; three days later they are dragged back towards it by a home defeat to Lazio, whose winner comes after they had two men sent off. Consistency will take time.Perhaps his youth helps him relate to a much-changed squad that lost players such asGiovanni Leoni, who signed for Liverpool, in the summer. “Maybe the age can be a factor in terms of empathy,” he says. “We’re trying to create the competitive mindset we need to overcome adversity and develop. The players have been absolutely incredible – they are growing.”The quest for self-growth continues too. Cuesta reads voraciously: he frequently dips into a translation of the Chinese text Tao Te Ching, one of whose central tenets is self-awareness. Sacred Hoops, by the former NBA coach Phil Jackson, is another that “I usually have around”. Inspiration comes from numerous sources and the days when the wallpaper on his phone was a picture of the Champions League trophy, incentivising him with the most thrilling target available, are long gone.“Not any more, look!” he says, holding up a more nondescript background. “The only thing I have is the present. In this job you need to reframe ‘time’. For me, time right now means today is my everything.” The Maldives still feel a galaxy away.Explore more on these topicsParmaArsenalSerie AEuropean club footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

If the 49ers prevail, they can still clinch the No 1 seed with a win over the Seahawks in Week 18 owing to already holding the tie-breaker. If the Bears are victorious, they must beat the Lions next week and hope the Seahawks lose at least once to close the season. It is going down to the wire.What the Bears need to do to winThe Bears’ defense is having an extraordinary year turning the ball over. The ball-hawk brothers Kevin Byard and Nahshon Wright are showing a preternatural ability to read a quarterback’s mind and, as such, Chicago lead the league in interceptions (21) and total turnovers (31).They need to keep the giveaways flowing to cut the legs from a San Francisco offense quietly becoming a juggernaut. The 49ers’ success has been largely built on Brock Purdy’s return at quarterback, which has laid on a five-game winning streak in which they average a chunky 34.2 points per game. Backup Mac Jones also had success, though not quite as much, with the 49ers scoring 22.8 points per game and posting a 5-3 record under his care.A major difference is Purdy’s unwavering aggression when pushing the ball downfield. These more dynamic, trigger-happy tendencies can lead to interceptions, as Carolina discovered when picking Purdy off three times in November, only to lose 20-9. What the Bears have that the Panthers did not is an offense capable of outscoring San Francisco if they can pull off a similar trick. Chicago need to be conservative, guard against the big play and patiently await a present from Purdy.What the 49ers need to do to winSan Francisco need to slow down Chicago’s impressive two-man running attack. D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai, who have 1,728 rushing yards between them, form the best tandem in theNFLoutside of Buffalo’s unorthodox combination of James Cook and quarterback Josh Allen.Swift and Monangai’s old-school power running controls drives and keeps defenses honest as they efficiently chew up yardage from first whistle to last.The problem for the 49ers is that they have faced plenty of weak rushing attacks and have struggled against teams who run the ball well, such as the Rams. Los Angeles ran for 126 yards and two scores in their 42-26 thrashing of San Francisco in November. The solution may lie in the returns of linebacker Tatum Bethune and lineman Sam Okuayinonu from injury. Both are strong run defenders; both need to be ready to go toe-to-toe with a fierce offensive line and an even fiercer pair of backfield burners. The Bears will control the outcome if Swift and Monangai run riot.Rising: Pittsburgh Steelers“I think there’s a mindset that you pay for a ticket, you say whatever the hell you want. I think there should be some sort of code of conduct. Obviously that was intentional and I think there was some celebration afterward on his part,” mused the cerebral quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The depth of thought is still outstripping the arm, then – no change there.Where change has come for Pittsburgh is finding a cause they can rally behind to bind them as a unit. Rodgers has revealed that the in-house narrative is that DK Metcalf has been treated unfairly, despite the receiververy openly throwing a punch at someonehe could barely reach up to in the stands. Hardly a reflexive action to a vicious barb. But the bad man with the blue hair made him do it. Pittsburgh have their edge again.The entitled fan, and the rest of the NFL kingdom that want the black and gold to fail, are going to pay – even the home bodies chanting for Mike Tomlin to be fired in November. An edge missing on defense during early-season blundering has returned, enhancing an offense scoring in bunches for what feels like the first time in forever. Metcalf will make a triumphant return to save the Steelers on wild-card weekend, should they beat the Browns on Sunday or the Ravens next week, delivering a first playoff win in what also feels like forever. It is written.View image in fullscreenAaron Rodgers has the Steelers on the rise. Detroit on the other hand …Photograph: Nic Antaya/Getty ImagesFalling: Green Bay PackersThe wheels haven’t fallen off completely. The Packers are in the playoffs after the Lions limped out on Christmas Day. Job done. A window to winning the NFC North is still ajar, too, if the Bears lose out and the Packers win out.But after two successive defeats, Micah Parsons being ruled out for the season and quarterback Jordan Love’s fitness to face Baltimore in question, the omens don’t exactly scream Super Bowl contenders, which they very much were two weeks ago. The offense was exploding into life, leaning on Christian Watson’s deep threat, and Green Bay were leading the AFC-leading Broncos 23-14 early in the third quarter in Mile High.Defeat from a position of strength followed, as it did again at Soldier Field last week. The old enemy’s Caleb Williams delivered the most brutal of late daggers to extinguish what would have been a gritty victory against the odds. A chance missed to assume the playoff-boosting rallying cry – “nobody believes in us”. Instead, maybe the Packers themselves have lost faith now, too.Race for the No 1 pickAnd then there were two. A pair of 2-13 fall guys sharing respective nine-game doom slides. The Las Vegas Raiders and New York Giants sit in pole position for the top pick after Cam Ward’s Tennessee Titans whipped up on the fallen Kansas City Chiefs.And who might these bottom dwellers be facing this week? Each other. Yes, the bruised, battered and broken bowl comes crunching into focus, likely to settle the battle for good. Two jobbers enter; one leaves unsure whether to laugh or cry. The other lies crippled on the canvas, smiling through blackened teeth. Next year, the pain might just have been worth it.If the season ended todayAFC1) Denver 13-3; 2) New England 12-3; 3) Jacksonville 11-4; 4) Pittsburgh 9-6; 5) LA Chargers 11-4; 6) Buffalo 11-4; 7) Houston 10-5.

How? Plus, canal breaches and multiplying octopusesFri 26 Dec 2025 12.03 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 12.19 ESTShareMondayA canal in Shropshire hasdisappeared into a sinkhole. I paraphrase, but not by much.A report from the Cornwall Wildlife Trust tells us that 13 times as many octopuses as usual – about 233,000, or nearly 2m legs’ worth – were caught in UK waters this year.Look, I don’t believe in signs but – these things are a sign. I don’t know precisely what of, but they’re a sign. When two freaky variants of two already freaky things happen, it’s a sign. And what’s freakier than sinkholes appearing or octopuses? Sinkholes are holes thatappear out of nowhere. They are nowhere made manifest. They can happen anywhere, at any time. They just don’t care. You are safe never. The literal ground you are walking on could just give up on being ground and open up beneath you at any moment. This is no way to live. Holes need to be a thing that are only ever dug, laboriously, slowly, deliberately.And as for the other guys. I mean. No bones. Eight legs. Brains everywhere.No bones. And now they are clearly mustering for an invasion.Stay alert in 2026, that’s all I’m saying. Stay alert.TuesdayHere’s what I don’t understand. In the weeks leading up toChristmas, I have been doing twice as much work every day as I usually do so that I am free and clear for a bit over the actual proper Christmas bit and yet – no. I still have oodles to do before Boxing Day. How?I’m not complaining, please understand. I love to work and I love my job, two facts that I frequently send up prayer-type-things of thanks for before I bend back over my laptop to recommune therewith. I simply cannot fathom the maths. Twice as much for ages should eventually result in some kind of gap in the timetable, no? Deadlines met early, extra stuff filed, cached away, that should mean something, eventually, should it not?I eventually expressed some of my bafflement to a friend. “No,” she said. “What you have discovered is the essence of life as an adult. Time has no meaning. Existence is just one thing after another. You embrace that fact and move on. Or rather, you don’t. Because, as I say, this is life now.”I’m not sure this is exactly what Wizzard meant when they sang that they wished it could be Christmas every day. But we are where we are.Christmas EveA change is as good as a rest, they say, and today I am working on the train as my mother and I head to Devon to spend Christmas with my sister. The train left from Waterloo at 11.20am so my mother has been camping at the station for the last four days. I was in charge of buying the tickets so neither of us can be sure they’re right.We discuss my character flaws all the way there. I try to distinguish between my moral weaknesses and what I call “just being a different person from you”. But it’s a hard sell.Fortunately, one of my many defects is a willingness to partake of sustenance in public, because I was not raised by nuns who patrolled the streets of Preston looking for convent girls indulging in such venial sins and beating them to death outside Booths.And one of my mother’s few points of ignorance is that she doesn’t know that alcohol comes in vessels other than big green gin bottles. So I am downing cocktails in cans without her being any the wiser and Christmas is looking good.Christmas DayMy sister managed the whole thing perfectly. Great food, great presents, great reminding me to put my son’s stocking out before I went to bed – top work all round. The rest of the family did well too. I’d bought my husband the correct edition of the Dorset Pevsner he’d asked for, so he disappeared with that all afternoon.We gave Mum all our odd socks in a big basket and she happily sorted those all afternoon while trying to remember the names of everyone in White Christmas and refusing her grandson’s pleas to let him look it up on Google.We ate, we napped, we listened for the first time ever to the king’s speech and decided his mother probably wouldn’t be too ashamed of him. We washed up, we went for a little walk with the dog, we napped again, we agreed we should play a board game rather than stare at our phones, we did not play a board game, we went to bed. Strong recommend, especially the sock thing. She’s been quiet all day.View image in fullscreenDigested photo of the week 2: ‘Victoria, can you finish laying the table?

People are just so glad to be out, to be free instead of surrounded by loving relatives and weirdo uncles, to be looking round meaningless stuff again instead of having to feel gratitude and love and blessings and things. It’s got little to do with bargain hunting. In fact, if retailers had any sense, they would put their prices up. Everyone would pay the Boxing Day premium – the price of liberation.Christmas is lovely but, like sex or massages, it is even better when it stops.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekChristmascommentShareReuse this content"

But despite ‘peace’ being on the lips of world leaders ever since, we Palestinians are still under siege and afraidFri 26 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 08.29 ESTShareHere inGazawe hear the word “peace” constantly – even more often than we hear the roar of warplanes or the thuds of shelling. It appears on television screens, in the statements of world leaders, in promises repeated again and again. Every country claims to want peace for Palestinians. Yet have we ever lived it for a single day? The truth is that we have not.We are now living under a ceasefire, or at least that is what the US and the rest of the world have been telling us. But in Gaza, we haven’t felt it at all. It wasannounced on 10 October,amid great celebrations in Sharm el-Sheikh. Since then, Israeli forces have killedmore than 360 Palestinians, including about 70 children, in Gaza.Because of the explosions I keep hearing, I am still afraid to leave the house. We are trapped in an endless maze of waiting: for the suffering to stop, for our lives to begin again and above all, for thedeath to end.While the world’s leaders discuss the “day after” and finalise their peace plans, proposing and deciding our fate, we remain in the depths of the unknown, drowning in the fear and confusion war has caused. My family and I are now renting a small, unsuitable apartment. Daily life is extremely difficult. Access to water is limited, cash is hard to obtain with no working ATMs and the streets are so badly destroyed that walking or driving feels dangerous. There is no electricity or reliable internet, and no sense of stability or safety.I see families living in destroyed homes, with buildings above them at constant risk of collapse. They have no choice. All they want is a roof over their heads, even if it could fall at any second. And since it is December, with no homes left for us and our life confined to tents, some of us are literally submerged in winter water, in mud, in every sense of the word.2:40How Israel's 'yellow line' is dividing Gaza with deadly consequences – video explainerAlong the newly created borders of Gaza, where Israel has taken even more of our land and homes, is a new invisible boundary they call the “yellow line”. On the east side of the line, houses are demolished every day, and people cannot sleep because of the intensity of the explosions and the smell of smoke. We hear stories that children are shot if they comenear or crossthe line that no one can see. At the start of December I visited relatives in Gaza City whose home is still standing, near the so-called yellow line. The house constantly shakes from artillery fire and what we call explosive robots – ground-based, remotely operated devices loaded with large amounts of explosivesthat are capable of destroying entire residential blocks. They keep the windows closed most of the time because of the smoke from nearby attacks, which they fear may come fromphosphorus-based weapons.We dream of having the peace and security that are rightfully ours, but that now seems to exist only in a fantasy. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, countries discuss giving it to us as if it were forbidden, as if we were not entitled to it. We long for the simple realities of safety: a home that won’t be destroyed, lovers who might meet again, dreams that could come true, nights without fear. Things most people elsewhere take for granted.What is ‘home’ now? A woman’s two-year search for safety in the ruins of GazaRead moreWhen I heard about the “ceasefire” in October, I felt happy and hopeful, believing it would mark the end of the war and the beginning of a new life filled with safety and peace. Yet here I am at the end of December, still waiting for any real change. While the terms of the ceasefire are delayed on the ground, tears are shed at night. I wait to see my fiance, my love, whom I have not seen for two full years because it has been too dangerous to move between the central Gaza Strip, where I lived, and the southern part, where he lived. He travelled to Egypt in April 2024 – and now he cannot enter again and I cannot leave. Like so many other things in this war, our hope has been delayed. I must wait longer to be with the person I love, in peace. This is the true torment of a Palestinian: waiting for the unknown and trying to hold on to hope. Sometimes it feels worse than death.Benjamin Netanyahu said this month that thefirst phase of the ceasefire is near to completion. Unfortunately for Palestinians, none of it has translated into reality yet, and we remain excluded from the very negotiations that speak about our future without us. The beautiful Gaza we dream of returning to has gone. We look out and see rubble and suffering instead. The world and its constant meetings about our future have produced nothing that we can feel or touch.We try to create a form of peace for ourselves, even if it is fragile or false. We hold on to hope, even when it feels thin, and search for brief moments of happiness to survive the deadly waiting. We try to rebuild a life out of ashes because, as the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish wrote: “We carry hope like an illness, and we feel everything deeply.” In the end, this hope is all we have to keep going, while the world debates peace from afar.Aya Al-Hattab is a writer in GazaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s time to get ridFri 26 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 11.40 ESTShareWhen I was a kid, our TV was in a television cabinet. For those unfamiliar with this preposterous abomination, it was a box on legs into which the TV was placed to hide it. It was some sort of furniture hangover from the era of covering a piano’s ankles lest they cause lustful sweats to break out under the starched collars of young gentlemen.The trouble is, a two-doored, TV-shaped-and-sized box in the corner of the room where the TV would usually be, cables trailing from its rear and armchairs angled towards it, was about as good a disguise as when a child lacking object permanence puts its hand up to its eyes and assumes the rest of the world can’t see it.The other thing is: the TV didn’t need a box. It already had a box built round it. It even had a nickname, in case that wasn’t evident enough: “the box”.A box does not need a box. And so, in the same vein, a sink does not need a second sink sitting in it.The washing-up bowl is indefensible. Think on this as you wash your Christmas dishes. A bowl within a bowl. A water receptacle within a water receptacle. It does everything the sink does, and less. It doesn’t drain, for one thing. It has to be emptied into the sink for that to happen. (Although there are now some with plugholes, as if the pointlessness of this recursive arrangement needed underliningad absurdum.)For something that deals with water and the making cleaner of things, the washing-up bowl has some unsavoury side effects: that sump of waterlogged food clinging to its bottom, for instance. Or the fact that, over time, it becomes furry, sprouting little mussel-like beards of plastic.PLASTIC.That’s the other thing. This unnecessary, unhygienic, wan-coloured prophylactic, like so much other tat designed to keep us at one remove from the reality of our homes (toilet-seat lid covers, plug-in air fresheners) is landfill-in-waiting.“But it saves water!” cry its approbators. What arrant balls. If the logic here is that it holds less water than a sink, then first, it isn’t much of a saving and, second, less water can be used in the sink. Using less water saves water. Using a receptacle within a receptacle doesn’t.If you put a large plastic bath-shaped tub in your bath before bathing, people would rightly think you’d lost your mind. Let your sink be proudly naked.

I’d gone from running a busy home, juggling work, family and the everyday chaos that comes with it, to suddenly being ripped out of normality and forced to slow down in ways I never expected. When I finally returned home, I felt fragile – physically and emotionally. Getting dressed felt like climbing a mountain some days, never mind feeling remotely like myself.So I decided to try something small but surprisingly powerful: I started sharing my “fits of the day” on TikTok, which basically means I started sharing my outfits. My most-liked video is asimple one of mein an unremarkable cord skirt, oversized collar blouse and knee-high boots.It began as a simple promise to myself. Posting a video meant I had to get up, get dressed and show up in some form. It was a combination of accountability, motivation and a way to reconnect with the world again. I honestly didn’t expect it to become anything more. However,TikTokhas a funny way of surprising you.Each video starts the same way, with my tiny bio: “Hi, I’m Jen: fat, flat, over 50 and with a feeding tube.” TikTok is bursting with outfits of the day (OOTDs) fit checks, and women absolutely smashing it with their personal style. There are some brilliant over-50 creators too (FearlessAt50,Fran Bacon,Sally WhiteandRhianare all fantastic). But there aren’t many who look like me: fat, over 50, flat-chested – thanks to a double mastectomy 18 years ago – and navigating extra health challenges.I call myself fat because that’s what I am – it’s a descriptor, not an insult. Taking ownership of the word removes its sting, and it’s my way of taking up space unapologetically. For years after my double mastectomy, I hid my flatness behind baggy tops, convinced I had to disguise the shape of my chest or lack of it. Over time, though, I realised I didn’t want to hide. Somewhere along the way, I fell in love with the humble sweater vest (or tank top, if you’re my age!). They make me feel pulled together even on low-energy days.And here’s the lovely thing – TikTok loves them too. Sweater vest appreciation is strong. Every time I post one, people ask where it’s from and whether I can share more. There’s something deeply affirming about finding others who love the same things you do. Apparently, “granny chic” is exactly where it’s at on TikTok. Who knew? I certainly didn’t. My comments section is full of people who love what I love: bold colours, textures, feminist prints and clothes with proper personality.For too long, society has made older women, especially fat older women, feel invisible. The fashion industry rarely shows bodies like mine, and social media can make it feel like you’re only “allowed” to enjoy fashion if you fit a certain mould. But that needs to change.Womenover 50 account for 27% of all consumer spending, and we’re now the wealthiest and most active generation ever. Time to start seeing that reflected in fashion and online spaces.I’ve always believed in seeing clothes onrealwomen, with real bodies, living real lives. That’s the inspiration I crave. And funnily enough, younger creators have become a huge source of it for me (Madison Eley, I’m looking at you – you inspired thatyellow skirt and top). Their joyful, experimental outfits with zero fear have encouraged me to see my wardrobe differently. I’ve rediscovered pieces I forgot I owned, such as treasured knitwear, tried combinations I’d never have thought of, such as asummer dresswith a long-sleeved vest underneath and a cardigan worn fastened as a jumper, and stopped saving “nice” things for imaginary special occasions. There’s something wonderfully freeing about wearing whatever feels good that day, whether that’s a floral skirt, a cosy knit or one of my beloved sweater vests.As the videos gained views, I started gaining followers too – but more importantly, a genuinely supportive community of nearly 4,500 formed around my fits. They cheer me on, offer styling ideas and leap into the comments the moment someone starts being rude or dismissive. For every troll, there are 20 wonderful people ready to drown them out with kindness. It’s restored a bit of my faith in the internet, to be honest.And in turn, if my little videos encourage even one woman to get dressed, feel good, or treat herself with a bit more gentleness, then that’s a win in my book.Jen Walshaw is founder ofmuminthemadhouse.comExplore more on these topicsOlder peopleOpinionTikTokFeminismWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)commentShareReuse this content"

The young midfielder, soon to shoot to prominence under Martin O’Neill, was finding it impossible to snatch the ball from a rotund, wizened coach during a possession drill. Petrov’s teammates were cackling with laughter. John Robertson’s brilliance was understated enough inScotland. Word of his talent in the game was never likely to reach Petrov as he grew up in Bulgaria.Petrov is part of a recent generation who owe a debt of gratitude to Robertson the coach. More of them later. When news ofRobertson’s deathfiltered through on Christmas Day, the prevailing sense was that his country had lost one of a kind. He was also an individual who, for reasons associated with his own modesty, really never received the kudos he deserved in the land of his birth.John Robertson, Nottingham Forest and Scotland legend, dies aged 72Read moreRobertson was two-footed (albeit much more devastating with his left), capable of a bamboozling switch of pace over five yards and a wondrous crosser. He was Brian Clough’s favourite, for goodness sake; a footballer key to two crucial European Cup final goals. It is a pity that only now may Robertson be properly cherished in Scotland. Robertson was very different in style to Denis Law and Kenny Dalglish. It should not be sacrilege to suggest he was their footballing peer.There has never been any worry in Nottingham about Robertson’s contribution being unheralded. Robertson was adored there, almost from the moment Clough instigated a positional switch – central midfield to the left flank – and ordered this 22-year-old to at least moderate a lifestyle which revolved around fags and a frying pan. Robertson was an outside left rather than a winger, a player who made the improbable look so blissfully easy. Clough gave him scope to do as he pleased. In Forest’s halcyon days, Robertson was among the best in Europe.Clough’s depiction of Robertson in his autobiography was unsparing, as a “scruffy, unfit, uninterested waste of time”. Indeed, Robertson had been on the transfer list (where he was barely attracting attention) until Clough sprinkled magic dust. The Scot could, however, assert the benefit was mutual. Robertson at his peak was so heavily influential in Clough’s triumphs.Robertson’s depiction of his finest goal does not involve the 20th minute in the Santiago Bernabéu on 28 May 1980. The solitary goal as Forest successfully defended the European Cup against Hamburg was nudged into second place by events against England at Wembley the following year. Davie Provan plays through Stevie Archibald, who is knocked over by Bryan Robson. “I screamed: ‘Penalty!’” Robertson recalled. “Then I thought: ‘Oh God, I’m taking it.’” Club loyalties counted for nothing as Trevor Francis – whom Robertson had set up when Forest won the European Cup in 1979 – ran 30 yards to issue words of advice to Joe Corrigan in the England goal. Robertson duly sent Corrigan the wrong way.View image in fullscreenJohn Robertson revels in Scotland’s win at Wembley in 1981, when he scored the winning goal.Photograph: PAScotland have won at Wembley once since. Robertson’s 28 caps feel like scant reward for his brilliance, even from a time when international fixtures were less common and Scotland had an abundance of options. He featured in two World Cups (openly admitting he did not enjoy the 1978 version), with the fact his national service spanned only five years – 1978 to 1983 – explaining the low tally.O’Neill and Robertson were to become great friends. There was a strand of jealousy, though, when O’Neill bit back at a Clough half-time tirade. O’Neill questioned why Robertson was always spared criticism despite occasional selfishness or wastefulness. “Because, young man, that lad is a bloody genius,” Clough retorted. And Robertson was, while insisting he was only the second-best player to emerge from the Viewpark estate in Uddingston near Glasgow. It is for others to determine whether Jimmy Johnstone or Robertson was the superior export. That is one hell of a debate.Quick GuideForest to honour John RobertsonShowNottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis plans to rename one of the stands at the City Ground in John Robertson's honour.Robertson – who died on Christmas Day, aged 72 – became a Forest idol with standout moments in the finals of their 1979 and 1980 European Cup triumphs, providing the assist for the winner in the former and scoring the only goal in the latter.Marinakis paid tribute to the former Scotland winger and has proposed rechristening the Bridgford Stand to reflect his achievements at Forest, where Robertson also won the First Division title, the Uefa Super Cup and two League Cups.Marinakis wrote on X: \"This week is one of profound sadness for everyone connected with Nottingham Forest as we come together to mourn the passing of John Robertson, a true legend of this great club in every sense of the word.\"Today, I have recommended to the board that the Bridgford Stand be renamed 'The John Robertson Stand' in his honour and in lasting recognition of his extraordinary contribution to our club, so that his legacy, and our great hero, will forever be remembered.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Clough’s faith in Robertson was absolute. For a manager prone to such whim, that has always been intriguing. O’Neill displayed similar trust; the duo formed a great bond at Wycombe, Norwich, Leicester, Celtic and Aston Villa. Robertson’s strength as a coach was in earning the trust of players who loved his style. No airs or graces, no bullshit, but a deep understanding of the game and its actors. O’Neill trusted Robertson’s judgment implicitly. That Celtic squad especially was one with strong characters. One of them, Chris Sutton, has described Robertson as a “mentor”. Sutton, Petrov and others quickly came to learn exactly who Robertson was when the man himself would never have told them. With O’Neill such an adept frontman, it suited Robertson perfectly to linger in the shadows.There was background tragedy of which Robertson rarely spoke. His brother and sister-in-law were killed in a 1979 car crash in a vehicle Robertson had gifted to them. Robertson scored a diving header against Cologne days later. He reckoned his own father died of a broken heart within a year. Robertson’s daughter, Jessica, died at 13 in 1996 having been born with cerebral palsy.View image in fullscreenMartin O’Neill (left) on the touchline with John Robertson during their time at Celtic.Photograph: Ross Kinnaird/Getty ImagesRobertson’s switch to Derby famously caused an irreparable row between Clough and Peter Taylor. Clough was in the wrong by leaving his player with at least the sense he was not wanted any more amid recovery from a knee injury. Taylor used an element of inside knowledge to offer a three-year deal. Clough’s outrage would have been better aimed closer to home. Robertson regretted going to Derby – a move made against the advice of his wife – with his thoughts in that period understandably dominated by Jessica’s health. It was no wonder his playing career fizzled out.It is poetic that O’Neill returned to manage Celtic, successfully, on an interim basis so recently. The club has changed beyond all recognition since his first tenure. The makeup of his coaching staff had to, as well. Still, it is to be hoped that Robertson was well enough to enjoy his close friend, at 73, rolling back the years with victories and in sparkling fashion against Feyenoord.The Scottish champions described the O’Neill and Robertson alliance as overseeing “one of the most successful periods in Celtic’s history”. Those five years marked the only spell from 1970 until 2025 when Robertson did not live in the Nottingham area. An adopted home for an adopted hero.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestScotlandcommentShareReuse this content"

Today we look at how the struggle to adapt to a dangerously warming world has become a test of global justiceFri 26 Dec 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 14.04 ESTShareThe record-breaking 252mph winds of Hurricane Melissa that devastated Caribbean islands at the end of October were madefive times morelikely by the climate crisis.Scorching wildfire weatherin Spain and Portugal during the summer was made 40 times more likely, while June’sheatwave in Englandwas made 100 times more likely.Attribution sciencehas made one thing clear: global heating is behind today’s extreme weather. That greenhouse gas emissions warmed the planet was understood. What can now be shown is that this warming produces record heatwaves and more violent storms with increasing frequency.What we can do to minimise, or at least reduce, the risks to life from such events – as well as more gradual changes – is what climate adaptation experts think about all the time. The alarming consensus is that we are not doing anywhere near enough. The result is paid for in lives: floods and cyclonic storms acrossThailand, Sri Lanka and Indonesialeft hundreds dead at the end of November.The president of Cop30 in Brazil, André Corrêa do Lago, called for the UN climate change conference to be a “Cop of adaptation”. But the governments of the most vulnerable countries went home from Belém angry about an outcome that saw theprojected size of the annual adaptation budget triple to $120bn, but with the deadline pushed back to 2035 andno clear mechanismto make rich countries pay up.Even that total falls short of the$300bn in climate financeoverall that was agreed at Cop29 in 2024. The risk is that without international support, heavily indebted countries such as Jamaica become trapped, with resources that ought to be directed towards green energy and future-proofing being spent instead on coping with disasters.But the need for preparation is not limited to low-lying countries and those most affected by extreme heat and violent storms. This imbalance in climate programmes can be seen all over the world. Last month, a group of UK scientists organised what they called a “national emergency briefing” in London in an effort to alert people to the scale of the climate crisis threat – and alarming underpreparedness.Everyday injusticeIn the global context, thepolitics of adaptation are clear. Poorer countries, including the small island states whose existence is threatened by sea-level rises, have consistently argued that the rich nations whose historical and current emissions are responsible for climate heating must support them to adapt to the crisis, as well as to transition away from fossil fuels. Rightwing, nationalist governments in the west are extremely hostile to this idea – and toaid spendingmore broadly – even if their most vociferous objections are reserved for the phaseout of fossil fuels and net zero.But within wealthy countries, adaptation can appear more as a technocratic challenge than a political one. Policies regarding flood risks or increased resilience to high temperatures are not usually top priorities for voters – except when there is a disaster such as the floods in eastern Spain that led to theresignation of Carlos Mazón, president of Valencia, in November. While the grossly mismanaged water industry is a live political issue in England and Wales, big questions about natural resources and the resilience of infrastructure sit outside the daily cut and thrust, with responsibility delegated to arm’s-length agencies and rarely touched on by party leaders.Arecent reportfrom the UK’s Glacier Trust and Climate Majority Project argued that charities and politicians should seek to change this, and promote an “action-oriented public understanding of climate risk”. All must recognise that adaptation cannot simply be left to market forces because the economics of climate risk make private finance retreat just as danger rises.The long, low-profit investments needed to defend communities from flood, fire and heat are not attractive to private lenders. It is the state that must build seawalls or insure subsistence farmers when the risk becomes too great. Leah Aronowsky, a historian of science at Columbia University, says that climate risk is everyday injustice made worse – and she isrightto argue that how we adapt is a political battle.What adaptation should look likeOne reason that adaptation receives so little attention is the sheer urgency of cutting emissions. In the context of warnings that the 1.5C target in the Paris agreementcould move out of reach, mitigation – reducing or removing emissions – is the top priority.Discussing preparations for global heating can feel like a distraction or even an admission of defeat. But while it makes sense for climate campaigners to maintain the strongest possible pressure for emissions cuts, there ought to be scope to get ready for a hotter, more unstable climate as well. Under the terms of the UK’s Climate Change Act, the government is legally obliged to do so, and to regularly review its preparations.The UK’s Climate Change Committee will soon outline what a truly “well-adapted” country should look like: flood defences that can withstand the storms to come, transport links built for a harsher climate, food and supply chains resilient to global shocks, and coastal communities protected rather than abandoned. Experts also want to ensure that the 1.5m homes that the government has pledged to build in England alone are fit for the future. In an era of polarised attacks on net zero, such projects could help rebuild a shared belief in responsible care for the land.For the rich world, adaptation is prudent. For the poor world, it is survival. The latest UNreportis unequivocal: developing countries will need more than $310bn annually by 2035, yet received just $26bn in 2023. Catastrophicfloods in Asiaand worsening droughts inAfricathis year point to the growing need to accelerate climate adaptation.Under the Paris agreement,nationally determined contributions(NDCs) – country plans to tackle global heating – are meant to cover both emissions reduction and adaptation to climate impacts.But NDCs end up focusing mostly on cutting greenhouse gases and establishing decarbonisation pathways. That needs to change.National adaptation plans, which came out of Cop16, need to be foregrounded. These putadaptationcentre stage – and demand real plans, real finance, real justice. They ask the question that really matters now: how do vulnerable nations survive a warming world that emissions cuts alone can’t stop?Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The law protecting wildlife is outdated and, as recommended by theLaw Society, is ripe for review. Why, for example, have comprehensive protection for four of our native mustelids and almost nothing for the remaining two? Further, the recentAnimal Welfare (Sentience) Actrequires the government to consider sentience when framing policy. Against this background, one would have thought a review of outdated wildlife legislation would be a priority.Instead, the edges are tinkered with yet again. The government’s strategy includes a proposal for a close season for hares. It is claimed that fewer young hares will be left vulnerable to starvation and predation. All well and good, unless you happen to be a stoat, a weasel, a carrion crow or a mole – native species which enjoy almost no protection, meaning that thousands of their offspring will continue to die when their parents are killed during the breeding season.Alick SimmonsUK deputy chief veterinary officer, 2007-15The animal welfare strategy sets out a promising plan for raising the welfare of millions of animals that suffer unnecessarily (Hen cages and pig farrowing crates to be outlawed in England, 22 December). However, to achieve its ambitious vision of ensuring that as many animals as possible have a good life, the strategy must go further to tackle factory farming.Every year, millions of animals are confined on UK factory farms in abysmal conditions. The strategy has taken crucial steps towards protecting farmed animals from the most cruel aspects of factory farming. Hens will no longer be caged for their eggs and mother pigs will no longer be confined in small crates where they are unable to turn around. However, there are few indications that the strategy will seek to halt the expansion of the factory-farming systems driving such cruelty and threatening our climate, environment and health.The strategy’s announcement comes ahead of the government’s national food strategy and farming vision in 2026. I urge the government to prioritise a shift away from factory farming and support a just transition to nature-friendly farming that benefits animals, farmers and the planet.Ruth TannerUK country director, World Animal ProtectionTheproposed banon electric collars for dogs and cats would result in many more deaths and injuries for cats, if implemented. Electric collars for cats are not for training; they are for containment, and prevent cats straying on to roads and getting run over. We lost many cats to painful, unnecessary deaths on roads, until we installed a containment system.The collars issue a warning bleep if the cat gets close to the perimeter wire, and only give a small electric pulse if the cat moves closer; they soon learn not to get too close.We have not had a cat run over in the 20 years we have had such a system, and have never experienced our cats upset or traumatised by the collars. Another benefit is that containment limits the cats’ exposure to wildlife. Banning these containment systems would be a cruel removal of cats’ safety.David SuttonSalisbury, WiltshireIt’s welcome news that Labour is bringing in legislation to protect animal welfare (Boiling lobsters alive to be banned in UK animal cruelty crackdown, 22 December). If humans stop being cruel to animals, then possibly humans will also stop being cruel to other humans. You can but dream.Ann NewellThame, OxfordshireI’ve always felt sorry for lobsters, especially as it’s easy to dispatch them instantly.

This is intensifying as we encounter a world awash with data and distraction. Professional communications teams may now package storytelling as strategy, but the craft of storytelling is far older, and far deeper, than any job description. It is a human art, not a corporate invention.For over 30 years, theSociety for Storytellinghas championed oral storytelling in all its forms. Through our extensive online directory, audiences can find storytellers working wherever there are people – across schools, theatres, workplaces and care settings.In oral storytelling, teller and listener co-create meaning in the moment. We are transported to other worlds, other lives, other ways of seeing. No wonder businesses are beginning to recognise its power.Research and practice consistently show that storytelling supports cognitive function, memory and emotional resilience. Listening to and telling stories helps us feel seen and understood – a fundamental human need. Oral storytelling builds empathy, and strengthens listening and imagination.For children, stories are foundational. Oral storytelling underpins literacy, enriches vocabulary and invites playful thinking long before written text. But storytelling does not lose its power with age. For adults, oral narrative strengthens social bonds, helping us to make sense of life’s twists and turns while supporting our emotional health and wellbeing. Stories are not just jobs; they are the heartbeat of human life. Let’s keep telling them.Danyah MillerTrustee, Society for StorytellingHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Anything that helps young people develop a reading habit is welcome. But framing the solution as thrillers versus so-called “masterpieces” risks missing the deeper issue. There needs to be more systemic change in how schools think about boys’ reading rather than simply swapping one set of books for another.In my experience as an English teacher, despite having access to more books than ever before, schools often see books with glorified violence at the centre as “boy books”, and so fill the curriculum with this content. This does nothing to combat toxic masculinity – rather, it fosters it.We shouldn’t patronise boys by telling them what society thinks they should become, but instead give them a bit more credit in their reading interests. I’ve had plenty of young men tearing up in my classroom when reading Jane Eyre. Encouraging kids to read this kind of book won’t solve the entire problem, but it will certainly help in making more well-rounded young men.Louis ProvisHead of English, MyEdSpaceHow I agree with Lee Child. In the late 1970s I was teaching English to a very unmotivated year 10 group in a rural comprehensive school in Lincolnshire. To encourage them to read, we bought a set ofDick Francisnovels and had a weekly shared reading lesson.We had to feign disappointment when, nearly at the end of the novel, a group of them broke into the stock cupboard and stole copies so that they could find out what happened next.

Across all UK retail destinations footfall slipped by 0.3%.Following on from adecline in Boxing Day activityin 2024, there were 2.4% fewer visitors on Britain’s high streets than on 26 December last year, while there was a 2.6% slide in the number of people going to shopping centres.However, retail parks bucked the trend and experienced a 6.9% increase in the number of visitors on Boxing Day morning. Retail parks, which are mostly in out-of-town locations, accessible by car and often offering free parking, have become more popular with shoppers in recent years thanks to their convenience.View image in fullscreenBoxing Day shoppers in Liverpool.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAThe rise in shoppers deciding to visit retail parks could be seen as an “encouraging start to Boxing Day”, said Jenni Matthews, the marketing and insights director at MRI.“This suggests that shoppers may well be coming out earlier than expected to grab those bargains; brush off the festive cobwebs,” she added.Colder temperatures may have put off some would-be shoppers from travelling far from home. Central London recorded a 7.7% fall in the number of visitors compared with a year earlier, a much larger decline than the 3.4% fall recorded in other cities.By contrast, there was a near 4% increase in visitor numbers in outer London, and there was a 10% rise in footfall in coastal towns, as consumers hoped to combine a visit to the shops with a day out.The traditional Boxing Day start to the post-Christmas sales has increasingly shifted online in recent years, giving consumers the opportunity to secure some deals from the comfort of the sofa as early asChristmasDay itself. Large fashion and homeware retailers including Marks & Spencer and Next are now offering discounts of up to 50% online, while reductions will only be available in stores from Saturday.Despite this, groups of shoppers travelled toManchester’s Trafford Centre indoor mall, where some outlets opened their doors as early as 7.30am.Queues gathered outside the Selfridges department store before opening, which was offering reductions of up to 50%, as was the cosmetics retailer Lush.In the run-up to the big day, retailers had beenhoping for a late rush to buy presents, given that Christmas Day fell on a Thursday this year, anticipating that shoppers would hunt out last-minute items at the start of the week.However, there were signs that some consumers held back on purchases. Mild weather during the autumn and the start of winter for much of the country resulted in fewer people adding jumpers, coats or boots to their baskets, according to Clive Black, the head of consumer research at Shore Capital.Many large fashion retailers – including Next and John Lewis – launched their reductions before Christmas, while others including New Look and Sports Direct were advertising discounts of up to 70%.Retailers have faced a tough year of trading in 2025, with many consumers reining in their spending at a time when energy and grocery bills remain high. Uncertainty in the run-up to Rachel Reeve’s budget in late November over possible tax riseshit consumer confidenceat the start of the crucial pre-Christmas trading period.However, the average shopper is expected to spend £17 more on the end-of-year sales compared with last year, according to figures from the lender Barclays, taking the average budget to £253, up from £236 in 2024. However, it predicts that fewer consumers will take part amid cost of living pressures.Consumers around the UK were expected to spend £3.6bn in the Boxing Day sales, as more sales shoppers use AI and other tools to help them locate the best deals.

He had been detained in jail two years beyond his five-year sentence as the Cairo authorities refused to recognise the period he held in pre-trial detention as part of his time served.A previous attempt by Abd el-Fattah to leave Cairo for London in November after his release from jail, was blocked by the security forces a month ago. He has since been trying to negotiate an agreement whereby he is allowed to travel freely between Cairo and London and not be permanently excluded from Egypt if he came to the UK.His arrival in London was announced by his mother, Laila Soueif, on Facebook.His sister Mona Seif said: “I can’t believe it’s finally happened and Alaa has made it to London. We thought it was impossible, but here he is. Hundreds of people around the world did so much to help bring this moment about. Alaa is free and we can finally begin to heal as a family.”The family believe the agreement will allow him to travel back and forth between the UK and Egypt.View image in fullscreenAlaa Abd el-Fattah pictured in September in Cairo after he was given a presidential pardon.Photograph: Khaled Elfiqi/APJames Lynch of FairSquare, a human rights organisation that has worked alongside Abd el-Fattah’s family for several years, said: “I’m delighted that Alaa has safely returned to the UK to be reunited with his son after such a lengthy ordeal lasting well over a decade. After everything Alaa and his family have been through, I’m hopeful this marks the beginning of a new chapter for them.”His mother twice came close to death when she was admitted to hospital during an extendedeight-month hunger strikedesigned to put pressure on the UK Foreign Office to do more to secure his release.The British prime minister, Keir Starmer,made three calls to his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, also personally urged the Egyptians to end his detention. But the Egyptians never allowed British consular visits to jail, saying they did not recognise his dual citizenship status.Changes in the Egyptian embassy in London may have helped produce a less inflexible stance.Abd el-Fattah, from a family of human rights activists, became a leading voice during the Arab spring. He has a direct, perceptive, non-sectarian writing style that has won him awards.He has a teenage son, Khaled, who lives in Brighton and attends a special educational needs school. The boy visited him in Cairo soon after his release, in what was regarded as a successful reunion.Abd el-Fattah’s sister, Sanaa, explained at the time he had been blocked from flying out of Cairo: “We’re really glad to have [Alaa] back in our lives partially free, but he needs to have freedom of movement to live with his son, reunited with him properly.”“Khaled needs his father. My nephew … is very, very comfortable in his school and his setup in Brighton. We can’t change. We can’t keep creating instability.”He had already served a five-year jail sentence passed in September 2019 on charges of “spreading false news” after a much-criticised trial, yet last year his family were told he would not be released until January 2027.Starmer made no criticism of the justice of Abd el-Fattah’s sentencing. “I’m delighted that Alaa is back in the UK and has been reunited with his loved ones, who must be feeling profound relief,” the prime minister wrote on social media. “I want to pay tribute to Alaa’s family, and to all those that have worked and campaigned for this moment.“Alaa’s case has been a top priority for my government since we came to office. I’m grateful to President Sisi for his decision to grant the pardon.”Explore more on these topicsEgyptAbdel Fatah al-SisiAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaHuman rightsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

One group behind the hoisting of flags, named Operation Raise the Colours, accepted a donation from Britain First, a far-right party with an openly anti-Islam, anti-immigration agenda.The British Museumhosted a successful inaugural fundraising ballin October with a “pink theme”, a nod to the colours and light in India, that was attended by 8,000 people, with tickets costing £2,000 a go.Those who attended in October included Naomi Campbell, Alexa Chung, Miuccia Prada, Manolo Blahnik, Sir Steve McQueen, Sir Grayson Perry and Dame Kristin Scott Thomas.View image in fullscreenNaomi Campbell was among attendees at the British Museum’s pink-themed ball.Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APCullinan, who was born in Connecticut to British parents but brought up in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, has said he hoped that the annual celebration will become a “flagship national event”.Described as a “brilliant fundraiser”, Cullinan has nevertheless already faced opposition from inside and outside the institution.The first ball was co-chaired by Isha Ambani, an Indian “businesswoman, philanthropist and arts patron”. She is the daughter of Asia’s richest man,Mukesh Ambani, who owns a petrochemicals conglomerate, Reliance Industries.The campaign groupCulture Unstainedhas criticised the association of the Ambani family, “whose wealth comes in large part from the fossil fuel and petrochemical projects of Reliance Industries”.Prof Nick Groom, author of The Union Jack: The Story of the British Flag, said theBritish Museumshould be encouraged to go ahead with its plans despite the concerns raised.He said: “If the British Museum is reconsidering plans for a red, white and blue themed ball next year to celebrate the international concord between the UK and France in exhibiting theBayeux tapestryin London, then it is not just abdicating its responsibilities as a national institution to safeguard our history, but will effectively be complicit in the politicisation of the union jack – which would open the door to over 400 years of that history being rewritten by the far right.“And in any case, communities will still need symbols of unity – so what will the union jack be replaced by?“We are all accountable here, charged with maintaining and recognising the complexities and indeed contradictions of national symbols.“The only way is to resist simplistic politics that seek to impose one crude meaning on the flag and engage with its diverse history – a history that we can both celebrate and, where appropriate, censure.”Groom added: “George Orwell got it right when he castigated the ‘Bloomsbury highbrow’ for divorcing intelligence from patriotism and treating the expression of national identity as brutish: ‘If you were an intellectual you sniggered at the union jack and regarded physical courage as barbarous.’“That was in 1941, at the height of the Blitz bombing raids on British and Irish cities that killed over 43,500 civilians (about the population of Salisbury) when Britain faced the very real possibility of a Nazi invasion.”A British Museum spokesperson said: “The inaugural ball was a landmark moment in the museum’s history that secured over £2.5m vital funding for its international partnerships.“We are excited to follow up this year’s success with a ball in autumn 2026 and will announce more details in due course.”Explore more on these topicsCultureBritish MuseumBayeux tapestryFar rightLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Qesser Zuhrah, 20, and Amu Gib, 30, who are being held at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey, were on hunger strike from 2 November to 23 December. Heba Muraisi, 31, who is at HMP New Hall, joined the pair on 3 November. The group also includes Teuta Hoxha, 29, Kamran Ahmed, 28, and Lewie Chiaramello, 22, who is refusing food every other day because he has diabetes.Zuhrah and Gib temporarily resumed eating on Tuesday evening, according to a statement released by the Prisoners for Palestine group, owing to deteriorating health, but vowed to resume the protest action next year.On Friday a group of UN experts including Gina Romero, the UN special rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, and Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, issued a statement expressing alarm at the group’s treatment.“Hunger strike is often a measure of last resort by people who believe that their rights to protest and effective remedy have been exhausted. The state’s duty of care toward hunger strikers is heightened, not diminished,” the experts said.On Sunday, three of the prisoners – Zuhrah, Gib and Ahmed – were simultaneously in hospital. Ahmed has been admitted to hospital three times since going on hunger strike. The experts added: “Authorities must ensure timely access to emergency and hospital care when clinically indicated, refrain from actions that may amount to pressure or retaliation, and respect medical ethics.”Last week, Prisoners for Palestine, a prisoner-led collective in Britain, said the Prison Service was reported to have denied an ambulance entry into Bronzefield on Tuesday afternoon for Zuhrah, even though she was unable to stand and was writhing in pain on her cell floor. She was taken to hospital after protesters gathered outside the jail where she was being held to demand she receive urgent medical attention.“These reports raise serious questions about compliance with international human rights law and standards, including obligations to protect life and prevent cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,” the experts said. “Preventable deaths in custody are never acceptable. The state bears full responsibility for the lives and wellbeing of those it detains,” they added. “Urgent action is required now.”On Monday, families and supporters of the hunger strikers pleaded with David Lammy, the justice secretary, to meet them as lawyers for the group sent a legal letter claiming that, by refusing a meeting, the justice secretary had failed to comply with the Ministry of Justice’s own policy on handling of hunger strikes.There is understood to be concern in government about the condition of the prisoners, but also extreme caution about setting a precedent even to facilitate a meeting with Lammy, given the number of prisoners who are forced to spend lengthy periods on remand because of the court backlog.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s not the world I choose to live inPaul EvansFri 26 Dec 2025 00.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 01.06 ESTShareThe sparrows are a shuffling, chirruping shadow in the bushes, a static of anticipation. They are waiting for food, calling for it. They have not forgotten what the poet Emily Dickinson describes, in her poemVictory Comes Late, as “God keeps his oath to sparrows, / Who of little love / Know how to starve!” However, sparrows do seem to live in a much more vivid and emotional society than as mere victims of an indifferent nature that is economical at the expense of compassion.To say they come to the feeding station sounds a bit grand for a small bird table, a few hanging fat balls and a scattering of seed and mealworms in a back yard in Oswestry. The first adventurers edge in, not just to explore the food source but to play in a space of subtle changes that have happened in their place. When the wholehost, quarrel or ubiquitymove in, there must be over 30 birds. The energy of their performance is contagious.Moving through a home range of gardens, this clan know each other intimately. Feeding together, they have hair-trigger reactions. The slightest disturbance sends them all thrumming for cover at the speed of thought that looks telepathic – more fun than panic. Sparrow culture involves complex behaviours with other birds in this community of place: blue tits, robins, jackdaws, collared doves, blackbirds, wood pigeons and wrens.To the streets outside, where at the winter solstice there is aprocession of music and songin honour of the wren. What began as a reimagined ritual inspired by the folklore aroundhunting the Cutty Wrenhas changed into providing a sanctuary for the wren within the community. Such a ritual performance is not to live in the past tense, but to live as the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam suggested in the imperative of the future passive participle: “whatoughtto be”.A ritual for the protection of wrens, like the ritual feeding of sparrows – incomprehensibly on the red list of British birds of conservation concern – seeks to perform what ought to be, not what was or might be. I hope you get this on Boxing Day, which, whatever it’s about, traditionally involvespageants of violence towards wildlifeclaiming to imitate nature’s economy over compassion.

The season of consumption – from overindulging to buying far too many presents – can leave you, your wallet and your conscience feeling rather bloated. Most of us accept that the run-up to Christmas is what it is – a joyful time of excess – and atone for our extravagance by reining in our spending and eating from Boxing Day onwards.But what if there was another way? A way to consume more consciously, not just at Christmas, but throughout the year?Well, we just might have the answer – after this week’s climate headlines.Essential reads‘Unashamedly capitalist’ rewilders claim ‘Moneyball’ approach could make millions – but experts scepticalCrayfish, weevils and fungi released in UK to tackle invasive species such as Japanese knotweed‘The anxiety never disappears’: Monmouth businesses recover from severe floodingIn focusView image in fullscreenHere on the Filter, the Guardian’s product reviews and consumer journalism section, we are tackling that very conundrum: how to consume more mindfully. What does this apparent contradiction – sustainable consumerism – actually look like to us?Take Christmas: we’ve published a lot of gift guides, from gifts formums,cyclistsandteenagerstoanalogue presentsthat get scrolling loved ones off their screens, and gifts from ethical brands and retailersthat support charitiesand communities. All feature products that have been tried and tested, sniffed, sampled, played with or worn by our writers.In the case of our many kids’ gift guides, the children themselves told us what they wanted for Christmas; elsewhere, our readers told us about the gifts they’ve given or received that have lasted decades. Less like shopping inspo and more like personal recommendations from a friend, these gifts are far less likely to be snubbed, break by New Year’s Eve, or end up in the re-gifting drawer.And it’s not just gifts. We’ve tested and rated often overpriced and overpackaged Advent calendars to see if they’re worth the money, and how wasteful they are; and we’ve unboxed and erected artificial Christmas treesto test their quality. The Carbon Trust says using a fake tree over seven to 20 years (depending on its weight and materials) can create fewer emissions than buying a new, commercially grown tree every year. The key is to buy an artificial tree you’ll love enough to roll out for decades – which is where our test comes in.We’ve also eaten and drunk our way through mince pies, cheeseboard chutneys, festive drinks, Christmas crisps, sandwiches and much more, so you don’t waste money on food that might otherwise end up in the food waste bin. And we’ve offered ideas onhow to reduce wastethis Christmas, from investing in reusable crackers to making the most of your leftovers.From rigorous tests on products such as mattresses, coffee machines, tents, kettles and reusable coffee cups, to advice on how to make things last longer – from leather to kitchen knives – we aim to help readers make better, more informed decisions. And to encourage more thoughtful purchases so that our readers will, ultimately, consume less.Now Christmas is nearly over, we’re looking ahead to 2026, a year which will probably bring yet more extreme weather, alarming climate disasters and record heat. We’ll put more products through their paces and help you find the most sustainable, repairable and even refurbished choices. We’ll dig deep into secondhand shopping, help you make more of your things last longer, and advise you on what you shouldn’t buy.See you next year.Read more:‘I’ve used it every day for 48 years’: 42 forever gifts that last – and won’t end up in landfill305 best Christmas gifts for 2025: truly brilliant presents tried, tested and handpicked by usThe Christmas gifts you love the most, from cosy hand warmers to personalised chocolateTo read the complete version of this newsletter –subscribe to receive Down to Earthin your inbox every ThursdayExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentDown to Earth newsletterRecyclingnewslettersShareReuse this content"

There will be a river walk in each region of the country by the end of parliament, the government has pledged.No footpath would be created as part of the “new” river walk, government sources confirmed, but the initiative will enable nature recovery work, accessibility upgrades and community engagement work along the route.In opposition, Labourcommitted toa Scottish-style right to roam, where there would be an assumed right for people in England to walk around the countryside. However, theparty made a U-turnafter pressure from countryside groups.The party replaced this access to nature policy with a pledge to create three national forests and nine river walks.It is difficult to create river walks as the riverbank is owned by many different landowners, with different attitudes to allowing people to walk, boat or swim on their land.This walk, named the Mersey Valley Way, is being created to complement regeneration work in the area. New signs to mark it as a national river walk will be erected and stretches of the existing river path will be upgraded to meet accessibility standards for wheelchairs, mobility scooters, prams, cyclists and horse-riders.The next tranche of national river walks will be identified through competition bids in 2026.Lady Hayman, the access minister, said: “Nature is a huge source of pride and enjoyment for people across the country, but too many people struggle to find ways to access the outdoors. We are changing that today, delivering on our manifesto pledge by launching the first of nine new national river walks, boosting opportunities to be in nature and supporting local businesses that line the routes.“The Mersey Valley Way offers 21km of new paths for people in Manchester andStockportto explore, be outdoors, and enjoy the nature on their doorstep.”The government said it had chosen the area as it had a large concentration of low-income households. Research has found that people on lower incomes, on average, are spending significantly less time in nature. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said there were 30,000 low-income households in Stockport alone, and they hoped this would improve their access to nature.Explore more on these topicsAccess to green spaceRiversWalkingGreen politicsEnglandGreater ManchesterStockportnewsShareReuse this content"

The practice, which involves hounds following a scent rather than a live animal, was introduced to comply with a ban on pursuing foxes introduced in the Hunting Act 2004.The ban is likely to cause further friction between the government and rural communities after the recent row overchanges to inheritance tax breaks for farms, which led to a partial U-turn by the government on Tuesday. A consultation on how to implement the ban will be launched in early 2026.Critics of trail hunting say it has been used as a smokescreen to enable illegal foxhunting. Hunt saboteurs who monitored hunts over the Christmas period provided what they claim is evidence of illegal activity.Ministers raise inheritance tax threshold for farms after backlashRead moreTim Bonner, the Countryside Alliance’s chief executive, said: “When Keir Starmer said he wanted a new relationship with the countryside, we all assumed he meant a better one, but in 18 months his government has alienated rural people and created the clear impression that it does not care about the countryside. Its warped priorities have put taxing family farms, raising rates for rural businesses and banning trail hunting above policies that would benefit rural people.“While the partial changes to the family farm tax are a step in the right direction, the government must desperately learn the fundamental lesson of this policy debacle, which is that it needs to work with the rural community – not legislate against it.”A poll by the analysis firm ORB International suggested only 36% of people in Britain agreed or strongly agreed that the government cared about people who live in the countryside, while 76% said they believed the government prioritised urban issues over rural ones. ORB surveyed 2,083 British adults online between 12 and 14 December.Johnny Heald, the chief executive of ORB’s UK operation, is a director of the Countryside Alliance’s corporate vehicle, Working for the Countryside. A spokesperson for the pressure group said it operated separately to ORB.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “This government is committed to banning trail hunting, which is too often used as a cover for illegal foxhunting, and has strong public support across the country.”Referring to its response to a review of the agricultural sector carried out by the former National Farmers’ Union president Minette Batters, it added: “This builds on previous animal welfare reforms delivered by this government, including giving police greater powers to prevent dog attacks on livestock, protecting farmers and animals alike.“The Batters review highlighted the need for greater collaboration between industry, farmers and government – and that is exactly what we will do. We have increased the individual inheritance tax threshold from £1m to £2.5m, meaning couples with estates of up to £5m will pay no inheritance tax.”Those seeking to exploit the planned trail hunting ban as a “culture war” issue include the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, who attended a hunt in Kent. He told GB News that the government was made up of people with “an ignorance” of rural communities.Emma Slawinski, the chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: “Banning trail hunting isn’t an attack on the countryside, it’s an attack on those who would use weaknesses in the law to get around it, and who have done for the last two decades.”Commenting on the ORB poll, she said: “The same polling shows banning trail hunting narrowly missed being in last place on the list of issues the respondents say would influence their vote at the next election, which suggests the narrative from the Countryside Alliance is completely out of touch with rural values.”Explore more on these topicsHuntingRural affairsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Longstanding Ambridge favourites and newer voices from the drama will make an appearance.The Archers is one of the BBC’s most popular programmes and is the top on-demand show for listeners of all ages on BBC Sounds, including among listeners under 35.Barnes said: “I am not just an Archers superfan, I am obsessed with all things Ambridge. So to be asked to host The Archers: Live at 75 is like winning a prize at the Flower and Produce show and being cast as the lead in a Lynda Snell production, all rolled into one. I can’t wait to hang out with all of my favourite characters and really immerse myself in Borsetshire life.”Alison Hindell, the drama and fiction commissioner at BBCRadio4, said: “The Archers is one of the BBC’s most-loved programmes and we are tremendously proud of it as it reaches the astonishing broadcasting milestone of its 75th year. We hope that The Archers live show will give fans even more of what they love, joining in the celebrations with an extra slice of Ambridge life.”James Albrecht and Serena Brett, the directors of Fane Productions, said: “Marking 75 years of The Archers is a rare privilege, and we’re thrilled to work with the BBC to create a live experience that honours the programme’s extraordinary legacy.“Taking one of the BBC’s most precious and established brands, which has lived almost entirely in listeners’ imaginations, and working so closely with Angela, the editorial team, and the cast to make it leap out of the studio and on to the stage is a wonderfully fun creative challenge. We can’t wait to share this special experience with the audiences who’ve loved The Archers for generations.”This is not the first time The Archers has left the medium of radio. In 2019, the Birmingham studios where The Archers is recorded was madeopento fans, who were given the opportunity to recreate iconic scenes from the long-running drama.They were also given a behind-the-scenes look at the show. Among the glamorous titbits they were made privy to were the collection of doorbells for each Archers’ property and the glass of small lego bricks used to recreate clinking ice cubes in the Bull.Fane Productions, the company behind the long-running radio drama, said The Archers: Live at 75 will run from June to November 2026 at 29 venues, starting in Manchester, then hopping around the country, stopping in Oxford, Stockton-on-Tees and Glasgow, among other towns and cities, before ending in Wolverhampton.Explore more on these topicsThe ArchersRadionewsShareReuse this content"

Farage’s party became the first to accept donations in crypto earlier this year.Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary,said in Julythat banning cryptocurrency donations was “definitely something that the Electoral Commission should be considering” and that it was “very important that we know who is providing the donation”.However, ministers have so far shied away from legislating to limit political donations after last year assessing a proposal by the Institute for Public Policy Research for a£100,000 cap.Like other major parties, Labour relies on private fundraising to fund its campaigns. Its biggest donors in recent years have included the former Autoglass boss Gary Lubner and the green energy entrepreneurDale Vince.The letter also called on ministers to legislate to introduce automatic voter registration, which is being piloted in Wales. The measure, which Labour officials have beenexploring since they were in opposition, would mean voters are added to the electoral roll automatically without needing to actively register.Campaigners saythe move would improve voter turnout and increase electoral participation by renters and people from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds, who are less likely to be registered to vote.Finally, the letter urged ministers to safeguard the Electoral Commission’s independence after the Conservatives legislated to allow ministers to set strategy and policy for the regulator.The signatories warned that the Tory move “creates serious risks of interference and political capture” and that “while it may seem politically expedient to maintain this power while in government, it is essential that independence be returned”.Campaign groups that signed the letter to Reed and Dixon included Generation Rent, The 99% Organisation, Make Votes Matter, the Black Equity Organisation and the website Byline Times.A Transparency International report concluded that in 2023, £56.6m in donations – 66% of the total coming from private sources – came from 19 mega-donors.An MHCLG spokesperson said: “Our elections strategy sets out tough new rules on political donations including plans to increase transparency and close loopholes for foreign funding as we modernise UK democracy and ensure its protection for generations to come.”Explore more on these topicsParty fundingElectoral reformElectoral CommissionLabournewsShareReuse this content"

A third-degree tear extends into the muscle that controls the anus and a fourth-degree tear extends further into the lining of the anus.According to Guardian analysis ofNHSfigures obtained via a freedom of information request, Asian women suffered third- and fourth-degree tears at a rate of 2,831 tears per 100,000 deliveries during 2023-24. This compares with rates of 1,473 per 100,000 for white women and 1,496 per 100,000 for black women.Risk to women of severe bleeding after giving birth at five-year high in EnglandRead moreSuch injuries can result in life-changing physical and mental harm, including bowel incontinence, post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain.Geeta Nayar, a senior associate at Irwin Mitchell and advocate for the MASIC Foundation, which supports women who have suffered severe injuries during childbirth, and the Birth Trauma Association, said the reasons Asian women were at a greater risk of severe tearing during childbirth were“multifactorial – from anatomical and physiological differences to structural systemic issues”.Lia Brigante, a professional policy adviser at the Royal College of Midwives, said that although women of Asian ethnicity had been shown in several western-based studies to face a higher risk of perineal trauma, “this knowledge isn’t consistently reaching frontline staff, as many women tell us their midwife or doctor seemed unaware they were at higher risk”.Brigante said: “The reasons for this disparity are complex and remain unexplained. Difference in care, rates of instrumental births, nutrition and inequalities in how women’s needs are recognised during labour may all contribute. However, there is not enough evidence to fully understand why this gap exists.”She added: “Every woman deserves personalised care and honest conversations about possible risks and options available. Asian women must be supported with evidence-based practices and feel heard and respected throughout labour and birth.”Nayar, who is south Asian and experienced a third-degree tear when giving birth to her daughter that left her with permanent injuries, added that the focus needed to be on what could be positively changed to improve outcomes. She said: “Adequate information about individual risks, including the increased risk of OASI, needs to be given to women antenatally in a culturally and linguistically acceptable manner.”The analysis comes as previous research found thenumber of mothers sustaining a third- or fourth-degree perineal tear while delivering their babyhad risen from 25 in 1,000 in June 2020 to 29 in 1,000 in June this year – a 16% increase.Chloe Oliver, the chief executive of MASIC, said: “At MASIC we see the impact of OASI birth injuries every day, and the lifelong emotional and physical consequences they carry.”She added: “One of the major risk factors for sustaining an OASI is being of south Asian heritage, but like several other risk factors – such as a forceps delivery, carrying a large baby, older maternal age or short maternal height – so few women are aware of their risk because it’s not routinely discussed in antenatal appointments.“Urgent improvements in antenatal counselling are needed to inform women of their risks and to allow them to make an informed choice with their healthcare professional on the best and safest delivery for both mum and baby.”An NHS spokesperson said: “Every woman deserves safe, high-quality, compassionate and equitable maternity care. We remain firmly committed to tackling the disparities that affect Asian women and other communities, ensuring that every mother receives the highest standard of support throughout pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period.”Explore more on these topicsChildbirthWomen's healthPregnancyHealthRaceNHSEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Israel says that helps to locate militant infrastructure and prevent future attacks. Rights watchdogs say such actions are collective punishment.The Israeli military said it was “preparing for an operation” in the area.The Israeli ambulance service confirmed a man and woman were pronounced dead at the scene after medics were unable to resuscitate them. A teenager was also hurt in the attack, they said.An Israeli reservist soldier was meanwhile reportedly under house arrest on Friday after he rammed his vehicle into a Palestinian man who was praying on a roadside in the occupied West Bank on Thursday.The reservist acted “in severe violation of his authority” and his weapon had been confiscated and his service terminated, the Israeli military said. The man who was rammed was checked in hospital, but was unhurt and was now at home.More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank between 7 October 2023 and 17 October 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some during settler violence, according to the UN. During the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks.Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaWest BankPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

Officials in Saudi Arabia have not so far commented.Two weeks ago, the STC – a longstanding voice calling forYemento return to the pre-1990 settlement of a Yemen divided into north and south – entered the two large, oil-rich provinces in the south not yet under its control.The capture of the huge governorates of Hadramaut and al-Mahra, the province bordering Oman, occurred without much sign of resistance, as the Hadramaut forces retreated in the face of well-armed STC troops.Since then, the Saudi-backed and UN-recognised elements in Yemen’s divided southern government have been trying to mount a political and diplomatic counteroffensive against “STC unilateralism”, arguing that there is no support across the south for the STC’s call for separation from the north.European countries and Gulf states such as Kuwait and Qatar, as well as the Arab League secretary general, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, have called for Yemen to remain a unified country – backing the Saudi position – but the US has said little so far.Europe has voiced concerns that fractures within the south would divert energy away from the struggle to oustthe Houthis, who have run the north of Yemen since 2015, including the former capital, Sana’a.The STC said the UN-recognised government had done little to take the battle to theHouthis, and that a separated, cohesive south would be a more effective bulwark against the Iranian-backed Houthis, and would be better equipped to protect the ports along Yemen’s southern coast.There were demonstrations on Thursday in the south-western port city of Aden calling for the STC president, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, to declare independence, a step he is considering.On Thursday, the Saudi ministry of foreign affairs issued a conciliatory but firm statement calling for the STC to withdraw and to reopen negotiations with the remnants of the UN-recognised government. Riyadh said unilateral acts harmed the integrity of Yemen, and it insisted it “had prioritised preserving unity and making every effort to reach peaceful solutions to resolve the situation in both governorates”.It added: “The kingdom remains hopeful that the public interest will prevail through ending the escalation by the Southern Transitional Council and the withdrawal of its forces from the two governorates in an urgent and orderly manner. The kingdom stresses the importance of cooperation among all Yemeni factions and components to exercise restraint and avoid any measures that could destabilise security and stability, which may result in undesirable consequences.”In response, the UAE put out a brief statement commending Saudi Arabia’s role “in serving the interests of the Yemeni people and fulfilling their legitimate aspirations for stability and prosperity”.It did not endorse the call for the STC to withdraw, but private discussions over the political preconditions necessary for a withdrawal have been held.Most observers do not believe the STC could survive without UAE military and political endorsement. If the UAE does not, publicly or privately, withdraw its reassurances to back the STC, then the UAE and Saudi Arabia face a major confrontation.Explore more on these topicsYemenMiddle East and north AfricaHouthisSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the largest weapons sale in the history of the bilateral relationship.China’s stance onTaiwan, which is that it must merge with the People’s Republic of China – something that the democratically governed Taipei rejects – has been a pinch point in its relations with the US, already worn thin over trade and tariff issues.Individuals on the Chinese sanctions list, including the founder of the defence firm Anduril Industries and nine senior executives from the sanctioned firms, are banned from entering China, the ministry added.Boeing produces fighter jets in St Louis, where more than 3,000 union workerswent on strikeover pay this year. Other companies targeted by the sanctions include Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation and L3Harris Maritime Services.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement on Friday: “The Taiwan issue is the core of China’s core interests and the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations. Any provocative actions that cross the line on the Taiwan issue will be met with a strong response from China.” They urged the US to cease “dangerous” efforts to arm the island.The US is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, although such arms sales are a persistent source of friction with China.The eight arms agreements that comprised the total sale included 420 army tactical missile systems, or Atacms. The systems are similar to those sent to Ukraine under the Biden administration for its defence against Russia.The state department said at the time of the Taiwan arms sale that it served “US national, economic and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernise its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability”.“The proposed sale[s] will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region,” various similar statements issued on each of the agreements said.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsChinaTaiwanArms tradeBoeingTrump administrationUS foreign policyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The class action cases use an opt-out system that means millions of people can be represented at once in claims of breaches of competition law.“It’s definitely a tipping point,” said Dr Rachael Kent, an academic at King’s College London who won the £1.5bn case against Apple on behalf of 36 million UK consumers. “People are pushing back against the harms from digital worlds, which they have to be living in and through every day and the financial implications of that,” she said.View image in fullscreenApple said most apps are subject to a 15% commission, and the App Store helps drive the UK’s digital economy.Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/ShutterstockKent added that the win in October still felt “a bit pinch me”. If Apple’s appeal fails, every person in the UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to a payout.In the suite of class action cases, Apple and Google are accused of overcharging British consumers and developers in their app stores and, in the case of Apple, of “trapping” and overcharging customers with its iCloud data storage service.Instead of up to 30%, Apple should be charging commission of 17.5% when selling apps and 10% on in-app purchases, while app developers should pay 10%, the competition appeal tribunal found in Kent’s case.Another of the cases is being brought by Barry Rodger, a law professor at the University of Strathclyde, on behalf of more than 2,000 app developers who he argues are collectively entitled to up to £1bn in compensation.“Small and medium-sized app developer businesses have suffered as the result of excessive profiteering by the App Store and Google Play,” he said. His case alleges Google Play has charged “excessive, arbitrary and discriminatory commissions” against developers, with the makers of dating and games apps particularly affected.His suit is expected to reach trial at the competitions appeal tribunal in October 2026, and will be jointly managed with a claim for about £1bn on behalf of 19 million Google Play customers, who are alleged to have been overcharged. That case is being brought by the consumer activist Liz Coll and accuses Google of “excluding competition and/or charging an unlawfully high level of commission on digital purchases”, breaching competition law.Coll said: “These types of large collective proceedings are new in the UK, but I’m really excited about the potential of the Kent decision to not only make people aware they were paying too much for apps through opaque commission but also that there is now a clear route to getting that put right. Where we need consumers to get really active now is in claiming back the money they’re owed.”A Google spokesperson said: “Android provides more choice than any other platform and our fees are the lowest of any major app platform. We’ll defend these cases vigorously.”View image in fullscreenA class action has also been brought on behalf of Google Play customers.Photograph: Issei Kato/ReutersGoogle argues that the class action cases seek to upend a system that has lowered prices and increased choice and that, if successful, would make downloading and using apps on Android phones more complicated and less safe.And in the largest of all the claims, November saw the consumer campaign group Which? announce a £3bn claim against Apple over its iCloud services, claiming it is “trapping” customers with Apple devices into using it.Apple called the Which? claims unfounded and said no customers are required to use iCloud. The company said it strongly disagrees with the ruling in Kent’s case over the App Store, and the tribunal took a flawed view of the “thriving and competitive app economy”, with other platforms providing “vigorous competition”. It said most apps are subject to a 15% commission, and the App Store helps drive the UK’s digital economy, facilitating billings and sales of over $55bn (£41bn) in the UK in 2024.Kent said that people are “waking up to the harms of digital life and how it can be detrimental mentally, physically and financially”.“There is a tidal shift that is happening against big tech,” she said. “Consumers are looking at all of the tools that they have to use every day. Covid really accelerated our reliance on technology and many of us went from using five apps in a week to perhaps 10 apps in a day to manage food shopping, food delivery, retail, fitness and diet tracking, keeping in close communication with friends and family, much more social media, increased screen time.“A big part of the last six years working the case has been about educating people that this is actually happening. That’s what tech giants and marketeers like Apple are so brilliant at. It’s creating an ecosystem where we are foreclosed into decision making and we don’t even realise that this is actually how it’s happening.”Explore more on these topicsAppsAppleGoogleiPhoneAlphabetComputingMobile phonesnewsShareReuse this content"

Odeon’s new Luxe Suites seats.Photograph: OdeonIts rival Odeon first launched its premium offering, under the Luxe brand, in 2017 and it now has 38 venues which the company says have become the “defining standard” for customers across its entire estate.Odeon has moved to super-charge its premium strategy with the introduction of Luxe Suite Pods, which it describes as a “private cocoon” with luxury seats that is proving a hit for date night and with families.It is also introducing VIP Beds, now in nine locations, which promise to “transform the front row into the best seat in the house”.“This is next level,” says Suzie Welch, managing director for UK & Ireland at Odeon. “Over the last 18 months we have been looking at what we want to do next with Luxe, what we think our guests want next from their cinema experience. Innovations like the Luxe Suites and VIP Beds are about creating a different experience; families love them and they are great for an evening experience, like a date night. The focus is on how we can give people choice and experiences for all occasions.”The cost of seating in cinemas varies widely depending on factors including the time and day of the week, the type of film, sound and picture technology, and the location.Vue’s Ultra Lux recliner seats range from £10 to about £26. Odeon’s range of Luxe seating runs from £7.50 to £35 for a VIP bed for three, and £28 for a Luxe Pod for two.The path to premium has been pioneered by Everyman, founded in 2000, where viewers can lounge on sofas and have food and beverages ordered to their seats.Its model is proving to be a runaway success post-pandemic, with Everyman’s latest results showing a 46% year-on-year increase in sign-ups to its membership programme in the first half, and revenues growing by a fifth.The chain has also seen admission numbers rise, despite an increase in ticket prices, with movie-goers spending more on food and drink.“Everyman have led the way on premium for more than 20 years – comfy seats, food – other chains are catching on to that,” says Andrew Renton, director of research at Cavendish. “Smaller cinemas, a cosier feel and higher spend.”But the move to premium by mass-market chains – which include operators such as Vue introducing next-generation laser projectors to rival the experience offered by Imax – coincides with a significant shift in cinema-going habits.Cinema attendance has been well down since the pandemic, from 176m annual UK admissions in 2019 to 126m in 2024, as many film fans fell out of love with the big screen.View image in fullscreenVue recliners.Photograph: Sheradon Dublin/VueWhile the push to premium may make film-going a more attractive prospect, cinema audiences are not expected to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels, even if the number of film releases return to pre-2020 levels.The cost of living crisis has meant household bills have soared, making cash-strapped consumers much more selective about what they spend their extra income on.“It is probably the case that movie fans will continue to go less than they did,” says Renton. “However, they are willing to spend more on the occasion, as we have seen in other sectors, such as big ticket gigs like Coldplay and Oasis.”The cinema industry is also continuing to come to grips with the small screen revolution, prompted by the rise of Netflix, with consumers now awash with choice when it comes to in-home entertainment.Netflix’s co-founder, Reed Hastings, once succinctly summed up the intense battle for attention in the digital age when he said the company considered almost every activity to be a rival –half-joking that sleep was its biggest competitor.Cinema companies are also trying to offer more than the traditional experience as they face extra competition from the rise of theexperiential economy.The £98bn market for immersive experiences is booming, from The Greatest Showman-inspiredCome Alive, the long-establishedAbba Voyage, and Crystal Maze, to more recent pop-ups linked to Minecraft, Jurassic World and Squid Game.View image in fullscreenAny popcorn? Vue’s Ultra Lux experience includes a barPhotograph: Tim Atkins Photography Ltd/Vue“It comes down to what is the purpose of cinema becoming, because it is not just about the old model where it was about going to see a film as soon as it is released,” says Renton. “Now it is much more about experiential leisure. They realise that to continue to capture that going-out experience they have to make a bigger difference. They are doing that through premiumisation.”While there have been flashes of pre-pandemic levels of commercial success, including most recently the Wicked films, the industry still lacks the blockbusters to realise its ambitions for a premium-led-experience recovery.Vue’s CEO, Richards, acknowledges that “2025 is still a period where we have seen 20% fewer movies released compared to the average of the three-year pre-pandemic period of 2017, 2018 and 2019”.However, he points to the increasing commitment to the big screen shown by the Silicon Valley giants as evidence of a healthy future.Apple’s release of F1,Brad Pitt’s highest-grossing film, has given the iPhone maker confidence in its big-screen strategy.And after Amazon’s$8.5bn acquisition of MGM– the Hollywood studio behind the James Bond and Rocky franchises, as well as an extensive library ranging from Gone with the Wind to The Hobbit – the studio is scaling up and matching the output of traditional film studios with plans for 10 big releases in 2026 and a further 16 in 2027.“It takes 18- to 24 months-plus for a major production to go from being green lit to the big screen,” says Richards. “We are just really now starting to see the Hollywood machine rev up and get going again.”View image in fullscreenVue aims to use next-generation laser projectors that rival the experience offered by Imax.Photograph: VueFor now, the cinema industry is looking at a promising year ahead.Big releases include Super Mario, more editions of Spider-Man, Avengers, Dune and Moana, a fifth Toy Story release and a third in the Jumanji franchise.The insights company Omdia estimates that the volume of releases of films of all budgets in the UK next year will hit 850, the most since 2019.“In totality, next year and in 2027 we will see the same number of releases, or an even greater number, than before the pandemic,” says Richards. “When the history books are written, this is the end of the post-pandemic period and new era of film.”Explore more on these topicsTravel & leisureFilm industryUK cost of living crisisLuxury goods sectornewsShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson for the department said: “These figures do not present the full picture. SAF volumes are continuously rising and not all suppliers have reported on the fuel they’ve supplied.”Planes burning SAF still emit equal amounts of CO2in flight, but the net carbon footprint is calculated as far lower because of how SAF is produced, compared with normal jet fuel. Although many scientists and environmental groups remain deeplysceptical that it can be delivered, production and uptake of SAF is seen as the only way for commercial, and particularly long-haul, aviation to reduce its emissions.While the government has backed aviation as a driver of economic growth and granted permission for airports includingGatwickandLutonto rapidly expand, ministers have promised to consult the Climate Change Committee over plans to builda third runway at Heathrow.The aviation minister, Keir Mather, told an industry conference in London earlier this month that Heathrow expansion would still have to meet Labour’s four tests, including reducing its climate impact, but that decarbonisation would be “a licence for growth”.He said that SAF represented the biggest opportunity, and the government’s SAF bill, which is passing through the House of Lords, “will deliver the revenue-certainty mechanism that you called for – a guaranteed price for SAF that reduces risks for investors and raises confidence for producers”.Heathrow airport has pushed the uptake of SAF with an incentive scheme that cuts landing charges for airlines using cleaner fuel. It expects to meet its own target of 3% SAF use over the course of 2025.However, airlines have fewer available supplies outside larger hub airports, and have questioned whether future mandates can be met – especially when costlier second-generation and power-to-liquid SAF, yet to be produced at scale, are mandated.The UK has progressed further than most in global aviation. The international airlines body Iata recently warned that growth in production worldwide was stalling, with SAF supplying only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, and forecast to increase to 0.8% in 2026.Iata’s director general, Willie Walsh, criticised the mandates, adding: “If the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work.”Duncan McCourt, chief executive of the air industry body Sustainable Aviation, said: “These provisional figures show the UK is using significant quantities of SAF and we remain confident that the mandate will be met and UK aviation will use increasing quantities of SAF in the years to come.”Explore more on these topicsAirline industryTransportTransport policyAirline emissionsGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

She talks Lego therapy, freaking out her Better Call Saul co-star and her frustration with the Guardian crosswordStuart HeritageFri 26 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShareRhea Seehorn has had a hell of a year. For years she had garnered a reputation as a great underappreciated talent, but that has all changed now thanks to Pluribus. A series about one of the only people on Earth not to have their minds taken over by an alien virus, Pluribus is not only critically adored, but recently became Apple TV’s most-watched show. And Seehorn is front and centre through it all. However, today she has bigger things on her mind.“You gotta tell me how to crack the code,” she pleads before we’ve even said hello. “I’m an avid crossword puzzler, but I cannot beat the Guardian crossword. I cannot crack it, and I need to figure out what the problem is.”If you’ve seen Pluribus, in which she plays a grouch forced to save the world against her will, the delightfulness of Seehorn in person might come as a surprise. She is bright-eyed and alert, sitting forward in her seat and fully engaged.“I love making the show,” she says. “It has been the most challenging thing I’ve ever done, and the most rewarding. People are coming up to me and they want to talk about what the show is bringing up in them, and the thoughts it’s making them have. That’s been absolutely beyond satisfying.”But perhaps not surprising. Pluribus is the sort of show that deliberately takes its time unfolding the grand mystery at its core. Seehorn plays Carol Sturka, who finds herself unaffected by the alien virus that has affected the rest of the global population. While they all operate as a mass hive mind – existing peacefully, if creepily, in a state of unquestioning happiness – she finds herself tasked with restoring individuality to the world. To complicate matters further, everyone seems especially attuned to her behaviour … perhaps because millions of people die whenever she loses her temper.View image in fullscreenRhea Seehorn in Pluribus.Photograph: Anna Kooris/AppleWhile creator Vince Gilligan has claimed that it’s partially autobiographical (it’s hard to see it as anything other than a reaction to his post-Breaking Bad celebrity, and all the sycophancy that goes with it) it’s also strangely universal. It’s the kind of high-concept show that has inspired a fervent obsession online of a level not seen since Lost. This obsession is something Seehorn respectfully prefers not to investigate.“I’m too much of a scaredy-cat to look online,” she reveals. “My friends tell me, even on social media, to never scroll down. I know eventually there’s going to be a comment that’s just like, ‘She is an ugly idiot who should never be on screen again,’ and then I’m just going to want to go do Lego sets for a week.”A bizarrely large chunk of the discourse online revolves around whether Carol should just give up and enjoy the simple pleasures of having her mind controlled. Seehorn doesn’t see the appeal.“When I think about happiness and joy, it always comes down to surprise,” she says. “Being surprised by others’ accomplishments. But in that world, there are no new books. There is no new art. There’s never going to be a belly laugh, because no one can surprise you. I’ll never get to do a crossword puzzle again, because I already know all the answers, because I made the crossword.”The story of how Seehorn got the Pluribus role has been told before, but it speaks volumes. Gilligan initially envisioned the lead as a man, but after seeing her in action onBetter Call Saul, where she played Kim Wexler, he swapped the character’s sex purely to carry on working with her. Seehorn has been working since the 1990s, but this is her first series lead. Those who know her understand the pressure this must put on her.View image in fullscreenSeehorn with Bob Odenkirk in Better Call Saul.Photograph: Robert Trachtenberg/AP“I watch Pluribus and my heart hurts for how long Rhea must have spent in physically and emotionally challenging states,” saysBob Odenkirk, her Better Call Saul co-star. “When we did Saul, we lived together with Patrick Fabian, and we all helped each other through the show. I wonder how she is doing with decompressing.”Seehorn laughs when I mention this. “It’s so funny that he posed that question, because he called to check on me after he saw a couple of episodes,” she says. “He probably just wanted me to make fun of myself, because Bob has seen how my little squirrelly brain decompresses. There are art projects all over the house. There’s a Lego set, a jigsaw puzzle, embroidery, painting, hundreds of almost-finished crossword puzzles.”Does she miss living with co-stars? “People thought it was weird,” she replies. “Bob started it. He called Patrick and I after season one and was like, ‘Do you guys think we should just live together?’ And I was like, actually, yes. All of our partners and spouses know each other and are friends, and none of us are skeezy. And it can be mentally taxing to come home by yourself.”For Pluribus, which shoots in Albuquerque, she continued the tradition by moving in with Trish Almeida, the head of the show’s hair department, during production. “This one took longer to shoot, and it was challenging. A lot of explosions of anger, or suppression of anger in the moments when Carol is not allowed to show those feelings. A lot of time by myself, too. Sometimes even just seeing somebody for a cup of coffee can make your week.”The 50 best TV shows of 2025Read moreThe season one finale airs on Boxing Day and, without wanting to spoil anything, it ends on such a tantalising cliffhanger that the next batch of episodes cannot come fast enough. While they are definitely coming – Apple knows a good thing when it sees one – Seehorn can’t give a concrete date.“They’re in the writers’ room right now,” she says of Gilligan and his team. “But I don’t have a timeline of when they’ll complete that process.”At this point I make a small strangulated yelp of frustration, to which Seehorn responds with a sense of calming reason. “I don’t think anybody is sitting around going, ‘Let’s just make them wait,’” she says with a smile. “I know my writers. They take such great care. Plus, the scope of this show is huge. Think about the episodes where everybody disappears. We’re in a working city. There were cars driving by all the time. They all have to be erased.”But does she know what’s coming next for Carol? “I know the same as I did on Better Call Saul – one script at a time,” she says. “I never have any idea where it’s going. I haven’t a clue what happens next season. A couple of big things happen in the finale. And I gotta tell you, I haven’t a clue in the world where they’re going.”Explore more on these topicsTelevision2025 in TVBetter Call SaulfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He and stars Will Arnett, Laura Dern and Andra Day talk gags, growth and relationship goalsFri 26 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 06.17 ESTShareLast Christmas, the audience at an open-mic night in New York welcomed to the stage a new standup. Alex Novak, he said his name was. Mildly funny, bit depressed. Mostly told jokes about getting divorced. Weirdest thing though: he lookedexactlylikethat guy from Arrested Development.“I was so naively unaware of what to expect,” saysWill Arnett, almost a year later. “I’ve been comedy-adjacent for a lot of my life, but not a comedian. I had no idea what I was in for.”That was a crash course in confessional standup. Five nights a week, for six weeks, Arnett would write and perform material across the city, going up cold, ignoring any hecklers who might insist he was actually the star of one of the US’s best-loved sitcoms, as well asBoJack Horseman, Blades of Glory, The Lego Movie etc.All this to prepare for his first dramatic movie lead as a man who walks into a bar, finds he can dodge the entrance fee if he agrees to five minutes on stage in the basement comedy club – and finds himself in the process.View image in fullscreen‘The only laughter I could hear was at the back of the room, and it was Bradley’ … Will Arnett in Is This Thing On?Photograph: Jason McDonald/Searchlight Pictures“Every time a comic goes on stage, they are jumping off a cliff,” says Arnett. “It’s unnerving and very scary.” Sometimes it paid off. One night he went to a club, “andkilledit. They loved it. Really vibed with me. And then I went around the corner to a different club, did the same jokes, and completely bombed.”Some actors are smaller than you expect. Arnett is more substantial: tall and brawny. Still, he withers at the memory. “There’s nowhere to hide. You feel your soul leaving your body. I’d gone up with such confidence, but there was just this profound silence. The only laughter I could hear was at the back of the room, and it was Bradley.”Every time a comic goes on stage, they are jumping off a cliff. It’s unnerving and very scary.Will ArnettBradley isBradley Cooper. This is his third film as writer-director; he also co-stars as Alex’s best friend, a vain actor called Balls. Also rubbernecking from the crowd that night was Andra Day, who plays Balls’ waspish wife Christine.“It was so cool to watch Will’s body absorb how the audience was not responding,” she says with glee. “Every little gesture. How uncomfortable his head was.” Day is a singer-songwriter; years of gigs mean she knows how it feels when patter dies. “But I have the luxury of saying: ‘All right! Let’s play the next track! Move on!’”Arnett, however, struggled to turn a doomed ship around. “You try to recalibrate by amping up the delivery,” he says, but then people seem yet more repelled. “Comedy is much more of a conversation than I realised. You have to listen to them respond before you build toward the punchline. To let them be invested. You want them to lean in.”View image in fullscreen‘My generation had fairytales’ … Laura Dern with Will Arnett, and Calvin Knegten.Photograph: Jason McDonald/Searchlight PicturesCooper’s films are, it’s fair to say, interested in this transaction. In how performing both feeds and leeches; how being adored or torn apart by strangers affects your personal life. A Star Is Born, Maestro and Is This Thing On? all feature scenes in which someone falls in love (or back in love) with the protagonist as they perform live. “What seems to recur,” says Cooper – or, in fact, emails, of which more later – “is the idea that artistic expression requires a vulnerability that reveals something deeply human. In each of the films, the moment of falling in love happens when that truth becomes visible.”In this case, that happens when Alex’s ex, Tess (Laura Dern), goes on a date with another man and they wind up at a club where Alex happens to be performing. Unseen at the back, unaware the man she was married to for decades had ever even considered comedy, she watches agog, by turns appalled, amused – and turned on. “Tess glimpses the person she once loved coming back into focus,” says Cooper.In a London hotel room down the hall from Arnett, Dern leans forward keenly. “This theme of committing to being unhappy with someone touches meso much,” she says. “It’s the same experience many of us have had in a relationship: how did we get here? How have we lost ourselves and each other? The film taught me a lot as a woman about the goal of a relationship – that it has to be that whole journey all the time. Because,” she continues, “we are ever-evolving organisms!” She smiles: engaged, evangelical even, all empathy and connection.View image in fullscreen‘Once you drop the act, you never wanna go back in’ … Andra Day with Bradley Cooper (left) and Will Arnett.Photograph: Jason McDonald/Searchlight PicturesAlex and Tess reconcile as each finds the freedom to explore their own passions (him: comedy, her: basketball). Growth is essential, the film suggests. So is realism. Being unhappy with someone isn’t great, but being unhappy alongside them might be the best we can hope for.Dern thinks her generation (she’s 58) is often too entrenched to compromise, let alone reinvent. Her children – Ellery, 25, and Jaya, 21– are wiser. “They have been raised with so much noise around performative social media living,” she says. “‘Let’s show everybody how this moment feels! Let’s see how many followers care about it!’ So they’re now like: can we just put it away and actually just be connected and honest and a mess?”How have we lost ourselves and each other? The film taught me a lot as a woman about the goal of a relationship.Laura DernShe shudders. “Showing people what you’re eating or wearing feels like middle-school all the time. Being judged for the length of my skirt or what I said to the boy. Oh my God, it’s exhausting!”In the room next door, Day (40) says she has no time for artifice. “People’s arrogance is often just really deep-seated insecurity,” she says. “We’re only getting half-versions of everyone as they’re trying to hide.” Once you drop the act, she says, “you never wanna go back in, to disappear into the performative part of life ever again.”View image in fullscreen‘Tess glimpses the person she once loved coming back into focus’ …  Cooper on Laura Dern’s character (pictured with Will Arnett).Photograph: Jason McDonald/Searchlight PicturesThe original idea for the film was Arnett’s. It came after a chance meeting with the Liverpudlian comedianJohn Bishop, who did indeed first try standup to avoid paying a cover charge, took to it, started using it as quasi-counselling, then reconnected with the mother of his children after she accidentally saw him perform. The main difference between fact and fiction is the quality of the jokes. Bishop became successful; Alex probably won’t. “Yeah,” says Arnett, “if Alex wants to keep doing this, he’s got to get funny.”When we spoke, Stephen Colbert’s late-night satirical talkshowhad just been axedand Jimmy Kimmel’s futurelooked shaky. US TV comedy seemed especially imperilled. Yet, Arnett – a staple of the scene for 25 years – was circumspect. “It is and it isn’t under threat. It’s always been like that. The court jester looked over his shoulder to make sure he pleased the king. So I don’t know if I am particularly troubled. There are plenty of people out there pushing the boundaries and finding a way to do it. It probably forces you to be a little more clever.”View image in fullscreenJohn Bishop in 2010.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianWhat drew him to the story was not the comedy, he says, but the drama – a chance to flex other muscles and draw on some unfunny personal history. “It demanded I look at my own experiences. And you don’t have to know much about me to know there are strains and commonalities.” Arnett is referring to his own split from Amy Poehler, with whom he has two sons, in 2012. At the time, it was major gossip in the US; the personal lives of both parties remain, like that of Cooper, tabloid catnip.UnlikeA Star is BornandMaestro, Is This Thing On? is not about people who are enormously famous. And yet, like Noah Baumbach’s (considerably inferior)movie-star-in-crisis film Jay Kelly– which also features Dern – its concerns betray the fact it was made by people whoareenormously famous.So there is quite a lot about how uncomfortable it feels to see massive photos of yourself you don’t feel are representative of your whole being. Alex enlarges to poster size a photo he loves of Tess spectacularly sinking a hoop decades earlier. She’s not flattered. “It’s because that’s nother,” says Dern. “It’s an idea of her. And that is the story of many of our lives: a moment captured in time that someone is still judging us on. I’ve had it from the other side, too, with projection.”View image in fullscreenWill Arnett in a 2003 promotional shot for Arrested Development.Photograph: Rex/c.20thC.Fox/EverettBeing troubled by such stuff is, concedes Arnett, a first-world problem. “But it is odd to see yourself out there in the world in that way. It’s really weird.”Cooper doesn’t respond on this one. Maybe he doesn’t need to. Given how energetically he hit the press trail for his previous films, plus the themes of this one, it feels significant that he’s opting to back-seat it this time round. Is This Thing On? is a loose and relaxed movie that is also surprisingly sharp on how much of yourself you should supply to strangers in the service of art. Cooper’s email answers are highly considered and curated, script tightly controlled – even now.At one point, Alex’s preteen sons happen upon a rough draft of his father’s latest routine. They’re distressed. “None of that stuff is real,” he says, comforting them. “It’s all made up. None of it’s real life, really.” But that’s not true: Alex is, by and large, impeccably honest. So when does sharing something become betrayal?“I don’t think I could define that boundary for anyone else,” says Cooper. “‘Betrayal’ is a heavy term, and these moments tend to be highly circumstantial. I recall reading not long ago about a comedian whose material left the subject of the joke feeling genuinely betrayed. And if someone feels betrayed by what was shared, then in some sense there is a betrayal. Their emotional reality is valid.View image in fullscreenBradley Cooper as Leonard Bernstein in Maestro.Photograph: Jason McDonald/Netflix“For myself, I’m very deliberate about sharing anything from my private life in a public setting, because other people are inevitably part of those stories, and they haven’t necessarily chosen to be included. It’s something I try to approach with care. That may sound a bit old-fashioned in a culture where everything is shared so freely, but it’s the way I orient myself.”Betrayal is a heavy term. But if someone feels betrayed by what was shared, then in some sense there is a betrayal. Their emotional reality is valid.Bradley CooperCooper has an eight-year-old daughter, Lea, who played Leonard Bernstein’s daughter in some of Maestro. Is This Thing On? is bookended by scenes set at school performances. “Bradley said he went to one when we were in preproduction,” says Dern, “and all the kids were having this amazing moment and all the parents were on their phones. And he was like: ‘There’s alion! Dancing! In front of us!’”She rolls her eyes. “We’ve allowed the noise to take over so completely. But if you wake up to self, you wake to your children. To a moment that you may define in your busy adult brain as less important than that text from your boss.”View image in fullscreenCooper and Arnett in Is This Thing On?Photograph: Jason McDonald/Searchlight Pictures“As a parent,” writes Cooper, “watching a school performance becomes a deeply subjective experience. The moment your own child is on stage, a whole world of personal history and emotion comes with you. The audience is essentially a collection of people engaged in private internal narratives – reflecting, remembering, projecting. That shared interiority gives school performances a kind of quiet, unexpected magic.”Those scenes are among the film’s finest. They capture something of the weird potency of guileless prancing. “There’s an innocence to children performing,” says Cooper, “a transparency of feeling, an almost complete indifference to success or failure; they’re simply expressing themselves. Whatever is happening within them is visible, unfiltered – which is ironic, because that’s exactly what adult performers spend their lives trying to recreate: a genuine moment in an imagined circumstance.”It must be strange to be in a profession in which you sweat all day for excellence, then go and watch your kid just casually pull it off without blinking. Is This Thing On? relies on the idea that that toil is worth it and honest adult performance is intrinsically cathartic.More committed, even, than Cooper himself. “I’ve certainly had experiences where it felt quite the opposite – more stressful than liberating,” he writes. “Still, in hindsight, even those moments tend to become cathartic. When you place yourself in a situation that’s uncomfortable and demands you push past your limits, there’s inevitably some emotional release or insight that emerges.”When children perform, whatever is happening within them is visible, unfiltered. Ironic, because that’s exactly what adult performers spend their lives trying to recreateBradley Cooper“It’s never not cathartic,” says Dern, ever the pro. “Even if it’s a difficult job or people aren’t feeling fulfilled or they’re missing the point. I have played some rough folks that I don’t necessarily want to admit are a part of me, but I have to find the part of me in them to connect. And that’s exciting.”The rough is hard to spot today. Dern is the definition of polish. She may not be a comedian, but it’s impossible to imagine that, had she been the one taking to the stage, anonymously, in a random comedy club, she wouldn’t have nailed it.Dern sells this film, as she does herothers, with such chewy commitment you could use her quotes on the poster. Is this Thing On? is a “roadmap to not missing it”, she says. Her son seems cut from the same cloth: “‘This is the best movie to see as I’m starting my journey,’” he told her after watching it. “‘It makes me wanna love by being my most vulnerable.’”View image in fullscreenCooper directing Dern and Arnett.Photograph: Jason McDonald/APShe beams with satisfaction. “My generation had fairytales: Prince Charming shows up, you must say yes. So it’s pretty incredible to have an alternative.”Showing people what you’re eating or wearing feels like middle-school all the time. Judged for the length of my skirt or what I said to the boy. Exhausting!Laura DernAnd, she adds, gesturing at the TV in the corner, an alternative to allthat. “I don’t know how I’ve become yet again addicted to checking in on the world right before I go to sleep. A horrible idea. But we have to tune out from the resentments and the fear, and say that because of them, this is the moment we have to be our most connected.”Don’t dismiss Is This Thing On?, she says. This isn’t just industry frippery or a comedy of remarriage. There’s a radical moral at its core. “It could be global, even political, to say: ‘I want to be unhappy with you. I’m fighting for this thing we call life, despite all the noisy, chaotic crap.’ We are all on the planet at the same time. And if we don’t lead with love, we are lost.”Is This Thing On?

Brace yourself for a hugely funny, all-American wild goose chase!Phil HarrisonFri 26 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 11.03 ESTShareLee Raybon (Ethan Hawke) is a “truthstorian”. How to explain that proudly self-applied title? A historian, but also an investigative journalist with an inherent distrust of mainstream narratives? A maker of trouble for trouble’s sake? Or one of those fantasists whose home contains a huge mood board (current mood? Paranoid!) covered with photos of suspects and newspaper clippings and various strands of a conspiracy connected by pieces of string? Raybon actually has one of those. “I’m a very visual thinker,” he says. His scathing former business partner Wendell (Peter Dinklage) sees it differently: “It’s like you read one Oklahoma history book and then made a junior high collage out of it.”This exchange is typical of the alacrity with which The Lowdown cheerfully undercuts itself. Sterlin Harjo’s Tulsa noir is brilliantly elusive in tone. It allows Raybon, its nominal hero, precious little dignity. Raybon is, in many ways, a ridiculous man. His marriage is in ruins. He puts his sweet, resourceful daughter Francis in danger by mixing business and parenting. He’s one of the least physically imposing renegades you’ll ever meet (“How does an adult with a gun get put in the trunk of a car?” wonders his associate Cyrus at one point). He isn’t Woodward or Bernstein, he’s Jeffrey “The Dude” Lebowski with a sympathetic editor and a political agenda.View image in fullscreenDissolute … Jeanne Tripplehorn as Betty Jo Washberg with Hawke in The Lowdown.Photograph: Shane Brown/FXThe Lowdown is frequently very funny; working as both a genre piece (in which the genre in question is fondly spoofed) and as a character study (which follows a similar trajectory of amiable mockery). And yet, as with Harjo’s previous showReservation Dogs, there’s something profoundly serious going on here too. The mystery at the drama’s heart involves the powerful Washberg family whose wayward offspring Dale has taken his own life – or anyway, that’s their story. It seems likely that he has died – at least indirectly – as a result of an article Raybon has written. So there’s a follow-up to be explored about the circumstances of Dale’s death but also potentially about the older Washberg, Donald’s predatory designs on Indigenous American land and Black-owned businesses in the area.This is Harjo’s subtext. Tulsa is a city with a dark history.The Tulsa Massacre of 1921– in which up to 300 Black citizens were murdered by white supremacists – is a barely acknowledged but omnipresent undertone. The distinct aroma of white saviour surrounds Raybon at all times. “White men that care,” mutters Cyrus. “The saddest of the bunch.” Harjo, meanwhile, is anOklahoma native in the most fundamental sense. He’s a citizen of the Indigenous American people, the Seminole nation of Oklahoma. Reservation Dogs was about a beleaguered Indigenous community and how it managed to support itself in the face of white hostility – and arguably worse still, indifference. The Lowdown isn’t even nearly a follow-up in terms of subject matter but it could be regarded as a companion piece – the same territory and power structures, viewed from a different angle. Raybon’s good intentions are weighed down by their historical context.View image in fullscreenKeith David as Marty with Hawke in The Lowdown.Photograph: Shane Brown/FXBut even if Raybon is constantly failing to outrun the past, there is still real generosity in Harjo’s characterisation. Raybon is a driven man at least partly because the most important thing is to keep trying. Harjo specialises in earnest, ardent goofballs. People who are on the side of the angels but who remain endearingly daft. People who hold firm to their principles and take themselves extremely seriously. Like the idealistic, charming teens in Reservation Dogs, Raybon will never let his own absurdity cause him to take his eyes off the prize.The fact that Raybon doesn’t really understand what that prize might be is a big part of the fun. What unfolds is an all-American wild goose chase, populated by an ensemble of memorable picaresques. The supporting performances are uniformly superb – from Keith David’s blunt gumshoe Marty to Kyle MacLachlan’s oily Donald, everyone brings something sweet or sinister, funny or peculiar to the table. Meanwhile, Raybon blunders around, stumbling uninvited into private meetings, getting beaten up (repeatedly: he becomes progressively bruised and dishevelled as the series goes on) and drunkenly falling into bed with Donald Washberg’s dissolute ex-wife Betty Jo (the brilliant Jeanne Tripplehorn).Raybon imagines he is fighting to preserve an idea of progressive America, but he’s hanging on to something in himself too. Eventually, The Lowdown is a poignant and surprisingly personal story, about purpose and ageing and noble failure; about the timeless truth that the journey is more important than the destination. “There’s no cat up in that tree he’s barking at,” suggests his antiquarian book dealer friend Raymond. But even if Raymond is right, Raybon has to keep barking all the same. What else is a Truthstorian to do?The Lowdown is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewEthan HawkeTelevisionFXreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yes, Winona Ryder has been unforgivably sidelined. And yes, some characters are trapped in a room filling with yoghurt. But despite our misgivings, this show still absolutely slapsStuart HeritageThu 25 Dec 2025 20.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 10.51 ESTShareListen, this isn’t the place for newcomers.Stranger Thingshas been around for almost a decade, and it has spent almost all this time building a mythology that has grown so unwieldy that trying to explain it would cost me my wordcount and my will to live.However, in fairness, this new penultimate batch of episodes gives it a good try. The content of these new episodes can neatly be split into three categories. There’s action, which is high-octane and fun, and probably why you’re watching. Then there’s dialogue, which is less successful because it causes characters to stop moving and emote at each other, even though they should probably be concentrating on the imminent end of the world.And then there is explanation, of which there is a ton. You will remember that Stranger Things was initially conceived as a one-off, and its success forced the Duffer Brothers to cake on endless new lore to keep the engine running. Well, things have become so convoluted that maybe 40% of the show is taken up with people reminding other people what the hell is going on. The second episode of this new batch is so incomprehensible that Maya Hawke has to stop everything so that she can very slowly explain the plot, using props, as if talking to children. It doesn’t exactly scream entertainment.And yet more lore is caked on by the second. The thrust of these episodes is that the Upside Down (the evil parallel dimension at the heart of the show) isn’t actually a parallel dimension. It is in fact a wormhole to an even worse dimension, and Vecna (who remains a winning cross between the Grinch and an unbroadcastable outtake from a colon cleanse commercial) is trying to collapse it so he can take over the world.View image in fullscreenSadie Sink as Max Mayfield and Nell Fisher as Holly Wheeler in Stranger Things: season five.Photograph: NetflixAnd our young – well, youngish, since the male cast is now 90% Adam’s apple – heroes have to stop him. Some of them are in the real world. Some are in the Upside Down. Some are in a secret memory world hidden inside the Upside Down. For some reason, two of them are trapped in a room that’s slowly filling up with yoghurt. No, really.So the fact that none of this is unbearable is miraculous. Stranger Things is one of those shows that, when it gets everything rolling in the right direction, absolutely slaps. It’s a grand, pedal-to-the-metal spectacle where everything is maxed out to the nth degree. The action sequences are beautifully choreographed. The nostalgia remains extremely effective. The emotion rarely drops below operatic. On a second-by-second basis, Stranger Things is amazing.The downfall of season five’s release strategy, though, is that it gives you time between episodes to think. We had a month to sit with the last batch, and a week until the finale, and the moment you apply any level of reason to the show, the entire thing falls apart.View image in fullscreenCaleb McLaughlin as Lucas Sinclair and Priah Ferguson as Erica Sinclair in Stranger Things: season five.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/Netflix © 2025You notice that almost every character becomes significantly more or less intelligent at any given moment, based on the demands of the plot. You start counting all the characters, and realise that more than half of them are dramatically superfluous. You realise how old and tired the children look, and that the sidelining of Winona Ryder is unforgivable.Usually at this late stage of a landmark drama series, things winnow down. Unnecessary characters and extraneous plot points are shed so that the finale can deliver with maximum power. Look at Breaking Bad, which cut everything away so that the final episode could focus on Walter White settling his last scores. Look at The Sopranos, which systematically killed off characters to prepare us for Tony’s fate in the finale. Even Mad Men dropped its ad industry sheen to concentrate on Don Draper’s personal collapse and rehabilitation.But not Stranger Things. As things stand, the finale has a mountain of admin to battle through. Vecna needs to be defeated. Children need to be rescued. The world needs to be saved. The evil scientists – who started all this, remember – need to be stopped. And then, when all that is done, it somehow needs to find believable and distinct emotional denouements for (if I’ve counted correctly) 17 characters. There is so much work to do in such a short space of time it’s unfathomable how the Duffers can wrap a satisfying bow around such a sprawling mass. Then again, stranger things have happened. Let’s talk again next week.Stranger Things is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsStranger ThingsTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fingerpicked acoustic guitar and her extraordinary vocals – husky, expressive, elegant – are front and centre. The arrangement is subtle but not drearily tasteful: arching noise that could be feedback or a distorted pedal steel guitar, which gradually swells into something climactic before dying away. The lyrics, meanwhile, concern themselves with selling out: “Maybe I’m an analyst, an antisocial bitch,” she sings. “Who sells her dreams for money.”It’s a topic that speaks to Annahstasia’s turbulent music industry history: signed at 17 to a label that tried to mould her into a mainstream pop star, she quit and pursued a more singular vision. Tether acts as vindication, announcing the arrival of a strikingly unique voice. It slips from Slow’s seductive take on soul to the raging alt-rock of Believer, but every track has its author’s unique character stamped through it. These are superbly written, remarkably moving songs, delivered by a singer who knows exactly how to use her vocals to cut the listener deep: when to exercise restraint, when to express halting uncertainty, when to let fly with impassioned vibrato. The result is an album that feels intimate and revealing: the kind you don’t so much listen to as enter into a relationship with.Alexis PetridisValentina Magaletti and YPY – Kansai BruisesView image in fullscreenArresting … Valentina Magaletti and YPY.Photograph: Yuki NakagawaThere’s a tendency to single out prolific musicians as “hard-working”, though one of the joys of following Italian drummer Valentina Magaletti through the underground is how effortlessly and innately she races through different gears. This year she released a remix album of her excellent 2024 album Estradas with Afro-Portuguese producer Nídia, put out a mighty new EP with her abrasive trio Moin and collaborated with the writer Fanny Chiarello. Then there’s this wildly exhilarating record with YPY, AKA Japanese musician Koshiro Hino, also of Goat (jp), which highlights the delirious musicality of her playing as his synths and her filigreed attack become inextricable.You might very well think: “Thirty-seven minutes of pure percussion? No, thank you.” But even if you don’t know your Chris Corsano from your Kahil El’Zabar, Kansai Bruises is immediately arresting in its virtuosity, high-wire thrills and textural delight. The hyper detail of One Hour Visa feels like synaptic overload, Magaletti and Hino’s mind-meld swerving like an out-of-control sled down a slalom. You hear Magaletti yelping “yeah!” in the title track, and wonder how great and gruelling it must feel to flit from tuneful patter to drone-line rumble then hand-style patterned percussion in a matter of seconds, an electric run aptly characterised by Hino’s shooting sparks. Lantern Lit Run has a dazed swirl to its gait that feels like drunkenly blinking at a city’s bright lights; then it dissipates to the steamy hiss of hot springs. More of a showcase for Hino, Her Own Reflection makes his synths blossom through the rubble Magaletti strews with abandon. The gleeful aggression of Kansai Bruises is so overwhelming that it becomes oddly relaxing: another indication of Magaletti’s preternatural talent.Laura SnapesMadison Cunningham – AceMarriage as a grape plucked and crushed, a plane downed in an open field, a town patrolled by wolves: for her gripping third album, Californian folk musician Madison Cunningham calls on a host of haunting metaphors to describe falling in love at 17 and divorcing by 27.A record about rebirth, or “dying in reverse”, Ace shifts the focus from Cunningham’s celebrated, dextrous guitar work. Instead, she and her touring band harness elemental power from vast woodwind arrangements and slicing strings – all the better to capture the terrifying, breathless possibilities of starting over. “You say you know every mole and skin tag, like it makes you wiser to the person I am,” she sings, steely with new self-knowledge, on piano ballad Take Two.Cunningham’s previous LPs (including the Grammy-winning Revealer) used songwriting to search for clarity. But Ace, named after “the strongest and the weakest card in the pack”, finds the truth to be slippery, contradictory, two-sided. Grief and desire are circular on single My Full Name, while the album’s slow-burn finale Best of Us tackles the slippery slope that is faking it, just a little, until you’re faking it more than you’re not. What happens when the facade finally cracks? This stormy, career-best record holds the answer.Katie HawthorneSarz – Protect Sarz at All CostsSarz: Getting Paid ft Asake, Wizkid, Skillibeng – videoAnyone with any interest in Afrobeats knows that the Nigerian producer Sarz has been an architect and alchemist of some of its best sounds, from Wizkid’s Come Closer to Lojay’s Monalisa. I’ve also seen him DJ at some of the best African music nights in London: not a realm he originally planned on venturing into, but one that naturally emerged from his production work as he wanted to learn how to influence the psychology of a crowd and get them moving. With his momentous, Black diaspora-surfing debut album Protect Sarz at All Costs, he lays a solid claim to the title of Nigeria’s most deft curator and enchanter of swinging hips.There are some of his usual collaborators here in Asake and Lojay, but there is also the Ndlovu Youth Choir from South Africa, French-Congolese singer Theodora and Cameroonian-American artist Libianca. They help him helm an incredible span of sounds: orchestral flourishes, traditional African percussion and futuristic afro-pop textured EDM. Like many ambitious projects by Afrobeats artists, Protect Sarz at All Costs is genre-fluid, encompassing amapiano, hip-hop, afroswing, 90s R&B and alté. The result is a potpourri of different moods: one of my favourite tracks, African Barbie, is sensual and fierce, while Getting Paid takes its cues from luxury rap about the spoils that a business in music and entertainment confers. With Sarz’s presence stretching beyond the African continent to fill dancefloors across the world, his debut doesn’t mark an arrival, but an assertion of his prodigious talent.Jason OkundayeDaniel Avery – TremorView image in fullscreenBrooding … Daniel Avery.Photograph: Kalpesh LathigraDaniel Avery’s Tremor is an album I feel like a fine film of grease on my skin, or the thin, constricting sensation of nylons pulled tight over my face while I do crimes. It’s an album that sounds like furtive behaviour, full of dark, industrial sounds and brooding, lurking musical alleyways. The first time I listened to it, I was walking home after dark with my hood up against the drizzle. It made me feel as if I was up to absolutely no good (but was actually on my way home from book club).Avery gathered a community of interesting, understated voices around him to make Tremor and the result is a far cry from the accessible techno he produced in his youth: though it occasionally feints in that direction as it roils through genres, Tremor’s droning guitars and clipped live drums slink beneath breathily delivered lyrics; the only way you could call it techno is if you said it was something like deconstructed post-techno industrial noisecore, which, let’s not. If Nine Inch Nails hung out in Dalston for a bit, they might come up with something approaching this record. If Deftones played a show underwater, you might get something a bit like Tremor; a seething, serpentine album that seeps into being and lingers, goading you into mischief like the devil on your shoulder.Kate SolomonAnthony Naples – ScannersNaples emerged in the mid-2010s amid a wave of dance producers making lo-fi house music (such as Delroy Edwards, Actress, DJ Boring and most of the LIES roster). Consciously or not, that loose scene seemed to be a bulwark against the shine of EDM. Since then, Naples’ work has only matured: 2023’s Orbs was spellbinding ambient techno, and the follow-up is richer still.It’s a more populist album than Orbs, with vocal samples, higher tempos and playful detailing such as the discordant jazz piano chords of Somebody, or the neo-acid squiggle running through Bounce that undulates the grid around it. Hi Lo is classic Basic Channel-style dub techno, as if swooping through mists on to a city-planet at dawn, while the title track still has that Germanic bearing but with a more golden-hour, late-afternoon light. Mushy, meanwhile, sounds like the kind of early 90s track that ex-ravers get misty-eyed about in YouTube comment sections. The highlight is Night: cantering along at 134bpm, it’s as if shards of digital light are hurtling past your field of vision.In a dance scene that lauds old-school legends and the latest hype-cyclists but can forget about those in between, it’s great to see Naples still steadily moving forward, iterating and improving his craft with every release.Ben Beaumont-ThomasRadu Lupu: The Unreleased RecordingsView image in fullscreenThrillingly vivid ... Radu Lupu in Bologna, Italy, 2017.Photograph: Roberto Serra/Iguana Press/RedfernsLupu was a pianist whose beguiling sound world was allied to a mind of such penetrating musical intelligence that it sometimes seemed miraculous. He died in 2022; Decca, for whom he recorded exclusively for over two decades, released his complete recordings in 2015, but to mark what would have been the pianist’s 80th birthday, the company produced this wonderful surprise: six discs made up of unreleased studio sessions and BBC, Dutch and SWR radio tapes, dating between 1970 and 2002, of works that the Romanian pianist otherwise did not record.While there is more familiar Lupu territory (Mozart and Schubert) in some of the discs, much of the set is less expected. Lupu recorded little Chopin, but here is a thrillingly vivid performance of the B minor Scherzo, more uncharacteristic still is Copland’s Sonata, fierce and majestic, from the Aldeburgh festival in 1971, while Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition sees him making a rare venture into the Russian repertory; it comes from a 1984 Dutch broadcast, his tone noticeably rawer, almost strident at times. In general, though, the recording quality serves the exemplary playing well enough; every track is a treat.Explore more on these topicsMusicBest music of 2025Pop and rockSoulElectronic musicExperimental musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Danish duo’s debut album Goodbyehouse, released on the cultishly adored label Escho, derives from a period when the pair’s lives were in a state of major upheaval, and comfort was in short supply. “We had fun – you can hear humour a bit on the album – and we went through some tough times, existential crisis, and you can hear that too,” says Theusen over a video call from her home in Copenhagen.Goodbyehouse became one of 2025’s runaway underground successes thanks to that emotional openness – as well as the duo’s canny blend of Dido-esque balladry, shoegaze haze and minimalist pop. When we speak, Thuesen and Strange have just returned home from their final tour dates of the year, a brief run that left them both ailing. “We get sick now after three weeks!” Strange says, laughing. “It was a lot easier when we were twentysomething.” They need to get used to it: 2026 includes an extensive Danish tour before a handful of shows with Paramore’s Hayley Williams and stops at Barcelona’s Primavera Sound and Denmark’s Roskilde festival.Snuggle is neither member’s first band. In his early 20s, Strange played in the acclaimed electronic soul band Liss, who were signed to XL Recordings. The four-piece broke up after the lead singer Søren Holm, died by suicide in 2021. They released their final album in 2022, after Holm’s death. “I was kind of at my lowest – I didn’t know what my music should sound like, if I should even make music,” he says. “That had been my life.”Thuesen has been a member of the indie-rock trio Baby in Vain since she was a teenager. The band “had this whole run where we had the hype, and we were signed to [big indie label] Partisan Records and toured a lot.” But the band “started to crumble” after Covid. She found herself at a crossroads, deciding, like Strange, whether to continue with music as her bandmates started to drift to other projects.Strange and Thuesen both ended up enrolling in Denmark’s Rhythmic Music Conservatory (RMC), where they met for the first time three years ago – despite both having previously been signed to Escho and having mutual friends. “We had these classes where we had to play music for each other, and it was an instant thing where we really liked what each other was doing, so we decided to try and jam,” says Thuesen. There was an emotional connection too, says Strange: “Some of the stuff we talked about when we met was having these similar experiences of losing a very good friend in your mid-20s – we were just talking in a very unfiltered way.”‘Rethink it all!’ Why is one Danish school producing nearly every cool alt-pop star?Read moreMany of the most hyped musicians of the 2020s – including the pop singer Erika de Casier, Henriette Motzfeldt (half of the electronic duo Smerz) and the experimental producers Astrid Sonne and ML Buch – have studied at the RMC, but Snuggle bristle at the idea thatthe school is the nexusof a certain scene. “It feels like the school is getting too much credit [for the] wave,” says Thuesen. “It’s more like a coincidence that all these people that are getting attention now went to that school, and I don’t really like when you put the art too much in context with institutions. I think it takes away from what art can be and can do.”Snuggle’s success certainly transcends the sometimes overly highbrow discourse surrounding the Copenhagen scene (now so renowned that it has its own officialSpotify playlist). The band recently received a DM on Instagram from a teenage girl in midwest America who said they made her want to pursue music. “It just made me so incredibly happy – when I was younger, I just wanted to go and get out there, feel the success, and [feel] hyped about the hype,” says Thuesen. “Now, it’s about these little things.”Explore more on these topicsIndieNew music for 2026interviewsShareReuse this content"

Tom Smith Big Band – A Year in the LifeUK saxophonist, composer and bandleader Tom Smith was dropping clues to his distinctively contemporary take on jazz traditions as a BBC YoungJazzMusician of the Year finalist in 2014 and 2016, and later as a leader of groups including the sax trio Gecko and the LGBTQI+ ensemble Queertet. But his powerful big band’s 2025 release, A Year in the Life, unveiled how exultantly Smith’s writing mingles orchestral influences from Maria Schneider and Carla Bley with slamming groovers from the big-band swing era, and a deep grasp of bebop chordal acrobatics, with raw and metallic guitar interventions thrown in.9. Artemis – ArboresqueView image in fullscreenEvocative … Renee Rosnes of Artemis.Photograph: Pascal Schmidt/Hans Lucas/AFP/Getty ImagesArboresque is the Artemis collective’s third and best release for the Blue Note label, evolved from an ensemble formed for International Women’s Day in 2016 by the acclaimed Canadian pianist and composer Renee Rosnes. All five members compose; standouts include saxist Nicole Glover’s ethereal Petrichor for its theme and her tenor improv, and trumpeter Ingrid Jensen’s snappy Sights Unseen with its vivacious post-bop dialogue with Rosnes. There are typically evocative Rosnes arrangements of her former employer Wayne Shorter’s Footprints, and the standard What the World Needs Now is Love. Cliche-free individuality and congenial collective spirit radiantly combined.Tell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more8. Jakob Bro – Taking TurnsDanish guitarist Jakob Bro is an undisguised admirer of Bill Frisell, but also of the unique melodic imagination of legendary Birth of the Cool alto saxophonist Lee Konitz. In 2014, ECM recorded this mini-masterpiece with Bro, an 86-year-old Konitz, and an avant-jazz supergroup of Frisell, pianist Jason Moran, bassist Thomas Morgan and former Cecil Taylor drummer Andrew Cyrille – and then unaccountably sat on it. This belated release reveals softly chiming harmonies and songlike waltzes for the inimitable Konitz to gleam and breathe through, alongside Cyrille’s and Morgan’s free-floating conceptions of swing, and the minimalist, interwoven delicacies of two sound-painting contemporary guitar masters.Read the full review7. أحمد[Ahmed] – Sama’aaView image in fullscreenFearless and compelling … أحمد [Ahmed].Photograph: Lisa GripKeyboardist Pat Thomas has been an idiomatically diverse creative maverick in UK jazz and improv for over three decades, and this two-album set features his أحمد [Ahmed] quartet’s stormily percussive, sonically abstract work, dedicated to sometime Art Blakey and Thelonious Monk bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, a pioneering merger of jazz and Middle Eastern music. Saxophonist Seymour Wright (an awesome inheritor of the methods of Albert Ayler and Evan Parker) and bassist Joel Grip often entwine raw multiphonics with melodious bowed sounds, while Thomas’s sometimes Cecil Taylor-esque chording and drummer Antonin Gerbal’s racing uptempo patterns rock between boiling free-jazz squalls and rattling folk-dances, on a session of fearless but infectiously compelling free jazz.Read the full review6. Cécile McLorin Salvant – Oh SnapTwelve originals and one quirky cover, first created alone with a computer by the French/Haitian/US vocalist Cécile McLorin Salvant, and then studio-layered with some longtime vocal and instrumental partners. Salvant draws on teenage pop memories, on folk and classical music, and the rich jazz life of her years in France. Fragile song-lines drift over drum loops, sleek jazz pianist Sullivan Fortner drives old-school swingers, while genre-spanning vocal partners June McDoom and Kate Davis join hauntingly empathic harmonies. What Does Blue Mean to You?, inspired by Toni Morrison’s Beloved, is the standout of a memorably bold and personal venture.Read the full review5. Linda May Han Oh – Strange HeavensView image in fullscreenSpecial … Linda May Han Oh.Photograph: Shervin LainezThe Malaysia-born, New York-based Australian bassist and composer Linda May Han Oh has long played for stars (Vijay Iyer and Pat Metheny among them); her own ventures have been few, but special. Strange Heavens revisits the partnership first launched in 2009 with Miles-influenced but lyrically inimitable trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire. The pair are joined here by Tyshawn Sorey, one of the great drummer-composers – and improvisational listeners – in contemporary music. Whisper-quiet melodies blossom out of bass caresses and Sorey’s spacey rimshots, Miles-like trumpet improv glides over hip-hoppish grooves, and Geri Allen’s Skin and Melba Liston’s Just Waiting get respectfully startling reinventions.Read the full review4. Joshua Redman – Words Fall ShortUS improvising saxophone master Joshua Redman’s 2023 debut for Blue Note (three decades after his spectacular 1993 emergence) was atypically and unsuitably focused on covers and vocals. But this year’s release features one vocal, an all-original repertoire and a new road band, and acclaimed Chilean saxophonist Melissa Aldana and 19-year-old west coast trumpeter Skylar Tang guesting. Both of them improvise with Redman as if they were soulmates, the ballad Borrowed Eyes develops exquisitely in spacey Redman whispers against softly plucked bass sounds, and the captivatingly ghostly voice of Gabrielle Cavassa shares a spellbinding vocal/tenor sax exchange on the closing Era’s End.Read the full review3. Anthony Braxton – Quartet (England) 1985View image in fullscreenOne of the greats … Anthony Braxton.Photograph: CTK/AlamyThe influence of the now 80-year-old Anthony Braxton, one of the great instrumental and conceptual jazz and new-music pioneers, has spanned music from free-improv to symphonies and operas. But his small jazz groups have often best showcased his multi-reeds virtuosity and the imagination that drives it. These live recordings from Braxton’s superb 1985 quartet tour of the UK feature headlong avant-bebop storms, free-collective passages, captivating warm-ups on standard songs, and the power and precision of pianist Marilyn Crispell, bassist Mark Dresser and drummer Gerry Hemingway. The cassette-recorded audio is understandably patchy, but the sense of being present at its creation is vivid.Read the full review2. Mary Halvorson – About GhostsAbout Ghosts expands New York guitarist/composer Mary Halvorson’s Amaryllis ensemble who partnered with her on 2024’s acclaimed Cloudward release. They are augmented here by two soulful saxophonists in altoist Immanuel Wilkins, and tenorist Brian Settles, whose arrival swells the surprises that Halvorson’s pieces constantly play with. Full of Neon’s march-like pulse and rich ensemble harmonies are squawked at by indignant horn exclamations, taut guitar figures mix with whooping alto improv on Carved From, and beboppish outbursts travel so fast as to sound hyper-compressed. Halvorson has said she loves singer-songwriter Robert Wyatt’s music for blending “the weird with the beautiful”. She certainly knows all about how that’s done.Read the full review1. Michael Wollny Trio – Living GhostsView image in fullscreenGenre busters … Michael Wollny Trio.Photograph: Jörg SteinmetzThe brilliant German pianist/composer Michael Wollny’s 10-year-old group with David Bowie Blackstar bassist Tim Lefebvre, and genre-busting drummer Eric Schaefer, goes from strength to strength. Living Ghosts is a live recording featuring the group’s favoured eschewal of setlists or arrangements, letting go to what the pianist has called “seances where the ghosts of the trio’s songbook visit us at their will”. Alban Berg and Paul Hindemith miniatures turn into rock-powered stomps or bass-walking bebop, swing turns into raw improv, Nick Cave’s Hand of God becomes Guillaume de Machaut’s Lasse! But governing it all is what types of music have in common, not what divides them.Read the full reviewExplore more on these topicsJazzBest music of 2025Lee KonitzfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Of the many hundreds of pianists I must have heard in more than 50 years of recital going, a multitude that has included many of the greatest names of the 20th century, none gave me more consistent pleasure or a greater sense of wonder than Radu Lupu. If ever a pianist’s appearance, especially in his later years, belied the character of his playing it was Lupu: that the intensely serious, heavily bearded figure who hunched over the keyboard in a way more appropriate to a seance than a recital could produce playing of such velvety tonal beauty was extraordinary enough; that such a beguiling sound world was allied to a mind of such penetrating musical intelligence sometimes seemed miraculous.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for The Unreleased Recordings.Photograph: DeccaLupu died in 2022, at the age of 76. He had retired from the concert platform three years before, and had ceased to make studio recordings some years before that. Decca, for whom he recorded exclusively for over two decades, released his complete recordings in 2015, and with that comprehensive box, one thought, the legacy would be complete. But now, to mark what would have been the pianist’s 80th birthday, the company has produced this wonderful surprise: six discs made up of unreleased studio sessions and BBC, Dutch and SWR radio tapes, dating between 1970 and 2002, of works that Lupu otherwise did not record.The set begins with Mozart’s G minor and E flat piano quartets, for which Lupu was partnered in 1976 by members of the Tel Aviv String Quartet, in performances of such pristine studio quality – Lupu at his most inward in the slow movements, dazzlingly buoyant in the finales – that it’s mystifying they have never previously been released. A 1990s disc of Schubert sonatas – the unfinished C major D840, and the D major D850 (in a surprisingly downbeat, almost angry performance) – complements the Lupu Schubert already in the catalogue, while a sequence of Haydn and Mozart sonatas from the 1970s and 80s ends surprisingly with Schumann’s Études Symphoniques, complete with its five “posthumous” variations.View image in fullscreenRadu Lupu, photographed at Sydney Opera House in 1974.Photograph: Fairfax Media/Getty ImagesIf those discs remain on more or less familiar Lupu territory then much of the rest of the set does not. He recorded little Chopin, but here is a thrillingly vivid (if not always technically immaculate) performance of the B minor Scherzo, while Lupu learned Bartók’s Out of Doors suite especially for the 1969 Leeds International Piano Competition, of which, half a century on, he remains the most celebrated winner. More uncharacteristic still is Copland’s Sonata, fierce and majestic, from the Aldeburgh festival in 1971, while Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition sees Lupu making a rare venture into the Russian repertory; it comes from a 1984 Dutch broadcast, his tone noticeably rawer, almost strident at times. In general, though, the recording quality serves the exemplary playing well enough; every track is a treat.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Shearwater is a research outpost, home to the global seed vault created as a bulwark against climate catastrophe and to colonies of seals, penguins and birds. For eight years, Dominic Salt and his children have lived there, but dangerously rising sea levels mean that they, and the vault, will shortly be evacuated. Dominic cannot understand why Rowan has ended up on Shearwater, and Rowan is mystified by the absence of the scientists and researchers, about whom the family are tight-lipped – and the island’s communication centre has been mysteriously sabotaged, isolating them still further. McConaghy writes beautifully about the natural world and expertly ratchets up the tension, as mutual suspicion increases and secrets are gradually revealed. This is a powerful read that encompasses not only grief, sacrifice and perseverance in the face of disaster, but also survival strategies and their concomitant moral dilemmas.View image in fullscreenDarkroomsby Rebecca Hannigan (Sphere, £20)When chaotic kleptomaniac Caitlin returns to her small Irish home town after the death of Kathleen, the mother from whom she has been estranged for many years, she’s pleased to be welcomed by the Branaghs, friendly neighbours she remembers from childhood. Less pleasant is being forced to confront past traumas, including the disappearance of her nine-year-old friend Roisin from a local wood 20 years earlier. Caitlin feels guilty about this, as does Roisin’s older sister Deedee, who is sure that Caitlin is still hiding something. Having joined the garda to find answers that never materialised, Deedee is drinking heavily, making poor decisions and jeopardising both her job and her relationship, and both women desperately need closure … This impressive, if bleak, debut is a slow-burning but well paced story of shame, guilt, misplaced loyalty and generational trauma, the conclusion of which, once one is in possession of all the facts, has a heartbreaking inevitability.View image in fullscreenThe Nancys and the Case of the Missing Necklaceby RWR McDonald (Orenda, £9.99)Winner of the Ngaio Marsh award for best first novel, New Zealander McDonald’s debut is set in a small town in South Otago. Eleven-year-old Tippy Chan has had a tough year after the death of her father, and when her mother goes on a Christmas cruise, leaving her in the care of her uncle Pike and his new partner Devon, she’s not sure what to expect. Pike, who fled to Sydney many years earlier, and Devon, a fashion designer, arrive in a blizzard of sequins and exuberance, but what begins as a jolly romp against a background of queeny flamboyance and inappropriate innuendo – which, mercifully, sails over our young narrator’s head – darkens when one of Tippy’s teachers is found dead in suspicious circumstances. Uncle and niece being devotees of the Nancy Drew mysteries, they feel compelled to investigate, and the Nancys detection club is born. As well as a compelling mystery, this is a funny and touching account of family, friendship and loss, with a trio of appealing characters at its heart.View image in fullscreenBest Offer Winsby Marisa Kashino (Doubleday, £16.99)American journalist Kashino’s first novel is a satirical thriller about the housing market, set in Washington DC. PR executive Margo and her lawyer husband Ian are desperate to move out of their cramped flat and buy a home where they will be able to start a family but, demand far outweighing supply for the type of property they desire – colonial style in a good area, the very benchmark of Successful Adulthood – they keep losing bidding wars. When Margo, the cynical but sensitive product of an unstable childhood, hears of a perfect house about to be put on the market, she decides to persuade the owners into a private sale. What begins with stalking and befriending under false pretences soon escalates, and events spiral out of control as Margo becomes increasingly deranged in pursuit of her life goals. Dark, funny and inventive, this is an ingeniously entertaining take on millennial anxieties.View image in fullscreenYour Every Moveby Sam Blake (Corvus, £14.99)More dirty dealings in the world of property, this time among the estate agents themselves. Your Every Move is set in London, where Sterling & Co sell houses that would attract the highest band of mansion tax to the uber-rich. Successful saleswoman Rosie Kinsella, who is also an influencer with an Instagram account full of property porn, usually enjoys her work, but now she’s being stalked. “Michael” appears to believe that he has a relationship with Rosie and, terrifyingly, has progressed from messaging to sending her photographs clearly taken frominsideher home. Meanwhile her boss, Yaraslava, has problems of her own – and then a colleague is found murdered in one of the luxury houses on their books. Seasoned crime readers may work out whodunnit fractionally before Rosie does, but this zippy chick lit/psychological thriller mashup with a dash of romantic suspense is just the job for a long winter evening.Explore more on these topicsBooksCrime and thrillers roundupFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Was it really all as good as you pretended it was on Facebook? Full of A-grades for the kids and riotous themed fancy dress birthday parties for the grownups? Or was it a sea of disappointment with only occasional fun flotsam? And was any of it actually real, or are we all now seven-fingered AI slop beings with Sydney Sweeney’s teeth?I have gathered my thoughts (and the Diamond household) together, whether they wanted to or not, to reflect on the most important thing in any given year: which video games we enjoyed the most.

The publisher is already planning a global marketing blitz.Set in 1960s London, the book charts the literary ambitions of Mitzy Barlow, a housewife and mother-of-two stranded in a loveless marriage who has grown weary of the mind-numbing monotony of her life.She begins hosting Tupperware parties – ubiquitous events in the 1950s and 60s – to make some extra income from selling the plastic containers to women in her neighbourhood.However, she soon begins to combine her role as hostess with a burgeoning career as a writer of sexual fantasies, which she starts to compose each night in a journal to help her deal with the bleakness of her marriage.As her confidence grows, Mitzy begins writing her own stories under the pseudonym Queen B. Before long, her part-time job selling Tupperware becomes a cover for smuggling erotic stories to her customers, with the stories stashed safely inside the airtight containers.As her alter ego finds success, Mitzy is left with a dilemma over pursuing a different life, fraught with the danger of being accused of indecency.The novel’s TV rights were eventually secured by Kudos, part of Banijay UK, one of the world’s biggest production companies. It has been behind programmes including the Netflix series The House of Guinness, and the BBC’s This Town and SAS Rogue Heroes.“We are thrilled to have acquired the rights to Abigail’s novel,” said Karen Wilson, the joint managing director of Kudos. “She is a brilliantly talented writer, and Wet Ink is a must read. We cannot wait to get started on developing it into a TV series for both the UK and international market.”Insiders said the demand was a sign of the continuing importance to production companies of hunting down new content, as competition has intensified with the rise of the streamers. There has also been a recent trend of books by female writers to be the subject of ferocious auctions.Industry sources said that in another such contest, 21 offers had already been made. The field for that title has been whittled down to a final 10, described as “a roll-call of glittery producers”. The book in question has not even been finished.Another novel, Death’s a Bitch by the debut author Eloise Rodger, was acquired earlier this year by another Banijay-backed producer, , after international interest led to intense competition for the rights.The novel follows Aggie and the plight of her younger sister Marcie, who has faced a long illness and endless waiting lists. Death offers Aggie a job that will ensure Aggie survives.Avis, who studied and taught English literature before entering a fellowship with The Royal Literary Fund, has said the idea for Wet Ink came to her during one of her children’s midnight feeds. Her agent, Hayley Steed, said that in selling the book rights she had never seen a reaction like it.“Within mere hours we were turning down international pre-empts and it has broken agency records around the globe,” she said. “Abigail has written a book that encapsulates the perfect bookclub read; an empowering call to arms, a warm story of female community and friendship, and just the right amount of naughtiness with its snippets of erotica.”Explore more on these topicsTelevision industryTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

But it was his tender, erotic pictures taken in a Paris hotel room in the 50s that really caused a stirChristian HouseFri 26 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 02.09 ESTShareIn 1952, two young honeymooners checked into a small hotel in Montparnasse. An everyday story in the City of Light, perhaps. But the Swiss photographer René Groebli and his wife, Rita Dürmüller, spent their time in Paris cocooned in their room producing a series of photographs – sensual, intimate, enigmatic – that would first shock then beguile viewers, works that can now be seen in a new exhibition in Zurich.In the honeymoon pictures, Groebli’s camera traces Dürmüller’s movements – as a shirt drops from her shoulders, the turn of her neck – which, he explains, was a deliberate “artistic approach not only to intensify the depiction of reality but to make visible the emotional involvement of my wife and of me.” Dürmüller is often nude, but not solely, and never explicitly posed. It is clear that she is playing with her husband, that this is fun. And we explore their shared space: the bed curved like a cello, the windows with their opaque lace curtains. There is one graceful snap of Dürmüller hanging up her laundry like a ballerina at a barre.By today’s standards the shots are sweet. But in 1954, when they were first published in book form, they were scandalous, leading to critical letters being sent to photographic journals and damning editorials written in newspapers.View image in fullscreen‘It doesn’t exhibit my wife as an object of desire’ … Undressing, 1952.Photograph: René Groebli/Courtesy of BildhalleThe final photograph in the series featured Dürmüller’s hand, complete with wedding ring, dangling over the edge of the bed holding a cigarette. Since Groebli’s book did not specify that he was married to his subject, some viewers saw this as depicting an extramarital encounter.Now 98, Groebli is sanguine about the mid-century response. “I wasn’t really surprised by the reaction of the media,” he tells me from his home in Zurich. “In those days only artists and people acquainted with the arts were used to nudity.Photographywas not commonly perceived as an art yet and photographs of nudes were associated with pornography rather than with artful, tender erotic poesy. It was therefore not surprising that, prejudiced by common perception, the poetic photographic essay could hardly be judged by its artistic value.”He responded by defining the series himself. “I reacted with the title The Eye of Love. It puts into words what the photographic essay is all about: love. It is not about voyeuristic sex, it doesn’t exhibit my wife as an ‘object of desire’,” he says of his spouse, who died in 2013. “Rita loved to create the images when we took those pictures. She took an active creative part in posing and composing. One may sense, while looking at these photographs, that she felt absolutely comfortable and, hence, acted perfectly natural. She was not an actor, but an artist helping to create scenes. The pictures are the result of a collaboration in perfect harmony.”View image in fullscreenUrgency in every frame … a shot from Rail Magic, 1949.Photograph: René Groebli/Courtesy of BildhalleGroebli was born in 1927 in Zurich, where his father was a procurator. In his late teens, he apprenticed with the Swiss photographer Theo Vonow and briefly studied at the Zurich School of Applied Arts under Hans Finsler, whose rigid, geometric style of photography Groebli rejected for a more fluid approach. Those interests informed his subsequent studies in film and a period training as a documentary cameraman.In the late 1940s, Groebli published his first photo-essay, Rail Magic, which followed the progress of a steam train as it barrelled from Paris to Basel. Its real subject was speed, its approach impressionistic: steam consumes the sidings, drivers lean into the wind. There is urgency in every frame. From the very beginning of his career, Groebli eschewed the cool gaze of the new objectivity movement popular inSwitzerlandat the time.His early shots of trains, merry-go-rounds, dancers and bicycles echoed the work ofJacques Henri Lartigue, who had captured a similar whirlwind of pistons and wheels during la belle époque. But where Lartigue’s pictures are zany, Groebli’s are poetic. “My life as a photographer is all about movement,” he says. “I took my first photographs visualising motion in 1946 and there was no influence from other sources. With respect to Lartigue, it must have been around 1965 that I came across his pictures for the first time. I never met him personally.”View image in fullscreenPoetic … Karussell Zürich Schweiz, 1947.Photograph: René Groebli/Courtesy of BildhalleWere there subjects that were simply too fast for his shutter? “Of course, there were extremely fast subjects”, he says. “But in the majority of instances, I intentionally chose the appropriate shutter speed that would provoke blurring or streaking effects.”In 1951, he married Dürmüller, a graduate in painting from the Zurich School of Applied Arts, and the couple went on their belated honeymoon to Paris the following year. Groebli describes his late wife as “not only lovely but in all respects an inspiring woman.” While initially criticised as being sexually overt, The Eye of Love series was later championed by the American photographer Edward Steichen, who invited Groebli to participate in The Family of Man, the landmark 1955 exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art in New York.Groebli went on to work in photojournalism, advertising and design, took portraits of Charlie Chaplin, Robert Frank and Walt Disney, and in the 1960s pioneered new modes of psychedelic colour-saturated photography using filters and selective dye transfer. “Mere naturalistic colour-photography did not satisfy my desires as an artist for long,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘Mere naturalistic colour-photography did not satisfy my desires as an artist for long’ …Cornelia, 1961.Photograph: René Groebli/Courtesy of BildhalleOver the course of seven decades, he has seen his medium change immeasurably. “Smartphones have made photography a general public asset. Hence the world is flooded with myriads of pictures daily. A few decades ago, photographers were either professionals or educated enthusiasts,” he says. “As to the future: while analogue means of manipulation were rather limited, [they] expanded through digital photography. And they are definitely exploding with AI. The main issue is and will be to distinguish photographs from pictures generated by AI.”The Bildhalle exhibition presents an oeuvre shaped by experimentation. But Groebli’s most personal works remain those pictures of Dürmüller, taken more than 70 years ago in a Montparnasse hotel, compositions fixed in period and place, yet timeless and universal. And authenticity is perhaps the key factor to their enduring appeal. The viewer believes in the emotions exhibited. As Groebli explains: “I still see, as I did in the early days of our relationship, her love for me and my artistic work, and my love for her.”René Groebli: Movement is atBildhalle Zurichuntil 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsPhotographyEuropeArtSwitzerlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why were we butting heads?Kerry HudsonFri 26 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTShareIt was 3pm onChristmasEve and already getting dark. As I stripped off on a wooden pier over the Baltic Sea in Malmö, Sweden, my husband and five-year-old boy, bundled up against the harsh wind, chanted: “Go Mummy, go Mummy, go Mummy!” Just as I was about to heroically slither out of my final layer, a bearded, completely naked man, who can only be described as Viking-esque, ascended the wooden ladder from the sea, looked at me with horror and possibly hypothermia in his eyes and shook his head. I put my five layers of clothing back on and, feeling deflated, suggested we crack open the Thermos. I knew I had failed at Swedish Christmas.My family and I emigrated toSwedenfrom the UK last winter, and while the days seemed impossibly short and dark, we were buoyed up by optimism,glögg(Swedish mulled wine) studded with almonds and raisins, and our new city, scattered with fairy lights. However, as the advent countdown began, a cold front harsher than the Baltic Sea swept through our cosy new home. My husband wanted to be “more Swedish than the Swedes”; I wanted some familiar traditions to pass on to my son. And so, December became a period of friendly but fierce negotiations.Yes, I still wanted Christmas cake, and it was important to me to have roast potatoes with dinner. I went to the Taste of Britain shop in town in search of Bisto gravy and some exorbitantly priced crackers. Sure, we could open presents on Christmas Eve, as is the Swedish way, but we needed to save my son’s stocking and “big present” for Christmas morning proper.We went to a Christmas market every weekend, where the only food on offer was the ubiquitous hotdog andpepparkakor(Swedish gingersnaps). Instead of visiting a cheerful, rosy-cheeked Santa, my little boy queued for a long time to see a taciturnTomte, a sort of grumpy house elf, who took my little boy’s wishlist of strictlythree presentsonly, signed it and handed it back with the exhausted resignation of a job centre adviser.Instead of roast dinner, my husband wanted to have the traditionally Swedish Jansson’s temptation: a gratin of potatoes, anchovies, cream and onion, an unfathomable selection of fish – gravlax, fermented herring and roe – and perhaps a large Christmas ham. It didn’t matter how much I reminded my usually easy-going spouse that none of us liked baked ham or fish that much – Christmas wasJulnow, and that was that.Eventually, on Lucia Day – a traditional day of candlelit processions of angelic kids, held on the 13 December, that’s meant to bring light and hope to dark winter – we untangled our adversarial tinsel. My husband, who had moved to Switzerland from London aged eight, explained that he had always felt slightly out of place and, as a result, wanted our son to adopt the most Swedish traditions as soon as possible, so that he could fully assimilate.Meanwhile, I had grown up in a selection of homeless hostels and council flats in Scotland and England, with very little money and even fewer happy Christmas memories. I wanted to give my son the perfect festive season that I had always imagined: a Christmas tree, a huge trifle, photos in an ugly Christmas jumper with Santa, a joyful frenzy of wrapping paper on Christmas morning.Each of us just wanted our little boy to have a great Christmas – and we soon realised we could do both: a table laden with sproutsandherring. This year, instead of quarrelling on Christmas Eve about whether we’ll watch The Snowman or, as in so many Swedish homes,Kalle Anka och hans vänner önskar God Jul(From All of Us to All of You), a 1958 festive Donald Duck cartoon, we’ll do both. We’ll supersize our celebrations, Scots-Swedish style, and embrace excess. I will be taking that Baltic sea dip on Christmas Eve and also paying wildly over the odds for a tub of Twiglets and an imported Radio Times.We’re not quite Swedish, no longer really British, but our Christmas will be as sweet and shiny as a box of Quality Street. A cool Jul for the whole family.Explore more on these topicsChristmasMy weirdest ChristmasSwedenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With the music throbbing, I learned I could be comfortable in my own companyAmmar KaliaFri 26 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShareBetween the ages of 16 and 21, the big night out wasn’t just a hobby, it was a calling. Getting together with friends, getting drunk, being blasted by music, meeting new friends in the smoking area, getting more drunk, somehow making it home eight hours later – these were things I excelled at, the precious moments where I could try to lose myself and avoid the anxiety that inevitably came with daybreak.The escapism wasn’t just selfish fun. It felt like a necessary avoidance of reality, which for me consisted of having a mother with a terminal illness who would die when I was 19, leaving me at university to cope with my grief. Going out, dancing and chatting rubbish to friends was one way to survive.I never usually went out alone, as that would mean being forced to engage with my thoughts and emotions. Except for one humid summer’s night in 2014 when I was 21, with my university years coming to a close and the prospect of moving back in with my widowed dad fast approaching: I found myself on a big night out with no company.The night was intended as one last blowout with friends before I was due to move out of my university digs in Bristol and, hopefully, enter the adult world. Five of us travelled to a warehouse on the outskirts of town to see the dub-influenced producer the Bug play with the MC Flowdan.But the pre-game shots and drinking games must have been especially potent because, by the time we arrived, one of the group was denied entry for being too drunk. The rest of us carried on until another of the group left for the smoking area, found someone to snog and never came back. That left me with a couple who were renowned over the three years of their university relationship for erupting into explosive rows. This final night was no different. I left for the loo and by the time I was back, they had begun bickering, then shouting at each other, before ultimately storming off into the street.I stood and began to sway to the rhythm while the thoughts I had been avoiding bubbled upLeft to my own devices, I finished my drink and felt a simmering anxiety begin to creep in. I fidgeted and was just about to leave when it hit me – a sound so loud and menacing it felt like the music was reaching inside to rearrange my organs. My knees quivered and the fillings in my molars rattled. This was the Bug finally coming on stage with his signature bass pressure, a noise so intense it seemed dangerous.I felt the flickering of a fight-or-flight response, but with foam earplugs soon shoved in, confused and aurally overloaded, I stood and began to sway to the rhythm while the thoughts I had been avoiding bubbled up: what would I do for work? How would I survive back in the family home? What was I meant to do with my life now my mum was gone?Rather than panic, though, the aggression of the music – its sheer loudness – started to scream back at the fear I was feeling. It was strange and compelling, and the longer I stayed, the more I began to feel tolerant of that discomfort – of the volume and of my fears. I could withstand the intensity, I realised, and maybe even enjoy it.I stayed for a few hours, sweating and dancing on my own, and made it home exhausted. I didn’t suddenly have a revelation that I was healed or that life would always be OK. I just found myself letting those thoughts and feelings emerge for the first time, rather than always trying to run away from them. The next morning, with my ears ringing, I felt a tiny jolt of excitement about the uncertainty that lay ahead of me – even if it meant moving back into my childhood bedroom.In the decade since that night out, I have become increasingly comfortable in my own company, and with those lingering thoughts that emerge when I’m alone. I would usually prefer to spend nights out with friends, but sometimes I seek out time by myself. It can be precious, poignant or silly fun, and I now know that if everyone else happens to disappear again, I can still dance and make my own good time.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleMy big night outClubbingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Drink styling: Seb Davis.The good mixerCocktailsCocktail of the week: Ambassadors Clubhouse’s Patiala peg – recipeAn old fashioned with a batty backstoryJames StevensonFri 26 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShareLegend has it that in 1920 Bhupinder Singh, the maharaja of Patiala, was determined that his cricket team would triumph over a visiting English team. To gain the upper hand, he hosted a grand party the night before the match at which he served his guests Patiala pegs, famously generous four-finger whisky pours traditionally measured from pinky to index finger. Unsurprisingly, the English players overindulged, leaving them very hungover and, inevitably, defeated the next day, and the legend of the Patiala peg was born. This Punjabi kind-of old fashioned is inspired by Singh’s drink. At the restaurant, we serve it from a bespoke five-litre bottle, but we’ve adapted the recipe to make it more suitable for a domestic environment.Patiala pegMakes1 litre, to serve 10-12725g blended scotch whisky– we useJohnnie Walker Black Label130g sugar syrup6g Angostura bitters(about 1⅓ tsp)1g orange bitters(about ⅕ tsp)A pinch of salt2g xanthan gumPut everything in a large bottle or jug, add 130g water, stir to combine, then put in the fridge, where it will now keep for up to three weeks.To serve, pour roughly 90ml Patiala peg into a rocks glass filled with ice (we use one big block), and serve – if you’re feeling traditional, measure it in by hand instead.James Stevenson, beverage director,Ambassadors Clubhouse, London W1Explore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodIndian food and drinkWhiskyrecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.At this time of year, I like to stay home, shut off from the world and do as little as possible for as long as possible. Eat all the food, embrace all the leftovers and be creative with whatever’s in the kitchen. After the big day, I like to turn leftovers into some sort of pie: they’re forgiving and malleable and work with whatever you have hanging about.This leftovers piefrom Tom Hunt andthis turkey and ham piefrom Felicity Cloake are great places to start. You could absolutely make your own pastry, as Tom does, or use shop-bought if you want to keep things as simple as possible (I always store a few rolls of pastry in the fridge over Christmas for precisely this reason). If it’s cheese that you have in abundance, meanwhile, then Rosie Birkett’s decadent-soundinglazy cheeseboard tartis a perfect way of using up the odds and ends of any remaining festive fromage.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As well as comfort food, I also find I need a change of pace after the 25th; I start craving spice and less hearty meals, too. Yotam Ottolenghi’sBoxing Day fried rice with garlic and spring onion sauceis the perfect way to be resourceful with leftover roast veg, as is Meera Sodha’sChristmas veg penang curry, a real treat of a dish that I enjoy year-round, and especially after the indulgence of December. Nigel Slater’sroast parsnip and stilton soup with beetroot crispsis another great addition to your leftovers repertoire, not least because it is a recipe that needs very few ingredients, very little work and is immensely adaptable. If I don’t have beetroot kicking around, I just leave it out. And if I have leftover comté instead of stilton, I’ll chop and stir that in instead.And then there are the puddings. No matter how well I plan, I always have an excess ofmince piesandChristmas pudding, so this year I am stocking up on the additional ingredients for Felicity Cloake’s fabulousChristmas pudding tiffin– what an inspired way of giving new life to leftovers! It’s perfect for any last-minute visits or visitors, or just to enjoy on the sofa with a glass of sherry in front of your favourite Christmas movie. Merry Christmas to all!My Christmas in sweetsView image in fullscreenClassic Christmas … Nigel Slater’s stollen.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverMore bakes|I’m clearly embracing my sweet tooth and want to share one of my favourite festive reads of all time:Advent by Anja Dunk. I adore this classic Christmas book and think it is a must for any keen bakers. Dunk shares recipes from her German heritage, and her book is filled with inspiring recipes and stories, beautiful photography and prints that she created herself. Favourites of ours include peppery gingerbread,gefüllte lebkuchen(jam-filled lebkuchen) and marzipan-filled stollen. A beautiful addition to any bookshelf.Scanditreat|My current addiction isLakrids by Bülow; these little balls of chocolate-coated artisanal liquorice are my achilles heel; I also love theirChristmas pairing of caramel balls with festive raspberry. Sous Chef also stocksa smaller festive set, as well as many of their other flavours (they’re gluten-free, too).New Year, new cake|Leaning into my Greek Cypriot roots, I love making all the traditional festive biscuits and cakes in December, such asmelomakarona,kourabiedesandvasilopita. Vasilopita is a cake that’s traditionally eaten at New Year, and features a lucky charm hidden inside, a bit like the French galette des rois. It is said that the finder will have good luck all year and myyiayia(grandma) always makes a large one for all of our family. You can absolutely have a go at making it yourself, or just order one fromGreek Mama’s Bakehouse, which makes them all by hand and is delivering before New Year. Great as a gift or to have at home to see in 2026 with loved ones.One last sugar hit for the road|If you’re still in need of a present for a fellow sweet-toothed loved one, head toGower Cottage Brownies. These treats by post have cult status – and rightly so: they are very,verygood (they have gluten-free and vegan options, too). You can either send a box by post, or set up agift box subscription.

Pile crisp coffee meringues high with espresso cream, boozy cherries, a drizzle of whisky caramel and a flicker of edible gold leaf, then shake, spoon and sparkle your way into the New Year. A few tips: arrange the toppings in glass bowls or on tiered trays for a beautiful display, add labels for fun and, if it’s sitting out for a while, keep the whipped cream chilled on ice.Espresso martini pavlova barPrep10 minCook1 hr 40 minMakes24 meringuesFor the meringues (make up to 3 days ahead)140g egg whites(from about 4 large eggs)220g caster sugar2 tsp instant coffee powder dissolved in 1 tsp hot water1 tsp cornflour½ tsp white vinegar1 tsp vanilla extract1 pinch fine sea saltCocoa powderEdible gold leaf(optional)For the espresso brandy cherries (make up to 3 days ahead)400g frozen black cherries60g light brown sugar60ml black coffeeA pinch of sea salt2 tbsp brandy, or coffee liqueur (Kahlúa, Tia Maria or similar)½ tsp vanilla extractFor the whisky caramel (make up to 3 days ahead)300g caster sugar60ml water150ml double cream50ml whiskyFor the espresso mascarpone cream (make on the day)300ml double cream150g mascarpone2 tsp coffee grounds1 tsp vanilla extract½ tsp cinnamonTo make the meringues, heat the oven to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2 and line two large oven trays with baking paper. In a clean bowl of an electric mixer, whisk the egg whites on medium-high to soft peaks. Add the sugar a tablespoon at a time, whisking until thick, glossy peaks form and the sugar dissolves – test by rubbing a bit of the meringue mix between your fingers: it should feel smooth. Add the coffee, cornflour, vinegar, vanilla and salt, and whisk just to combine.Dab a little meringue under each corner of each sheet of baking paper, so they stick to the trays, then, using two small soup spoons, dollop 12 roughly 5cm-wide rounds on each tray, spacing them well apart because they will double in size when baked. Using the back of a teaspoon, make a shallow dip in the centre of each meringue.Put the trays in the oven and turn down the temperature to 130C (110C fan)/250F/gas ½. Bake for an hour and 15 minutes, until lightly crisp, dry to the touchand still slightly soft inside. Turn off the oven, leave the door ajar and leave the meringues to cool completely for about an hour. Store in an airtight container for up to three days.To make the brandy cherries,combine the cherries, sugar, coffee and salt in a small saucepan, bring to a gentle simmer, stirring so the sugar dissolves, then lower the heat and simmer for five minutes until the cherries are tender and the liquid has reduced slightly. Add the brandy (or coffee liqueur) and vanilla, then take off the heat and leave to cool completely – the syrup will thicken as it stands. Store in a jar in the fridge for up to three days; bring to room temperature before serving.For the whisky caramel, mix the sugar and water in a medium saucepan on a low heat and stir occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Turn up the heat to high, cook without stirring until the caramel turns a deep amber, then take off the heat. Carefully add the cream, then return the pan to a low heat and stir until smooth. Add the whisky, decant into a jug and store in the fridge for up to three days. Reheat in a pan over a low heat before serving.For the espresso mascarpone cream,mix all the ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat on medium-low until soft waves form. Chill until ready to serve.To assemble, arrange the meringues on a plate and dust lightly with cocoa powder. Put the espresso mascarpone cream, brandied cherries and whisky caramel in separate small bowls or jars. You now have a DIY bar from which guests can build their own dish: nestle a meringue in a glass or shallow bowl, spoon in a little cream, top with cherries and finish with a glossy drizzle of caramel. A flicker of edible gold leaf on top adds just the right touch of New Year’s shimmer.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotNew yearDessertCoffeeSpiritsEggsWhiskyrecipesShareReuse this content"

It is really fun, and then it is a bit too much fun, and by the time I realise I’ve stepped over that line, whoops, it’s too late. I’ve overdone it, and all I want to do is lie down in a dark room.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Christmas is an intense and immersive experience. It is not just the alcohol, not just the food, although there have definitely been way too much of both of those things round my way. It is the whole sensory world. The new perfume your auntie got for Christmas going head-to-head with the cinnamon-scented tea lights. The nostalgia-soaked playlists and soppy romcoms. The kids on laps, the dogs on sofas, the fridge that barely closes. No doubt there was a point back there when I could have said: “You know what, I’ve had an elegant sufficiency of cheer, just a water and a quiet night with my journal tonight thanks,” but I was too busy singing along to Mariah Carey to notice and the moment passed. No matter. Better to err on the side of too much jolliness than too little, after all.You want a knit that feels joyful, not hectic. A restrained dusting of sparkle, or little pearls, is idealNow that the triptych of Christmas Eve, The Day Itself and Boxing Day are done, we can dial things down. But let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater just yet. These post-Christmas days are, for many of us, an important moment of rest and relaxation. There is a sleepiness to the world right now. What day of the week is it? Are the trains running/shops open? No other time of year feels quite the same. The Twixmas days have a texture all of their own, a braiding together of hearty walks, long films, bubble and squeak.The dress code is simple. What you need is a jumper that is cosy and special, but not overtly Christmassy. This, my friends, is the festive knit you really need, the one that will do you proud from the first days of December right to the last. The just-for-fun jumper, not a Fun Jumper.View image in fullscreenDesigner and stylist Natasha Goldenberg shows how it’s done.Photograph: Christian Vierig/Getty ImagesTo be clear, this means a knit with absolutely no reindeer. A hard no to gingerbread men. Zero tolerance of red-breasted robins. A snowflake motif is acceptable, at a push, if it is abstract and elegant. Holly, berries, that sort of thing are passable, but no Christmas trees please. Don’t even get me started on “Ho Ho Ho” jumpers, which will land you straight on the naughty list. Argyle diamonds, Fair Isle patterns: these are perfect. Think Scandi drama, not Santa’s grotto.These betwixt-and-between Twixmas days can feel lazy in a luxurious way, or they can feel aimless in a discombobulating way. The right outfit can help you land on the right side of that line. The texture of a nice knit is unbeatable for when you want to feel wholesome but sophisticated, as if you are the sort of person who takes contemplative walks on beaches and knows how to cook things with clams. Be wary of the seductive tactile appeal of the super-chunky jumper, though. The most useful all-through-December knit, which is what we are aiming for, is one that keeps your body temperature optimal whether you are indoors doing nothing, or striding out on a brisk walk. A very heavy jumper is liable to leave you red-faced in both of those scenarios.Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion: how to do the country look – without being a flat cap clicheRead moreThe right one is the knitwear equivalent of good lighting. It softens the edges, smooths over the late nights and the extra helpings. It is perfect for meeting friends to go for a walk, which is the kind of thing you might have in the diary for the next few days, because it will be comfy and warm but will also look nice in photos if someone gets their phone out. You want a knit that feels joyful, not hectic. A restrained dusting of sparkle, or little pearls, is ideal: it is important that you can pull it on for an early dog walk and then keep it on for lunch, dinner, telly, pub.

Southerly winds here can bring balmy winter days but winds off the North Sea are quite brutal. The light is fantastic and the variety of walking routes huge, with a boardwalk and visitor centre enriching the experience. This north-facing coastline is a magnet for exhausted migrant birds making landfall, and the pinewoods offer welcome shelter in bitter conditions. Bird hides along the woods’ southern edge look over marshland – fantastic for winter wildfowl spectacles and birds of prey.Jo SinclairProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

The walk starts overlookingPortstewart Strandand finishes in the town centre. It’s exposed to the Atlantic, so it’s always gusty and perfect for clearing the head after working too hard or overindulging. The sunsets here are to be savoured, so try to time it for dusk, and a post-walk pint by the fire in theAnchor Barfeels heavenly.CiaranA perfect hike for a frosty day in the ChilternsView image in fullscreenSnowfall on the north-facing slopes of the Chilterns.Photograph: Phototropic/Getty ImagesIf it’s frosty, this is a cracker. From the Chilterns village ofEwelme(the famous watercress beds can wait) head east uphill through fields and beech woodland to Ewelme park, turn left and skirt Swyncombe House, which has excellent views of the Vale of Oxford, keeping north and right of the church as you go up. Cross the only main road, down and up into more classic Chilterns woodland complete with deer, pheasant and dappled sunlight before descending gently through ancient earthworks back to Ewelme as the sun sets. It’s 5 miles, 2.5 hours, and there’s no pub – but you won’t care because the countryside is perfect.Rik HallewellA North Yorkshire amble for a foggy morningView image in fullscreenSkipton Moor.Photograph: Chris Dukes/AlamySkipton Mooris wonderfully quiet despite having spectacular views, perhaps because it’s just outside the Yorkshire Dales national park. Only a mile up the hill from the edge of town, its high points offers panoramic views of Airedale and Pendle, and it is home to hares and curlew. Sparkling frost outlines all the spider webs in the gorse bushes.

Mists rising over sandstone rooftops is a spectacular sight on a frosty morning. En route are panoramic views, ancient woodland, a sham castle, a cemetery clinging to the hills and the National Trust’sPrior Park, a magical 18th-century landscape garden designed for Ralph Allen, a key moderniser of the nationwide postal service.

But within a few minutes it opens out into majestic views across the River Clyde to the hills in Argyll and continues to wow for miles. The Cut’svisitor centre and cafeoffer a warming break and good-quality paths keep it passable even on wet or icy days. Walkers can continue onwards along the hill to return via the spectacular Wemyss Bay railway station (11 miles), or loop back on a shorter route passing the calm Loch Thom (8 miles). Both are stunning.NicView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysReaders' travel tipsWalking holidaysTop 10sWalkingShort breaksDay tripsHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Friends and family didn’t think I’d last a mileKidus TeseraFri 26 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 12.44 ESTShareSince coming to England from Ethiopia eight years ago, I’ve lost parts of my cultural identity. I was stuck in a monotonous, isolated routine studying for a biochemistry degree at Imperial College London, without the family-centred lifestyle I was used to. Back in Ethiopia, I’d be surrounded by my aunt, grandparents, friends.So this year, I took 12 months out and moved to my uncle’s house in Leeds. The change helped me try new things, like cycling: as a child, I had never ridden a bike. I bought one in a charity shop. My friends told me that it was made for a 10-year-old and donated an adult-sized bike to me.The bike had spent two years in my friend’s garden, so it was in bad shape. I spent a month taking it to a repair shop. I also joined a project called the Hackspace – it’s a community-run workshop for makers – and built a wooden bicycle. It’s mostly made of recycled materials: I used an old flip-flop for the brake. The Hackspace’s director, Mark, suggested I go to John o’Groats and cycle all the way down to the south. At first, I thought that was ridiculous, but then reconsidered it: I wanted to do something new.I hadn’t planned any logistics, hoping to figure things out as I went. My friends and family didn’t think I’d last a mile. Maybe they had a point: the first three nights were terrible. I hadn’t bought a tent to sleep in; only a tarp to cover myself. I’d packed light, relying only on one cotton shirt. The wind and rain were rough.During the months I was on the road, I was prepared for the worst. But plenty of people offered me their friendshipI hadn’t brought enough food, either, and had to ask people for help – in those remote parts it was hard to find a shop and I didn’t have much money. These wonderful people were often elderly and isolated, but eager to help. This inspired me to use my journey to fundraise forAge UKandMekedonia, an Ethiopian charity for vulnerable people.During the two and a half months I was on the road, I was prepared for the worst. But people offered me their friendship. A DJ discovered my videos on TikTok and sent me money for hotel stays. After I finally bought a tent, people let me pitch up in their gardens. I was invited into homes, garages, village halls and even barns to stay. I met builders in the Scottish village of Tomatin, who offered me a place to stay for the night, and I helped them in return. I spent the next day bricklaying, making friends I still keep in touch with now.Experience: I gave birth to the world’s first IVF boyRead moreThe wooden bicycle caused a stir wherever I went. Locals would go crazy over it. I’d tell them my story, they’d gather their friends and family to take pictures, and donate to my fundraiser.It wasn’t all easy cycling. During Storm Floris, I was passing through Dalwhinnie, another Scottish village, and desperate for shelter. Then, the loveliest couple invited me in, gave me hot food, took me to their community hall and set up an air mattress for me.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

When my chain broke near Newcastle, some cyclists helped me hitchhike to a shop, which then fixed it for free. A man in the Bedfordshire village of Haynes replaced my front wheel with one from his daughter’s bike, then let me sleep in his van.I wondered if I would face racism. I did have some tricky encounters, but hopefully I’ve changed their minds. I also got to know Ethiopians in Britain, who followed my progress on social media. Whenever I reached a city with a sizable Ethiopian population, they would offer to host me.The last few days were hard. I had been catching up with my friends in London, and leaving felt difficult. But again, people helped. One lady in Faversham hosted me in her house. We watched Avatar together.Later, an Ethiopian who’d seen my TikToks booked me a hotel room in Canterbury.The next day, I reached Dover. A party of 10 Ethiopians travelled from London to meet me, with food, music and a trophy: a small bike with my name on it. My journey came to an end.I had previously felt the absence of community in my life: doing this adventure made the world feel bigger. The community helped me finish my journey. Not money or my resilience – just the kindness of strangers.As told to Sumaiya MotaraDo you have an experience to share?

So she put her feelings on camera. The answer was immediate ...Emma BeddingtonFri 26 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShareIf you’re a woman of a certain age with a phone, you’ve probably seen one of Melani Sanders’We Do Not Care Club posts. In a fleecy dressing gown with reading glasses hanging off her like Christmas tree baubles, a sleep mask wonkily on her forehead, Sanders stares deadpan at the camera. “We are putting the world on notice that we simply do not care much any more,” she says. She uncaps a highlighter with her teeth, spitting the lid out of shot, then starts flatly listing stuff members of the We Do Not Care Club, her virtual community of menopausal women, don’t care about. “We do not care we have to go to therapy weekly; you are probably the reason we are there.” “We do not care if we asked you the question 13 times. We do not remember the answer; say it again.” “We do not care if you realise we are not wearing a bra: this, my friend, is freedom.”Sanders laughs when I show her over Zoom (she’s in West Palm Beach, Florida) the highlighter tucked into my bra strap in her honour. Since shefirst suggestedstarting a “we do not care club” on 13 May 2025, it has become more than a series of brilliantly funny videos about how the midlife hormonal rollercoaster leaves women bereft of fucks to give. It is a worldwide sisterhood of 2.2 million followers on Instagram and 1.5 million on TikTok. But when Sanders, 45, sat frazzled and sleep-deprived in her car, fetching the supplements that kept her (somewhat) sane since entering surgically induced perimenopause, she was wondering if she was alone. Pre-hysterectomy, she was a perfectionist, running her home, family and life with military precision; no more. Her sports bra was skew-whiff; her hair dishevelled. “I said: ‘Melani, you really just don’t care any more … Is it just a me thing? I just hit record.’”Twenty minutes after what she calls her “hot mess moment”, she had her answer: it wasn’t just a her thing. Sanders was a seasoned content creator – “I’ve had viral content; I know what that looks like” – but this was different: her post was everywhere, all at once. “I honestly got scared,” she says. “I actually cut my phone off for a little while.” She turned it back on to post again the next day – already in her signature list format (“We don’t care about being on time – baby, be happy I showed up because I don’t even want to be here,” was one highly relatable item). Thereafter, whenever she looked at her phone, hundreds of thousands more women who found her hilarious, but who also finally felt seen and understood, had joined the club. It was overwhelming, she says. “I cried a lot during this time – impostor syndrome. I did not think I was enough. I felt everyone was looking at me to continue this, but I’m in perimenopause, I don’t know what I’m doing from day to day. I don’t even know who I am from day to day!”Emma Barnett says she felt ‘mugged, robbed’ after perimenopause at 38Read moreWhat shifted, Sanders says, was seeing other women saying they were starting their own “chapters” of WDNC, taking on the mantle of not caring in their own areas, or communities. “I said thank you, Jesus – this is a sisterhood.” Still, Sanders remains WDNC’s beating heart, and it has been an intense ride for a woman dealing with a grab-bag of perimenopause symptoms and a full life with a husband and three sons. There’s been an appearance onThe Drew Barrymore Showwith Halle Berry; Ashley Judd filmed atribute post; Sanders regularly receives deeply heartfelt messages from women going through the menopausal wringer. She has even written a book, the imminent (and extremely funny) The Official We Do Not Care Club Handbook. “What got me to the point of just embracing it is hearing women saying: ‘I feel seen now. You’re saying the things we want to say.’ That is what strengthens me.” Perimenopause can be, as Sanders says, “extremely isolating”. Women’s symptoms are minimised; misinformation – and medical indifference – is rife. Feeling part of a community, sharing frustrations and symptoms (“I have a saying, if our sister’s coochie is dry, then we all have dry coochie,” Sanders says, winningly) and, above all, having a laugh, is precious. Her pinch me moment, Sanders says, wasn’t the celebrity stuff, but when a woman spotted her shopping for groceries: “She started to cry and she said I’ve been following you – I’m going through a divorce right now, I’m in perimenopause and, watching your videos, you’ve given me the strength to keep pushing through.” Because she does care, hugely – not about laundry or chin hair, but about the stuff that really matters.The Official We Do Not Care Club Handbook by Melani Sanders will be published on 13 January by HQ (£12.99).Explore more on these topicsMenopause2025: what happened next?PodcastingWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)InternetDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

People who truly love their plots shuffle things around all the time, with the same confidence and curiosity as those restless interior design lovers who change their curtains twice a year with the clocks.The longest I’ve ever had a plot is five years, but even in that time I feel as though I made several different gardens. The suck-it-and-see approach of lifting something that isn’t terribly happy has been a stalwart of mine since I started container gardening on a tiny balcony.Yes, there’s a risk that moving a plant may overwhelm or challenge it, but it’s also a free and relatively easy way of playing with new shapes, forms and ideas in your plot, no matter the size. And I’d argue that right now, this slow, quiet time between Christmas and January, between one year and the next, as the days gradually start to stretch out again, is a symbolically lovely time to do it.If you’d rather be more formal about it, sketch your beds, whether existing or planned, to help get things in their new placeIf you live in an area that has been damp to the point of boggy, or frozen solid, then save it for a quiet weekend in January instead. But if things are simply cool, damp and docile out there, you’ve got the perfect conditions for shuffling some plants around, because many perennials will be dormant. I recommend you start with the things that are bothering you a bit – whether it’s because you wish they were growing better than they are, they’re frustrated in a too-small pot or looking deathly – because the chances are that a new spot will only improve things.Composting for your garden? This ancient method requires minimal effortRead moreOne of my favourite things about gardening is the almost free-flowing nature of how plans unfurl once I’m out there. But if you’d rather be more formal about it, draw up a sketch of your beds, whether existing or planned, to help get things in their new place. Prepare the landing site before you lift anything: dig a hole that’s generously deep and larger than the anticipated rootball (look to the crown of the plant for a good guide), and add some mulch or well-rotted compost. Then lift, plonk, bed down firmly and give a good water to celebrate the plant’s new home.Depending on the plant, you won’t see the fruits of your labour for a few weeks yet, but there’s a satisfaction in this, too. While you wait, you can enjoy your new planting arrangement through its skeletal structure; and if it’s not working for you, have another shuffle before spring comes. A fresh take on the garden for the new year.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But could they be connected to a documentary I had made on Havana syndrome?Larry RyanFri 26 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShareWaking foggy-headed and with the room spinning on 26 December is surely not an uncommon condition. Who among us hasn’t felt the effects of overindulgence onChristmasDay?These were my immediate thoughts when I rose in such a state in my parents’ house in Dublin two years ago. An hour later, the room continued its relentless swirl, nausea was building and it was becoming hard to stand. So far, so Christmas hangover. I remained in bed and waited for things to blow over. They didn’t. Gradually, family members stuck their heads into my childhood bedroom and wondered if everything was OK. I could only say that I felt quite strange.After a couple of hours, I thought I was over the worst, so I joined my mother, sister and wife in the kitchen. Moments later, they watched on helplessly as I vomited in the kitchen sink, a silent bond created between them.This process repeated itself several times over the next day, so I visited a doctor. The GP diagnoseda case of vertigo: not any Hitchcock-infused vision, but dizziness and nausea, usually caused by inner ear problems. Often this lasts only seconds, but there can be more prolonged incidents. I was prescribed medication to restore order.The wider oddity was that, at the time, I was working as a producer on a podcast documentary for BBC Sounds calledHavana Helmet Club, investigatingHavana syndrome– the 2016 case of mystery brain injuries affecting CIA agents and US embassy officials in Cuba and farther afield.I wondered if somehow I had imagined myself into sicknessI had spent the previous year researching all aspects of this strange story: starting with the array of symptoms the patients had begun experiencing, seemingly out of nowhere. Most reported hearing piercing sounds in their homes in Havana, followed by overwhelming headaches, dizziness, nausea and, eventually, lasting brain trauma. There was speculation aboutRussian microwave weaponsand jokes about an “immaculate concussion”. Politicians, scientists, diplomats and security experts argued endlessly about it. Some claimed people had simply imagined it or overreacted to the sound of crickets – suggestions that the victims were rather hostile to. Doctors explained that even if there wasn’t a weapon, other triggers – physical and mental – could cause a dramatic reaction in the brain.Shortly before my own incident, I had been listening to an interview a colleague had done with a neurologist. The doctor was talking about how, when you become aware of a certain part of your body, your mind can then overly focus on it. If you’re told you have a family history of heart disease, for example, you might suddenly start noticing how you feel out of breath walking up stairs. In the weeks after listening to this, I had occasionally noticed mild head rushes when I bent over or stood up quickly.In my vertigo-addled state, I attempted to explain all of this to the doctor. I wasn’t claiming I had been dragged into a dastardly spy plot. More, I wondered if somehow I had imagined myself into sickness. Could something a person had read about take possession of their body? When I finished this spiel, she looked at me politely, said, “Right, yes,” and explained it wasn’t an unusual affliction. The pills should do the trick after a week, she told me, and if it happened again I would need vestibular physiotherapy.She was right, of course, and it passed relatively smoothly. But it did make me think of everyone who had been caught up in the case of Havana syndrome. As well as needing care, many were consumed by a need to know what had happened to them. My illness was minor, but I could see how easily such thinking can take over when you get struck down out of the blue. The list of causal factors for vertigo and vestibular disorders includes everything from lying down to standing up, air travel and much else in between. Most dismayingly for someone in their 40s, it“becomes progressively more common with age”. We are where we are.Rather than go down the rabbit hole, I decided it was better just to be grateful that my bout of ill health had occurred the dayaftermy big Christmas dinner – even if the medication did mean I could only sip non-alcoholic “champagne” on New Year’s Eve. Perhaps a fate worse than vertigo itself.Explore more on these topicsChristmasMy weirdest ChristmasEspionageHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is up 14% from £56 a month in 2022.“Ongoing macroeconomic pressures mean that UK consumers are seeking more cost-effective ways of getting their entertainment services,” Broughton said.To date the impact of streamers introducing advertising has had a limited impact on traditional broadcasters such as ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5.Wary of the impact on their subscribers, who for more than a decade had become accustomed to streaming being an ad-free environment, the number of breaks appearing in films and TV shows has been low so far.Many advertisers were also initially put off by the high pricing that players such as Netflix and Disney+ tried to command, backed by the argument that for the first time they would be able to target audiences watching hit shows such as Rivals, Adolescence and Stranger Things.However, while Netflix has said it does not expect ads to be a “primary driver of revenue” until at least 2026, the increasing number of subscribers on ad-supported plans means the market for streaming adverts in the UK is growing rapidly.The market – which includes ITVX, Channel 4 and Channel 5’s streaming services as well as players such as Pluto TV, Tubi and the smart TV operators such as Samsung – will reach £1.38bn this year. It has more than doubled in size over the past four years, and is almost half the £3.15bn ad spend on traditional UK linear TV.Among the top 10 streaming advertisers are Apple, Tesco, McDonald’s and Subway, according to Ampere’s analysis of the UK market in November.Top 10 advertisers on streaming services in the UKAppleSkyTescoSainsbury’sIndeedSubwayGoogleParamountMcDonald’sBT* Rank based on total ad viewing time in November – impression volume multiplied by ad length.

He had been detained in jail two years beyond his five-year sentence as the Cairo authorities refused to recognise the period he held in pre-trial detention as part of his time served.A previous attempt by Abd el-Fattah to leave Cairo for London in November after his release from jail, was blocked by the security forces a month ago. He has since been trying to negotiate an agreement whereby he is allowed to travel freely between Cairo and London and not be permanently excluded from Egypt if he came to the UK.His arrival in London was announced by his mother, Laila Soueif, on Facebook.His sister Mona Seif said: “I can’t believe it’s finally happened and Alaa has made it to London. We thought it was impossible, but here he is. Hundreds of people around the world did so much to help bring this moment about. Alaa is free and we can finally begin to heal as a family.”The family believe the agreement will allow him to travel back and forth between the UK and Egypt.View image in fullscreenAlaa Abd el-Fattah pictured in September in Cairo after he was given a presidential pardon.Photograph: Khaled Elfiqi/APJames Lynch of FairSquare, a human rights organisation that has worked alongside Abd el-Fattah’s family for several years, said: “I’m delighted that Alaa has safely returned to the UK to be reunited with his son after such a lengthy ordeal lasting well over a decade. After everything Alaa and his family have been through, I’m hopeful this marks the beginning of a new chapter for them.”His mother twice came close to death when she was admitted to hospital during an extendedeight-month hunger strikedesigned to put pressure on the UK Foreign Office to do more to secure his release.The British prime minister, Keir Starmer,made three calls to his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, also personally urged the Egyptians to end his detention. But the Egyptians never allowed British consular visits to jail, saying they did not recognise his dual citizenship status.Changes in the Egyptian embassy in London may have helped produce a less inflexible stance.Abd el-Fattah, from a family of human rights activists, became a leading voice during the Arab spring. He has a direct, perceptive, non-sectarian writing style that has won him awards.He has a teenage son, Khaled, who lives in Brighton and attends a special educational needs school. The boy visited him in Cairo soon after his release, in what was regarded as a successful reunion.Abd el-Fattah’s sister, Sanaa, explained at the time he had been blocked from flying out of Cairo: “We’re really glad to have [Alaa] back in our lives partially free, but he needs to have freedom of movement to live with his son, reunited with him properly.”“Khaled needs his father. My nephew … is very, very comfortable in his school and his setup in Brighton. We can’t change. We can’t keep creating instability.”He had already served a five-year jail sentence passed in September 2019 on charges of “spreading false news” after a much-criticised trial, yet last year his family were told he would not be released until January 2027.Starmer made no criticism of the justice of Abd el-Fattah’s sentencing. “I’m delighted that Alaa is back in the UK and has been reunited with his loved ones, who must be feeling profound relief,” the prime minister wrote on social media. “I want to pay tribute to Alaa’s family, and to all those that have worked and campaigned for this moment.“Alaa’s case has been a top priority for my government since we came to office. I’m grateful to President Sisi for his decision to grant the pardon.”Explore more on these topicsEgyptAbdel Fatah al-SisiAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaHuman rightsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Death to all Islamic terrorists! Thank you.”Loomer said she had been informed by the US defense department – which theTrump administrationcalls the war department – that the American cruise missile strikes carried out with the Nigerian government’s cooperation had been “a direct response to [IS] jihadi terrorists killing Christians in Nigeria”.The US House member Randy Fine, a Florida Republican who in November supported a congressionalresolutioncalling for Nigeria to be designated a “country of particular concern” due to its religious violence, described Thursday’s strikes as an “amazing Christmas present!”US warns of more Nigeria strikes as Abuja talks of ‘joint ongoing operations’Read more“With Muslim terrorists attacking Christians in Nigeria, Syria, and even Europe – simply for refusing to submit to Islam – the president is showing that we will no longer tolerate these barbarians,”Fine said on X, after suggesting earlier in December that “mainstream Muslims” should be “destroyed”.The uniformity of the Republicans’ response comes in contrast to a campaign involving economic pressure as well as airstrikes on alleged drug boats that the Trump administration is waging on Venezuela to oust its president, Nicolás Maduro. SomeRepublicanshave warned that the history of US “regime change” efforts are not promising and have warned against direct military strikes on Venezuela.Attacks on Christians by Islamic extremist groups inNigeriasuch as Boko Haram had been drawing increased attention from US Christian groups that are generally aligned with Trump.“Do not test President Trump‘s resolved [sic] in this matter,” saida postfrom the Republican US House member Riley Moore of West Virginia, who introduced the Nigeria-related congressional resolution in November. “Tonight’s strike in coordination with the Nigerian government is just the first step to ending the slaughter of Christians and the security crisis affecting all Nigerians.”In further comments on Friday, other Republican lawmakers praised Trump for carrying out the strikes. North Carolina senator Ted Budd, a Republican,saidthat IS “is responsible for the deaths of thousands of Christians & religious minorities in Nigeria”.Budd wrote that Trump’s “decisive strikes will save lives & protect religious freedom. May God bless our brave men & women in uniform.”Congressman Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who recently led a delegation to Nigeria, said that attitudes within the Nigerian government were “beginning to turn in favor of protecting Christians – in addition to taking actions against those terrorizing Christians and moderate Muslims”.Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican,said on Xthat he commended the Trump administration as well as American troops for “these strikes against bloodthirsty [IS] savages who are not only persecuting Christians, but also have killed many Americans”.Pressure on the administration to act in Nigeria had been building since July, when the US Commission on International Religious Freedom issued anadvisorythat said the Nigerian government was “often unable to prevent or slow to react to violent attacks by Fulani herders, bandit gangs, and insurgent entities such as JAS/Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP)”.In October, Ted Cruz – a Republican senator from Texas – said the US was able to identify the perpetrators of anti-Christian violence in Nigeria “and I intend to hold them accountable”. Cruz said that since 2009, “over 50,000 Christians in Nigeria have been massacred, and over 18,000 churches and 2,000 Christian schools have been destroyed”.At the recent AmericaFest, a four-day gathering of US conservative organized by Turning Point USA, the Trinidadian rap starNicki Minajspoke with Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, on the oppression of Christians in Nigeria. She said she loved Nigeria in part because her pastor is Nigerian.“Hearing that people are being kidnapped – while they’re in church, people are being kidnapped, people are being killed, brutalized, all because of their religion – that should spark outrage in America, and that’s what it’s doing,” Minaj said.Trump toldPoliticoon Friday that the Christmas strike was originally to take place on Wednesday, but the president had the operation delayed until Thursday for symbolic reasons.“I said, ‘Nope, let’s give a Christmas present,’” Trump remarked to the outlet. “They didn’t think that was coming, but we hit them hard. Every camp got decimated.”Thursday’s strikes in Nigeria come less than a week after the US hit more than 70 Islamic State networks and infrastructure in Syria in response to an attack that killed two American military service members as well as a civilian.Adm Brad Cooper, commander of the American military’s Central Command (Centcom), said the Syrian strikes were “critical to preventing [IS] from inspiring terrorist plots and attacks against the US homeland”.Hegseth on Friday warned of additional US strikes against IS targets in northern Nigeria.Explore more on these topicsRepublicansUS militaryTrump administrationNigeriaUS foreign policyUS politicsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing.”Now, Nigerian foreign minister,Yusuf Tuggar, has told broadcaster ChannelsTV that he was on the phone with the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, and that Nigeria “provided” the intelligence.“We spoke twice. We spoke for 19 minutes before the strike and then we spoke again for another five minutes before it went on,” Tuggar said.He added that they spoke “extensively” and that President Bola Tinubu gave “the go-ahead” to launch the strikes.Nigeria’s foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar.Photograph: Light Oriye Tamunotonye/AFP/Getty ImagesTuggar did not rule out further strikes, describing them as an “ongoing process” that would also involve other countries.In an interview with the BBC, Tuggar insisted the strikes had “nothing to do with a particular religion”. He said the operation did not have “anything to do with Christmas, it could be any other day - it is to do with attacking terrorists who have been killing Nigerians”.Trump has previously said he would launch a “guns-a-blazing” US military intervention in Nigeria, claiming that the country’s government hasbeen inadequate in its efforts to prevent attacks on Christiansby Islamist groups.ShareUpdated at07.49 EST"

The [Pentagon] is always ready, so ISIS found out tonight – on Christmas. More to come … Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation. Merry Christmas!”Nigeria’s foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, said on Friday that the US strikes, which came after Trump had locked the countries in a diplomatic dispute when heaccused Nigeria’s governmentof failing to stop Christians being killed in the country, were “part of joint ongoing operations”.Trump said on Friday that a US military strike targeting Islamic State militants inNigeriawas originally supposed to take place on Wednesday, but he ordered that it be delayed by a day.“They were going to do it earlier,” Trump told Politico in an interview. “And I said, ‘nope, let’s give a Christmas present.’ They didn’t think that was coming, but we hit them hard. Every camp got decimated.”Nigeria is officially secular and its population is almost evenly split between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%). Violence against Christians has drawn attention from the religious right in the US, which has framed it as persecution, and Trump’s supporters broadly welcomed the strikes. Nigeria’s government has pointed out that armed groups target Christians and Muslims.Nigeria provided intelligence for theairstrikes in Sokoto state, Tuggar told the country’sChannels Televisionon Friday. He said he had spoken to his US counterpart, Marco Rubio, for 19 minutes, then called the Nigerian president, Bola Tinubu, to get his go-ahead, before speaking to Rubio again for another five minutes.“We have been working closely with the Americans,” Tuggar said. “This is what we’ve always been hoping for, to work with the Americans, to work with other countries, to combat terrorism, to stop the death of innocent Nigerians … It’s a collaborative effort.”The US military’sAfricaCommand said the strikes in Sokoto state had been carried out in coordination with Nigerian authorities. An earlier statement posted on X and then removed said they had been conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities.map of NigeriaTrump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday: “Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!“I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was. The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing.”Trump positioned himself as the “candidate of peace” in the 2024 US presidential election, campaigning on a promise of extricating Washington from decades of “endless wars”. However, the first year of his second term in the White House has been notable for a number of military interventions overseas, with strikes on countries including Yemen, Iran and Syria, as well as ahuge military buildupin the Caribbean targeting Venezuela.Neither the US nor the Nigerian authorities have said if anyone was killed in the airstrikes. Asked if there would be more, Tuggar said: “You can call it a new phase of an old conflict. For us it is something that is ongoing.”Residents in the Sokoto village of Jabo, where the strike hit, said there had been no casualties and that security forces had cordoned off the area.Some in the village described panic and confusion as the US missiles hit. “As it approached our area, the heat became intense,” Abubakar Sani told the Associated Press on Friday. “The Nigerian government should take appropriate measures to protect us as citizens. We have never experienced anything like this before.”Sanusi Madabo, a farmer, said the sky glowed a bright red for hours from what he learned only later had been a US airstrike. “It was almost like daytime,” he said.US planes conducted surveillance missions over the region earlier this month. It is believed they used an airport in neighbouring Ghana as a base.Forests in Sokoto, which is bordered by Niger to the north, have been used as bases by gangs of armed bandits and members of Islamic State – Sahel Province, known locally as Lakurawa. Some analysts say the IS branch started when a group of herders joined together to fight bandits in the absence of state support. The state is mostly Muslim.Why is Donald Trump threatening military intervention in Nigeria?Read moreFor residents of Sokoto, the US strikes brought back memories of when the Nigerian air forcemistakenly bombed an areajust an hour away from Jabo on Christmas Day last year. The villagers received compensation only five days ago, according to the air force’sFacebook page, which said 13 civilians had been “unintentionally killed” and eight injured.Clashes between Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities in parts of Nigeria have been aggravated by ethnicity and religion but their roots lie in competition for land and water.Priests and pastors have increasingly beenkidnapped for ransombut some experts say this may be a trend driven by criminal incentives rather than religious discrimination.Tuggar said the operation was about “protecting Nigerians and innocent lives”, not one religion or another. “The president emphasised yesterday, before he gave it the go-ahead, that it must be made clear that … it is a joint operation,” he said. “It is not targeting any religion, nor is it simply in the name of one religion or another.”A day before the Sokoto strikes, a Christmas Eve suicide bombing at a mosque in north-east Nigeria killed at least five people and left more than 30 seriously injured. The Nigerian army attributed the attack to the jihadist group Boko Haram, which has waged an insurgency in the region for almost two decades, mostly separate to the violence in the north-west.There have been almost 6,000 incidents of violence in Nigeria in 2025, about half of them attacks targeting civilians, according toArmed Conflict Location & Event Data, a non-profit conflict monitor. The state of Katsina, another Muslim-majority state two states to the east of Sokoto, had the highest number of incidents at 706. Sokoto had the fourth highest, 353.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaUS foreign policyUS militaryTrump administrationUS politicsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He is now living in exile in Spain.As far as is known, no prominent opposition figures who had been detained, nor the 17-year-old Méndez, are among the 99 allegedly released, a group that does include at least three other teenagers.“The selective and discretionary nature of these releases confirms that deprivation of liberty has been used as an instrument of political persecution,” said the NGO Justicia, Encuentro y Perdón in astatement.The NGO acknowledged the “positive impact” of the measure on the lives of those freed, but said it was “clearly insufficient” given that hundreds of political prisoners remain, with estimates ranging from 900 to 1,000.The Committee for the Freedom of Social Fighters and Political Prisonerssaidmost of those released would remain under “conditional” liberty, subject to precautionary measures such as travel bans, regular court appearances and restrictions on speaking to the media about their cases.The committee and other groups alsosaidthey had not yet independently verified that the number of people released was 99, suggesting it may have been lower.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroCaribbeanAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, Braeburn in the Yukon recorded -55.7C, its coldest December temperature since 1975.Meanwhile, Mayo and Dawson endured 16 consecutive nights below -40C, with Mayo plunging to -50.4C on Monday. Whitehorse also recorded 10 nights when temperatures dropped below -30C.Atmospheric rivers – what to know about the storms inundating the Pacific north-westRead moreThe deep freeze spread farther south over the festive period. On Christmas Day, overnight temperatures in Edmonton fell below -28C, while Boxing Day was expected to bring lows of at least -20C across many regions, including Edmonton, Montreal, Ottawa and Quebec.The severe cold is forecast to persist into the new year. Officials have warned that the Yukon could face electricity outages in the coming days, as the territory’s power grid comes under strain from record-high energy demand.The prolonged chill has been caused by the polar vortex remaining anchored over Canada for much of December, allowing bitter Arctic air to spill south. Next week, the cold air mass is expected to retreat north gradually, enabling milder Pacific air to move across the US and into parts of southern Canada.In stark contrast, parts of the US experienced their warmest Christmas Day on record as temperatures soared about 15-30C above the seasonal average. In many areas, conditions felt more typical of April or May than late December.Several states set Christmas Day temperature records. In Oklahoma, Oklahoma City hit 25C on Tuesday, surpassing the previous peak of 22C set in 1982. Cities including Austin and Dallas, in Texas, and Charlotte, North Carolina, were also among those that recorded temperatures above 25C.Above-average warmth is expected to continue through Boxing Day and the days ahead, with unseasonable heat forecast to sweep into the south-eastern states later in the week.The warmth has been fuelled by a strong upper-level ridge extending from the desert south-west towards the north and east, creating a heat-dome effect. This pattern establishes a broad area of high pressure across much of the continent, trapping warm air near the surface. As air sinks through the atmosphere, it compresses and heats further, allowing unusually warm temperatures to build.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasWinteranalysisShareReuse this content"

He has consistently denied wrongdoing in the scandal, which dented Malaysia’s image abroad.Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah, who was presiding, convicted Najib, 72, on all four counts of abuse of power. The former PM will also face a verdict on 21 counts of money laundering linked to the fund, which prompted investigations in several countries, from Singapore to the US.The judge said in his verdict: “The contention by the accused that the charges against him were a witch-hunt and politically motivated were debunked by the cold, hard and incontrovertible evidence against him that pointed towards the accused having abused his own powerful position in 1MDB, coupled with the extensive powers conferred upon him.”Malaysian and US investigators say at least $4.5bn was stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a state fund Najib co-founded in 2009 while in office. More than $1bn allegedly made its way into accounts linked to Najib, who has denied wrongdoing.The ruling could add to tensions in the prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim’s, governing alliance, which includes the once dominant United Malays National Organisation, over which Najib, its former leader, has retained significant influence.Najib hasbeen in prison since August 2022, when Malaysia’s top court upheld a corruption conviction for illegally receiving funds from a 1MDB unit. His 12-year jail sentence in that case was halved last year by a pardons board.Najib is the son of one of the country’s founding fathers and was groomed for leadership from a young age until his spectacular fall from power. He had been seen as untouchable until public anger over the 1MDB corruption scandal led to the 2018 election defeat of his ruling party, which had governed since Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957.Prosecutors say Najib abused his positions as prime minister, finance minister and 1MDB advisory board chair to move large amounts of money from the fund into his personal accounts more than a decade ago.According to investigators, proceeds from the state fund were used to bankroll high-end real estate, a luxury yacht and precious artworks.Najib has repeatedly said he was misled by 1MDB officials and the fugitive financier Jho Low, who has been charged in the US for his central role in the case. Low, whose whereabouts are unknown, has denied wrongdoing.The judge dismissed several of the defence lawyers’ arguments, including that Najib was duped by Low, his close associate. He also dismissed arguments that the money flowing into Najib’s accounts was “donations” from Middle East funders, calling it a “tale that surpassed even those from the Arabian Nights”.The prosecution presented bank records, testimony from more than 50 witnesses and documentary evidence.Najib “paints himself as a victim of rogue subordinates, when in truth, he was the single most powerful decision maker”, the deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib told the court during closing arguments. “The accused wielded absolute financial, executive and political control,” he said.Najib has apologised for allowing the 1MDB scandal to happen during his tenure, but maintains he knew nothing about illegal transfers from the fund.His legal battle was dealt a blow on Monday after he lost an application to serve the remainder of his first jail term at home rather than the Kajang prison, outside Kuala Lumpur.Agence France-Presse, Reuters and Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsNajib RazakMalaysia1MDBAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the largest weapons sale in the history of the bilateral relationship.China’s stance onTaiwan, which is that it must merge with the People’s Republic of China – something that the democratically governed Taipei rejects – has been a pinch point in its relations with the US, already worn thin over trade and tariff issues.Individuals on the Chinese sanctions list, including the founder of the defence firm Anduril Industries and nine senior executives from the sanctioned firms, are banned from entering China, the ministry added.Boeing produces fighter jets in St Louis, where more than 3,000 union workerswent on strikeover pay this year. Other companies targeted by the sanctions include Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation and L3Harris Maritime Services.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement on Friday: “The Taiwan issue is the core of China’s core interests and the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations. Any provocative actions that cross the line on the Taiwan issue will be met with a strong response from China.” They urged the US to cease “dangerous” efforts to arm the island.The US is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, although such arms sales are a persistent source of friction with China.The eight arms agreements that comprised the total sale included 420 army tactical missile systems, or Atacms. The systems are similar to those sent to Ukraine under the Biden administration for its defence against Russia.The state department said at the time of the Taiwan arms sale that it served “US national, economic and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernise its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability”.“The proposed sale[s] will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region,” various similar statements issued on each of the agreements said.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsChinaTaiwanArms tradeBoeingTrump administrationUS foreign policyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The increase comes in the fourth year of Japan’s five-year program to double its annual arms spending to 2% of GDP.The budget plan focuses on fortifying strike-back capability and coastal defences with surface-to-ship missiles and unmanned arsenals. To defend the coasts, Japan will spend ¥100bn yen to deploy “massive” unmanned air, sea-surface and underwater drones for surveillance and defence under a system called “Shield” planned for March 2028, defence ministry officials said.Japan PM fails to achieve breakthrough in row with China – but polling shows public backs herRead moreThe budget boost comes amidescalating hostilitiesbetween the Chinese and Japanese governments. Beijing has consistently objected to Japan’s strengthening defensiveness, but relations imploded last month when Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, said Japanwould probably become militarily involvedif China attacked Taiwan as part of Beijing’s plans to annex the territory.Takaichi’s remarks sparked a furious reaction from Beijing,which launched a rangeof diplomatic and economic retaliatory moves. Takaichirefused to withdraw her comments, and the government has maintained they represented no change to Japan’s defence policies.Chinese government officials have continued to publicly rail against Tokyo, seizing on any military-related announcement.On Thursday China’s defence ministry told a regular press briefing that Japan’s recent space technology developments – some of which are in cooperation with the US – were “accelerating the weaponisation and militarisation of space, and fuelling a space arms race”.Tokyo has launched several rockets since March 2023, carrying cargo spacecraft and satellites for GPS systems and intelligence gathering, according to Japanese media.“Given that Japan’s vicious militarists once launched sneak attacks and that the country is now taking an offensive space policy, it is hardly surprising that there are growing concerns of another Pearl Harbor scenario,” defence ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang said on Sunday.Japan’s postwar constitution forbids it from using force as a means of settling international disputes but a2015 amendment– passed when Takaichi’s mentor, Shinzo Abe, was prime minister – permits it to exercise collective self-defence in certain situations, even if it is not directly under attack.Japan’s current security strategy identifies China as the country’s biggest strategic challenge and calls for a more assertive role in its security cooperations with the US.On Thursday, China’s defence ministry also blasted the US over its continued support for Taiwan, a week after it approved amassive US arms sale to Taipeiof more than $10bn. The US doesn’t recognise Taiwan diplomatically but is Taiwan’s most significant supporter in resisting Chinese annexation threats, and is mandated under US law to provide it with the means to defend itself.Last week the US senate also passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes authorisation to spend up to $1bn in 2026 on Taiwan-related security cooperation.Zhang accused the US of “emboldening Taiwan independence” activity and undermining peace and stability.China is in the midst of a years-long overhaul and modernisation of its military, geared in large part towards being able to take Taiwan by force. Beijing claims Taiwan is a province that must be “reunified” with the mainland, but an overwhelming majority of Taiwan’s people reject the prospect. Its rapidly growing navy and air force are venturing further out beyond their borders, and have been involved in multiple incidents with other militaries.Earlier this month Chinese aircraftlocked their radaron Japanese aircraft during drills near south-western Japan, prompting Tokyo to protest. Locking radar is considered one of the most threatening acts a military aircraft can take because it signals a potential attack, forcing the targeted aircraft to take evasive action.Zhang said China’s defence expenditure was reasonable and moderate, and its activities were “fully in compliance with international law”.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsJapanChinaTaiwanAsia PacificUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

However, the junta’s most important ally,China, which has helped the military claw back from the brink on the battlefield, is backing the election, which is being held in three phases. Commentators say that China views the vote as the country’s best path back to stability.View image in fullscreenPeople inspect their damaged home after bombardments carried out by Myanmar’s military in Tabayin on 6 December.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesAnalysis shows the conflict has only intensified over the past year. From 1 January to 28 November 2025, military air and drone strikes increased by about 30% compared with 2024, according toAcled, which tracks conflicts around the world. Civic infrastructure such as schools and medical facilities have been hit in near-daily strikes. This month,dozens were killed in a military strikeon a hospital in Rakhine state, which is mostly controlled by the Arakan Army, an opponent of the military.Conscription-related abductions increased by 26% compared with 2024, with the militarysnatching people from the streets and their homesand forcing them to serve, in a desperate attempt to boost their dwindling ranks.Young people who have the means to do so have fled military-controlled areas such as the former capital Yangon, fearing they could be forced to serve.‘Sham elections’There is such intense paranoia among Myanmar’s ruling military that a new election protection law has been passed, under which any criticism of the election can lead to a minimum sentence of three years in prison, and even the death penalty. Since July more than 200 people have already been arrested, including for merely liking social media posts criticising the vote. In cities such as Yangon residents report the authorities going door-to-door instructing people to vote. People may have little choice but to obey, activists say.“Everybody knows well how this military is ruthless and will continue to be very ruthless. Anyone who’s seen as disapproving of the junta’s sham election are at a very high risk,” says Khin Ohmar, a pro-democracy activist who lives in exile, citing the use of repressive laws to arrest those who criticise the vote or the military’s rule.Revealed: Myanmar junta ‘crony’ given key role behind Fifa peace prizeRead moreThere will be 57 parties on the ballot on Sunday, but the majority are perceived as being linked to or dependent on the military. Analysts say they create only the illusion of choice, but do not represent any true opposition to military rule. Only six parties are running at a nationwide level, including the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development party, which has fielded the largest number of candidates and is effectively running uncontested in dozens of constituencies.Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy, whichwon a landslide victory in the 2020 election, was dissolved after it refused to comply with a demand to register with the junta-backed Union Election Commission. Dozens of ethnic parties were also dissolved. According to election monitoring group Anfrel, 57% of the parties that ran in the 2020 general election no longer exist, even though they received more than 70% of votes and 90% of seats.Large strips of territory will be excluded from the elections, illustrating how much ground the junta has lost since the coup – even as it has regained momentum on the battlefield.The military has said there will be no voting in 56 of 330 townships. Voting has also been cancelled in an additional 3,000 wards and village tracts, with analysts estimating about a third of the country will be excluded from the vote.Many areas are in the midst of intense fighting, or under the control of opposition groups. The country has been locked in a fierce conflict since the 2021 coup, when the militaryimprisoned then de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyiand opened fire on protesters calling for the return of democracy.Communities took up arms and formed people’s defence forces to fight against military atrocities, while older, ethnic armed groups that have long fought for independence also launched attacks, leaving the military desperately overstretched. Despite relentless airstrikes and violence that UN experts have described as likely war crimes, thejunta lost vast areas of territory along its borders. Some began to speculate the military could even be overthrown.Support from Beijing has allowed the generals to fight back. China, which feared even greater instability were the junta to collapse, cut off cross-border supplies to some of the military’s most formidable enemies in northern Shan state. Two of these powerful ethnic armed groups, the TNLA and MNDAA, handed territory back.The military, freed up to fight elsewhere, has also adapted its tactics, enforcing mandatory conscription, making better use of drones and reforming its chain of command to allow it to deploy airstrikes more quickly.In the run-up to the election, it has intensified its bombardments, seeking to cement its power in areas where it plans to hold voting. That is unlikely to ease after the vote, said Richard Horsey, senior Myanmar adviser at the Crisis Group.The military may seek to agree to ceasefires with some groups after the election, he said, but any such deals will be tactical in nature, to give the military respite in certain areas so that it can target its force elsewhere.“They are determined to continue pressing their advantage and clawing back as much of the territory that they’ve lost since the coup as possible,” said Horsey. “This isn’t about a new civilian government shifting to a more soft approach.”Explore more on these topicsMyanmarChinaMyanmar coupSouth and central AsiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Apart from being exhausted and cold they were not physically injured, police said.In a statement released through police, the pair said they wanted to express their sincere thanks to everyone who was involved in their rescue.“We are so grateful for the outcome but still trying to come to terms with how quickly a beautiful, carefree afternoon turned into an almost tragedy,” they said.“We are exhausted, very shaken and feel so lucky we were able to stay together. We commend the efforts of all the agencies involved.“The decisive and quick action led not only to our rescue, but our survival. Thank you so much.”In another Christmas Day incident, police said they were called to Lake King in Paynesville following reports a kayaker was in trouble about 1.30pm.Police said officers were told the man was seen struggling before his kayak rolled and had not been seen for about two hours.Water police, air wing and the coast guard searched for the Hoppers Crossing man, who was spotted by the police helicopter just before 3pm, picked up by the coast guard and returned unharmed to shore, police said.Police said they were also called out to Westernport Bay after a mother and her two teenage daughters got into difficulty while kayaking near the Corinella jetty about 2.10pm.The trio had attempted to retrieve an adrift kayak when the current and strong winds swept them a significant distance from shore, police said. They were all wearing lifejackets.The woman and girls had ended up about 1km from the shore line and police said local officers coordinated with the Westpac rescue helicopter to winch them to safety.They were dropped back to Corinella without injury, police said.Explore more on these topicsMelbourneVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

He is known to frequent Melbourne’s inner southern and northern suburbs,” the statement said.“Detectives are treating this arson as a targeted attack but there is no indication that Argento poses as a specific risk to the Jewish community.”No one was inside the car at the time of the incident but the occupants of the house were evacuated as a precaution, police said.The Victoria police assistant commissioner for the southern metro region, Chris Gilbert, said at this stage he did not believe there was a broader threat to the Jewish community.“We understand the devastating impact this type of [alleged] offence has on our Jewish community and we are continuing to prioritise this investigation,” he said.The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, said on Thursday she had been briefed by police on the St Kilda incident.“This is not what any family, street or community deserves to wake up to on Christmas Day in Australia,” she said on X.“We have a duty to this community: to ensure their families are safe and feel safe right now, and to work long-term in a serious effort to drive anti-Semitism and hate out of our state.”The incident comes less than two weeks after 15 people were killed in a mass shooting that targeted Jews celebrating the holiday of Hanukah at Sydney’s Bondi beach.The state Liberal MP David Southwick, who represents the Caulfield electorate in which the suspected arson occurred, said he had been in touch with the affected family since the incident.“It’s a harrowing experience for anyone to have to go through this,” he said.Southwick reiterated his calls for Victoria to follow New South Wales in recalling parliament to passlegislation restricting protests and strengthening vilification laws.The Minns Labor government in NSW recalled parliament this week to pass the laws, whereas the Victorian parliament is not scheduled to return until 2026.“Every day delayed puts the Jewish community and broader Victorian community at risk,” Southwick said. “What are we waiting until February for?”Explore more on these topicsVictoriaMelbourneAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

It grew out of the country’s deeply corrupt state infrastructure and became indispensable both to those seeking to exploit the system and to those trying to expose it.For a modest fee – sometimes as little as $10 – buyers can obtain passport numbers, home addresses, travel histories, car registrations and internal police records. At the higher end, entire dossiers could be purchased on individuals, including metadata on calls and movements.Probiv, whose use remains controversial among Russian journalists, have underpinned high-profileinvestigations, including tracing the FSB state security unit behind the poisoning of Alexei Navalny.It also served the police and security services themselves, who routinely used the black market to track activists, opposition figures and anyone who fell outside the state’s favour.“It is one of the paradoxes of modern Russia: on the one hand, these services are illegal and rely on leaked data, yet on the other, they are far more convenient for day-to-day police work than the multitude of official departmental databases,” said Andrei Zakharov, an investigative journalist who recentlypublished a book onprobiv.But as the war inUkrainestretched into its fourth year, the Kremlin began to viewprobivless as a tolerated convenience and more as a threat.Phone scam syndicateswere using leaked data on an industrial scale, while Ukrainian intelligence had learned to exploit the country’s porous information landscape to identify and assassinate military officials inside Russia.During his annual phone-in with the nation last year, PresidentVladimir Putinhimself admitted that a close friend had fallen victim to a phone scam.That incident, said Zakharov, was the signal for security services to start closing down on theprobivmarket. Over the past year, Putin has signed laws tightening penalties for data leaks, imposing up to 10 years in prison for accessing or distributing such information.The security services have also begun an aggressive hunt forprobivoperators, detaining several brokers and targeting the infrastructure they rely on. Among the most high-profile arrests was of the team behind Usersbox, one of the widest-used and cheapest services.Russia using criminal networks to drive increase in sabotage acts, says EuropolRead moreBut the Kremlin’s war onprobivappears to have had the opposite effect, Zakharov said. Many of the leadingprobivoperators and brokers have moved their businesses abroad where they are far less constrained by informal deals with the security services or fear of immediate arrest.“Before, they still worked with the security services, or would think twice before releasing something extremely sensitive. Now all their brakes are off,” Zakharov said. “They’re dumping one sensitive leak after another.”He cited last year’s massive FSB database known as Kordon-2023, which was leaked online, containing details of people who had crossed Russia’s borders between 2014 and 2023. Zakharov described it as one of the largest and most consequential leaks to date.Well-known services such as Himera, which had been known to cooperate with the authorities, have changed course: the group said it had cut off law-enforcement access and relocated all its staff.Ukrainian hackers have joined in. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion, pro-Ukrainian hackers and other intelligence groups have repeatedly breached Russian state and commercial systems, stealing data and releasing it openly – often for free, and largely for ideological reasons.Last year, the Ukrainian hacker group KibOrg published online a database belonging to clients of Alfa Bank, Russia’s largest private commercial bank.The leak allegedly contained personal data on roughly 24 million individuals and more than 13m organisations.“Taken together,” Zakharov said, “it has never been easier to find private Russian data on the market.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Only one was willing to go on the record, but several others expressed similar opinions.Valente was described as brilliant and competitive, but willing to help his colleagues out. He finished top of his class, with an average grade of 19 out of 20, an unusually high score for Técnico. Loureiro, who was said to be an excellent student but more easygoing than Valente, finished with an average grade of 16 out of 20.Classmates say that, at the time, the two men appeared socially well adjusted.View image in fullscreenThe MIT professor Nuno FG Loureiro was killed last week.Photograph: Jake Belcher/APNuno Morais, 48, now a researcher at the Gulbenkian Institute for Molecular Medicine in Lisbon, said he and his fellow classmates, shaken by the news of Loureiro’s killing, had been “racking their brains” for any signs that something was wrong.“Having known Cláudio and having had a good relationship with him, we can’t find any other explanation than a serious mental health problem – exacerbated by resentment for not having achieved the academic career he dreamed of,” he said.Soon after his graduation in Lisbon, Valente enrolled at Brown University as a promising young doctoral student of physics, but dropped out after a few months in early 2001 and returned to Portugal to work as a programmer for an internet provider.Loureiro studied at Imperial College London and then Princeton University, later working at the UK’s Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. He joined MIT in 2016 as a professor of nuclear science and engineering, eventually becoming the director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center at the institute.Valente and Loureiro’s classmates said they suspected that the highly competitive atmosphere of academia may have taken a mental toll.“I don’t remember any specific situations directly involving Nuno and Cláudio during our graduate degree, but the culture in these schools remains the same – a hyper-competitive environment where students who struggle are humiliated and made to feel they can only succeed if they are the best of the best,” said Morais.View image in fullscreenA memorial for the shooting victims at Brown University.Photograph: Taylor Coester/ReutersAccording to his peers, Valente was crushed by his failure to complete his PhD.Morais said: “The only connection I can make with Cláudio’s trajectory and what happened was his disappointment with the experience at Brown. Those of us who work in academia dream of pursuing a PhD at a major American university. Cláudio aspired to have a brilliant academic career, comparable to Nuno’s, and this dream was prematurely destroyed, generating frustration.” .He said his current work included mentoring and supporting students, which had made him aware of how normalised emotional distress and high pressure are in academia. He said that over the years higher-education institutions such as MIT and Caltech had taken steps to relieve student pressure because of high suicide rates. Portugal lags on this matter, he said.“Portuguese schools now have therapist offices to assist students, but there’s a great delay in fighting bullying and harassment inside the institutions. The prevailing culture is still one in which senior figures behave in ways that are prejudicial to mental health and that continues to be tolerated. Tragedies like this should prompt us to think very carefully,” Morais said.My daughter was in the Brown University library, hiding under the desk | Sarah RuhlRead moreA spokesperson for Técnico said the school was not aware of any connection between the shootings and Valente and Loureiro’s time at the university.“From what we have been reading in the media, they seemed to have a normal, collegial relationship. We are unable to see how something that happened 30 years ago can be connected to what happened now, but the school is going to come together to reflect and discuss,” they said.Valente returned to the US in 2017 through the diversity lottery immigrant visa programme and was granted a green card. He was living in Miami.On Friday morning, after Valente was found dead in a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, announced she had paused the visa scheme under Trump’s direction to “ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous programme”.“This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” she wrote in her social media statement.Such comments, and the Trump administration’s subsequent move to further narrow the pathways to legal immigration using the crime as a pretext, caused outrage among Valente and Loureiro’s peers.Morais said: “[This puts] the focus of the problem in the wrong place. Access to weapons and the hyper-competitive culture of some universities are closer to the root causes of these shootings than migration.”Explore more on these topicsBrown University shootingMIT - Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyPortugalEuropeBostonMassachusettsHigher educationnewsShareReuse this content"

Its most popular event, the Tuesday lectures, gets about 1,000 people each week.Recent Stockholm lectures have included “The art of awarding Nobel prizes” by a former member of a Nobel committee, “Disinformation and AI – the threat we invented ourselves” and “From soap to cultural heritage/canon and vice versa.”Inga Sanner, chair of Senioruniversitetet in Stockholm, said membership nationally was at an all-time high. “We had a dip during the pandemic, of course, but we have come up again to the same number and increased even more. Our membership is the highest ever.”In 2023 there were 2,099 events held across Sweden attended by 161,932 participants, according to Folkuniversitetet. This year, that number is projected to increase to 177,024 participants across 2,391 events.Gunnar Danielsson, secretary general of Folkuniversitetet, said: “The desire to learn for pleasure’s sake, or for the sake of learning as such, is a joy to experience in a society which is increasingly obsessed with learning and education as preparation for work.”The increasing popularity of Senioruniversitetet was not reflected by the level of government funding, though, he said, which had “significantly decreased” over the past few years. “More likely it reflects a desire to actually meet other people in real life rather than on the internet.”Sanner, a retired history professor, said older people were “more and more alert” and that there is a “fantastic hunger for education”. She added: “It’s totally fascinating that there are so many who want to learn more and learn more about the world. It is so very needed in our time.”The wider societal role that Senioruniversitetet plays is becoming increasingly important, she said, and the learning and wellbeing of its members has a knock-on effect to their families and beyond.“It is to do with democracy issues and education. Senior citizens don’t live in a vacuum. If nothing else, it has an effect on children and grandchildren,” she said. “You are an example. Not just sitting rocking in a rocking chair, but you are out and want to learn more. Then you can share that with your grandchildren and children.”She added: “The lectures are fantastic. You become completely fulfilled when you have been to an event and then it bubbles over when you meet others.”For many of their volunteers, their office in central Stockholm is like a workplace. “It is very meaningful work, but also you have such a lovely time and meet others.”Sanner said the demographic of its membership does, however, tend to be “too homogenous”, adding that they need to do more to extend their reach to a more diverse audience.Susanne Abelin, 66, a former journalist from Norrtälje, near Stockholm, volunteers on the university’s newsletter and is learning Italian.Ageism is rife in Sweden, she said, and palpable in day-to-day life. “You are seen more or less as an idiot. Maybe it’s because we have had it so materially well over generations that we don’t need each other so much – for good and for bad.”But Senioruniversitetet, where over-55s can learn for a relatively low fee, is “a bit of the Swedish welfare system that is still left”.Her Italian class has a WhatsApp group so they can stay in touch outside lessons and last year she went to Italy with one of her classmates. “I’m absolutely not fluent in Italian and will never be, but it is inspiring and it keeps your mind alert. Instead of doing crosswords and suduko you can study some verbs.”Joachim Forsgren, 71, a former physician who now volunteers for the Stockholm branch, has given lectures on “man and drugs” and tuberculosis.Volunteering, he said, gives people a “sense of meaning and that they are contributing still”. He added: “People can get the feeling that they are not contributing once they leave their jobs. Pensioners is a word I hate.”By volunteering, he said, “we are contributing to some kind of democracy project. This is really trying, especially in this day and age, to get people interested in what is going on”. Amid the rise of online disinformation and populism, the university helps people to “look critically at the amount of information we are almost drowning in every day”.Explore more on these topicsSwedenEuropeOlder peopleAgeingnewsShareReuse this content"

Israel says that helps to locate militant infrastructure and prevent future attacks. Rights watchdogs say such actions are collective punishment.The Israeli military said it was “preparing for an operation” in the area.The Israeli ambulance service confirmed a man and woman were pronounced dead at the scene after medics were unable to resuscitate them. A teenager was also hurt in the attack, they said.An Israeli reservist soldier was meanwhile reportedly under house arrest on Friday after he rammed his vehicle into a Palestinian man who was praying on a roadside in the occupied West Bank on Thursday.The reservist acted “in severe violation of his authority” and his weapon had been confiscated and his service terminated, the Israeli military said. The man who was rammed was checked in hospital, but was unhurt and was now at home.More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank between 7 October 2023 and 17 October 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some during settler violence, according to the UN. During the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks.Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaWest BankPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

Officials in Saudi Arabia have not so far commented.Two weeks ago, the STC – a longstanding voice calling forYemento return to the pre-1990 settlement of a Yemen divided into north and south – entered the two large, oil-rich provinces in the south not yet under its control.The capture of the huge governorates of Hadramaut and al-Mahra, the province bordering Oman, occurred without much sign of resistance, as the Hadramaut forces retreated in the face of well-armed STC troops.Since then, the Saudi-backed and UN-recognised elements in Yemen’s divided southern government have been trying to mount a political and diplomatic counteroffensive against “STC unilateralism”, arguing that there is no support across the south for the STC’s call for separation from the north.European countries and Gulf states such as Kuwait and Qatar, as well as the Arab League secretary general, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, have called for Yemen to remain a unified country – backing the Saudi position – but the US has said little so far.Europe has voiced concerns that fractures within the south would divert energy away from the struggle to oustthe Houthis, who have run the north of Yemen since 2015, including the former capital, Sana’a.The STC said the UN-recognised government had done little to take the battle to theHouthis, and that a separated, cohesive south would be a more effective bulwark against the Iranian-backed Houthis, and would be better equipped to protect the ports along Yemen’s southern coast.There were demonstrations on Thursday in the south-western port city of Aden calling for the STC president, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, to declare independence, a step he is considering.On Thursday, the Saudi ministry of foreign affairs issued a conciliatory but firm statement calling for the STC to withdraw and to reopen negotiations with the remnants of the UN-recognised government. Riyadh said unilateral acts harmed the integrity of Yemen, and it insisted it “had prioritised preserving unity and making every effort to reach peaceful solutions to resolve the situation in both governorates”.It added: “The kingdom remains hopeful that the public interest will prevail through ending the escalation by the Southern Transitional Council and the withdrawal of its forces from the two governorates in an urgent and orderly manner. The kingdom stresses the importance of cooperation among all Yemeni factions and components to exercise restraint and avoid any measures that could destabilise security and stability, which may result in undesirable consequences.”In response, the UAE put out a brief statement commending Saudi Arabia’s role “in serving the interests of the Yemeni people and fulfilling their legitimate aspirations for stability and prosperity”.It did not endorse the call for the STC to withdraw, but private discussions over the political preconditions necessary for a withdrawal have been held.Most observers do not believe the STC could survive without UAE military and political endorsement. If the UAE does not, publicly or privately, withdraw its reassurances to back the STC, then the UAE and Saudi Arabia face a major confrontation.Explore more on these topicsYemenMiddle East and north AfricaHouthisSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesnewsShareReuse this content"

Over the next 14 years, he performed more than 400 shows, playing on some of the band’s best-known tracks, such as Friday I’m in Love, High and A Letter to Elise.Bamonte, who was born in September 1960 in London, left the Cure in 2005 after the band was reconfigured as a trio.

He will be very greatly missed.”Bamonte was also the bass player in supergroup Love Amongst Ruin, alongside former Placebo drummer Steve Hewitt and Julian Cope collaborator Donald Ross Skinner.

At the same time, the number of nurses and midwives joining the NHShas fallen sharplyover the past year.Dickson is the chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents the professional interests of the UK and Ireland’s 220,000 doctors, including GPs, surgeons, anaesthetists and A&E specialists.She said that without the contribution of foreign doctors and nurses the NHS “could quite easily fall over” and find itself without “a critical mass of people there to run the service safely”.Foreign-born doctors and nurses were being put off by antagonism by politicians towards migrants, media coverage of immigration, the racist abuse of international medical graduates by NHS colleagues and racist aggression by patients toward minority ethnic NHS staff, she said.“My feeling is we are creating a culture where the rhetoric is ‘foreigner bad’. If you have never visited Britain and are looking at our media, the social media, press media, print media, what our politicians are reported as saying, I think that it’s not unreasonable to see that as a hostile environment,” Dickson, an NHS consultant clinical oncologist, told the Guardian.“Because [foreign health staff] see Britain retreating from Europe, ‘we can go it alone’. They see attacks on synagogues, they see anti-Muslim protests. They see the rhetoric that immigration is bad, [that] immigration is a major problem for the country.“Why would you go somewhere where people are going, ‘we don’t need you, we don’t want you’? For them that makes Britain appear unwelcoming, racist. The prevalence of it [hostility to migrants] is significantly more [than] 10 years ago.”While the NHS has relied on overseas staff since its creation in 1948, this dependence has reached its greatest extent. For example, 42% of all UK doctors qualified abroad,General Medical Council (GMC) figures show.The atmosphere in the UK towards migrants is now so unpleasant that some foreign-born NHS staff feel unsafe in their everyday lives, Dickson added.Selina Douglas, the chief executive of the Whittington health trust in London, told a public meeting last month that hospital and community-based staff were experiencing a rise in racism.Referring to overseas nurses who have worked here for 25 years, Douglas said: “Those staff are being racially abused in our hospital. I have had staff spat at walking up the hill [from the tube station].”In a warning to abusive patients, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said last month that “your right to access free healthcare in this country does not come with the freedom to abuse our staff on any grounds”. However, it is unclear what action NHS trusts or the police take against abuse by patients.Workforce data collected by the GMC and theNursingand Midwifery Council show that more and more foreign medical and nursing graduates are “voting with their feet” by either not coming to the UK or leaving to work elsewhere, Dickson said.She voiced her concerns at the end of a year in which Streeting has said NHS staff areoften the targets of an increasingly overt “1970s, 1980s-style racism”and an NHS trust leader expressed alarm that Black and Asian staff visiting patients’ homes had been “deliberately intimidated”by the placing of England flags.She claimed that the Labour government was partly to blame for doctors deciding not to come to Britain because it was prioritising UK medical graduates over those who qualified overseas in the allocation of places in specialist medical training. This is a key issue alongside pay in theresident doctors disputein England between ministers and the British Medical Association.That may prove shortsighted, Dickson suggested, given that there was a global shortage of doctors, who can earn more money and enjoy easier working lives outside the UK.She added: “You have a population who have retreated from internationalism through Brexit. There is a secretary of state who is also saying ‘we would prioritise UK graduates for jobs’.“There’s always been a cohort [of doctors] who’ve gone back to their country of origin or another country. More worryingly to me [is] the number of overseas graduates who wanted to enter the country is diminishing as well. And I think that’s partly about the prioritisation argument that’s being pushed forward.“Doctors have a lot of portable skills, as do nurses. There’s an international shortage [of both]. If the country is not looking as welcoming, or people don’t feel as safe, and Canada, Australia and New Zealand are opening their doors more, then I find it unsurprising that people are leaving.”Anti-migrant sentiment expressed by unnamed politicians could prompt so many overseas staff to quit that the NHS “could quite easily fall over”, she warned.“If we have significant outward migration, and continue with the rhetoric nationally that immigration is bad and also ‘we’re prioritising UK graduates’, then I do worry about us coming to a point of not having a critical mass of people there to run the service safely.”She said Keir Starmer, the prime minister, and Streeting should make clear to the public that foreign-born frontline NHS doctors and nurses were welcome because “they provide an invaluable service to patients but also to the NHS and their colleagues, because without them we’d all be completely snowed under. The ones who are already in the UK, we absolutely need to make them feel welcome and go out of our way to make them feel welcome”.Responding to Dickson’s remarks, a spokesperson for the Department ofHealthand Social Care said: “The NHS benefits hugely from its international staff, and we’ll continue to support and attract talented overseas staff who want to dedicate their time, energy and skills to the health service.“Discrimination against patients and staff alike undermines everything our health service stands for – and the NHS has a zero tolerance for racism.”They added: “However, a failure to train enough medical professionals has left us reliant on international recruitment to plug the gaps. It’s only right that British taxpayers should see a return on the investment they make in training homegrown medical talent which is why our 10-year health plan commits to prioritising UK medical graduates and others who have worked in the NHS for significant periods for speciality training roles.”Explore more on these topicsNHSDoctorsNursingHealthImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

Of the people who were rescued, two were checked by paramedics and one was taken by ambulance to hospital as a precaution.In a statement posted on Upham’s Instagram account, his family said: “Our family is heartbroken by the loss of our beloved family member Matthew Upham, who was reported missing on Christmas morning.“Matthew is deeply loved and will be forever missed.“We would like to express our sincere and heartfelt thanks to the emergency services who responded, particularly the RNLI and coastguard, for their dedication, professionalism, and tireless efforts during this extremely difficult time.“We are profoundly grateful for their compassion and support.As we grieve and support one another, we kindly ask that our family’s privacy is respected.“We thank everyone for their understanding, kindness, and condolences.”Upham, from Budleigh Salterton, ran an antiques business called Matthew Upham Antiques in the Devon town.A coastguard search for the two men has been called off.On Boxing Day, police said both men were still missing. A spokesperson added: “Police inquiries are ongoing. A police presence remains at the scene.”The coastguard stopped searching the water at 5pm but police said onshore inquiries continued into the evening.

After extensive shoreline and offshore searches, the coastguard part of the search was stood down at 5pm.”Julia Robb, a resident who had been watching swimmers at the beach before the men went missing, said it had been a “very cold and windy” day and the waves “would have been at least 6ft”. She said it was only when she heard helicopters it became clear something was wrong.Robb added: “It was a sad thing to happen on what had been such a positive morning. I just feel sorry for those who have been affected. I think it will be shocking for the whole community. We are a small town. People are very friendly.

Minor’s girlfriend allegedly helped the men order the Lyft ride, prosecutors said.When the driver attempted to drop the men off at their location, the men attacked her, wrapping a rope around her neck and dragging her to the backseat.The driver later told police that the men threatened to rape and kill her during the 10-hour trip to Florida.Charles, Minor and Yohannes then used the woman’s credit cards and bank information to rent a property in Miramar, Florida, a suburb of Miami. The men also used the driver’s car while in the area. Police tracked down the trio’s whereabouts using license plate readers, which allow law enforcement to search for wanted vehicles.All three men were later arrested. The driver was rescued from the rental property, records state, and was examined for injuries.The trio’s escape was discovered on Sunday during a standard security check.Temetris Atkins, chief deputy of DeKalb county, told reporters on Tuesday that the men managed to escape through an older part of the jail.“We repaired the area that was compromised, and we’re looking at other areas that are similar to that to fortify them to make sure that they are not compromised in the same manner,” Atkins said.Phone records searched by police following the trio’s escape revealed that one of the men had been in touch with people outside to help them avoid arrest after their escape.Minor and Yohannes are both serving life sentences for murder charges, NBC reported. Charles is being detained on murder and armed robbery charges.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeUS prisonsGeorgiaFloridanewsShareReuse this content"

Weiss’s last-minute decision to hold the episode sparked outrage and charges of censorship amid Donald Trump’s second administration, though someconservative commentatorsgenerally aligned with the president have defended the move. In a private email sent to 60 Minutes correspondents that was subsequently made public, CBS correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, who spent weeks reporting the episode, called the decision a “political one”.In the memo to staff, Weiss acknowledged the uproar her decision had caused internally and externally – but she rejected the accusation that politics played a role in her determination to hold the segment.“Such editorial decisions can cause a firestorm, particularly on a slow news week,” Weiss wrote. “And the standards for fairness we are holding ourselves to, particularly on contentious subjects, will surely feel controversial to those used to doing things one way. But to fulfill our mission, it’s necessary.”Weiss has said she was concerned about the episode airing without a sufficient response from theTrump administration. But Alfonsi said it had been “screened five times” as well as cleared by CBS attorneys along with its standards and practices department. She also said her team had unsuccessfully requested comment from the White House, the US state department, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).“If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,” Alfonsi wrote.The episode has since appeared online, after it was published by a streaming platform owned by Global TV, the network that has the rights to 60 Minutes in Canada. In it, Alfonsi visits the prison in El Salvador and interviews deportees who offered powerful testimony about torture and abuse inside the notorious prison where the Trump administration had sent more than 200 Venezuelan migrants from the US in what a federal judge recently ruledwas a violation of their due process rights.CBS’s decision to hold the episode comes amid a widening feud between the Trump administration and 60 Minutes – one of journalism’s most venerated institutions known for hard-hitting investigations. During the 2024 election, Trump declined to sit for an interview with 60 Minutes, then sued the network over how the show handled an interview with his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. In a highly controversial move, Paramount, the parent company of CBS,agreed to pay Trump $16m to settle the lawsuit.Disgruntled NYT journalist to ‘anti-woke’ power grab: how far can Bari Weiss go?Read moreEarlier in December, Trump fumed on Truth Social that the network had treated him “far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before”.“If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!” the Republican added. A week earlier, he assailed the show for an interview with his ally turned critic, the outgoing Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom he called a “very poorly prepared Traitor”, and said of parent company Paramount: “THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP.”Weiss’s management of CBS has come under sharp scrutiny since she wasinstalled as CBS News’s editor-in-chiefby Paramount’s CEO, David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, a Trump ally and donor who is one of the world’s richest people. Paramountalso acquiredWeiss’s Free Press, the conservative-friendly publication she founded after leaving the New York Times as a columnist, in a reported $150m deal.Her appointment was met withfrustrationand concern by CBS’s editorial staff while media watchdogs questioned Weiss’s qualifications to lead the storied news network and raised concerns about further media politicization. Weiss, whobuilt a reputation as a provocative opinionwriter and media operator, has no experience working in broadcast television.Paramount is now waging an extraordinary hostile takeover bid to gain control ofWarner BrosDiscovery, which had reached a deal to sell its storied film and television properties to Netflix. Trump has made clear that he plans to be involved in the acquisition’s regulatory review process.Explore more on these topicsCBSUS television industryTelevision industryTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Kentucky’s governor, Andy Beshear, and Louisville’s mayor, Craig Greenberg, each confirmed that Rodriguez died on Thursday.“Alain is the 15th victim of the UPS Flight 2976 accident,” Greenbergwroteon X. “He suffered severe injuries at the time of the crash and passed earlier this Christmas Day.“May Alain’s memory be a blessing.”Death toll from UPS plane crash at Louisville airport rises to 13Read moreSeparately on X, BeshearcalledRodriguez’s death “tough news” while soliciting prayers for the loved of all those who were killed in the crash.“Let’s pray for these families today and in the days, months and years to come so they know they are not alone and they are loved.”Sean Garber, owner of Grade A Auto Parts & Recycling, told the Louisville news outletWavethat Rodriguez was the fourth of the company’s employees to die in the plane crash. Customers of Grade A were killed as well.A company newsletter cited byUSA Todaysaid Rodriguez worked at Grade A since 2023, developing a reputation for “always greeting customers with a smile, while going above and beyond for each”.Beside people on the ground, threepilotson UPS Flight 2976 died when the plane’s left engine detached as it departed Muhammad Ali international airport, home to the package delivery service’s largest hub. Terrifying video captured the MD-11 plane that was fully loaded with fuel for a trip to Hawaii as it barreled into businesses near the airport and erupted into a fireball.The National Transportation Safety Board later said that investigators found cracks where the plane’s engine connected to its wing.Four days after the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding of all MD-11s, which for more than a decade had been used exclusively to fly cargo.UPS in early December was met with a pair of wrongful death lawsuits that accused the company of continuing to fly older planes without stepping maintenance up beyond the regularly scheduled amount. The manufacturer of the plane’s detached engine, General Electric (GE), was also named as a defendant in those lawsuits.Both UPS and GE have said they do not comment on unresolved lawsuits but asserted that safety was their top priority as they assisted investigators scrutinizing the 4 November crash.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsKentuckyPlane crashesLouisvilleAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

US right champions psychedelic drugsTexas governor among those to call for expanded access to ibogaine, said to help with treating veterans with PTSDMattha BusbyFri 26 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 20.06 ESTShareFor half a century, psychedelics largely belonged to the cultural left: anti-war, anti-capitalist, suspicious of the church and state. Now, one of the most politically consequential psychedelic drugs in the US – ibogaine – is being championed by evangelical Christians, Republican governors, military veterans, and big tech billionaires.Many of them see ibogaine, an intense psychedelic derived from a central African rootbark, as a divine technology. In fact, some pointedly do not refer to it as a psychedelic, given the apparent baggage of the term in some circles.“The psychedelic renaissance is three things: capitalized, conservative and Christian,” Jamie Wheal, author of Recapture the Rapture: Rethinking God, Sex, and Death in a World That’s Lost Its Mind, wroteearlier this yearin an article titled Make America Hallucinate Again. “The tactical decision to makemilitary veteransthe face of [the psychedelic reform] movement has now taken on a life of its own.”After the Food and Drug Administration’s rejection of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD last year, ibogaine is now center stage. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, signed off on a landmark $50m funding package for ibogaine research in June,notingthe “great promise” of the drug in treating conditions suffered by veterans – more of whom live in Texas thanany other state.Reform discussions are also under wayin Ohio, while Colorado is alreadymoving towardssanctioning legal ibogaine treatments, in which patients embark on rollercoaster trips of about 12 hours.“It has a breakthrough therapeutic impact on veterans who have experienced all the visible and invisible traumas of war, including traumatic brain injuries, which have been fully resolved with a single ibogaine treatment,” saysBryan Hubbard, CEO of advocacy group Americans for Ibogaine and a lawyer from Kentucky who often references his personal prayer, Isaiah 61:1. “This very special emancipation medication has the capacity to substantially improve treatment outcomes for afflictions that affect the mind, body and soul.”In a Stanford University study publishedlast yearin Nature Medicine, 30 US special forces veterans who underwent ibogaine treatment in Mexico experienced significant reductions in traumatic brain injury (TBI), PTSD and depression symptoms. A month later, most of the patients had improved even further, without any reported side-effects.Hubbard, a devout Christian, says the irony of conservative Republicans like himself standing at the forefront of the campaign to provide legal access to psychedelic therapies is not lost on him. His own legal experiences in clinics in Mexico with ibogaine, however, were “the most profound spiritual experiences in my life”.But there is growing scrutiny of the apparent victory of the cultural right in who gets to define psychedelic healing, and what Wheal has described bleakly as a “counter-counter-cultural turn” in the psychedelics world. “The psychedelic [QAnon] shaman storming the White House on January 6 was an early awakening that within Maga there could be rightwing psychonauts,” saysJeremy Weate, director of the non-profit Global Ibogaine Therapy Alliance.Ibogaine, which Hunter Biden took in 2014 in a failed attempt to address his drug and alcohol addiction, is “a maverick molecule for a maverick moment”, Weate adds, after its accidental discovery as a treatment for opioid addiction in the 1960s by heroin addict and film-maker Howard Lotsof. But as clinics in legal jurisdictions expand to cope with the rising demand, the dream-inducing psychedelic – which can rid addicts of even debilitating withdrawal symptoms, while also providing consumers with autobiographical and sometimes distressing movies of their lives – is “just becoming a pill you take”, Weate says, as part of a “ruthlessly transactional” and lucrative American-style healthcare system.That traumatized US veterans and victims of the pharmaceutical industry’s opioid crisis are flocking to Mexico to take an African psychedelic is just one consequence of how the “effervescence of irrationality” has migrated to the right in recent years, where libertarian Republican political figures appear keener to take previously unfathomable risks.On 7 September, ketamine therapy enthusiast Elon Musk – whose allies are now some ofthe biggest individual fundersof psychedelic NGOs, research and drug development – postedon X: “White people are a rapidly diminishing minority of [the] global population.” A few hours later,he added: “We cannot understand the true nature of the Universe, unless we question deeply. I want to know what is real, even if the answer is total obliteration of my consciousness.”Towards the end of November, former UFC champion Conor McGregor, who recently lost his appeal ina civil rape caseafter being alleged to have held his female victim in a chokehold, did ibogaine and claimed to have experienced visions of being initiated by Jesus ina viral X post.“I was shown the light,” he wrote. Jesus descended from the white marble steps of heaven and anointed me with a crown. I was saved! My brain. My heart. My soul. Healed!”McGregor seemingly has political aspirations. He attended Trump’s inauguration in January and visited the president againin March, before hosting Tucker Carlsonin Dublinand then running a short-livedanti-immigration campaignfor president of Ireland.A week after McGregor’s trip, the “Don’t Die” longevity entrepreneur Bryan Johnson, a Trumpsupporterwho became a centimillionaire after selling the web payments company Braintree in 2013,livestreamed himselftripping on mushrooms – with more than a million people watching on X. The billionaire Salesforce CEO, Mark Benioff, joined the live stream just weeks after saying Trumpshould sendtroops into San Francisco to make the city safer.Others at the forefront of calls to expand access to ibogaine treatment include the former Texas governorRick Perry, who was Trump’s energy secretary from 2017 to 2019 and co-founded Americans for Ibogaine with Hubbard after the Kentucky lawyer worked as an independent contractor for the Reid Foundation, a nonprofit established by Rex Elsass, an ibogaine advocate who has been describedby GQas “the most powerful man in the GOP” that nobody has ever heard of. Google co-founder Sergey Brin reportedly made a $15m investment into a startup researching ibogainelast year.Congressman Morgan Luttrell, a former Navy Seal, did ibogaine and another psychedelic, 5-MeO-DMT, also known as “the God molecule” himself in 2018 in Mexico before his election to the House in 2023. He is the only known federal lawmaker to have tripped on the drugs, which he said eased his war traumas. “I was always ready to go,”he toldthe Washington Examiner. “I was a hyper-aggressive spec war guy that just couldn’t turn the page and start the new chapter.” But psychedelics were “life-changing” for him. “It was a clean slate; start completely over,” he said.It was much the same for Rob O’Neill, the Navy Seal veteran credited with killing Osama bin Laden in 2011, who says that ibogaine has helped him address his PTSD as part of a grueling set of trips in which he was forced to witness his own demons. “It gets in your brain. It shows you stuff. And it kind of cleans out the closet,” O’Neill told Tucker Carlsonearlier this year. “It’s terrifying.”But aside from the terrors, the psychedelic experience, says Norman Ohler, author of Tripped: Nazi Germany, the CIA, and the Dawn of the Psychedelic Age, is often characterized by a “unified worldview, without borders or enemies, because you work through your trauma”. Even while he doubts psychedelics can make peace-loving men of the most ardent warmongers, Ohler does not see the apparent upswell in rightwing figures publicly aligning themselves with the psychedelic reform movement as a negative phenomenon.“If both camps are embracing psychedelics, they can be a unifying force for society,” he says. “Maybe psychedelics will destroy fascism.”Ohler also recently took ibogaine himself, for psychospiritual purposes, at a clinic in Mexico alongside a group of veterans, one of whom had been suffering from daily migraines after being shot in the head in Afghanistan years before. “After taking ibogaine, his pain was completely gone,” says Ohler. “This is a very special medicine.”A medicine that also comes with mortal risks. Ibogaine is contraindicated with a host of other drugs and can lead to cardiac arrest, which is why treatments best take place with intensive care ward care and monitoring. A 2021 studyreportedthat 33 ibogaine-related deaths have been reported publicly, but the true figure isprobably much higherand there have been questions over how certain clinics have dealt with deaths under their care – even while the psychedelic has reportedly transformed thousands of lives.For Hubbard, it is paramount that ibogaine is treated as the “very serious medication” that it is. “I don’t shy away from [the term] psychedelics,” he says.But he does seek to avoid “flamboyant and quixotic” language when making the case. “Someone who is eating a handful of mushrooms and rolling around the mud at Woodstock in 1969 is not a credible advocate for how psychedelics can help deliver individual healing and broader spiritual enlightenment,” he says.This story was amended on 26 December 2025 to clarify that Bryan Hubbard did not receive funding from Rex Elsass.Explore more on these topicsUS newsDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

The tycoon, whose business interests include xAI, an artificial intelligence company, became the first person to have a net-worth of more than $500bnin October this year. Hecould become the world’s first trillionaireif he hits targets set by Tesla, the electric car company he runs.Musk sits ahead of Google co-founder Larry Page and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in the overall rankings of the world’s wealthiest billionaires. Page isestimatedto be worth $270bn, and Bezos $255bn.Thegrowing concentrationof wealth among an ultra elite has fuelled debate about how best to rebalance economies, with some calling formore effective wealth taxes.The chief executive of the chipmaker Nvidia, Jensen Huang, was also one of the biggest gainers. The value of his investments, equity and other assets rose $41.8bn, taking his personal fortune to $159bn. This puts him ninth in the overallBloomberg Billionaire Index, and eighth among the top 10 US tech billionaires, according to a separate report from the Financial Times.Huang sold nearly $1bn worth of shares this year, cashing in on Nvidia’s soaring stock price. Its relatively advanced computer chips are a critical component in building the more powerful processing capability required by AI. It became the world’s first $5tn company in October, larger than the economic output of some of the world’s biggest economies, such as Japan or India.List of Silicon Valley’s wealthiest billionairesThe wealth of Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google, swelled by around $102bn and $92bn respectively, as investors bet on the company’s AI progress, including its own in-house efforts to build new chips, known as a Tensor Processing Unit.Such has been the surge in AI investments in recent years that the Bank of England has warned of a“sudden correction”in global markets if investor confidence proves misplaced.“On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence,” top policymakers at the central bank said in October.This means that stock markets are “particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic”, they said.While technology is the dominant industry among gainers in the billionaire rankings, there are other familiar names, too. Bernard Arnault, the French chair of the LVMH luxury goods company, which makes the likes of Louis Vuitton bags and Dom Perignon champagne, saw his wealth rise by $28.5bn over the past year. The 76-year-old controls around half of LVMH and analysts have turned more positive on the stock in recent months, with strong spending by wealthy North American consumers.The Spaniard Amancio Ortega, who holds 59% of Inditex, the parent company of the high street clothing retailer Zara, and seven other brands, was among the biggest gainers, adding $34.3bn to his fortune, which sits at $136bn. This was boosted by a record dividend of €3.1bn from the retail group.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He has consistently denied wrongdoing in the scandal, which dented Malaysia’s image abroad.Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah, who was presiding, convicted Najib, 72, on all four counts of abuse of power. The former PM will also face a verdict on 21 counts of money laundering linked to the fund, which prompted investigations in several countries, from Singapore to the US.The judge said in his verdict: “The contention by the accused that the charges against him were a witch-hunt and politically motivated were debunked by the cold, hard and incontrovertible evidence against him that pointed towards the accused having abused his own powerful position in 1MDB, coupled with the extensive powers conferred upon him.”Malaysian and US investigators say at least $4.5bn was stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a state fund Najib co-founded in 2009 while in office. More than $1bn allegedly made its way into accounts linked to Najib, who has denied wrongdoing.The ruling could add to tensions in the prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim’s, governing alliance, which includes the once dominant United Malays National Organisation, over which Najib, its former leader, has retained significant influence.Najib hasbeen in prison since August 2022, when Malaysia’s top court upheld a corruption conviction for illegally receiving funds from a 1MDB unit. His 12-year jail sentence in that case was halved last year by a pardons board.Najib is the son of one of the country’s founding fathers and was groomed for leadership from a young age until his spectacular fall from power. He had been seen as untouchable until public anger over the 1MDB corruption scandal led to the 2018 election defeat of his ruling party, which had governed since Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957.Prosecutors say Najib abused his positions as prime minister, finance minister and 1MDB advisory board chair to move large amounts of money from the fund into his personal accounts more than a decade ago.According to investigators, proceeds from the state fund were used to bankroll high-end real estate, a luxury yacht and precious artworks.Najib has repeatedly said he was misled by 1MDB officials and the fugitive financier Jho Low, who has been charged in the US for his central role in the case. Low, whose whereabouts are unknown, has denied wrongdoing.The judge dismissed several of the defence lawyers’ arguments, including that Najib was duped by Low, his close associate. He also dismissed arguments that the money flowing into Najib’s accounts was “donations” from Middle East funders, calling it a “tale that surpassed even those from the Arabian Nights”.The prosecution presented bank records, testimony from more than 50 witnesses and documentary evidence.Najib “paints himself as a victim of rogue subordinates, when in truth, he was the single most powerful decision maker”, the deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib told the court during closing arguments. “The accused wielded absolute financial, executive and political control,” he said.Najib has apologised for allowing the 1MDB scandal to happen during his tenure, but maintains he knew nothing about illegal transfers from the fund.His legal battle was dealt a blow on Monday after he lost an application to serve the remainder of his first jail term at home rather than the Kajang prison, outside Kuala Lumpur.Agence France-Presse, Reuters and Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsNajib RazakMalaysia1MDBAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The increase comes in the fourth year of Japan’s five-year program to double its annual arms spending to 2% of GDP.The budget plan focuses on fortifying strike-back capability and coastal defences with surface-to-ship missiles and unmanned arsenals. To defend the coasts, Japan will spend ¥100bn yen to deploy “massive” unmanned air, sea-surface and underwater drones for surveillance and defence under a system called “Shield” planned for March 2028, defence ministry officials said.Japan PM fails to achieve breakthrough in row with China – but polling shows public backs herRead moreThe budget boost comes amidescalating hostilitiesbetween the Chinese and Japanese governments. Beijing has consistently objected to Japan’s strengthening defensiveness, but relations imploded last month when Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, said Japanwould probably become militarily involvedif China attacked Taiwan as part of Beijing’s plans to annex the territory.Takaichi’s remarks sparked a furious reaction from Beijing,which launched a rangeof diplomatic and economic retaliatory moves. Takaichirefused to withdraw her comments, and the government has maintained they represented no change to Japan’s defence policies.Chinese government officials have continued to publicly rail against Tokyo, seizing on any military-related announcement.On Thursday China’s defence ministry told a regular press briefing that Japan’s recent space technology developments – some of which are in cooperation with the US – were “accelerating the weaponisation and militarisation of space, and fuelling a space arms race”.Tokyo has launched several rockets since March 2023, carrying cargo spacecraft and satellites for GPS systems and intelligence gathering, according to Japanese media.“Given that Japan’s vicious militarists once launched sneak attacks and that the country is now taking an offensive space policy, it is hardly surprising that there are growing concerns of another Pearl Harbor scenario,” defence ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang said on Sunday.Japan’s postwar constitution forbids it from using force as a means of settling international disputes but a2015 amendment– passed when Takaichi’s mentor, Shinzo Abe, was prime minister – permits it to exercise collective self-defence in certain situations, even if it is not directly under attack.Japan’s current security strategy identifies China as the country’s biggest strategic challenge and calls for a more assertive role in its security cooperations with the US.On Thursday, China’s defence ministry also blasted the US over its continued support for Taiwan, a week after it approved amassive US arms sale to Taipeiof more than $10bn. The US doesn’t recognise Taiwan diplomatically but is Taiwan’s most significant supporter in resisting Chinese annexation threats, and is mandated under US law to provide it with the means to defend itself.Last week the US senate also passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes authorisation to spend up to $1bn in 2026 on Taiwan-related security cooperation.Zhang accused the US of “emboldening Taiwan independence” activity and undermining peace and stability.China is in the midst of a years-long overhaul and modernisation of its military, geared in large part towards being able to take Taiwan by force. Beijing claims Taiwan is a province that must be “reunified” with the mainland, but an overwhelming majority of Taiwan’s people reject the prospect. Its rapidly growing navy and air force are venturing further out beyond their borders, and have been involved in multiple incidents with other militaries.Earlier this month Chinese aircraftlocked their radaron Japanese aircraft during drills near south-western Japan, prompting Tokyo to protest. Locking radar is considered one of the most threatening acts a military aircraft can take because it signals a potential attack, forcing the targeted aircraft to take evasive action.Zhang said China’s defence expenditure was reasonable and moderate, and its activities were “fully in compliance with international law”.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsJapanChinaTaiwanAsia PacificUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The move comes weeks after Whittingham stepped down from his long-held position at Utah, where he spent 21 seasons as head coach and became the most successful figure in the program’s history.Trump loomed over sport like never before in 2025. Next year he will take even moreRead moreAt Utah, Whittingham compiled a 177-88 record and led the Utes to consistent relevance at the national level, including an unbeaten 13-0 campaign in 2008. His overall winning percentage of 66.8% and longevity at a single program have long positioned him as a future inductee into the College Football Hall of Fame.When Whittingham announced his departure from Utah earlier this month, he made clear he was not retiring from coaching, joking publicly that he was entering “the transfer portal.” The phrasing of his exit – described as stepping down rather than retiring – immediately fueled speculation that another high-profile opportunity could be imminent.Michigan’s vacancy emerged under far different circumstances. Their search for a new head coach was triggered by theabrupt dismissal of Sherrone Moore, who was fired earlier this month after the university said an internal investigation found “credible evidence” of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.Within hours of his firing, Moore was arrested by police in Pittsfield Township, near Ann Arbor, andlater charged with three crimes, including home invasion and stalking a person he had previously dated. Washtenaw County prosecutors said Moore “unlawfully enter[ed] the dwelling of a victim with whom Mr Moore had a dating relationship” and accused him of “terrorizing” the woman following the loss of his job.Moore, 39, spent two nights in jail following his arrest. His attorney, Joe Simon, said there was “no evidence to suggest he’s a threat”.Michiganhas not publicly disclosed details of the alleged relationship, though athletic director Warde Manuel said Moore’s conduct constituted “a clear violation of university policy”.Moore, who is married and has three young daughters, had signed a five-year contract last year with a base salary of $5.5m. Under the terms of the deal, Michigan will not owe a buyout because he was fired for cause.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsMichiganShareReuse this content"

The visitors’ problem was a lack of cutting edge. Towards the end Joelinton pulled the trigger with the goal begging but drilled only into Senne Lammens’ gloves. Joe Willock did the same with a cross. Then, Anthony Gordon spurned one more clear chance.Manchester United v Newcastle: Premier League – liveRead moreSo, missing Bruno Fernandes for only the fourth time of a five-year, 308-appearance United career, Ruben Amorim’s men finished the night happy, particularly as the captain was one of seven unavailable.Factor in how they ended with a backline containing the 20-year-olds, Leny Yoro and Tyler Fredricson, Ayden Heaven (19), plus Tyrell Malacia, who last featured in January, and you understood why the head coach was pleased.“Yes, especially if you see the second half, we managed to defend sometimes with a back six [were forced to] and we suffered together. If we always have this spirit we are going to win so many games. It is something we need to feel – that we can win games with spirit and togetherness,” said Amorim.Of Dorgu, he said: “Maybe the game today with a lot of transitions is good for his ability to drive with the ball. He did well.”For the first time, Amorim’s configuration featured a flat back four even when defending and stationed Dorgu as a right-winger, with Mason Mount chief orchestrator in attacking midfield.The former Chelsea man was a cocktail of industry and creation A gilded chance for Casemiro came when Mount’s corner dropped on to his head: unmarked, the Brazilian twitched his neck muscles and missed – poorly. Then Mount hassled Lewis Hall, pilfered possession, and passed to Dorgu. The Dane’s cross went to Benjamin Sesko whose pivot was followed by an aimless shot.Punch and counterpunch was the pattern. Sandro Tonali popped a corner in from Newcastle’s left, Bruno Guimarães nodded on, and in a near-post thicket Lammens squeezed the ball away.Eddie Howe’s unchanged XI were on top so Dorgu’s blistering strike was succour for United. Matheus Cunha’s devilry claimed a throw-in which Diogo Dalot lobbed into Newcastle’s area, Nick Woltemade’s header looped to Dorgu, and an instant left-foot volley flashed past Aaron Ramsdale in the visitors’ goal.View image in fullscreenManchester United’s Lisandro Martínez (No 6) was cleared of handball, despite Newcastle’s appeals.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesOne-nil to United and a feather in the Amorim cap for switching the effervescent Dorgu to attack. He and his teammates now hurtled at their visitors in a red blur. Balletic Dorgu feet bedazzled on the right and brought Mount in but his touch was laboured. Luke Shaw careered along the left and hoped to put Sesko in but failed. Cunha, too, tried to locate the Slovenia forward and was thwarted. A Dorgu break followed by an effort that Ramsdale saved, and the sight of Manuel Ugarte scheming were all part of the show Amorim’s men were putting on.They were breathless and exhilarating, direct and potent – in attack. Yet as the goals against column showed at kick-off – 30 conceded – defence is their issue. When Sesko dawdled and was robbed in his own half, instantly United were turned. The ball went to Jacob Murphy and a skimming ball over was missed by a stranded Lammens.United were missing Matthijs De Ligt, Harry Maguire, Kobbie Mainoo, and Fernandes, all injured, plus Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui, and Amad Diallo, who are on Africa Cup of Nations duty. But at the interval Amorim’s team – captained by Lisandro Martínez, in his first start since February – walked off to applause, fine tidings for the head coach as his bench was crammed with five academy youngsters, including the Fletcher twins, Jack and Tyler, who were together in a matchday squad for the first time.Jack was brought on for Mount by Amorim who saw a slick Woltemade backheel find Jacob Ramsey. He manoeuvred into space then fell over, comically, in instalments.United’s bad habit of falling asleep directly after the break was again present. Newcastle, scenting blood, forced a medley of corners. At one, the ball bounced to Fabian Schär and his snapshot was deflected away by Dorgu.Amorim, seeing enough, brought Joshua Zirkzee on for Sesko, whose final act was to crash the ball off Ramsdale’s bar, as Yoro replaced Casemiro. None of this halted Newcastle’s flow. Hall skirted past Ugarte and also hit the bar. Schär wanted handball by Martínez but the video assistant referee ruled this was inadvertent, the defender’s effort hitting him on the underarm.Newcastle have won away from home only once in the league this season, 4-1 against Everton. Howe said: “You could make an argument we should have got something today but ultimately we haven’t.”He needs to remedy this – fast.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

She was originally identified by team staff earlier in the season after attempting kicks at a September home game, according to her account.The Jets said the initial disqualification stemmed from rules that prohibit current or recent coaches in soccer, football or rugby from participating in the promotion for insurance reasons. Castanio-Gervasi said she had disclosed both her college soccer background and her coaching role during the qualification process and was not made aware of any issue until days before the scheduled contest.“This is a bad look for an organization that should be looking for any positive PR,” Woody said on X.The $100,000 prize, sponsored by Hellmann’s, would be “life-changing”, Castanio-Gervasi said, noting that she planned to use any winnings toward buying a home and supporting cancer-related charities.She has said the opportunity carries particular meaning because she is attempting the kick in memory of her father, Frank, a devoted Jets fan who died of esophageal cancer in 2011. The family has continued attending games together in his honor and has raised tens of thousands of dollars for cancer education causes.After learning of the disqualification, Castanio-Gervasi said she planned to skip Sunday’s game, though the Jets had offered alternative compensation including team merchandise and a gift card. Following the team’s reversal, she and several family members now plan to attend the game at MetLife Stadium.The distance of the final kick has not been announced. Castanio-Gervasi is currently recovering from knee surgery on her non-kicking leg but said she intends to participate as scheduled.The team’s decision restores her chance to compete alongside three other finalists during half-time of Sunday’s home finale. The Jets enter the contest with a 3-12 record, good for dead last in the AFC East division.Explore more on these topicsNew York JetsNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

If the 49ers prevail, they can still clinch the No 1 seed with a win over the Seahawks in Week 18 owing to already holding the tie-breaker. If the Bears are victorious, they must beat the Lions next week and hope the Seahawks lose at least once to close the season. It is going down to the wire.What the Bears need to do to winThe Bears’ defense is having an extraordinary year turning the ball over. The ball-hawk brothers Kevin Byard and Nahshon Wright are showing a preternatural ability to read a quarterback’s mind and, as such, Chicago lead the league in interceptions (21) and total turnovers (31).They need to keep the giveaways flowing to cut the legs from a San Francisco offense quietly becoming a juggernaut. The 49ers’ success has been largely built on Brock Purdy’s return at quarterback, which has laid on a five-game winning streak in which they average a chunky 34.2 points per game. Backup Mac Jones also had success, though not quite as much, with the 49ers scoring 22.8 points per game and posting a 5-3 record under his care.A major difference is Purdy’s unwavering aggression when pushing the ball downfield. These more dynamic, trigger-happy tendencies can lead to interceptions, as Carolina discovered when picking Purdy off three times in November, only to lose 20-9. What the Bears have that the Panthers did not is an offense capable of outscoring San Francisco if they can pull off a similar trick. Chicago need to be conservative, guard against the big play and patiently await a present from Purdy.What the 49ers need to do to winSan Francisco need to slow down Chicago’s impressive two-man running attack. D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai, who have 1,728 rushing yards between them, form the best tandem in theNFLoutside of Buffalo’s unorthodox combination of James Cook and quarterback Josh Allen.Swift and Monangai’s old-school power running controls drives and keeps defenses honest as they efficiently chew up yardage from first whistle to last.The problem for the 49ers is that they have faced plenty of weak rushing attacks and have struggled against teams who run the ball well, such as the Rams. Los Angeles ran for 126 yards and two scores in their 42-26 thrashing of San Francisco in November. The solution may lie in the returns of linebacker Tatum Bethune and lineman Sam Okuayinonu from injury. Both are strong run defenders; both need to be ready to go toe-to-toe with a fierce offensive line and an even fiercer pair of backfield burners. The Bears will control the outcome if Swift and Monangai run riot.Rising: Pittsburgh Steelers“I think there’s a mindset that you pay for a ticket, you say whatever the hell you want. I think there should be some sort of code of conduct. Obviously that was intentional and I think there was some celebration afterward on his part,” mused the cerebral quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The depth of thought is still outstripping the arm, then – no change there.Where change has come for Pittsburgh is finding a cause they can rally behind to bind them as a unit. Rodgers has revealed that the in-house narrative is that DK Metcalf has been treated unfairly, despite the receiververy openly throwing a punch at someonehe could barely reach up to in the stands. Hardly a reflexive action to a vicious barb. But the bad man with the blue hair made him do it. Pittsburgh have their edge again.The entitled fan, and the rest of the NFL kingdom that want the black and gold to fail, are going to pay – even the home bodies chanting for Mike Tomlin to be fired in November. An edge missing on defense during early-season blundering has returned, enhancing an offense scoring in bunches for what feels like the first time in forever. Metcalf will make a triumphant return to save the Steelers on wild-card weekend, should they beat the Browns on Sunday or the Ravens next week, delivering a first playoff win in what also feels like forever. It is written.View image in fullscreenAaron Rodgers has the Steelers on the rise. Detroit on the other hand …Photograph: Nic Antaya/Getty ImagesFalling: Green Bay PackersThe wheels haven’t fallen off completely. The Packers are in the playoffs after the Lions limped out on Christmas Day. Job done. A window to winning the NFC North is still ajar, too, if the Bears lose out and the Packers win out.But after two successive defeats, Micah Parsons being ruled out for the season and quarterback Jordan Love’s fitness to face Baltimore in question, the omens don’t exactly scream Super Bowl contenders, which they very much were two weeks ago. The offense was exploding into life, leaning on Christian Watson’s deep threat, and Green Bay were leading the AFC-leading Broncos 23-14 early in the third quarter in Mile High.Defeat from a position of strength followed, as it did again at Soldier Field last week. The old enemy’s Caleb Williams delivered the most brutal of late daggers to extinguish what would have been a gritty victory against the odds. A chance missed to assume the playoff-boosting rallying cry – “nobody believes in us”. Instead, maybe the Packers themselves have lost faith now, too.Race for the No 1 pickAnd then there were two. A pair of 2-13 fall guys sharing respective nine-game doom slides. The Las Vegas Raiders and New York Giants sit in pole position for the top pick after Cam Ward’s Tennessee Titans whipped up on the fallen Kansas City Chiefs.And who might these bottom dwellers be facing this week? Each other. Yes, the bruised, battered and broken bowl comes crunching into focus, likely to settle the battle for good. Two jobbers enter; one leaves unsure whether to laugh or cry. The other lies crippled on the canvas, smiling through blackened teeth. Next year, the pain might just have been worth it.If the season ended todayAFC1) Denver 13-3; 2) New England 12-3; 3) Jacksonville 11-4; 4) Pittsburgh 9-6; 5) LA Chargers 11-4; 6) Buffalo 11-4; 7) Houston 10-5.

The 26-year-old was Arsenal’s top scorer in the Premier League last season with nine goals despite missing several months with a hamstring issue. He was pictured training this week and Arteta revealed Havertz had been “quite close” to being considered for the Carabao Cup quarter-finalwin over Crystal Palaceon Tuesday.‘A quick learner’: how Declan Rice went from Chelsea reject to Arsenal’s Rolls-RoyceRead more“I think it will be a matter of days, not weeks,” the manager said. “Let’s see in the next step how he responds to that. But he’s a player that we miss a lot, a player that brings the team into a different dimension. So I’m really happy to have him back very soon.”Saturday’s meeting with Brighton may come too early for Havertz, who will compete when fit with the £64m signing Viktor Gyökeres and Gabriel Jesus – who started his first game for almost a year against Palace – to lead the line. Gabriel Martinelli is a doubt with a knee injury and Arteta has more problems at the back after revealing Piero Hincapié picked up an unspecified injury in the win over Everton.Riccardo Calafiori is expected to continue alongside William Saliba in central defence – the eighth pairingArsenalhave used this season – but it is hoped that Gabriel Magalhães could be back in contention in the new year. “He hasn’t trained yet, so he’s still doing his rehab,” Arteta said. “But, hopefully, as quick as possible because we know the situation that we have in the back.”Injuries undermined Arsenal’s title challenge last season but this time they have at least avoided racking up red cards. As well as being top of the Premier League, Arteta’s side lead the fair play standings with 22 bookings from 17 games and no dismissals – a vast improvement after six sendings-off last season. The first of those came in the home game against Brighton in August 2024 when Declan Rice was shown a controversial second yellow card for kicking the ball away.“I remember very well, I was very hacked off in the manner that we played with 10 men,” said Arteta. “Hopefully it’s going to be very different next time.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetanewsShareReuse this content"

So deep that he decided it would be best if his wife and two small children spent Christmas in their native Sweden while he continued to put in long days on Teesside.Given that the Hellberg family will soon be reunited in a new home in North Yorkshire and Blackburn’s visit represented the first of four games in nine days it seemed a sensible sacrifice – even if such pragmatism failed to pay the desired Boxing Day dividends. The former Hammarby head coach had hoped to celebrate the completion of his first month in charge at the Riverside Stadium after succeeding the Wolves-bound Rob Edwards with three points but Blackburn, and their irrepressible midfielder Todd Cantwell in particular, had different ideas.While this draw keeps Boro second in theChampionship, eight points behind the leaders Coventry, it raised question marks about the long-term suitability of Hellberg’s narrow 4-2- 2-2 formation.Championship roundup: Coventry go eight points clear while Leicester lose againRead moreBefore last weekend’s 2-0 defeat at Bristol City, the 37-year-old had presided over four straight wins and Boro appeared to be turning into wingless wonders. Here though his preferred configuration looked overly compact and a system built on plenty of slick, short, sharp one and two-touch passing through midfield malfunctioned a little.Admittedly the resultant congestion probably helped limit Cantwell’s room for manoeuvre behind Blackburn’s front two but he remained influential enough to make longstanding home fans pine for a Stuart Ripley or a Stewart Downing offering an outlet down the wings.Boro’s own attacks were invariably constructed in central areas and, although players naturally drifted wide at times the resultant lack of crosses often made life relatively straightforward for Valérien Ismaël’s back five.Hellberg preferred to blame the execution of his gameplan rather than the blueprint itself. “I think we passed the ball too much instead of driving forward,” said Edwards’s impressive, eloquent replacement. “The performance was not good enough. We didn’t deserve more than a draw. But that’s life, you have days that are tough.”Ismaël’s post-match delight certainly seemed a testament to Boro’s potential. “It was tough, as we expected, but we played a great away game,” said Blackburn’s manager. “Middlesbrough might be the best side we’ve faced so far this season in possession but we managed that well. I’m very proud of the boys. We just needed to be more clinical in the final third.”Indeed, Ismaël’s side would have taken a late first-half counterattacking lead had Yuki Ohashi not dragged his shot wide at a moment when Hellberg’s defence had come completely undone.Suitably stung, the hosts were very nearly ahead themselves a couple of minutes later after David Strelec and Hayden Hackney conjured a fine break that concluded with Morgan Whittaker watching in disbelief as his right-footed shot rebounded off the inside of a post.View image in fullscreenMiddlesbrough’s Morgan Whittaker reacts after seeing his shot come off the inside of a post.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAHellberg liberated Sverre Nypan’s midfield skills from the bench at the outset of the second half but the 19-year-old Manchester City loanee and Norway international was eclipsed by Cantwell’s increasing vision and determination.The former Norwich and Rangers creator has recently recovered from injury and wore an enormous bandage on his already heavily strapped right knee but he refused to allow it to weigh him down.Cantwell’s cause was helped by the introduction of Moussa Baradji in the heart of the Rovers midfield. On for the injured Ryoya Morishita, the Frenchman delighted in reducing Hackney’s control in the centre of the pitch.Tellingly, a clearly frustrated Hackney seemed fortunate to be shown a yellow rather than a red card after kicking out aggressively at Taylor Gardner-Hickman with the ball long gone.Granted Blackburn did not force Middlesbrough’s goalkeeper Sol Brynn into a single significant save, let alone take advantage of the injury-induced withdrawal of three home defenders in Alfie Jones, George Edmundson and the Newcastle loanee Matt Targett. But the way they stifled Boro’s creativity bodes well for Ismaël’s future.On this evidence his improving Rovers should soon allay any lingering fears of a springtime relegation skirmish but Middlesbrough may arguably need to adopt a slightly less one-dimensional approach when Hull visit Teesside on Monday night.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipMiddlesbroughBlackburn Roversmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But Slot, who admits Liverpool’s position remains below expectations, insists he will not get carried away by an unbeaten run of six matches because the team’s performance level requires big improvement.Liverpool praying for a golden sky after seven months of stormsRead more“We are in the position we deserve after the first half of the season,” said the Liverpool head coach, who will be without the suspended Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexander Isak,now a long-term absentee, against Wolves on Saturday. “I think we should be higher, let that be clear – I was expecting and hoping for us to be higher in the table – but even in the last six games the difference between us and the other team is constantly too small.“Now we have been a few times a bit lucky with the result [against Tottenham and Brighton] and we need to find a situation where we are so much better than the other team that luck or bad luck does not influence it any more. I think the games we have lost were unlucky. Referees and set pieces have had an incredible impact on the start of our season, but we should not have that as an excuse. That should not lead to us dropping points. We need to make sure like last season when a lot of decisions went against us as well but it didn’t hurt us.”Slot is adamant the Premier League champions will improve in the second half of the season. However, he admitsLiverpoolmust rectify problems with set pieces at both ends to make progress. Only Bournemouth (12) have conceded more set-piece goals in the league this season than Liverpool (11), and while Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United have all scored 10 set-piece goals in the Premier League, Slot’s team have scored three.View image in fullscreenArne Slot wants his team to be so far ahead in games that ‘bad luck’ does not influence the result.Photograph: Adam Davy/PA“Players are getting fitter and fitter, not only the ones we brought in but also the ones who missed out in pre-season,” Slot said. “They are getting used to each other. I think the best is still to come for this team.“If you look at what has happened in the first half [of the season] then I am not so surprised where we are. If you look at our set-piece balance, there is not one team in the world that is minus eight in set pieces and is still joint-fourth in the league. If you find that team please tell me. From open play we are the number-one team in the league for chance creation but I don’t think anyone sees it because I think in general we are criticised a lot. That is true if you simply look at the results, but if you were to exclude the set pieces then the world would look completely different and we would probably be five or six points higher.“People say: ‘What are you talking about? Set pieces are part of the game.’ Of course it is part of football but it is a different element within the game, you could say. The fundamental is the football itself and set pieces are an add-on. But set pieces have such an immense impact on a football game and also on the league table.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

Still, would that be so bad? “It could be better or worse, it depends when or why. If it’s because you want it, or if it’s because somebody told you to go.”If soaking up rays sounds like anathema to Cuesta it is because, in a remarkable ascent, he has barely wasted a minute. In June, shortly before turning 30, he took the reins at Parma and became theyoungest head coach in Serie A since 1939. Half of his short life had been spent building up to that moment, the realisation crystallising in his late teens that no other calling would do. “I felt that I needed to coach,” he says. “It was like an inner necessity that I had inside of me.”Havertz near to Arsenal return with Arteta hoping for ‘different dimension’ in attackRead moreCuesta had been coveted long before his arrival in Emilia-Romagna. It was during a five-year spell as one of Mikel Arteta’s assistants at Arsenal that he matured from inquisitive, ferociously diligent tyro into an elite manager in waiting. Nobody involved with the Premier League leaders would play down Cuesta’s influence; the public received a glimpse when he featured in the club’sAll or Nothing documentarythree years ago. Parting ways brought its own agony.“It was maybe the most difficult decision of my life,” he says of the moment Parma called. Cuesta had to weigh the sense he was aboard a rocket ship against the privilege of being sought by a club feted for itssuccess in the 1990s. “I was incredibly happy at Arsenal, surrounded by incredible people in an incredible project. Not only with great players and a path that is only growing and growing, but with a person who has been incredibly important for me, which is Mikel.”View image in fullscreenCarlos Cuesta with Declan Rice at Arsenal last year. Cuesta says he was ‘incredibly happy’ at the club.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesArteta would never have stood in Cuesta’s way. Other clubs had long been hovering. “I needed to consider a lot of things but in the end I had a great feeling with the people atParma,” Cuesta says. “It’s an amazing, historic club. You can feel there has been success here and, at the same time, there have been many ups and downs. Right now, we are trying to create our own path and our own chapter.”To Parma, all the way from Palma. Cuesta was born in Mallorca, the youngest of four siblings, then 12, 11 and nine. “I was like the penalty,” he quips, but the age gap with his sister and two brothers meant there was little sparring. “It was the opposite,” he says. “They are like extra dad or mum figures. They’ve helped a lot in my education, my standards, my way of approaching life. I guess, through my childhood, I was living in a process that helped me mature a little bit earlier than usual.”He played for Santa Catalina Atlético, a local lower-division side, until 18 but knew his prospects were limited. “I was a footballer that was on the pitch but not making a difference,” he admits. Life nonetheless revolved around the club. His mother ran its coffee shop; he would go there after school, hang out into the evening, immerse himself in the institution’s rhythms. “In this kind of way, I think it got into my blood,” he says.By 15, he had been invited to coach youngsters at Santa Catalina. What had the club’s elders spotted? “Passion for the game, I guess. And maybe a kid that had some time off, spending so long there! Perhaps when I was playing I was a little bit vocal too. But I was watching a lot of games and trying to understand the ‘why?’, trying to understand how things can improve.”The die was cast. Cuesta was confident, academically bright and ambitious. He wanted a career around football and for a short time considered sports journalism. The inner cry to make his name in coaching had become overwhelming by the time he began a sports science degree in Madrid.“I tried to be proactive in order to make it happen,” he says. Social media proved invaluable. Cuesta followed a number of staff from Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid on Twitter, eventually striking up conversations that brought a role in the latter’s academy alongside his studies. Atlético was “almost like the real university”: their coaches had spotted a precocious talent and he began working with their under-nines, eventually taking charge at under-14 level.View image in fullscreenCarlos Cuesta says of the challenge facing him at Parma: ‘We’re trying to create the competitive mindset we need to overcome adversity and develop.’Photograph: Fabio Fagiolini/IPA Sport/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockCuesta was motivated “to try and spend time with people that could add value for me”. During a year out after leaving Atlético he crammed in visits to clubs, managers, seminars and tournaments. Among the yields was a connection with Juventus, where he spent two years with the under-17s and under-23s. He was 22. “If Atlético was the university, Juventus was the master’s,” he says. “An incredible experience. Learning things like the attention to detail on tactics, on defensive aspects of the game.”Then came the call from Arteta, who was eight months in atArsenal. The pair had forged a relationship during Arteta’s time at Manchester City when Cuesta “had the opportunity to share some thoughts” with a coach whose outlook he already admired. He became one of Arteta’s most trusted lieutenants and the pair still communicate regularly. His face illuminates with every chance to extol his mentor’s virtues.“An incredible person,” he says. “He has always been extremely supportive through the whole process and still is. I can’t speak well enough about who he is, not just as a leader and a coach but as a human being.”The clarity, single-mindedness and intensity Cuesta exhibits during an hour-long conversation at Parma’s training centre bring easy comparison to the Arteta who, before his playing days wound down, was sketching out detailed visions of a life in management.Sometimes Cuesta finds himself rising at dawn and finishing work at 10pm, although he will try to at least operate from home in the evening. Long hours are an Arteta trait and so is a pragmatism that Cuesta, in trying to keep Parma from the relegation zone, may need to deploy at the expense of idealism.“You have your own sensibility and beliefs about what the game is, but I think it’s very important to have this flexibility to understand what the context requires,” he says. “It’s not always possible to do what you like, but you always have to do what is needed. There will be moments where what you like is needed or possible, but there will be many others where you just need to maximise the resources at your disposal and do your best.“That’s why I think, the bigger the spectrum of your knowledge and ability to convince players to do certain things, the better a coach you will be. I try to learn from many.”View image in fullscreenCarlos Cuesta reads voraciously and frequently dips into a translation of the Chinese text Tao Te Ching.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The GuardianHis initial role at Arsenal was individual development coach, which involved one-on-one work with players focusing on aspects of their game. The dressing room of Arteta’s early days was not outwardly the easiest to enter, even before considering Cuesta was 25 and almost unknown. Senior players embraced him swiftly though; the All or Nothing clip in which he animatedly, yet concisely, talks Ben White through his “world-class” attributes is a widely available example of his talents.“I tried to observe, to listen, to intervene only when I thought I could add some value, and from there to slowly try to get their credibility and trust,” he says. “When the player feels you can do that, and that you’re a good person with honesty, good intentions and good values, they follow and respect you.”Any flicker of fame from becoming a minor television star was, he says, blanked out by obsession with the day-to-day. That focus continues at Parma, where he oversees the third-youngest team in Europe’s top five leagues. We meet soon after a win at Pisa that pulls them well clear of the drop; three days later they are dragged back towards it by a home defeat to Lazio, whose winner comes after they had two men sent off. Consistency will take time.Perhaps his youth helps him relate to a much-changed squad that lost players such asGiovanni Leoni, who signed for Liverpool, in the summer. “Maybe the age can be a factor in terms of empathy,” he says. “We’re trying to create the competitive mindset we need to overcome adversity and develop. The players have been absolutely incredible – they are growing.”The quest for self-growth continues too. Cuesta reads voraciously: he frequently dips into a translation of the Chinese text Tao Te Ching, one of whose central tenets is self-awareness. Sacred Hoops, by the former NBA coach Phil Jackson, is another that “I usually have around”. Inspiration comes from numerous sources and the days when the wallpaper on his phone was a picture of the Champions League trophy, incentivising him with the most thrilling target available, are long gone.“Not any more, look!” he says, holding up a more nondescript background. “The only thing I have is the present. In this job you need to reframe ‘time’. For me, time right now means today is my everything.” The Maldives still feel a galaxy away.Explore more on these topicsParmaArsenalSerie AEuropean club footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The young midfielder, soon to shoot to prominence under Martin O’Neill, was finding it impossible to snatch the ball from a rotund, wizened coach during a possession drill. Petrov’s teammates were cackling with laughter. John Robertson’s brilliance was understated enough inScotland. Word of his talent in the game was never likely to reach Petrov as he grew up in Bulgaria.Petrov is part of a recent generation who owe a debt of gratitude to Robertson the coach. More of them later. When news ofRobertson’s deathfiltered through on Christmas Day, the prevailing sense was that his country had lost one of a kind. He was also an individual who, for reasons associated with his own modesty, really never received the kudos he deserved in the land of his birth.John Robertson, Nottingham Forest and Scotland legend, dies aged 72Read moreRobertson was two-footed (albeit much more devastating with his left), capable of a bamboozling switch of pace over five yards and a wondrous crosser. He was Brian Clough’s favourite, for goodness sake; a footballer key to two crucial European Cup final goals. It is a pity that only now may Robertson be properly cherished in Scotland. Robertson was very different in style to Denis Law and Kenny Dalglish. It should not be sacrilege to suggest he was their footballing peer.There has never been any worry in Nottingham about Robertson’s contribution being unheralded. Robertson was adored there, almost from the moment Clough instigated a positional switch – central midfield to the left flank – and ordered this 22-year-old to at least moderate a lifestyle which revolved around fags and a frying pan. Robertson was an outside left rather than a winger, a player who made the improbable look so blissfully easy. Clough gave him scope to do as he pleased. In Forest’s halcyon days, Robertson was among the best in Europe.Clough’s depiction of Robertson in his autobiography was unsparing, as a “scruffy, unfit, uninterested waste of time”. Indeed, Robertson had been on the transfer list (where he was barely attracting attention) until Clough sprinkled magic dust. The Scot could, however, assert the benefit was mutual. Robertson at his peak was so heavily influential in Clough’s triumphs.Robertson’s depiction of his finest goal does not involve the 20th minute in the Santiago Bernabéu on 28 May 1980. The solitary goal as Forest successfully defended the European Cup against Hamburg was nudged into second place by events against England at Wembley the following year. Davie Provan plays through Stevie Archibald, who is knocked over by Bryan Robson. “I screamed: ‘Penalty!’” Robertson recalled. “Then I thought: ‘Oh God, I’m taking it.’” Club loyalties counted for nothing as Trevor Francis – whom Robertson had set up when Forest won the European Cup in 1979 – ran 30 yards to issue words of advice to Joe Corrigan in the England goal. Robertson duly sent Corrigan the wrong way.View image in fullscreenJohn Robertson revels in Scotland’s win at Wembley in 1981, when he scored the winning goal.Photograph: PAScotland have won at Wembley once since. Robertson’s 28 caps feel like scant reward for his brilliance, even from a time when international fixtures were less common and Scotland had an abundance of options. He featured in two World Cups (openly admitting he did not enjoy the 1978 version), with the fact his national service spanned only five years – 1978 to 1983 – explaining the low tally.O’Neill and Robertson were to become great friends. There was a strand of jealousy, though, when O’Neill bit back at a Clough half-time tirade. O’Neill questioned why Robertson was always spared criticism despite occasional selfishness or wastefulness. “Because, young man, that lad is a bloody genius,” Clough retorted. And Robertson was, while insisting he was only the second-best player to emerge from the Viewpark estate in Uddingston near Glasgow. It is for others to determine whether Jimmy Johnstone or Robertson was the superior export. That is one hell of a debate.Quick GuideForest to honour John RobertsonShowNottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis plans to rename one of the stands at the City Ground in John Robertson's honour.Robertson – who died on Christmas Day, aged 72 – became a Forest idol with standout moments in the finals of their 1979 and 1980 European Cup triumphs, providing the assist for the winner in the former and scoring the only goal in the latter.Marinakis paid tribute to the former Scotland winger and has proposed rechristening the Bridgford Stand to reflect his achievements at Forest, where Robertson also won the First Division title, the Uefa Super Cup and two League Cups.Marinakis wrote on X: \"This week is one of profound sadness for everyone connected with Nottingham Forest as we come together to mourn the passing of John Robertson, a true legend of this great club in every sense of the word.\"Today, I have recommended to the board that the Bridgford Stand be renamed 'The John Robertson Stand' in his honour and in lasting recognition of his extraordinary contribution to our club, so that his legacy, and our great hero, will forever be remembered.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Clough’s faith in Robertson was absolute. For a manager prone to such whim, that has always been intriguing. O’Neill displayed similar trust; the duo formed a great bond at Wycombe, Norwich, Leicester, Celtic and Aston Villa. Robertson’s strength as a coach was in earning the trust of players who loved his style. No airs or graces, no bullshit, but a deep understanding of the game and its actors. O’Neill trusted Robertson’s judgment implicitly. That Celtic squad especially was one with strong characters. One of them, Chris Sutton, has described Robertson as a “mentor”. Sutton, Petrov and others quickly came to learn exactly who Robertson was when the man himself would never have told them. With O’Neill such an adept frontman, it suited Robertson perfectly to linger in the shadows.There was background tragedy of which Robertson rarely spoke. His brother and sister-in-law were killed in a 1979 car crash in a vehicle Robertson had gifted to them. Robertson scored a diving header against Cologne days later. He reckoned his own father died of a broken heart within a year. Robertson’s daughter, Jessica, died at 13 in 1996 having been born with cerebral palsy.View image in fullscreenMartin O’Neill (left) on the touchline with John Robertson during their time at Celtic.Photograph: Ross Kinnaird/Getty ImagesRobertson’s switch to Derby famously caused an irreparable row between Clough and Peter Taylor. Clough was in the wrong by leaving his player with at least the sense he was not wanted any more amid recovery from a knee injury. Taylor used an element of inside knowledge to offer a three-year deal. Clough’s outrage would have been better aimed closer to home. Robertson regretted going to Derby – a move made against the advice of his wife – with his thoughts in that period understandably dominated by Jessica’s health. It was no wonder his playing career fizzled out.It is poetic that O’Neill returned to manage Celtic, successfully, on an interim basis so recently. The club has changed beyond all recognition since his first tenure. The makeup of his coaching staff had to, as well. Still, it is to be hoped that Robertson was well enough to enjoy his close friend, at 73, rolling back the years with victories and in sparkling fashion against Feyenoord.The Scottish champions described the O’Neill and Robertson alliance as overseeing “one of the most successful periods in Celtic’s history”. Those five years marked the only spell from 1970 until 2025 when Robertson did not live in the Nottingham area. An adopted home for an adopted hero.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestScotlandcommentShareReuse this content"

The British No 1 has played just one match since Wimbledon, with bone bruising in his left armcurtailing his 2025 season, and he is set to be on the sidelines for a little while longer.I was there: Carlos Alcaraz’s comeback in French Open final is still hard to comprehendRead moreDraper, ranked 10th in the world, said in a video on X on Boxing Day: “Unfortunately, me and my team have decided not to head out to Australia this year. It’s a really, really tough decision, obviously [with] Australia being a grand slam, it’s one of the biggest tournaments in our sport.“However, I’ve had this injury for a long time, I’m at the very, very end stages of the process and to step back on court into best-of-five-set tennis so soon just doesn’t seem like a smart decision right now for me and my tennis.”Draper’s arm injury plagued him for much of his campaign, coming to a head at the US Open in August, when he withdrew from his second round match before calling time on his season shortly afterwards. The 24-year-old had been pencilled in to return at the UltimateTennisShowdown grand final in London earlier in December but he followed advice to take more time in his recovery.In skipping the season’s first grand slam, which starts on 18 January in Melbourne, Draper is now likely to target a comeback in February before the defence of his Indian Wells title at the beginning of March.He added: “I’ve obviously been through a fair amount of setbacks so far but by far and away this one has been the most difficult, the most challenging, the most complex one that I’ve had. It’s weird, it always seems to manage to make me more resilient, to make me hungrier, to make me want to become the player I want to become even more. I’m looking forward to getting back out there in 2026 and competing.”Explore more on these topicsJack DraperAustralian OpenTennisAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

This abject surrender came just six days after Quins were thumped 40-14 by Bristol at Twickenham.“The boys care for the club – but there’s a difference between caring for the club and doing something about it,” the Queenslander said pointedly after his players conceded 31 second-half points without reply. “We will be looking hard at the squad in terms of what next year looks like.”Sale squad’s ‘honest’ meeting with owners has reset ambitions, says SandersonRead moreAfter a sixth defeat from eight in the league, Quins can almost certainly forget about the playoffs. But things are finally looking up again for Sale, who reduced their visitors to so much rubble with five second-half tries.Sale’s recent dismal league run, culminating in a 47-21 defeat at Northampton last weekend, prompted the club’s wealthy owners to meet Alex Sanderson and his players. The basic message from Simon and Michelle Orange was “raise your game” and it was heeded.At half-time, though, surely not even Sanderson, a positive person by nature, could have foreseen his side winning so convincingly.“I’m quite emotional now actually but the owners have been really supportive,” said Sale’s director of rugby. “I just thought we were physically brilliant all game. We were down on the scoreboard at half-time, but that didn’t represent the physical dominance we had in that first half.“It was a case of ‘more of the same, please’ and sometimes the plan just comes together, so I couldn’t be prouder of the lads. We desperately needed the win but could I have seen that second half coming? Not the scoreline.“It blew out but I thought we were good value for the win. Even though we were 17-12 down at half-time, the lads stuck at it and they got their reward.”View image in fullscreenAlex Sanderson was under pressure after meeting the Sale owners this week but his side delivered for him.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesIf they could not beat another side struggling so badly in Quins, could Sale really consider themselves ready to start climbing the table?It was a nightmarish start, though, for Sanderson and his players as Quins led early on when Marcus Smith dived over from close range.Smith converted but Sale steadied themselves and hit back in the eighth minute with a slick try from Alex Wills from Rob du Preez’s exquisite long pass.George Ford missed the conversion but his intricate probing came increasingly to the fore for Sale, who had their second try when their England and Lions hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie went over from close range.Jack Walker’s close-range effort – and Smith’s conversion – put the visitors 17-12 up at the break but there was an impressive physicality about Sale and they were rewarded in spades during a ludicrously one-sided second half.The flanker Jacques Vermeulen produced two smart tries to secure the bonus point and Sale, self-belief coursing through their veins, began to move through the gears in devastating fashion.Centre Rekeiti Ma’asi-White finished off some delightful handling for their fifth before scrum-half Raffi Quirke pounced on an awful error from Smith to score Sale’s sixth. Quirke chased his own kick and Smith, inside his own in-goal area, dithered and allowed the ball to bounce beyond him, inviting Sale’s scrum-half to pounce and score.It was a sweet moment for Quirke, who was switched to the wing at the end of the first half after Tom O’Flaherty moved to full-back to replace Joe Carpenter.Smith was taunted by the home stands and, when they chanted “Marcus, Marcus, give us a wave” he responded, much to the delight of the Sale fans.There was still time for the replacement hooker Nathan Jibulu to crash over from close range amid scenes of mounting euphoria. But for Quins the problems continue to mount.Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbySaleHarlequinsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Jukebox Man, though, had met it slightly wrong and conceded what appeared to be a crucial quarter-length before finding an immense final effort that saw him squeeze between Gaelic Warrior and Banbridge and get a flared nostril down right on the line.The margins were the minimum of a nose and the same, with just a half-length back to Jango Baie in fourth, and while the TV cameras zeroed in on The Jukebox Man and Ben Jones as the winners, Redknapp was less convinced that he had just achieved the biggest win of his long career as an owner. He stepped away from the crowd of well-wishers near the winner’s enclosure, alone with his thoughts as he awaited the judge’s verdict, but when the announcement came – “First, number eight” – there was a huge roar of approval from every corner of the track.“It is a dream to have a horse that good,” Redknapp said. “Just to run was a great thing for me as I was so proud of having a runner here, but to have the winner is special.“What a race he has run. He has jumped unbelievable. I thought he was beat when they came to him and I thought he will finish fourth, but he has come again. The guts the horse has shown is just amazing.”Redknapp has owned horses both on the Flat and over jumps since the 1980s, and knows well that it is a game where occasional triumphs will – hopefully – cancel out the many disappointments. He even warned Ben Pauling, The Jukebox Man’s trainer, that he was “an unlucky owner” before first sending him a horse about eight years ago, but they have enjoyed a near-constant run of success ever since including a first win for Redknapp’s coloursat the Cheltenham festival in March 2024.“It is right up there with my best achievements,” Redknapp said. “Football is my life, so when you are winning the FA Cup final for the fans [as he didwith Portsmouth in 2008] it is an incredible feeling.

Late on Thursday a courtgranted hima temporary restraining order to block any attempt to remove him from the US or detain him.Ahmed told the Guardian he believed he had been singled out for his work seeking greater accountability and transparency for social media and AI firms, which has led to Elon Musk’s Xunsuccessfully suing CCDH.Ahmed, who is a friend of Morgan McSweeney, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, said it was another attempt to deflect accountability and transparency.“This has never been about politics,” he said, adding that his organisation had worked successfully with the firstTrump administrationand would do so again if asked.“What it has been about is companies that simply do not want to be held accountable and, because of the influence of big money in Washington, are corrupting the system and trying to bend it to their will, and their will is to be unable to be held accountable,” he said.“There is no other industry, that acts with such arrogance, indifference and a lack of humility and sociopathic greed at the expense of people.”View image in fullscreenThe former European internal market commissioner Thierry Breton is among those to have been hit with a visa ban.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesAs well as Ahmed, the state department has barred the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton. It accused the five people of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”.Sarah Rogers, an official at the state department,posted on X: “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.”The sanctions are being seen as thelatest attack on European regulationsthat target hate speech and misinformation. Campaigners in the UK have said the British government could be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation.Ahmed, who began his career working with Labour politicians in Westminster, said he had not yet formally received any notification from the US government, and that he believed its case against him was unfounded. “I’m very confident that our first amendment rights will be upheld by the court,” he said.The next court hearing, due on Monday, is expected to confirm the protective order that prevents the US government from detaining him, said Ahmed, who spent Christmas away from his wife and infant daughter amid the legal battle.He said this was “a rational thing for us to do, given that in every other case to date where someone has had a green card withdrawn in the last few months, they have been arrested and detained and often spirited hundreds or thousands of miles away from their friends, family and support networks.”The CCDH has previously angered Musk over reports chronicling the rise of racist, antisemitic and extremist content on X since he took it over. Musk tried unsuccessfully to sue the CCDH last year before calling it a “criminal organisation”.More recently, the CCDH released a report warning aboutharmful answersproduced by the latest version of ChatGPT when asked about suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.“We’ve seen that social media and AI companies are increasingly under pressure as a result of organisations like mine,” Ahmed said. “No one likes being exposed as mendacious or hypocritical, but they call their friends in government or they call their pitbull litigation lawyers and start suing.”‘Money mule’ cases surge as criminals target young people on social mediaRead moreAhmed said it was particularly jarring to be targeted given that hate speech and misinformation was increasingly a bipartisan issue, raised as a concern by some Republican politicians as well as Democrats.He said he was nonetheless ready to respond with a swift legal response when he heard the news. “When you take on the world’s biggest corporations and when you’ve had the experiences we’ve had, being sued by the world’s richest man, you dissociate and compartmentalise immediately.”There had been a cost already, he said. “Nothing I’m going through compares to any of the parents I sit with who’ve lost their children,” Ahmed said. “I chose to take on the biggest companies in the world, to hold them accountable, to speak truth to power. There is a cost attached to that. My family understands that.“The only time I felt any sadness at all is last night when my wife told me that our child said her sixth word, and then I cried a bit.”Asked whether he thought UK politicians should continue to use X, Ahmed told PA: “Politicians have to make decisions for themselves, but every time they post on X, they are putting a buck in Mr Musk’s pocket and I think they need to question their own consciences and ask themselves whether or not they think they can carry on doing that.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But now AI may be about to change thatFri 26 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 09.11 ESTShareThis summer, I found myself battling through traffic in the sweltering streets of Marseille. At a crossing, my friend in the passenger seat told me to turn right toward a spot known for its fish soup. But the navigation app Waze instructed us to go straight. Tired, and with the Renault feeling like a sauna on wheels, I followed Waze’s advice. Moments later, we were stuck at a construction site.A trivial moment, maybe. But one that captures perhaps the defining question of our era, in which technology touches nearly every aspect of our lives: who do we trust more – other human beings and our own instincts, or the machine?The German philosopher Immanuel Kantfamously defined the Enlightenmentas “man’s emergence from his self-imposed immaturity.” Immaturity, he wrote, “is the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another”. For centuries, that “other” directing human thought and life was often the priest, the monarch, or the feudal lord – the ones claiming to act as God’s voice on Earth. In trying to understand natural phenomena – why volcanoes erupt, why the seasons change – humans looked to God for answers. In shaping the social world, from economics to love, religion served as our guide.Humans, Kant argued, always had the capacity for reason. They just hadn’t always had the confidence to use it. But with the American and later the French Revolution, a new era was dawning: reason would replace faith, and the human mind, unshackled from authority, would become the engine of progress and a more moral world. “Sapere aude!” or “Have courage to use your own understanding!”, Kant urged his contemporaries.Two and a half centuries later, one may wonder whether we are quietly slipping back into immaturity. An app telling us which road to take is one thing. But artificial intelligence threatens to become our new “other” – a silent authority that guides our thoughts and actions. We are in danger of ceding the hard-won courage to think for ourselves – and this time, not to gods or kings, but to code.ChatGPT was launched only three years ago, and already one global survey, published in April, found that82% of respondents had used AIin the previous six months. Whether deciding to end a relationship or who to vote for, people are turning to machines for advice. According to OpenAI, 73% of user promptsconcern non work-related topics. Even more intriguing than our dependence on AI’s judgment in daily life is what happens when we let it speak for us. Writing is now among the most common uses of ChatGPT, second only to practical requests such as DIY or cooking advice. The American authorJoan Didion once said: “I write entirely to find out what I am thinking.” What happens when we stop writing? Do we stop finding out?Worryingly, some evidence suggests that the answer might be yes. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology used electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor thebrain activity of essay writersgiven access to AI, search engines like Google, or nothing at all. Those who could rely on AI showed the lowest cognitive activity and struggled to accurately quote their work. Perhaps most concerning was that over a couple of months, participants in the AI group became increasingly lazy, copying entire blocks of text in their essays.The study is small and imperfect, but Kant would have recognised the pattern. “Laziness and cowardice,” he wrote, “are the reasons why so great a proportion of men … remain in lifelong immaturity, and why it is so easy for others to establish themselves as their guardians. It is so easy to be immature.”Sure, AI’s appeal lies in its convenience. It saves time, spares effort and – crucially – offers a new way to offload responsibility. In his 1941 book, Escape from Freedom, the German psychoanalyst Erich Fromm argued that the rise of fascism could be explained in part by people preferring to surrender their freedom in exchange for the reassuring certainty of subordination. AI offers a new way of surrendering that burden of having to think and decide for yourself.AI’s greatest allure is that it can do things our minds can’t – sift through oceans of data and process it at unprecedented speed. Sitting in the car in Marseille, this was, after all, why I chose to trust the machine instead of my friend in the passenger seat (a decision she took as an insult). With access to all the data, surely the app must know best – or so I thought.The problem is thatAI is a black box. It produces knowledge, but without necessarily deepening human understanding. We don’t really know how AI reaches its conclusions – even the programmers admit as much. Nor can we verify its reasoning against clear, objective criteria. So when we follow AI’s advice, we are not guided by reason. We are back in the realm of faith.In dubiopromachina: when in doubt, trust the machine – that may become our future guiding principle.AI can be a formidable ally to humans in rational inquiry. It can help us invent drugs, or free us from “bullshit jobs”, or doing our taxes – tasks that demand little thought and offer little satisfaction. All the better. But Kant and his contemporaries did not plead the case of reason over faith just so humans could build better shelves or have more spare time. Critical thinking was not just about efficiency – it was a practice of freedom and human emancipation.Human thinking is messy and full of errors, but it forces us to debate, to doubt, to test ideas against one another – and to recognise the limits of our own understanding. It builds confidence, both individually and collectively. For Kant, the exercise of reason was never just about knowledge; it was about enabling people to become agents of their own lives, and resist domination. It was about building a moral community grounded in the shared principle of reason and debate, rather than blind belief.With all the benefits AI brings, the challenge is this: how can we harness its promise of superhuman intelligence without eroding human reasoning, the cornerstone of the Enlightenment and of liberal democracy itself? That may be one of the defining questions of the 21st century. It is one we would do well not to delegate to the machine.Joseph de Weck is a fellow with the Foreign Policy Research InstituteExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionPhilosophyComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

Was it really all as good as you pretended it was on Facebook? Full of A-grades for the kids and riotous themed fancy dress birthday parties for the grownups? Or was it a sea of disappointment with only occasional fun flotsam? And was any of it actually real, or are we all now seven-fingered AI slop beings with Sydney Sweeney’s teeth?I have gathered my thoughts (and the Diamond household) together, whether they wanted to or not, to reflect on the most important thing in any given year: which video games we enjoyed the most.

So thank you to the reader who took the time to email me personally, through my website, to say that my Outer Worlds 2 review was “bitter, confused resentment because YOU DON’T GET THE GAME OLD MAN and your son is an idiot as well sorry to inform you.” I present that in the exact way it was written, because I appreciate the effort, and he is obviously an excellent judge of character where my son is concerned.View image in fullscreen‘Not a gaming experience I want in my mid-fifties’ … Hollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryGame everybody loved that I just didn’t get: Hollow Knight: SilksongSure.

The child, though, has some thinking to do.It’s a bit like being asked by a well-meaning adult, “What do you want to be when you grow up?”, a question that calls for balancing the wings of hope against the burden of reality.“Oh, that’s easy,” my son smiles, bless his heart. “Odie loves my mum the most.”Dogs bred for herding sheep shouldn’t be stuck in the city.

She fed him three times a day and when she studied, he sat under her desk.

I don’t even know why.”There is wry truth in those words.View image in fullscreenOdie, Ranjana Srivastava’s cavoodle, sits quietly and expectantly outside her oldest son’s bedroom.Photograph: Ranjana SrivastavaWhen I am around, Odie keeps me in his line of vision. He is a tripping hazard outside the bathroom. In the wardrobe, he plays a guessing game in his head – is it walk or work? (what else could there be?) If I am writing in bed, he pushes up against my laptop. And when I take a micro nap, he simply fits it into his all-day nap.In the early days, when I left home, Odie used to bolt into my daughter’s room in the mornings and launch himself on to her before licking her face.One reason could be that her door is ajar so he can push it open with his little paw. Her siblings make sure that their door is firmly closed against such pet invasions.She would push him aside and he would snuggle contentedly into the crook of her knees. She said that was okay but flinging himself across her body to pin her under the blanket was not on.Quite possibly, Odie tired of the complaining (albeit good natured) and plotted his next move with some passive-aggressive tendencies. He left my daughter for my oldest son.He is at university, so his hours are less structured than school days. When we are gone, he is sometimes still sleeping or studying. Being tall, he has the most spacious bed of the kids. Odie has developed a distinct fondness for said bed and its occupant.Now, in the morning, when he has calculated from my work attire that his chance of squeezing in a walk is zero, Odie pads up to my son’s door. He used to employ a short bark to be let in but now, he sits quietly and expectantly, having learnt that as penance for going to work, I will find him a new babysitter.On my son’s bed, Odie finds any number of favourable positions: jammed between his long legs, leaning against his knees, resting on his shins, or finding his own little corner of the big bed.Dog and human finding companionship is understandable, but what leaves us scratching our head is why Odie seeks out our eldest’s bed even when he is not home. When we have left Odie alone, we know exactly where to find him resting dolefully.Truth be told, this is the rank favouritism that vexes us. It couldn’t be the walks or treats, we think, but out of all of us, he does have the gentlest manner with the dog. He is the most likely to greet Odie with the words, “Stay, I come in peace”: I reckon the dog appreciates peaceful co-existence.View image in fullscreenOdie used to bolt into Ranjana Srivastava’s daughter’s room in the mornings but has since turned focus to other family members.Photograph: Ranjana Srivastava“Odie, why don’t you love me like the others? What have I done? I take you for walks, I give you treats, why don’t you love me?”Four nights out of seven, you will hear this slightly desperate appeal from my youngest child to the dog as he lies across my feet, opens one tired eye and grumbles at the unwarranted intrusion.But then, as my child continues, Odie opens both eyes and licks my son on every free surface. At such times, I wonder if he is thinking, “Quit the melodrama, man. I love you just as much as the others.”My youngest son complains that Odie never sleeps on his bed and squeals to be let out.This much is true although Odie does love to jump into his lap to umpire endless games of Fifa.When Odie the cavoodle needed emergency surgery, the veterinary staff showed why they are the unsung heroes of healthcare | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreI wonder if his dog brain still remembers being lost in my son’s bedroom when we just got him.

Just look around your local dog park to see why.Apparently, canine intelligence comes in many forms.Odie turns five today.

But despite ‘peace’ being on the lips of world leaders ever since, we Palestinians are still under siege and afraidFri 26 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 08.29 ESTShareHere inGazawe hear the word “peace” constantly – even more often than we hear the roar of warplanes or the thuds of shelling. It appears on television screens, in the statements of world leaders, in promises repeated again and again. Every country claims to want peace for Palestinians. Yet have we ever lived it for a single day? The truth is that we have not.We are now living under a ceasefire, or at least that is what the US and the rest of the world have been telling us. But in Gaza, we haven’t felt it at all. It wasannounced on 10 October,amid great celebrations in Sharm el-Sheikh. Since then, Israeli forces have killedmore than 360 Palestinians, including about 70 children, in Gaza.Because of the explosions I keep hearing, I am still afraid to leave the house. We are trapped in an endless maze of waiting: for the suffering to stop, for our lives to begin again and above all, for thedeath to end.While the world’s leaders discuss the “day after” and finalise their peace plans, proposing and deciding our fate, we remain in the depths of the unknown, drowning in the fear and confusion war has caused. My family and I are now renting a small, unsuitable apartment. Daily life is extremely difficult. Access to water is limited, cash is hard to obtain with no working ATMs and the streets are so badly destroyed that walking or driving feels dangerous. There is no electricity or reliable internet, and no sense of stability or safety.I see families living in destroyed homes, with buildings above them at constant risk of collapse. They have no choice. All they want is a roof over their heads, even if it could fall at any second. And since it is December, with no homes left for us and our life confined to tents, some of us are literally submerged in winter water, in mud, in every sense of the word.2:40How Israel's 'yellow line' is dividing Gaza with deadly consequences – video explainerAlong the newly created borders of Gaza, where Israel has taken even more of our land and homes, is a new invisible boundary they call the “yellow line”. On the east side of the line, houses are demolished every day, and people cannot sleep because of the intensity of the explosions and the smell of smoke. We hear stories that children are shot if they comenear or crossthe line that no one can see. At the start of December I visited relatives in Gaza City whose home is still standing, near the so-called yellow line. The house constantly shakes from artillery fire and what we call explosive robots – ground-based, remotely operated devices loaded with large amounts of explosivesthat are capable of destroying entire residential blocks. They keep the windows closed most of the time because of the smoke from nearby attacks, which they fear may come fromphosphorus-based weapons.We dream of having the peace and security that are rightfully ours, but that now seems to exist only in a fantasy. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, countries discuss giving it to us as if it were forbidden, as if we were not entitled to it. We long for the simple realities of safety: a home that won’t be destroyed, lovers who might meet again, dreams that could come true, nights without fear. Things most people elsewhere take for granted.What is ‘home’ now? A woman’s two-year search for safety in the ruins of GazaRead moreWhen I heard about the “ceasefire” in October, I felt happy and hopeful, believing it would mark the end of the war and the beginning of a new life filled with safety and peace. Yet here I am at the end of December, still waiting for any real change. While the terms of the ceasefire are delayed on the ground, tears are shed at night. I wait to see my fiance, my love, whom I have not seen for two full years because it has been too dangerous to move between the central Gaza Strip, where I lived, and the southern part, where he lived. He travelled to Egypt in April 2024 – and now he cannot enter again and I cannot leave. Like so many other things in this war, our hope has been delayed. I must wait longer to be with the person I love, in peace. This is the true torment of a Palestinian: waiting for the unknown and trying to hold on to hope. Sometimes it feels worse than death.Benjamin Netanyahu said this month that thefirst phase of the ceasefire is near to completion. Unfortunately for Palestinians, none of it has translated into reality yet, and we remain excluded from the very negotiations that speak about our future without us. The beautiful Gaza we dream of returning to has gone. We look out and see rubble and suffering instead. The world and its constant meetings about our future have produced nothing that we can feel or touch.We try to create a form of peace for ourselves, even if it is fragile or false. We hold on to hope, even when it feels thin, and search for brief moments of happiness to survive the deadly waiting. We try to rebuild a life out of ashes because, as the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish wrote: “We carry hope like an illness, and we feel everything deeply.” In the end, this hope is all we have to keep going, while the world debates peace from afar.Aya Al-Hattab is a writer in GazaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I’d gone from running a busy home, juggling work, family and the everyday chaos that comes with it, to suddenly being ripped out of normality and forced to slow down in ways I never expected. When I finally returned home, I felt fragile – physically and emotionally. Getting dressed felt like climbing a mountain some days, never mind feeling remotely like myself.So I decided to try something small but surprisingly powerful: I started sharing my “fits of the day” on TikTok, which basically means I started sharing my outfits. My most-liked video is asimple one of mein an unremarkable cord skirt, oversized collar blouse and knee-high boots.It began as a simple promise to myself. Posting a video meant I had to get up, get dressed and show up in some form. It was a combination of accountability, motivation and a way to reconnect with the world again. I honestly didn’t expect it to become anything more. However,TikTokhas a funny way of surprising you.Each video starts the same way, with my tiny bio: “Hi, I’m Jen: fat, flat, over 50 and with a feeding tube.” TikTok is bursting with outfits of the day (OOTDs) fit checks, and women absolutely smashing it with their personal style. There are some brilliant over-50 creators too (FearlessAt50,Fran Bacon,Sally WhiteandRhianare all fantastic). But there aren’t many who look like me: fat, over 50, flat-chested – thanks to a double mastectomy 18 years ago – and navigating extra health challenges.I call myself fat because that’s what I am – it’s a descriptor, not an insult. Taking ownership of the word removes its sting, and it’s my way of taking up space unapologetically. For years after my double mastectomy, I hid my flatness behind baggy tops, convinced I had to disguise the shape of my chest or lack of it. Over time, though, I realised I didn’t want to hide. Somewhere along the way, I fell in love with the humble sweater vest (or tank top, if you’re my age!). They make me feel pulled together even on low-energy days.And here’s the lovely thing – TikTok loves them too. Sweater vest appreciation is strong. Every time I post one, people ask where it’s from and whether I can share more. There’s something deeply affirming about finding others who love the same things you do. Apparently, “granny chic” is exactly where it’s at on TikTok. Who knew? I certainly didn’t. My comments section is full of people who love what I love: bold colours, textures, feminist prints and clothes with proper personality.For too long, society has made older women, especially fat older women, feel invisible. The fashion industry rarely shows bodies like mine, and social media can make it feel like you’re only “allowed” to enjoy fashion if you fit a certain mould. But that needs to change.Womenover 50 account for 27% of all consumer spending, and we’re now the wealthiest and most active generation ever. Time to start seeing that reflected in fashion and online spaces.I’ve always believed in seeing clothes onrealwomen, with real bodies, living real lives. That’s the inspiration I crave. And funnily enough, younger creators have become a huge source of it for me (Madison Eley, I’m looking at you – you inspired thatyellow skirt and top). Their joyful, experimental outfits with zero fear have encouraged me to see my wardrobe differently. I’ve rediscovered pieces I forgot I owned, such as treasured knitwear, tried combinations I’d never have thought of, such as asummer dresswith a long-sleeved vest underneath and a cardigan worn fastened as a jumper, and stopped saving “nice” things for imaginary special occasions. There’s something wonderfully freeing about wearing whatever feels good that day, whether that’s a floral skirt, a cosy knit or one of my beloved sweater vests.As the videos gained views, I started gaining followers too – but more importantly, a genuinely supportive community of nearly 4,500 formed around my fits. They cheer me on, offer styling ideas and leap into the comments the moment someone starts being rude or dismissive. For every troll, there are 20 wonderful people ready to drown them out with kindness. It’s restored a bit of my faith in the internet, to be honest.And in turn, if my little videos encourage even one woman to get dressed, feel good, or treat herself with a bit more gentleness, then that’s a win in my book.Jen Walshaw is founder ofmuminthemadhouse.comExplore more on these topicsOlder peopleOpinionTikTokFeminismWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)commentShareReuse this content"

It’s time to get ridFri 26 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 11.40 ESTShareWhen I was a kid, our TV was in a television cabinet. For those unfamiliar with this preposterous abomination, it was a box on legs into which the TV was placed to hide it. It was some sort of furniture hangover from the era of covering a piano’s ankles lest they cause lustful sweats to break out under the starched collars of young gentlemen.The trouble is, a two-doored, TV-shaped-and-sized box in the corner of the room where the TV would usually be, cables trailing from its rear and armchairs angled towards it, was about as good a disguise as when a child lacking object permanence puts its hand up to its eyes and assumes the rest of the world can’t see it.The other thing is: the TV didn’t need a box. It already had a box built round it. It even had a nickname, in case that wasn’t evident enough: “the box”.A box does not need a box. And so, in the same vein, a sink does not need a second sink sitting in it.The washing-up bowl is indefensible. Think on this as you wash your Christmas dishes. A bowl within a bowl. A water receptacle within a water receptacle. It does everything the sink does, and less. It doesn’t drain, for one thing. It has to be emptied into the sink for that to happen. (Although there are now some with plugholes, as if the pointlessness of this recursive arrangement needed underliningad absurdum.)For something that deals with water and the making cleaner of things, the washing-up bowl has some unsavoury side effects: that sump of waterlogged food clinging to its bottom, for instance. Or the fact that, over time, it becomes furry, sprouting little mussel-like beards of plastic.PLASTIC.That’s the other thing. This unnecessary, unhygienic, wan-coloured prophylactic, like so much other tat designed to keep us at one remove from the reality of our homes (toilet-seat lid covers, plug-in air fresheners) is landfill-in-waiting.“But it saves water!” cry its approbators. What arrant balls. If the logic here is that it holds less water than a sink, then first, it isn’t much of a saving and, second, less water can be used in the sink. Using less water saves water. Using a receptacle within a receptacle doesn’t.If you put a large plastic bath-shaped tub in your bath before bathing, people would rightly think you’d lost your mind. Let your sink be proudly naked.

But now AI may be about to change thatFri 26 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 09.11 ESTShareThis summer, I found myself battling through traffic in the sweltering streets of Marseille. At a crossing, my friend in the passenger seat told me to turn right toward a spot known for its fish soup. But the navigation app Waze instructed us to go straight. Tired, and with the Renault feeling like a sauna on wheels, I followed Waze’s advice. Moments later, we were stuck at a construction site.A trivial moment, maybe. But one that captures perhaps the defining question of our era, in which technology touches nearly every aspect of our lives: who do we trust more – other human beings and our own instincts, or the machine?The German philosopher Immanuel Kantfamously defined the Enlightenmentas “man’s emergence from his self-imposed immaturity.” Immaturity, he wrote, “is the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another”. For centuries, that “other” directing human thought and life was often the priest, the monarch, or the feudal lord – the ones claiming to act as God’s voice on Earth. In trying to understand natural phenomena – why volcanoes erupt, why the seasons change – humans looked to God for answers. In shaping the social world, from economics to love, religion served as our guide.Humans, Kant argued, always had the capacity for reason. They just hadn’t always had the confidence to use it. But with the American and later the French Revolution, a new era was dawning: reason would replace faith, and the human mind, unshackled from authority, would become the engine of progress and a more moral world. “Sapere aude!” or “Have courage to use your own understanding!”, Kant urged his contemporaries.Two and a half centuries later, one may wonder whether we are quietly slipping back into immaturity. An app telling us which road to take is one thing. But artificial intelligence threatens to become our new “other” – a silent authority that guides our thoughts and actions. We are in danger of ceding the hard-won courage to think for ourselves – and this time, not to gods or kings, but to code.ChatGPT was launched only three years ago, and already one global survey, published in April, found that82% of respondents had used AIin the previous six months. Whether deciding to end a relationship or who to vote for, people are turning to machines for advice. According to OpenAI, 73% of user promptsconcern non work-related topics. Even more intriguing than our dependence on AI’s judgment in daily life is what happens when we let it speak for us. Writing is now among the most common uses of ChatGPT, second only to practical requests such as DIY or cooking advice. The American authorJoan Didion once said: “I write entirely to find out what I am thinking.” What happens when we stop writing? Do we stop finding out?Worryingly, some evidence suggests that the answer might be yes. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology used electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor thebrain activity of essay writersgiven access to AI, search engines like Google, or nothing at all. Those who could rely on AI showed the lowest cognitive activity and struggled to accurately quote their work. Perhaps most concerning was that over a couple of months, participants in the AI group became increasingly lazy, copying entire blocks of text in their essays.The study is small and imperfect, but Kant would have recognised the pattern. “Laziness and cowardice,” he wrote, “are the reasons why so great a proportion of men … remain in lifelong immaturity, and why it is so easy for others to establish themselves as their guardians. It is so easy to be immature.”Sure, AI’s appeal lies in its convenience. It saves time, spares effort and – crucially – offers a new way to offload responsibility. In his 1941 book, Escape from Freedom, the German psychoanalyst Erich Fromm argued that the rise of fascism could be explained in part by people preferring to surrender their freedom in exchange for the reassuring certainty of subordination. AI offers a new way of surrendering that burden of having to think and decide for yourself.AI’s greatest allure is that it can do things our minds can’t – sift through oceans of data and process it at unprecedented speed. Sitting in the car in Marseille, this was, after all, why I chose to trust the machine instead of my friend in the passenger seat (a decision she took as an insult). With access to all the data, surely the app must know best – or so I thought.The problem is thatAI is a black box. It produces knowledge, but without necessarily deepening human understanding. We don’t really know how AI reaches its conclusions – even the programmers admit as much. Nor can we verify its reasoning against clear, objective criteria. So when we follow AI’s advice, we are not guided by reason. We are back in the realm of faith.In dubiopromachina: when in doubt, trust the machine – that may become our future guiding principle.AI can be a formidable ally to humans in rational inquiry. It can help us invent drugs, or free us from “bullshit jobs”, or doing our taxes – tasks that demand little thought and offer little satisfaction. All the better. But Kant and his contemporaries did not plead the case of reason over faith just so humans could build better shelves or have more spare time. Critical thinking was not just about efficiency – it was a practice of freedom and human emancipation.Human thinking is messy and full of errors, but it forces us to debate, to doubt, to test ideas against one another – and to recognise the limits of our own understanding. It builds confidence, both individually and collectively. For Kant, the exercise of reason was never just about knowledge; it was about enabling people to become agents of their own lives, and resist domination. It was about building a moral community grounded in the shared principle of reason and debate, rather than blind belief.With all the benefits AI brings, the challenge is this: how can we harness its promise of superhuman intelligence without eroding human reasoning, the cornerstone of the Enlightenment and of liberal democracy itself? That may be one of the defining questions of the 21st century. It is one we would do well not to delegate to the machine.Joseph de Weck is a fellow with the Foreign Policy Research InstituteExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionPhilosophyComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

Today we look at how the struggle to adapt to a dangerously warming world has become a test of global justiceFri 26 Dec 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 14.04 ESTShareThe record-breaking 252mph winds of Hurricane Melissa that devastated Caribbean islands at the end of October were madefive times morelikely by the climate crisis.Scorching wildfire weatherin Spain and Portugal during the summer was made 40 times more likely, while June’sheatwave in Englandwas made 100 times more likely.Attribution sciencehas made one thing clear: global heating is behind today’s extreme weather. That greenhouse gas emissions warmed the planet was understood. What can now be shown is that this warming produces record heatwaves and more violent storms with increasing frequency.What we can do to minimise, or at least reduce, the risks to life from such events – as well as more gradual changes – is what climate adaptation experts think about all the time. The alarming consensus is that we are not doing anywhere near enough. The result is paid for in lives: floods and cyclonic storms acrossThailand, Sri Lanka and Indonesialeft hundreds dead at the end of November.The president of Cop30 in Brazil, André Corrêa do Lago, called for the UN climate change conference to be a “Cop of adaptation”. But the governments of the most vulnerable countries went home from Belém angry about an outcome that saw theprojected size of the annual adaptation budget triple to $120bn, but with the deadline pushed back to 2035 andno clear mechanismto make rich countries pay up.Even that total falls short of the$300bn in climate financeoverall that was agreed at Cop29 in 2024. The risk is that without international support, heavily indebted countries such as Jamaica become trapped, with resources that ought to be directed towards green energy and future-proofing being spent instead on coping with disasters.But the need for preparation is not limited to low-lying countries and those most affected by extreme heat and violent storms. This imbalance in climate programmes can be seen all over the world. Last month, a group of UK scientists organised what they called a “national emergency briefing” in London in an effort to alert people to the scale of the climate crisis threat – and alarming underpreparedness.Everyday injusticeIn the global context, thepolitics of adaptation are clear. Poorer countries, including the small island states whose existence is threatened by sea-level rises, have consistently argued that the rich nations whose historical and current emissions are responsible for climate heating must support them to adapt to the crisis, as well as to transition away from fossil fuels. Rightwing, nationalist governments in the west are extremely hostile to this idea – and toaid spendingmore broadly – even if their most vociferous objections are reserved for the phaseout of fossil fuels and net zero.But within wealthy countries, adaptation can appear more as a technocratic challenge than a political one. Policies regarding flood risks or increased resilience to high temperatures are not usually top priorities for voters – except when there is a disaster such as the floods in eastern Spain that led to theresignation of Carlos Mazón, president of Valencia, in November. While the grossly mismanaged water industry is a live political issue in England and Wales, big questions about natural resources and the resilience of infrastructure sit outside the daily cut and thrust, with responsibility delegated to arm’s-length agencies and rarely touched on by party leaders.Arecent reportfrom the UK’s Glacier Trust and Climate Majority Project argued that charities and politicians should seek to change this, and promote an “action-oriented public understanding of climate risk”. All must recognise that adaptation cannot simply be left to market forces because the economics of climate risk make private finance retreat just as danger rises.The long, low-profit investments needed to defend communities from flood, fire and heat are not attractive to private lenders. It is the state that must build seawalls or insure subsistence farmers when the risk becomes too great. Leah Aronowsky, a historian of science at Columbia University, says that climate risk is everyday injustice made worse – and she isrightto argue that how we adapt is a political battle.What adaptation should look likeOne reason that adaptation receives so little attention is the sheer urgency of cutting emissions. In the context of warnings that the 1.5C target in the Paris agreementcould move out of reach, mitigation – reducing or removing emissions – is the top priority.Discussing preparations for global heating can feel like a distraction or even an admission of defeat. But while it makes sense for climate campaigners to maintain the strongest possible pressure for emissions cuts, there ought to be scope to get ready for a hotter, more unstable climate as well. Under the terms of the UK’s Climate Change Act, the government is legally obliged to do so, and to regularly review its preparations.The UK’s Climate Change Committee will soon outline what a truly “well-adapted” country should look like: flood defences that can withstand the storms to come, transport links built for a harsher climate, food and supply chains resilient to global shocks, and coastal communities protected rather than abandoned. Experts also want to ensure that the 1.5m homes that the government has pledged to build in England alone are fit for the future. In an era of polarised attacks on net zero, such projects could help rebuild a shared belief in responsible care for the land.For the rich world, adaptation is prudent. For the poor world, it is survival. The latest UNreportis unequivocal: developing countries will need more than $310bn annually by 2035, yet received just $26bn in 2023. Catastrophicfloods in Asiaand worsening droughts inAfricathis year point to the growing need to accelerate climate adaptation.Under the Paris agreement,nationally determined contributions(NDCs) – country plans to tackle global heating – are meant to cover both emissions reduction and adaptation to climate impacts.But NDCs end up focusing mostly on cutting greenhouse gases and establishing decarbonisation pathways. That needs to change.National adaptation plans, which came out of Cop16, need to be foregrounded. These putadaptationcentre stage – and demand real plans, real finance, real justice. They ask the question that really matters now: how do vulnerable nations survive a warming world that emissions cuts alone can’t stop?Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s made them feel targeted for who they are, the band sayFri 26 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTShareJosh Breslaw was looking forward to a homecoming gig with his band of two decades’ standing. Oi Va Voi, a predominantly Jewish collective mixing traditional eastern European folk tunes with drum’n’bass and dance, were due to conclude a spring tour of Turkey with a gig in May at Bristol’s Strange Brew club, plus one in Brighton where Breslaw lives. But then, after protests from local activists about both the band’s past performances in Israel, and with Israeli singer Zohara, Strange Brew abruptly cancelled, citing “the ongoing situation in Gaza”.To be told they hadn’t met the venue’s “ethical standards” was devastating, says Breslaw, the band’s 52-year-old drummer: “It felt so unjust.” But worse came when his home-town venue cancelled in solidarity. “It changed how I felt about the city, how I felt about parts of the music industry. And it changed how I felt about the political home I always felt I lived in.” Although the Brighton promoter swiftly apologised, only in November did Strange Brew issue a statementsaying it had “made a mistake”, adding that the band likely only attracted scrutiny because they are “a Jewish band performing with an Israeli singer”.Feelings clearly remain raw when I meet Breslaw and fellow band member Steve Leviin north London’s JW3 community centre. It offers everything you’d expect from a neighbourhood arts venue: posters advertising a panto, children’s craft – and one thing found only in Jewish spaces, namely thorough airport-style security frisking at the gate.Since the Manchester synagogue attack, inwhich two worshippers died in a car and knife attack on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, the community has stepped up already tight security, says Breslaw: buy tickets for a small Jewish play or book reading, and the location may be disclosed only 24 hours before. Levi, the band’s 49-year-old clarinet player, hates the fact they had to hire extra security for a recent gig at north London’s Islington Assembly Hall: “Musicians shouldn’t have to look over their shoulder when they’re on stage.” Although this interview was conducted before the 14 December terror attack on Jews celebrating Hanukah on Bondi beach in Sydney, Australia, at the time of writing the Gaza ceasefire is fragile and the climate in Britain remains febrile.Against this backdrop, Oi Va Voi aren’t alone in their reservations about a regalvanised cultural boycott campaign, which asks artists to sever links with Israeli counterparts in solidarity with Gaza. This longstanding campaign, echoing tactics used against apartheid South Africa, insists it’s strictly peaceful. But the Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood – who recently played Tel Aviv – had two UK gigs with the Israeli musician Dudu Tassa cancelled after credible threats to the venue. There are signs, too, of the line between boycotting Israelis and targeting Jews blurring. Two British Jewish comedians, Rachel Creeger – whose show is about motherhood – and Philip Simon, had shows cancelled at this year’s Edinburgh festival fringe, over what the venue called staff safety concerns over additional security measures needed. Simon had a second run of shows cancelled after the venue cited his “views concerning the humanitarian situation in Palestine”, including social media posts criticising the actors’ union Equity’s support for a Palestine march. (Simon said he had “never expressed support for anything other than freeing the hostages and finding a path for peace” and that he was being “cancelled just for being Jewish”.)View image in fullscreenOi Va Voi on stage.Photograph: Tariana GorilovskyWhat worries Breslaw is what he sees as the creeping normalisation of the idea that British Jews are somehow suspect. Although he stresses he isn’t in any sense comparing cancellation to the Manchester attack, for him there’s a connection: “It’s deciding that this group of people is responsible for something and they’re a threat, when they couldn’t be further from a threat; they’re a vulnerable group of people that are under attack in this country. And the people who are putting us under attack need to take a look at how that’s happening, because itleadsto Manchester.”Oi Va Voi were, he argues, subjected to scrutiny that other musicians aren’t “because we were known as a Jewish band”. And it’s the singling out of a minority on ethnic grounds, in an arts scene that prides itself on inclusion, that he fears.Oi Va Voi formed in the early 00s out of a group of friends experimenting with combining klezmer melodies – folk tunes from their grandparents’ time – and the sounds of their own era, from drum’n’bass to breakbeat, soul and jazz. Breslaw and Levi are the only enduring members of a lineup that was “basically people discovering music that their parents thought was a bit naff”, says the former. But it was also, says the latter, about keeping the old songs alive. Across two decades they have played Glastonbury, won two BBC Radio 3 World Music awards, featured a young KT Tunstall as guest singer and even gigged at the Kremlin (though not for Vladimir Putin, they stress; “I think it was Russian Jewish man of the year or something”). Until May, they’d played across Europe without incident – including in predominantly Muslim Turkey, where some fans went so far as getting Oi Va Voi tattoos. Their music often addresses feelings about exile and migration, with resonance well beyond the Jewish community.Amid the cancellation furore, a young Iranian messaged Breslaw on Instagram, saying he had listened to the band’s 2003 hit Refugee daily before leaving to seek asylum in Germany. “And I was like: ‘OK, these people that are cancelling us have no concept of what we have tried to do with our music,’” he says. “Refugee was always about the human story: how does it feel to be on that journey, to be that lost and alone?”Promoters don’t want the heat … They think: You know what, it’s not worth the troubleIt is against this background that in May, Strange Brew asked them to explain activists’ allegations of playing “occupied Palestinian lands”. (They say they have gigged in Tel Aviv, which isn’t in the occupied territories – though activists who don’t accept Israel’s right to exist sometimes deem the entire country occupied.) There were also objections to the cover of an album Zohara made separately from the band, Welcoming the Golden Age, which featured her naked in a field gathering watermelons in a wheelbarrow. Her bandmates say she meant it only as a statement about “femininity, going back to nature”, and didn’t realise that the cut fruit – whose colours echo the Palestinian flag – has become a popular symbol of Palestinian resistance, especially on western social media.“I’ve spoken to some Israeli people who have never heard of this watermelon thing,” says Levi. Breslaw points out that there are easier ways of determining Zohara’s politics than reading sinister meanings into album covers: in Tel Aviv she’s been a very active anti-war protester, whose recent single denounced the Netanyahu government’s reluctance to end the war. “She’s being criticised not for who she is, what she stands for, but where she was born.”Zohara herself posted on Instagram at the time that the row was secondary to “the only thing that truly matters: ending the starvation in Gaza, bringing all the hostages home and stopping Israel’s bombardments”.Yet at the time Oi Va Voi chose not to defend themselves by taking a stance on the war, and even now they won’t say exactly what they think about it: first on the grounds that British Jews aren’t accountable for a foreign government; and second that they don’t see why they can’t just get on with making music. “I don’t understand this need for all the artists out there to make their statement, as if – if they didn’t make it – people would assume that they must really love the war,” says Breslaw. “Come on, it’s ridiculous.” Nor, he says, do they want their cancellation weaponised for dubious political ends. “We don’t want to be dragged into a culture war from the hard right.”What they will say, to anyone confused as to how British Jews can be offended both by being treated as synonymous with Israelis and by the rap duo Bob Vylan chanting “death to the IDF” on stage, is that diaspora emotions are complicated. Many British Jews, Breslaw explains, have loved ones in Israel. “That doesn’t mean they support what’s going on, it just means they’re more connected. So if you call for the destruction of that place, it’s going to make people feel worried and uneasy.”Moreover, he won’t rule out Oi Va Voi playing in Israel again. Cultural boycotts can, he argues, isolate and push away the very creatives trying hardest to find solutions. “What does it do to an artist like Zohara who spends most of her time on the streets protesting against her government, fighting really hard, making music that is specifically anti-war? The people in the boycott organisations say: ‘Well there’s got to be some collateral damage’ but no I don’t really see the need.” Although he understands the strength of feeling, “if people think that by cancelling Oi Va Voi or posting aggressive comments [on messageboards] they’re inching closer to solving the Middle East peace process then I think they’re very wrong”.So do they agree with the Jewish protesters calling recently for the cancellation of a Bob Vylan gig in London? “I’m not into the cancelling of things. But I do think if someone wants to play they should be responsible, and they shouldn’t be calling for hate and death,” says Breslaw. Levi argues that the line is crossed “when you’re inciting racial hatred, because that’s illegal”. But mostly, they’re wary of political statements, preferring the music to do the talking.It was Levi’s idea to respond to cancellation with exuberant dance track Back to My Roots, built round a klezmer melody. All about “standing proud, restating what you’re about, that we’re still playing as a band”, it includes synagogue-style cantorial singing and a blast of shofar, the ram’s horn traditionally blown at the Jewish new year.“That’s about calling you back to who you are every year,” Levi says.Through several newer songs – including Dance Again, a response to the Nova festival massacre, and the title singlefrom their new album The Water’s Edge – runs the idea underpinning many Jewish religious festivals, of defying adversity with hope. “It’s about a persecuted minority surviving,” says Levi.Returning to live gigging is, for the band, also an expression of that desire not to be erased. But post-cancellation, says Breslaw, some bookers seem wary. “I think it’s just they don’t want the heat of the intimidatory tactics of the people that want to see bands like us cancelled. They think: You know what, it’s not worth the trouble.”He understands the fear of losing business, he says; the sense across the arts world that it may be easier to give in than risk a backlash. “But if everyone does that, where does that leave us?”Explore more on these topicsCultureFolk musicDance musicJudaismReligioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Yes, Winona Ryder has been unforgivably sidelined. And yes, some characters are trapped in a room filling with yoghurt. But despite our misgivings, this show still absolutely slapsStuart HeritageThu 25 Dec 2025 20.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 10.51 ESTShareListen, this isn’t the place for newcomers.Stranger Thingshas been around for almost a decade, and it has spent almost all this time building a mythology that has grown so unwieldy that trying to explain it would cost me my wordcount and my will to live.However, in fairness, this new penultimate batch of episodes gives it a good try. The content of these new episodes can neatly be split into three categories. There’s action, which is high-octane and fun, and probably why you’re watching. Then there’s dialogue, which is less successful because it causes characters to stop moving and emote at each other, even though they should probably be concentrating on the imminent end of the world.And then there is explanation, of which there is a ton. You will remember that Stranger Things was initially conceived as a one-off, and its success forced the Duffer Brothers to cake on endless new lore to keep the engine running. Well, things have become so convoluted that maybe 40% of the show is taken up with people reminding other people what the hell is going on. The second episode of this new batch is so incomprehensible that Maya Hawke has to stop everything so that she can very slowly explain the plot, using props, as if talking to children. It doesn’t exactly scream entertainment.And yet more lore is caked on by the second. The thrust of these episodes is that the Upside Down (the evil parallel dimension at the heart of the show) isn’t actually a parallel dimension. It is in fact a wormhole to an even worse dimension, and Vecna (who remains a winning cross between the Grinch and an unbroadcastable outtake from a colon cleanse commercial) is trying to collapse it so he can take over the world.View image in fullscreenSadie Sink as Max Mayfield and Nell Fisher as Holly Wheeler in Stranger Things: season five.Photograph: NetflixAnd our young – well, youngish, since the male cast is now 90% Adam’s apple – heroes have to stop him. Some of them are in the real world. Some are in the Upside Down. Some are in a secret memory world hidden inside the Upside Down. For some reason, two of them are trapped in a room that’s slowly filling up with yoghurt. No, really.So the fact that none of this is unbearable is miraculous. Stranger Things is one of those shows that, when it gets everything rolling in the right direction, absolutely slaps. It’s a grand, pedal-to-the-metal spectacle where everything is maxed out to the nth degree. The action sequences are beautifully choreographed. The nostalgia remains extremely effective. The emotion rarely drops below operatic. On a second-by-second basis, Stranger Things is amazing.The downfall of season five’s release strategy, though, is that it gives you time between episodes to think. We had a month to sit with the last batch, and a week until the finale, and the moment you apply any level of reason to the show, the entire thing falls apart.View image in fullscreenCaleb McLaughlin as Lucas Sinclair and Priah Ferguson as Erica Sinclair in Stranger Things: season five.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/Netflix © 2025You notice that almost every character becomes significantly more or less intelligent at any given moment, based on the demands of the plot. You start counting all the characters, and realise that more than half of them are dramatically superfluous. You realise how old and tired the children look, and that the sidelining of Winona Ryder is unforgivable.Usually at this late stage of a landmark drama series, things winnow down. Unnecessary characters and extraneous plot points are shed so that the finale can deliver with maximum power. Look at Breaking Bad, which cut everything away so that the final episode could focus on Walter White settling his last scores. Look at The Sopranos, which systematically killed off characters to prepare us for Tony’s fate in the finale. Even Mad Men dropped its ad industry sheen to concentrate on Don Draper’s personal collapse and rehabilitation.But not Stranger Things. As things stand, the finale has a mountain of admin to battle through. Vecna needs to be defeated. Children need to be rescued. The world needs to be saved. The evil scientists – who started all this, remember – need to be stopped. And then, when all that is done, it somehow needs to find believable and distinct emotional denouements for (if I’ve counted correctly) 17 characters. There is so much work to do in such a short space of time it’s unfathomable how the Duffers can wrap a satisfying bow around such a sprawling mass. Then again, stranger things have happened. Let’s talk again next week.Stranger Things is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsStranger ThingsTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

At the heart of the plot: why did an innocent-looking kid called Jamie (Owen Cooper) commit such a brutal murder? The third episode lifted the lid. As Jamie is interviewed by psychologist Briony (Erin Doherty), we see him slowly reveal that he’s not an innocent kid, but warped by misogyny and a twisted sense of entitlement. The episode was captivating in its acting, but it stayed with you: from Jamie’s sudden switch from vulnerability to manipulation, to the moment the camera zooms in on Briony’s face as she registers who Jamie really is. Horrifying.Celia fartsNot only did The Celebrity Traitors have the best reality show casting of all time, but there were also so many scenes of hilarity and joy that it resulted in some of the best television of the year. It peaked with something no one could have anticipated:Celia Imriefarting in a tense moment at the start of a challenge. “It’s nerves, but I always own up,” admitted Imrie, as everyone else corpsed around her. Bafta has a TV moment of the year award, so I look forward to May 2026, when an acclaimed actor with a five-decade career wins a Bafta for … passing wind.‘You Ain’t My Mother’ 2.0EastEnders has had a belter of a year, from its faultless 40th anniversary live episode to an opening scene of Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden)yelling at a chicken. The soap also had a homage to one of its greatest andmost quoted scenes, when Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) yelled “you ain’t my mother!” to Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), who responded … “YES I AM!” Zoe’s high-profile return took place on the same street, in the rain, with the characters spaced just as they were when the exchange took place. Goosebumps.The Doctor regenerates into … Who?!When the BBC teamed up with Disney to help fund and distributeDoctor Who, it was anticipated that this supercharged “Whoniverse” would herald an exciting new era for the long-running sci-fi show. Yet despite some ambitious Russell T Davies storytelling, ratings sagged, Ncuti Gatwa quit and Disney decided not to renew the deal.Yet this wasn’t the most surprising part. It was the ending to the series finale The Reality War, where The Doctor regenerated into … 2005 companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper). Although we don’t know yet if she is actually The Doctor, or this is Rose again and The Doctor is somewhere else.

News of their departure not only blindsided viewers, but also the show’s judges, dancers and contestants. The timing was weird, too. Was it to get ahead of a tabloid paper? And why didn’t the BBC press office announce their departure at the same time? Strange.Bob Mortimer bosses itPrime Video shows are usually a hodge podge of random ideas drawn out of a hat (Lord of the Rings and the short-lived reboot of Neighbours, for instance). This year they had a bona fide hit with a super simple premise: put a bunch of comedians in a room and make them compete to get each other to laugh – without laughing themselves.It resulted in some truly unhinged television: Joe Wilkinson’s surrealspeech on the RNLI, Daisy May Cooper imitating a rollercoaster ride witha leaf blowerand the fridge being opened to find acackling Alison Hammond. The format was a playground for Bob Mortimer, who made Judi Love laugh simply bysitting on a chair. His steely resistance to humour made him the outright winner, evenbeating strong competitorRichard Ayoade. The fact that Mortimer has already been confirmed to return in the second series almost makes up for him not being in The Celebrity Traitors.Bake Off #bingate is backIn 2014, Bake Off contestant Iain thought his baked alaska was doomed after fellow contestant Diana temporarily took it out of the freezer. It resulted in him dumpinghis mixture in the bin, which he laterpresentedto judges Paul and Mary.I know. A simpler time, but I digress. Almost 10 years on, Iain, a different contestant with the same name, decided to make a tribute to the moment in his showstopper. Not by baking a baked alaska. No. He baked us the bin.Paul Hollywood later criticised the bin’s flavours (a sentence I never thought I would write). Iain (the 2025 baker) responded: “Those were Iain’s original flavours. I’m not trying to pass the buck!” Hollywood then broke the fourth wall addressing 2014 Iain. “I really didn’t like the bake. I’m so sorry.”James Acaster punches a polar bearSaturday Kitchen is usually the home of cooking demonstrations, old Rick Stein clips and if you’re lucky, somespectacular unintended innuendo. However, one episode this year went off the rails. When the public had to vote on whether James Acaster and Ed Gamble’s “food heaven” was to be cooked, loser Acaster did a dramatic overreaction,punching a polar bearthen attacking a Christmas tree. Bon appetit.‘We’re sorry we upset you, Carol’Pluribus,Vince Gilligan’s Apple TV serieswhich is like Breaking Bad meets Lost, started with protagonist Carol (Rhea Seehorn) watching on in horror as everyone around her convulses without explanation. Carol races home, turns on the television and flicks through the channels, hoping to find some reassuring news. Instead, in an almighty twist, Carol finds a man in the White House press room asking her directly to ring the number on the screen, who breaks the news to her that humanity has been taken over by a happy hive mind. But don’t worry Carol, he reassures her. “Your life is your own.”Joel’s brutal endYou can tell an OG fan of video game adaptation The Last of Us by whether they knew aboutthe death of Joel (Pedro Pascal)before it actually happened. Joel’s death was particularly brutal. A revenge attack by Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) after Joel killed her father, he was shot and repeatedly beaten with a golf club and then stabbed. Ellie (Bella Ramsey) could only look on in horror, as she saw Joel’s demise.Louis Theroux gets shovedOne of the standout documentaries of the year was when Louis Theroux saw first hand how Israeli settlements have accelerated in the West Bank. In one encounter, settlers point a laser sight through the window of a Palestinian home he visits. In another scene, he asks a balaclava-wearing armed Israeli soldier not to touch him while visiting a high-security area of Hebron with a Palestinian resident.Towards the end of the episode, we see a tense exchange between Theroux and Daniella Weiss, a leading figure in the settler movement. After Weiss denies settler violence against Palestinians, Theroux presses back that there’s video evidence. Weiss responds by unexpectedly shoving Theroux, hoping that he responds, as part of her explanation that such video evidence does not show the full picture. “That seems sociopathic,” responds Theroux. Ouch.Zero star hellDespite an A-list cast of Kim Kardashian, Glenn Close and Sarah Paulson, Ryan Murphy’s female-fronted legal drama All’s Fair becamethe 18th zero-star reviewin the Guardian’s 204-year history.It might end up being the only accolade the show will ever get. Described bythe Guardian’s TV criticLucy Mangan as “so awful, it feels almost contemptuous,” the plot, pacing, acting and script were all diabolical, resulting in, at one point, a 0% rating on thecritic website Rotten Tomatoes(it has since nudged upwards, but it’s still under 10%.)“I personally think that the first three episodes were the weakest,”Close later admitted in an interview with Variety. “That was a tough way to start. I’ve seen all nine episodes, and I think it actually adds up to something.” What a ringing endorsement!No longer Serving KantView image in fullscreenStill serving … Miriana Conte at Eurovision.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersEurovision this year was once again overshadowed by thetalk surrounding Israel’s inclusion, but one other story that came out from the contest was Maltese entrant Miriana Conte being told that if she wanted to compete, she would have to changethecontroversial C-word referencing lyricsof hersong Serving Kant.“It does sound as if you’re trying to use this sort of quite popular millennial phrase,” Newsnight’sFaisal Islam quizzed Conte, carefully skirting around what the popular phrase actually was.“To me, it means ‘serving singing’,” Conte said. However, as Conte’s performance saw her singing in front of a screen of a giant pair of open legs, I’m pretty sure everyone knew what she was referring to anyway.Rylan refuses to bareback liveAllow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

Rylan refused to participate in the discussion in case the chat went off the rails, which it inevitably did anyway.‘We’re soft-skinned, soft-skinned’Acclaimed Northern Ireland police drama Blue Lights has a knack for luring you in with a false sense of security (here are the coppers having a nice snack in their police car!) before an unexpected twist or heart-rending scene that leaves you on the floor.Episode five was a textbook example, when officers joked andplayed a song from Westlifefollowed swiftly by an altercation where Shane (Frank Blake) became unable to use both legs after being attacked in the thigh with a wine glass.Yet that wasn’t even the most tense moment. It was that episode’s cliffhanger: an active threat against a vehicle being driven by Constable Grace Ellis (Siân Brooke) with the attackers following them in the car behind (“Is your vehicle armoured or soft-skinned?” “We’re soft-skinned, soft-skinned.” “Shit.”) Yikes.Mummy Pig is pregnant!Good Morning Britain usually consists of two people with opposing views yelling at each other about a non-essential issue at 7.45am. Yet this year, the breakfast show went in a more surreal direction with Peppa Pig’s Mummy Pig announcing live on the programme that she was pregnant with her third piglet.Naturally, the country and all news media lost all sense of proportion. When Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig presented new baby Evie outside the Lindo Wing, the same hospital where the Princess of Wales had her baby a decade earlier, the Daily Mail reported concerns about why Mummy and Daddy Pig had both gone private rather than going with the NHS. No, I am not taking any of this out of context.Cunk does Who Do You Think You Are?Diane Morgan, the comedian behind the spoof documentary presenter Philomena Cunk, was the subject on the genealogy seriesWho Do You Think You Are?Inevitably, it resulted in her delightfully taking the mickey out of the show and the genre while appearing on it. At one point, she said“I wonder how much wandering aimlesslyI’ll be doing during this” before we got a shot of her doing just that. “My only reservation of doing this was the slow head rotation at the start. It makes me cringe just watching it,” Morgan told Who Do You Think You Are?, as her head started rotating slowly. Classic.Paul Merton takes on AndrewMountbatten-WindsorHave I Got News for You has a knack for recording an episode when major news breaks, such as its post-2015 election special when both the then Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg coincidentally stood down mid-recording.Earlier this year, another such event happened again. When news came that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor had lost his royal title, the production team slipped the development to guest host Jason Manford, who revealed it to a shocked audience.Jason Manford: “Andrew is no longer a prince.”Paul Merton, as always, came backwith a perfect quip.“The bad news is he’s become king.”MasterChef was cookedAllow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

The inevitable frantic re-editing led to a bizarre sequence noticed by viewers, when the exact same shot of Wallace appeared three times in less than a minute.‘How much is a 69 in your area?’It wouldn’t be a TV moments list without a few British news fails. Howler of the Year went to Sky News, with a guest on their paper review commenting that it was “great” that Pope Francis was feeling better from double pneumonia, only for it to be followed by breaking news thathe had in fact died.Innuendo of the Year was a heated battle between East Midlands BBC Weather presenter Rob Rose who said “and you can probably see Uranus as well” (he was actually talking about the clear night sky) and the Irish breakfast television presenter who asked viewers “how much is a69 in your area?” when he meant to say 99.Yet it was Peter Levy on BBC Look North who won overall, after commenting “mine’s only a small one but it did go up this weekend”. He was referring, of course,to a Christmas tree.The Maryam Moshiri Award went to BBC News presenter Maryam Moshiri, who this year failed toshow the middle fingerbut did do animpression of a peacock.The most coveted prize, Fail of the Year, went to an event on radio rather than on television, when BBC Radio Derby presenter Ian Skye had severe cramp while introducing a record.

Fingerpicked acoustic guitar and her extraordinary vocals – husky, expressive, elegant – are front and centre. The arrangement is subtle but not drearily tasteful: arching noise that could be feedback or a distorted pedal steel guitar, which gradually swells into something climactic before dying away. The lyrics, meanwhile, concern themselves with selling out: “Maybe I’m an analyst, an antisocial bitch,” she sings. “Who sells her dreams for money.”It’s a topic that speaks to Annahstasia’s turbulent music industry history: signed at 17 to a label that tried to mould her into a mainstream pop star, she quit and pursued a more singular vision. Tether acts as vindication, announcing the arrival of a strikingly unique voice. It slips from Slow’s seductive take on soul to the raging alt-rock of Believer, but every track has its author’s unique character stamped through it. These are superbly written, remarkably moving songs, delivered by a singer who knows exactly how to use her vocals to cut the listener deep: when to exercise restraint, when to express halting uncertainty, when to let fly with impassioned vibrato. The result is an album that feels intimate and revealing: the kind you don’t so much listen to as enter into a relationship with.Alexis PetridisValentina Magaletti and YPY – Kansai BruisesView image in fullscreenArresting … Valentina Magaletti and YPY.Photograph: Yuki NakagawaThere’s a tendency to single out prolific musicians as “hard-working”, though one of the joys of following Italian drummer Valentina Magaletti through the underground is how effortlessly and innately she races through different gears. This year she released a remix album of her excellent 2024 album Estradas with Afro-Portuguese producer Nídia, put out a mighty new EP with her abrasive trio Moin and collaborated with the writer Fanny Chiarello. Then there’s this wildly exhilarating record with YPY, AKA Japanese musician Koshiro Hino, also of Goat (jp), which highlights the delirious musicality of her playing as his synths and her filigreed attack become inextricable.You might very well think: “Thirty-seven minutes of pure percussion? No, thank you.” But even if you don’t know your Chris Corsano from your Kahil El’Zabar, Kansai Bruises is immediately arresting in its virtuosity, high-wire thrills and textural delight. The hyper detail of One Hour Visa feels like synaptic overload, Magaletti and Hino’s mind-meld swerving like an out-of-control sled down a slalom. You hear Magaletti yelping “yeah!” in the title track, and wonder how great and gruelling it must feel to flit from tuneful patter to drone-line rumble then hand-style patterned percussion in a matter of seconds, an electric run aptly characterised by Hino’s shooting sparks. Lantern Lit Run has a dazed swirl to its gait that feels like drunkenly blinking at a city’s bright lights; then it dissipates to the steamy hiss of hot springs. More of a showcase for Hino, Her Own Reflection makes his synths blossom through the rubble Magaletti strews with abandon. The gleeful aggression of Kansai Bruises is so overwhelming that it becomes oddly relaxing: another indication of Magaletti’s preternatural talent.Laura SnapesMadison Cunningham – AceMarriage as a grape plucked and crushed, a plane downed in an open field, a town patrolled by wolves: for her gripping third album, Californian folk musician Madison Cunningham calls on a host of haunting metaphors to describe falling in love at 17 and divorcing by 27.A record about rebirth, or “dying in reverse”, Ace shifts the focus from Cunningham’s celebrated, dextrous guitar work. Instead, she and her touring band harness elemental power from vast woodwind arrangements and slicing strings – all the better to capture the terrifying, breathless possibilities of starting over. “You say you know every mole and skin tag, like it makes you wiser to the person I am,” she sings, steely with new self-knowledge, on piano ballad Take Two.Cunningham’s previous LPs (including the Grammy-winning Revealer) used songwriting to search for clarity. But Ace, named after “the strongest and the weakest card in the pack”, finds the truth to be slippery, contradictory, two-sided. Grief and desire are circular on single My Full Name, while the album’s slow-burn finale Best of Us tackles the slippery slope that is faking it, just a little, until you’re faking it more than you’re not. What happens when the facade finally cracks? This stormy, career-best record holds the answer.Katie HawthorneSarz – Protect Sarz at All CostsSarz: Getting Paid ft Asake, Wizkid, Skillibeng – videoAnyone with any interest in Afrobeats knows that the Nigerian producer Sarz has been an architect and alchemist of some of its best sounds, from Wizkid’s Come Closer to Lojay’s Monalisa. I’ve also seen him DJ at some of the best African music nights in London: not a realm he originally planned on venturing into, but one that naturally emerged from his production work as he wanted to learn how to influence the psychology of a crowd and get them moving. With his momentous, Black diaspora-surfing debut album Protect Sarz at All Costs, he lays a solid claim to the title of Nigeria’s most deft curator and enchanter of swinging hips.There are some of his usual collaborators here in Asake and Lojay, but there is also the Ndlovu Youth Choir from South Africa, French-Congolese singer Theodora and Cameroonian-American artist Libianca. They help him helm an incredible span of sounds: orchestral flourishes, traditional African percussion and futuristic afro-pop textured EDM. Like many ambitious projects by Afrobeats artists, Protect Sarz at All Costs is genre-fluid, encompassing amapiano, hip-hop, afroswing, 90s R&B and alté. The result is a potpourri of different moods: one of my favourite tracks, African Barbie, is sensual and fierce, while Getting Paid takes its cues from luxury rap about the spoils that a business in music and entertainment confers. With Sarz’s presence stretching beyond the African continent to fill dancefloors across the world, his debut doesn’t mark an arrival, but an assertion of his prodigious talent.Jason OkundayeDaniel Avery – TremorView image in fullscreenBrooding … Daniel Avery.Photograph: Kalpesh LathigraDaniel Avery’s Tremor is an album I feel like a fine film of grease on my skin, or the thin, constricting sensation of nylons pulled tight over my face while I do crimes. It’s an album that sounds like furtive behaviour, full of dark, industrial sounds and brooding, lurking musical alleyways. The first time I listened to it, I was walking home after dark with my hood up against the drizzle. It made me feel as if I was up to absolutely no good (but was actually on my way home from book club).Avery gathered a community of interesting, understated voices around him to make Tremor and the result is a far cry from the accessible techno he produced in his youth: though it occasionally feints in that direction as it roils through genres, Tremor’s droning guitars and clipped live drums slink beneath breathily delivered lyrics; the only way you could call it techno is if you said it was something like deconstructed post-techno industrial noisecore, which, let’s not. If Nine Inch Nails hung out in Dalston for a bit, they might come up with something approaching this record. If Deftones played a show underwater, you might get something a bit like Tremor; a seething, serpentine album that seeps into being and lingers, goading you into mischief like the devil on your shoulder.Kate SolomonAnthony Naples – ScannersNaples emerged in the mid-2010s amid a wave of dance producers making lo-fi house music (such as Delroy Edwards, Actress, DJ Boring and most of the LIES roster). Consciously or not, that loose scene seemed to be a bulwark against the shine of EDM. Since then, Naples’ work has only matured: 2023’s Orbs was spellbinding ambient techno, and the follow-up is richer still.It’s a more populist album than Orbs, with vocal samples, higher tempos and playful detailing such as the discordant jazz piano chords of Somebody, or the neo-acid squiggle running through Bounce that undulates the grid around it. Hi Lo is classic Basic Channel-style dub techno, as if swooping through mists on to a city-planet at dawn, while the title track still has that Germanic bearing but with a more golden-hour, late-afternoon light. Mushy, meanwhile, sounds like the kind of early 90s track that ex-ravers get misty-eyed about in YouTube comment sections. The highlight is Night: cantering along at 134bpm, it’s as if shards of digital light are hurtling past your field of vision.In a dance scene that lauds old-school legends and the latest hype-cyclists but can forget about those in between, it’s great to see Naples still steadily moving forward, iterating and improving his craft with every release.Ben Beaumont-ThomasRadu Lupu: The Unreleased RecordingsView image in fullscreenThrillingly vivid ... Radu Lupu in Bologna, Italy, 2017.Photograph: Roberto Serra/Iguana Press/RedfernsLupu was a pianist whose beguiling sound world was allied to a mind of such penetrating musical intelligence that it sometimes seemed miraculous. He died in 2022; Decca, for whom he recorded exclusively for over two decades, released his complete recordings in 2015, but to mark what would have been the pianist’s 80th birthday, the company produced this wonderful surprise: six discs made up of unreleased studio sessions and BBC, Dutch and SWR radio tapes, dating between 1970 and 2002, of works that the Romanian pianist otherwise did not record.While there is more familiar Lupu territory (Mozart and Schubert) in some of the discs, much of the set is less expected. Lupu recorded little Chopin, but here is a thrillingly vivid performance of the B minor Scherzo, more uncharacteristic still is Copland’s Sonata, fierce and majestic, from the Aldeburgh festival in 1971, while Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition sees him making a rare venture into the Russian repertory; it comes from a 1984 Dutch broadcast, his tone noticeably rawer, almost strident at times. In general, though, the recording quality serves the exemplary playing well enough; every track is a treat.Explore more on these topicsMusicBest music of 2025Pop and rockSoulElectronic musicExperimental musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Alex Novak, he said his name was. Mildly funny, bit depressed. Mostly told jokes about getting divorced. Weirdest thing though: he lookedexactlylikethat guy from Arrested Development.“I was so naively unaware of what to expect,” saysWill Arnett, almost a year later. “I’ve been comedy-adjacent for a lot of my life, but not a comedian. I had no idea what I was in for.”That was a crash course in confessional standup. Five nights a week, for six weeks, Arnett would write and perform material across the city, going up cold, ignoring any hecklers who might insist he was actually the star of one of the US’s best-loved sitcoms, as well asBoJack Horseman, Blades of Glory, The Lego Movie etc.All this to prepare for his first dramatic movie lead as a man who walks into a bar, finds he can dodge the entrance fee if he agrees to five minutes on stage in the basement comedy club – and finds himself in the process.View image in fullscreen‘The only laughter I could hear was at the back of the room, and it was Bradley’ … Will Arnett in Is This Thing On?Photograph: Jason McDonald/Searchlight Pictures“Every time a comic goes on stage, they are jumping off a cliff,” says Arnett. “It’s unnerving and very scary.” Sometimes it paid off. One night he went to a club, “andkilledit. They loved it. Really vibed with me. And then I went around the corner to a different club, did the same jokes, and completely bombed.”Some actors are smaller than you expect. Arnett is more substantial: tall and brawny. Still, he withers at the memory. “There’s nowhere to hide. You feel your soul leaving your body. I’d gone up with such confidence, but there was just this profound silence. The only laughter I could hear was at the back of the room, and it was Bradley.”Every time a comic goes on stage, they are jumping off a cliff. It’s unnerving and very scary.Will ArnettBradley isBradley Cooper. This is his third film as writer-director; he also co-stars as Alex’s best friend, a vain actor called Balls. Also rubbernecking from the crowd that night was Andra Day, who plays Balls’ waspish wife Christine.“It was so cool to watch Will’s body absorb how the audience was not responding,” she says with glee. “Every little gesture. How uncomfortable his head was.” Day is a singer-songwriter; years of gigs mean she knows how it feels when patter dies. “But I have the luxury of saying: ‘All right! Let’s play the next track! Move on!’”Arnett, however, struggled to turn a doomed ship around. “You try to recalibrate by amping up the delivery,” he says, but then people seem yet more repelled. “Comedy is much more of a conversation than I realised. You have to listen to them respond before you build toward the punchline. To let them be invested. You want them to lean in.”View image in fullscreen‘My generation had fairytales’ … Laura Dern with Will Arnett, and Calvin Knegten.Photograph: Jason McDonald/Searchlight PicturesCooper’s films are, it’s fair to say, interested in this transaction. In how performing both feeds and leeches; how being adored or torn apart by strangers affects your personal life. A Star Is Born, Maestro and Is This Thing On? all feature scenes in which someone falls in love (or back in love) with the protagonist as they perform live. “What seems to recur,” says Cooper – or, in fact, emails, of which more later – “is the idea that artistic expression requires a vulnerability that reveals something deeply human. In each of the films, the moment of falling in love happens when that truth becomes visible.”In this case, that happens when Alex’s ex, Tess (Laura Dern), goes on a date with another man and they wind up at a club where Alex happens to be performing. Unseen at the back, unaware the man she was married to for decades had ever even considered comedy, she watches agog, by turns appalled, amused – and turned on. “Tess glimpses the person she once loved coming back into focus,” says Cooper.In a London hotel room down the hall from Arnett, Dern leans forward keenly. “This theme of committing to being unhappy with someone touches meso much,” she says. “It’s the same experience many of us have had in a relationship: how did we get here? How have we lost ourselves and each other? The film taught me a lot as a woman about the goal of a relationship – that it has to be that whole journey all the time. Because,” she continues, “we are ever-evolving organisms!” She smiles: engaged, evangelical even, all empathy and connection.View image in fullscreen‘Once you drop the act, you never wanna go back in’ … Andra Day with Bradley Cooper (left) and Will Arnett.Photograph: Jason McDonald/Searchlight PicturesAlex and Tess reconcile as each finds the freedom to explore their own passions (him: comedy, her: basketball). Growth is essential, the film suggests. So is realism. Being unhappy with someone isn’t great, but being unhappy alongside them might be the best we can hope for.Dern thinks her generation (she’s 58) is often too entrenched to compromise, let alone reinvent. Her children – Ellery, 25, and Jaya, 21– are wiser. “They have been raised with so much noise around performative social media living,” she says. “‘Let’s show everybody how this moment feels! Let’s see how many followers care about it!’ So they’re now like: can we just put it away and actually just be connected and honest and a mess?”How have we lost ourselves and each other? The film taught me a lot as a woman about the goal of a relationship.Laura DernShe shudders. “Showing people what you’re eating or wearing feels like middle-school all the time. Being judged for the length of my skirt or what I said to the boy. Oh my God, it’s exhausting!”In the room next door, Day (40) says she has no time for artifice. “People’s arrogance is often just really deep-seated insecurity,” she says. “We’re only getting half-versions of everyone as they’re trying to hide.” Once you drop the act, she says, “you never wanna go back in, to disappear into the performative part of life ever again.”View image in fullscreen‘Tess glimpses the person she once loved coming back into focus’ …  Cooper on Laura Dern’s character (pictured with Will Arnett).Photograph: Jason McDonald/Searchlight PicturesThe original idea for the film was Arnett’s. It came after a chance meeting with the Liverpudlian comedianJohn Bishop, who did indeed first try standup to avoid paying a cover charge, took to it, started using it as quasi-counselling, then reconnected with the mother of his children after she accidentally saw him perform. The main difference between fact and fiction is the quality of the jokes. Bishop became successful; Alex probably won’t. “Yeah,” says Arnett, “if Alex wants to keep doing this, he’s got to get funny.”When we spoke, Stephen Colbert’s late-night satirical talkshowhad just been axedand Jimmy Kimmel’s futurelooked shaky. US TV comedy seemed especially imperilled. Yet, Arnett – a staple of the scene for 25 years – was circumspect. “It is and it isn’t under threat. It’s always been like that. The court jester looked over his shoulder to make sure he pleased the king. So I don’t know if I am particularly troubled. There are plenty of people out there pushing the boundaries and finding a way to do it. It probably forces you to be a little more clever.”View image in fullscreenJohn Bishop in 2010.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianWhat drew him to the story was not the comedy, he says, but the drama – a chance to flex other muscles and draw on some unfunny personal history. “It demanded I look at my own experiences. And you don’t have to know much about me to know there are strains and commonalities.” Arnett is referring to his own split from Amy Poehler, with whom he has two sons, in 2012. At the time, it was major gossip in the US; the personal lives of both parties remain, like that of Cooper, tabloid catnip.UnlikeA Star is BornandMaestro, Is This Thing On? is not about people who are enormously famous. And yet, like Noah Baumbach’s (considerably inferior)movie-star-in-crisis film Jay Kelly– which also features Dern – its concerns betray the fact it was made by people whoareenormously famous.So there is quite a lot about how uncomfortable it feels to see massive photos of yourself you don’t feel are representative of your whole being. Alex enlarges to poster size a photo he loves of Tess spectacularly sinking a hoop decades earlier. She’s not flattered. “It’s because that’s nother,” says Dern. “It’s an idea of her. And that is the story of many of our lives: a moment captured in time that someone is still judging us on. I’ve had it from the other side, too, with projection.”View image in fullscreenWill Arnett in a 2003 promotional shot for Arrested Development.Photograph: Rex/c.20thC.Fox/EverettBeing troubled by such stuff is, concedes Arnett, a first-world problem. “But it is odd to see yourself out there in the world in that way. It’s really weird.”Cooper doesn’t respond on this one. Maybe he doesn’t need to. Given how energetically he hit the press trail for his previous films, plus the themes of this one, it feels significant that he’s opting to back-seat it this time round. Is This Thing On? is a loose and relaxed movie that is also surprisingly sharp on how much of yourself you should supply to strangers in the service of art. Cooper’s email answers are highly considered and curated, script tightly controlled – even now.At one point, Alex’s preteen sons happen upon a rough draft of his father’s latest routine. They’re distressed. “None of that stuff is real,” he says, comforting them. “It’s all made up. None of it’s real life, really.” But that’s not true: Alex is, by and large, impeccably honest. So when does sharing something become betrayal?“I don’t think I could define that boundary for anyone else,” says Cooper. “‘Betrayal’ is a heavy term, and these moments tend to be highly circumstantial. I recall reading not long ago about a comedian whose material left the subject of the joke feeling genuinely betrayed. And if someone feels betrayed by what was shared, then in some sense there is a betrayal. Their emotional reality is valid.View image in fullscreenBradley Cooper as Leonard Bernstein in Maestro.Photograph: Jason McDonald/Netflix“For myself, I’m very deliberate about sharing anything from my private life in a public setting, because other people are inevitably part of those stories, and they haven’t necessarily chosen to be included. It’s something I try to approach with care. That may sound a bit old-fashioned in a culture where everything is shared so freely, but it’s the way I orient myself.”Betrayal is a heavy term. But if someone feels betrayed by what was shared, then in some sense there is a betrayal. Their emotional reality is valid.Bradley CooperCooper has an eight-year-old daughter, Lea, who played Leonard Bernstein’s daughter in some of Maestro. Is This Thing On? is bookended by scenes set at school performances. “Bradley said he went to one when we were in preproduction,” says Dern, “and all the kids were having this amazing moment and all the parents were on their phones. And he was like: ‘There’s alion! Dancing! In front of us!’”She rolls her eyes. “We’ve allowed the noise to take over so completely. But if you wake up to self, you wake to your children. To a moment that you may define in your busy adult brain as less important than that text from your boss.”View image in fullscreenCooper and Arnett in Is This Thing On?Photograph: Jason McDonald/Searchlight Pictures“As a parent,” writes Cooper, “watching a school performance becomes a deeply subjective experience. The moment your own child is on stage, a whole world of personal history and emotion comes with you. The audience is essentially a collection of people engaged in private internal narratives – reflecting, remembering, projecting. That shared interiority gives school performances a kind of quiet, unexpected magic.”Those scenes are among the film’s finest. They capture something of the weird potency of guileless prancing. “There’s an innocence to children performing,” says Cooper, “a transparency of feeling, an almost complete indifference to success or failure; they’re simply expressing themselves. Whatever is happening within them is visible, unfiltered – which is ironic, because that’s exactly what adult performers spend their lives trying to recreate: a genuine moment in an imagined circumstance.”It must be strange to be in a profession in which you sweat all day for excellence, then go and watch your kid just casually pull it off without blinking. Is This Thing On? relies on the idea that that toil is worth it and honest adult performance is intrinsically cathartic.More committed, even, than Cooper himself. “I’ve certainly had experiences where it felt quite the opposite – more stressful than liberating,” he writes. “Still, in hindsight, even those moments tend to become cathartic. When you place yourself in a situation that’s uncomfortable and demands you push past your limits, there’s inevitably some emotional release or insight that emerges.”When children perform, whatever is happening within them is visible, unfiltered. Ironic, because that’s exactly what adult performers spend their lives trying to recreateBradley Cooper“It’s never not cathartic,” says Dern, ever the pro. “Even if it’s a difficult job or people aren’t feeling fulfilled or they’re missing the point. I have played some rough folks that I don’t necessarily want to admit are a part of me, but I have to find the part of me in them to connect. And that’s exciting.”The rough is hard to spot today. Dern is the definition of polish. She may not be a comedian, but it’s impossible to imagine that, had she been the one taking to the stage, anonymously, in a random comedy club, she wouldn’t have nailed it.Dern sells this film, as she does herothers, with such chewy commitment you could use her quotes on the poster. Is this Thing On? is a “roadmap to not missing it”, she says. Her son seems cut from the same cloth: “‘This is the best movie to see as I’m starting my journey,’” he told her after watching it. “‘It makes me wanna love by being my most vulnerable.’”View image in fullscreenCooper directing Dern and Arnett.Photograph: Jason McDonald/APShe beams with satisfaction. “My generation had fairytales: Prince Charming shows up, you must say yes. So it’s pretty incredible to have an alternative.”Showing people what you’re eating or wearing feels like middle-school all the time. Judged for the length of my skirt or what I said to the boy. Exhausting!Laura DernAnd, she adds, gesturing at the TV in the corner, an alternative to allthat. “I don’t know how I’ve become yet again addicted to checking in on the world right before I go to sleep. A horrible idea. But we have to tune out from the resentments and the fear, and say that because of them, this is the moment we have to be our most connected.”Don’t dismiss Is This Thing On?, she says. This isn’t just industry frippery or a comedy of remarriage. There’s a radical moral at its core. “It could be global, even political, to say: ‘I want to be unhappy with you. I’m fighting for this thing we call life, despite all the noisy, chaotic crap.’ We are all on the planet at the same time. And if we don’t lead with love, we are lost.”Is This Thing On?

Was it really all as good as you pretended it was on Facebook? Full of A-grades for the kids and riotous themed fancy dress birthday parties for the grownups? Or was it a sea of disappointment with only occasional fun flotsam? And was any of it actually real, or are we all now seven-fingered AI slop beings with Sydney Sweeney’s teeth?I have gathered my thoughts (and the Diamond household) together, whether they wanted to or not, to reflect on the most important thing in any given year: which video games we enjoyed the most.

Brace yourself for a hugely funny, all-American wild goose chase!Phil HarrisonFri 26 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 26 Dec 2025 11.03 ESTShareLee Raybon (Ethan Hawke) is a “truthstorian”. How to explain that proudly self-applied title? A historian, but also an investigative journalist with an inherent distrust of mainstream narratives? A maker of trouble for trouble’s sake? Or one of those fantasists whose home contains a huge mood board (current mood? Paranoid!) covered with photos of suspects and newspaper clippings and various strands of a conspiracy connected by pieces of string? Raybon actually has one of those. “I’m a very visual thinker,” he says. His scathing former business partner Wendell (Peter Dinklage) sees it differently: “It’s like you read one Oklahoma history book and then made a junior high collage out of it.”This exchange is typical of the alacrity with which The Lowdown cheerfully undercuts itself. Sterlin Harjo’s Tulsa noir is brilliantly elusive in tone. It allows Raybon, its nominal hero, precious little dignity. Raybon is, in many ways, a ridiculous man. His marriage is in ruins. He puts his sweet, resourceful daughter Francis in danger by mixing business and parenting. He’s one of the least physically imposing renegades you’ll ever meet (“How does an adult with a gun get put in the trunk of a car?” wonders his associate Cyrus at one point). He isn’t Woodward or Bernstein, he’s Jeffrey “The Dude” Lebowski with a sympathetic editor and a political agenda.View image in fullscreenDissolute … Jeanne Tripplehorn as Betty Jo Washberg with Hawke in The Lowdown.Photograph: Shane Brown/FXThe Lowdown is frequently very funny; working as both a genre piece (in which the genre in question is fondly spoofed) and as a character study (which follows a similar trajectory of amiable mockery). And yet, as with Harjo’s previous showReservation Dogs, there’s something profoundly serious going on here too. The mystery at the drama’s heart involves the powerful Washberg family whose wayward offspring Dale has taken his own life – or anyway, that’s their story. It seems likely that he has died – at least indirectly – as a result of an article Raybon has written. So there’s a follow-up to be explored about the circumstances of Dale’s death but also potentially about the older Washberg, Donald’s predatory designs on Indigenous American land and Black-owned businesses in the area.This is Harjo’s subtext. Tulsa is a city with a dark history.The Tulsa Massacre of 1921– in which up to 300 Black citizens were murdered by white supremacists – is a barely acknowledged but omnipresent undertone. The distinct aroma of white saviour surrounds Raybon at all times. “White men that care,” mutters Cyrus. “The saddest of the bunch.” Harjo, meanwhile, is anOklahoma native in the most fundamental sense. He’s a citizen of the Indigenous American people, the Seminole nation of Oklahoma. Reservation Dogs was about a beleaguered Indigenous community and how it managed to support itself in the face of white hostility – and arguably worse still, indifference. The Lowdown isn’t even nearly a follow-up in terms of subject matter but it could be regarded as a companion piece – the same territory and power structures, viewed from a different angle. Raybon’s good intentions are weighed down by their historical context.View image in fullscreenKeith David as Marty with Hawke in The Lowdown.Photograph: Shane Brown/FXBut even if Raybon is constantly failing to outrun the past, there is still real generosity in Harjo’s characterisation. Raybon is a driven man at least partly because the most important thing is to keep trying. Harjo specialises in earnest, ardent goofballs. People who are on the side of the angels but who remain endearingly daft. People who hold firm to their principles and take themselves extremely seriously. Like the idealistic, charming teens in Reservation Dogs, Raybon will never let his own absurdity cause him to take his eyes off the prize.The fact that Raybon doesn’t really understand what that prize might be is a big part of the fun. What unfolds is an all-American wild goose chase, populated by an ensemble of memorable picaresques. The supporting performances are uniformly superb – from Keith David’s blunt gumshoe Marty to Kyle MacLachlan’s oily Donald, everyone brings something sweet or sinister, funny or peculiar to the table. Meanwhile, Raybon blunders around, stumbling uninvited into private meetings, getting beaten up (repeatedly: he becomes progressively bruised and dishevelled as the series goes on) and drunkenly falling into bed with Donald Washberg’s dissolute ex-wife Betty Jo (the brilliant Jeanne Tripplehorn).Raybon imagines he is fighting to preserve an idea of progressive America, but he’s hanging on to something in himself too. Eventually, The Lowdown is a poignant and surprisingly personal story, about purpose and ageing and noble failure; about the timeless truth that the journey is more important than the destination. “There’s no cat up in that tree he’s barking at,” suggests his antiquarian book dealer friend Raymond. But even if Raymond is right, Raybon has to keep barking all the same. What else is a Truthstorian to do?The Lowdown is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewEthan HawkeTelevisionFXreviewsShareReuse this content"

Charles praised the “great diversity of our communities” and used his Christmas address, to urge the nation to “cherish the values of compassion and reconciliation”.Although the king’s address was watched by roughly the same number of people as last year, it was Gavin and Stacey that won the festive TV ratings battle in 2024, withthe show’s final farewellbecoming the most watched Christmas Day programme in 16 years with an average of 12.3 million viewers.The Scarecrows’ Wedding, based on the picture book by Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler and broadcast onBBCOne, was the second most popular programme this year, watched by 4.3 million people.TheStrictly Come Dancing Christmas Special– which Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman hosted together for the last time – was the third most popular programme, with 4.2 million tuning in.During the send-off, both outgoing presenters received Christmas gifts from the judges – a dance for Daly and a comedy skit for Winkleman. Their final dance ended with a tearful embrace, with Daly saying: “It’s our final time. So let’s make it count,” before the pair signed off with the catchphrase “keep dancing”.EastEnders had a drop in viewers compared with last year, with the first of two Christmas Day episodes becoming the eighth most-watched this year, with 2.85 million viewers. The second episode did not make the viewing figures top 10.Aftera difficult year, however, BBC executives will have been pleased to note that programmes from the public broadcaster made up nine of the top 10 most watched programmes across the day. A festive episode of The 1% Club, the quiz hosted by Lee Mack on ITV1, was in ninth place with 2.75 million watching.The BBC’s chief content officer, Kate Phillips, said this was “a timely reminder that shared moments really do still matter even in a world of so much choice”.All figures are based on official “overnight” TV ratings fromBarb(Broadcast Audience Research Board), which uses a panel of homes to measure what people watch across TV sets, online and via other devices.The overnight figures from Christmas Day do not include viewers who watch Christmas specials on catchup services during the rest of the festive period and do not include the small number watching the king’s message on Sky Showcase, Sky Mix HD or other non-TV platforms.View image in fullscreenA still from The Scarecrows’ Wedding.Photograph: BBC/Magic Light PicturesTop 10 most watched Christmas Day TV showsThe King (BBC, ITV, BBC News and Sky News) 6.56m (not including other channels)The Scarecrows’ Wedding 4.31mStrictly Come Dancing 4.24mMichael McIntyre’s The Wheel 3.71mCall the Midwife 3.44mGladiators 3.16mAmandaland 3.05mEastEnders 2.85mThe 1% Club 2.75mThe Weakest Link 2.63mSource: Barb overnight figuresExplore more on these topicsTV ratingsKing Charles IIIBBCITV1Strictly Come DancingClaudia WinklemanEastEndersnewsShareReuse this content"

Longstanding Ambridge favourites and newer voices from the drama will make an appearance.The Archers is one of the BBC’s most popular programmes and is the top on-demand show for listeners of all ages on BBC Sounds, including among listeners under 35.Barnes said: “I am not just an Archers superfan, I am obsessed with all things Ambridge. So to be asked to host The Archers: Live at 75 is like winning a prize at the Flower and Produce show and being cast as the lead in a Lynda Snell production, all rolled into one. I can’t wait to hang out with all of my favourite characters and really immerse myself in Borsetshire life.”Alison Hindell, the drama and fiction commissioner at BBCRadio4, said: “The Archers is one of the BBC’s most-loved programmes and we are tremendously proud of it as it reaches the astonishing broadcasting milestone of its 75th year. We hope that The Archers live show will give fans even more of what they love, joining in the celebrations with an extra slice of Ambridge life.”James Albrecht and Serena Brett, the directors of Fane Productions, said: “Marking 75 years of The Archers is a rare privilege, and we’re thrilled to work with the BBC to create a live experience that honours the programme’s extraordinary legacy.“Taking one of the BBC’s most precious and established brands, which has lived almost entirely in listeners’ imaginations, and working so closely with Angela, the editorial team, and the cast to make it leap out of the studio and on to the stage is a wonderfully fun creative challenge. We can’t wait to share this special experience with the audiences who’ve loved The Archers for generations.”This is not the first time The Archers has left the medium of radio. In 2019, the Birmingham studios where The Archers is recorded was madeopento fans, who were given the opportunity to recreate iconic scenes from the long-running drama.They were also given a behind-the-scenes look at the show. Among the glamorous titbits they were made privy to were the collection of doorbells for each Archers’ property and the glass of small lego bricks used to recreate clinking ice cubes in the Bull.Fane Productions, the company behind the long-running radio drama, said The Archers: Live at 75 will run from June to November 2026 at 29 venues, starting in Manchester, then hopping around the country, stopping in Oxford, Stockton-on-Tees and Glasgow, among other towns and cities, before ending in Wolverhampton.Explore more on these topicsThe ArchersRadionewsShareReuse this content"

One group behind the hoisting of flags, named Operation Raise the Colours, accepted a donation from Britain First, a far-right party with an openly anti-Islam, anti-immigration agenda.The British Museumhosted a successful inaugural fundraising ballin October with a “pink theme”, a nod to the colours and light in India, that was attended by 8,000 people, with tickets costing £2,000 a go.Those who attended in October included Naomi Campbell, Alexa Chung, Miuccia Prada, Manolo Blahnik, Sir Steve McQueen, Sir Grayson Perry and Dame Kristin Scott Thomas.View image in fullscreenNaomi Campbell was among attendees at the British Museum’s pink-themed ball.Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APCullinan, who was born in Connecticut to British parents but brought up in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, has said he hoped that the annual celebration will become a “flagship national event”.Described as a “brilliant fundraiser”, Cullinan has nevertheless already faced opposition from inside and outside the institution.The first ball was co-chaired by Isha Ambani, an Indian “businesswoman, philanthropist and arts patron”. She is the daughter of Asia’s richest man,Mukesh Ambani, who owns a petrochemicals conglomerate, Reliance Industries.The campaign groupCulture Unstainedhas criticised the association of the Ambani family, “whose wealth comes in large part from the fossil fuel and petrochemical projects of Reliance Industries”.Prof Nick Groom, author of The Union Jack: The Story of the British Flag, said theBritish Museumshould be encouraged to go ahead with its plans despite the concerns raised.He said: “If the British Museum is reconsidering plans for a red, white and blue themed ball next year to celebrate the international concord between the UK and France in exhibiting theBayeux tapestryin London, then it is not just abdicating its responsibilities as a national institution to safeguard our history, but will effectively be complicit in the politicisation of the union jack – which would open the door to over 400 years of that history being rewritten by the far right.“And in any case, communities will still need symbols of unity – so what will the union jack be replaced by?“We are all accountable here, charged with maintaining and recognising the complexities and indeed contradictions of national symbols.“The only way is to resist simplistic politics that seek to impose one crude meaning on the flag and engage with its diverse history – a history that we can both celebrate and, where appropriate, censure.”Groom added: “George Orwell got it right when he castigated the ‘Bloomsbury highbrow’ for divorcing intelligence from patriotism and treating the expression of national identity as brutish: ‘If you were an intellectual you sniggered at the union jack and regarded physical courage as barbarous.’“That was in 1941, at the height of the Blitz bombing raids on British and Irish cities that killed over 43,500 civilians (about the population of Salisbury) when Britain faced the very real possibility of a Nazi invasion.”A British Museum spokesperson said: “The inaugural ball was a landmark moment in the museum’s history that secured over £2.5m vital funding for its international partnerships.“We are excited to follow up this year’s success with a ball in autumn 2026 and will announce more details in due course.”Explore more on these topicsCultureBritish MuseumBayeux tapestryFar rightLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The publisher is already planning a global marketing blitz.Set in 1960s London, the book charts the literary ambitions of Mitzy Barlow, a housewife and mother-of-two stranded in a loveless marriage who has grown weary of the mind-numbing monotony of her life.She begins hosting Tupperware parties – ubiquitous events in the 1950s and 60s – to make some extra income from selling the plastic containers to women in her neighbourhood.However, she soon begins to combine her role as hostess with a burgeoning career as a writer of sexual fantasies, which she starts to compose each night in a journal to help her deal with the bleakness of her marriage.As her confidence grows, Mitzy begins writing her own stories under the pseudonym Queen B. Before long, her part-time job selling Tupperware becomes a cover for smuggling erotic stories to her customers, with the stories stashed safely inside the airtight containers.As her alter ego finds success, Mitzy is left with a dilemma over pursuing a different life, fraught with the danger of being accused of indecency.The novel’s TV rights were eventually secured by Kudos, part of Banijay UK, one of the world’s biggest production companies. It has been behind programmes including the Netflix series The House of Guinness, and the BBC’s This Town and SAS Rogue Heroes.“We are thrilled to have acquired the rights to Abigail’s novel,” said Karen Wilson, the joint managing director of Kudos. “She is a brilliantly talented writer, and Wet Ink is a must read. We cannot wait to get started on developing it into a TV series for both the UK and international market.”Insiders said the demand was a sign of the continuing importance to production companies of hunting down new content, as competition has intensified with the rise of the streamers. There has also been a recent trend of books by female writers to be the subject of ferocious auctions.Industry sources said that in another such contest, 21 offers had already been made. The field for that title has been whittled down to a final 10, described as “a roll-call of glittery producers”. The book in question has not even been finished.Another novel, Death’s a Bitch by the debut author Eloise Rodger, was acquired earlier this year by another Banijay-backed producer, , after international interest led to intense competition for the rights.The novel follows Aggie and the plight of her younger sister Marcie, who has faced a long illness and endless waiting lists. Death offers Aggie a job that will ensure Aggie survives.Avis, who studied and taught English literature before entering a fellowship with The Royal Literary Fund, has said the idea for Wet Ink came to her during one of her children’s midnight feeds. Her agent, Hayley Steed, said that in selling the book rights she had never seen a reaction like it.“Within mere hours we were turning down international pre-empts and it has broken agency records around the globe,” she said. “Abigail has written a book that encapsulates the perfect bookclub read; an empowering call to arms, a warm story of female community and friendship, and just the right amount of naughtiness with its snippets of erotica.”Explore more on these topicsTelevision industryTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

She talks Lego therapy, freaking out her Better Call Saul co-star and her frustration with the Guardian crosswordStuart HeritageFri 26 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShareRhea Seehorn has had a hell of a year. For years she had garnered a reputation as a great underappreciated talent, but that has all changed now thanks to Pluribus. A series about one of the only people on Earth not to have their minds taken over by an alien virus, Pluribus is not only critically adored, but recently became Apple TV’s most-watched show. And Seehorn is front and centre through it all. However, today she has bigger things on her mind.“You gotta tell me how to crack the code,” she pleads before we’ve even said hello. “I’m an avid crossword puzzler, but I cannot beat the Guardian crossword. I cannot crack it, and I need to figure out what the problem is.”If you’ve seen Pluribus, in which she plays a grouch forced to save the world against her will, the delightfulness of Seehorn in person might come as a surprise. She is bright-eyed and alert, sitting forward in her seat and fully engaged.“I love making the show,” she says. “It has been the most challenging thing I’ve ever done, and the most rewarding. People are coming up to me and they want to talk about what the show is bringing up in them, and the thoughts it’s making them have. That’s been absolutely beyond satisfying.”But perhaps not surprising. Pluribus is the sort of show that deliberately takes its time unfolding the grand mystery at its core. Seehorn plays Carol Sturka, who finds herself unaffected by the alien virus that has affected the rest of the global population. While they all operate as a mass hive mind – existing peacefully, if creepily, in a state of unquestioning happiness – she finds herself tasked with restoring individuality to the world. To complicate matters further, everyone seems especially attuned to her behaviour … perhaps because millions of people die whenever she loses her temper.View image in fullscreenRhea Seehorn in Pluribus.Photograph: Anna Kooris/AppleWhile creator Vince Gilligan has claimed that it’s partially autobiographical (it’s hard to see it as anything other than a reaction to his post-Breaking Bad celebrity, and all the sycophancy that goes with it) it’s also strangely universal. It’s the kind of high-concept show that has inspired a fervent obsession online of a level not seen since Lost. This obsession is something Seehorn respectfully prefers not to investigate.“I’m too much of a scaredy-cat to look online,” she reveals. “My friends tell me, even on social media, to never scroll down. I know eventually there’s going to be a comment that’s just like, ‘She is an ugly idiot who should never be on screen again,’ and then I’m just going to want to go do Lego sets for a week.”A bizarrely large chunk of the discourse online revolves around whether Carol should just give up and enjoy the simple pleasures of having her mind controlled. Seehorn doesn’t see the appeal.“When I think about happiness and joy, it always comes down to surprise,” she says. “Being surprised by others’ accomplishments. But in that world, there are no new books. There is no new art. There’s never going to be a belly laugh, because no one can surprise you. I’ll never get to do a crossword puzzle again, because I already know all the answers, because I made the crossword.”The story of how Seehorn got the Pluribus role has been told before, but it speaks volumes. Gilligan initially envisioned the lead as a man, but after seeing her in action onBetter Call Saul, where she played Kim Wexler, he swapped the character’s sex purely to carry on working with her. Seehorn has been working since the 1990s, but this is her first series lead. Those who know her understand the pressure this must put on her.View image in fullscreenSeehorn with Bob Odenkirk in Better Call Saul.Photograph: Robert Trachtenberg/AP“I watch Pluribus and my heart hurts for how long Rhea must have spent in physically and emotionally challenging states,” saysBob Odenkirk, her Better Call Saul co-star. “When we did Saul, we lived together with Patrick Fabian, and we all helped each other through the show. I wonder how she is doing with decompressing.”Seehorn laughs when I mention this. “It’s so funny that he posed that question, because he called to check on me after he saw a couple of episodes,” she says. “He probably just wanted me to make fun of myself, because Bob has seen how my little squirrelly brain decompresses. There are art projects all over the house. There’s a Lego set, a jigsaw puzzle, embroidery, painting, hundreds of almost-finished crossword puzzles.”Does she miss living with co-stars? “People thought it was weird,” she replies. “Bob started it. He called Patrick and I after season one and was like, ‘Do you guys think we should just live together?’ And I was like, actually, yes. All of our partners and spouses know each other and are friends, and none of us are skeezy. And it can be mentally taxing to come home by yourself.”For Pluribus, which shoots in Albuquerque, she continued the tradition by moving in with Trish Almeida, the head of the show’s hair department, during production. “This one took longer to shoot, and it was challenging. A lot of explosions of anger, or suppression of anger in the moments when Carol is not allowed to show those feelings. A lot of time by myself, too. Sometimes even just seeing somebody for a cup of coffee can make your week.”The 50 best TV shows of 2025Read moreThe season one finale airs on Boxing Day and, without wanting to spoil anything, it ends on such a tantalising cliffhanger that the next batch of episodes cannot come fast enough. While they are definitely coming – Apple knows a good thing when it sees one – Seehorn can’t give a concrete date.“They’re in the writers’ room right now,” she says of Gilligan and his team. “But I don’t have a timeline of when they’ll complete that process.”At this point I make a small strangulated yelp of frustration, to which Seehorn responds with a sense of calming reason. “I don’t think anybody is sitting around going, ‘Let’s just make them wait,’” she says with a smile. “I know my writers. They take such great care. Plus, the scope of this show is huge. Think about the episodes where everybody disappears. We’re in a working city. There were cars driving by all the time. They all have to be erased.”But does she know what’s coming next for Carol? “I know the same as I did on Better Call Saul – one script at a time,” she says. “I never have any idea where it’s going. I haven’t a clue what happens next season. A couple of big things happen in the finale. And I gotta tell you, I haven’t a clue in the world where they’re going.”Explore more on these topicsTelevision2025 in TVBetter Call SaulfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the other hand, anything’s possible and nobody cares. You can just create or imagine something – it’s like a blank canvas.”View image in fullscreenShaun Tan in his studio, 2025.Photograph: ABCFor a few hours a day, that blank canvas was punctuated by what Tan calls the “artform of the suburbs” – television. Only “three glorious channels” were available, but Tan would tape Doctor Who, Astro Boy and Twilight Zone reruns on the family VCR each night. It was those shows that kickstarted his interest in fantasy, science fiction, and eventually writing and illustrating his own stories.He poured these memories and feelings into his 2008 book,Tales from Outer Suburbia – 15 illustrated short stories that reimagined those suburbs as a familiar but surreal landscape. These tales were full of memorable, unlikely characters, from a giant water buffalo in a vacant lot to a wandering deep-sea diver – an allusion to Western Australia’s history of migrant Japanese pearl divers who once braved the bends in their hundreds.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning“I think my work is often misunderstood,” Tan says of Outer Suburbia’s look and feel. “I’m always at pains to say my style is not ‘quirky’, it’s not ‘weird’. It’s about normal things, normal feelings. They’re just displaced into other objects, but the displacement helps you to think about the deeper feelings and deeper meanings.”View image in fullscreenStill from Shaun Tan’s Tales From Outer Suburbia.Illustration: Highly Spirited/Flying Bark Productions/ABCOn 1 January, Tales of Outer Suburbia lands on the small screen as a 10-part animated ABC series.

And I’m like ‘What sisters?’ And then I realised, well, I don’t really give an identity to my protagonist, so they [young readers] just read themselves, and what they knew, into the stories.”View image in fullscreenGeraldine Hakewill (Wanted) voices mum Lucy; newcomers Brooklyn Davies and Felix Oliver Vergés voice siblings Klara and Pim, respectively.Illustration: Highly Spirited/Flying Bark Productions/ABCIn the series, those episodic vignettes are linked by the story of a family – teenager Klara (Brooklyn Davies), 10-year-old Pim (Felix Oliver Vergés) and mum Lucy (Geraldine Hakewill) – who move to the suburbs after a loss. All three use imagination to make sense of the same blank canvas Tan encountered: Klara draws, Lucy is a frustrated writer and Pim loves to tell stories.Tan is listed as a creative director for the series but credits its large team of collaborators for putting creation at the heart of the show.“I like that the series does have that self-reflexive feeling; that it’s a group of humans making imagery about humans making imagery,” he says. “We’re always questioning what it means to be an artist. How does it relate to myself and my real world experience? And what’s it like to be a person alive in the world at this particular place or time?”View image in fullscreenStill from Shaun Tan’s Tales From Outer Suburbia.Illustration: Highly Spirited/Flying Bark Productions/ABCLike the Perth suburbs Tan once knew, the show arrives in a media landscape unrecognisable from his childhood. Those three intermittent channels now compete with a continual feed of online content – something Tan has seen first-hand as the father of two young children.“My kids like to sort of bomb out after school and watch a bit of YouTube, and I’m just like ‘Oh my goodness, this is very different to the stuff that I would view’.“I’m wary of starting to sound like an old man, waving my fist and talking about coherent narrative,” he laughs. “‘Where’s the arc?!’”While the material his kids are watching is “alien” to him, their responses to this “confusing media landscape” remind him of his younger self.“I grew up with the advent of computer games and a lot of bad commercial television. It was a confusing landscape,” he says. “Me and my friends would have to negotiate that, and try and find anchored, human value in all of this nonsense. And I can see my own kids doing the same thing.”Shaun Tan’s Tales from Outer Suburbiapremieres on ABC iview on 1 January.Explore more on these topicsShaun TanChildren's TVChildren's books: 8-12 yearsFamily filmsAnimation on TVAnimation in filmAustralian Broadcasting CorporationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Shearwater is a research outpost, home to the global seed vault created as a bulwark against climate catastrophe and to colonies of seals, penguins and birds. For eight years, Dominic Salt and his children have lived there, but dangerously rising sea levels mean that they, and the vault, will shortly be evacuated. Dominic cannot understand why Rowan has ended up on Shearwater, and Rowan is mystified by the absence of the scientists and researchers, about whom the family are tight-lipped – and the island’s communication centre has been mysteriously sabotaged, isolating them still further. McConaghy writes beautifully about the natural world and expertly ratchets up the tension, as mutual suspicion increases and secrets are gradually revealed. This is a powerful read that encompasses not only grief, sacrifice and perseverance in the face of disaster, but also survival strategies and their concomitant moral dilemmas.View image in fullscreenDarkroomsby Rebecca Hannigan (Sphere, £20)When chaotic kleptomaniac Caitlin returns to her small Irish home town after the death of Kathleen, the mother from whom she has been estranged for many years, she’s pleased to be welcomed by the Branaghs, friendly neighbours she remembers from childhood. Less pleasant is being forced to confront past traumas, including the disappearance of her nine-year-old friend Roisin from a local wood 20 years earlier. Caitlin feels guilty about this, as does Roisin’s older sister Deedee, who is sure that Caitlin is still hiding something. Having joined the garda to find answers that never materialised, Deedee is drinking heavily, making poor decisions and jeopardising both her job and her relationship, and both women desperately need closure … This impressive, if bleak, debut is a slow-burning but well paced story of shame, guilt, misplaced loyalty and generational trauma, the conclusion of which, once one is in possession of all the facts, has a heartbreaking inevitability.View image in fullscreenThe Nancys and the Case of the Missing Necklaceby RWR McDonald (Orenda, £9.99)Winner of the Ngaio Marsh award for best first novel, New Zealander McDonald’s debut is set in a small town in South Otago. Eleven-year-old Tippy Chan has had a tough year after the death of her father, and when her mother goes on a Christmas cruise, leaving her in the care of her uncle Pike and his new partner Devon, she’s not sure what to expect. Pike, who fled to Sydney many years earlier, and Devon, a fashion designer, arrive in a blizzard of sequins and exuberance, but what begins as a jolly romp against a background of queeny flamboyance and inappropriate innuendo – which, mercifully, sails over our young narrator’s head – darkens when one of Tippy’s teachers is found dead in suspicious circumstances. Uncle and niece being devotees of the Nancy Drew mysteries, they feel compelled to investigate, and the Nancys detection club is born. As well as a compelling mystery, this is a funny and touching account of family, friendship and loss, with a trio of appealing characters at its heart.View image in fullscreenBest Offer Winsby Marisa Kashino (Doubleday, £16.99)American journalist Kashino’s first novel is a satirical thriller about the housing market, set in Washington DC. PR executive Margo and her lawyer husband Ian are desperate to move out of their cramped flat and buy a home where they will be able to start a family but, demand far outweighing supply for the type of property they desire – colonial style in a good area, the very benchmark of Successful Adulthood – they keep losing bidding wars. When Margo, the cynical but sensitive product of an unstable childhood, hears of a perfect house about to be put on the market, she decides to persuade the owners into a private sale. What begins with stalking and befriending under false pretences soon escalates, and events spiral out of control as Margo becomes increasingly deranged in pursuit of her life goals. Dark, funny and inventive, this is an ingeniously entertaining take on millennial anxieties.View image in fullscreenYour Every Moveby Sam Blake (Corvus, £14.99)More dirty dealings in the world of property, this time among the estate agents themselves. Your Every Move is set in London, where Sterling & Co sell houses that would attract the highest band of mansion tax to the uber-rich. Successful saleswoman Rosie Kinsella, who is also an influencer with an Instagram account full of property porn, usually enjoys her work, but now she’s being stalked. “Michael” appears to believe that he has a relationship with Rosie and, terrifyingly, has progressed from messaging to sending her photographs clearly taken frominsideher home. Meanwhile her boss, Yaraslava, has problems of her own – and then a colleague is found murdered in one of the luxury houses on their books. Seasoned crime readers may work out whodunnit fractionally before Rosie does, but this zippy chick lit/psychological thriller mashup with a dash of romantic suspense is just the job for a long winter evening.Explore more on these topicsBooksCrime and thrillers roundupFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Danish duo’s debut album Goodbyehouse, released on the cultishly adored label Escho, derives from a period when the pair’s lives were in a state of major upheaval, and comfort was in short supply. “We had fun – you can hear humour a bit on the album – and we went through some tough times, existential crisis, and you can hear that too,” says Theusen over a video call from her home in Copenhagen.Goodbyehouse became one of 2025’s runaway underground successes thanks to that emotional openness – as well as the duo’s canny blend of Dido-esque balladry, shoegaze haze and minimalist pop. When we speak, Thuesen and Strange have just returned home from their final tour dates of the year, a brief run that left them both ailing. “We get sick now after three weeks!” Strange says, laughing. “It was a lot easier when we were twentysomething.” They need to get used to it: 2026 includes an extensive Danish tour before a handful of shows with Paramore’s Hayley Williams and stops at Barcelona’s Primavera Sound and Denmark’s Roskilde festival.Snuggle is neither member’s first band. In his early 20s, Strange played in the acclaimed electronic soul band Liss, who were signed to XL Recordings. The four-piece broke up after the lead singer Søren Holm, died by suicide in 2021. They released their final album in 2022, after Holm’s death. “I was kind of at my lowest – I didn’t know what my music should sound like, if I should even make music,” he says. “That had been my life.”Thuesen has been a member of the indie-rock trio Baby in Vain since she was a teenager. The band “had this whole run where we had the hype, and we were signed to [big indie label] Partisan Records and toured a lot.” But the band “started to crumble” after Covid. She found herself at a crossroads, deciding, like Strange, whether to continue with music as her bandmates started to drift to other projects.Strange and Thuesen both ended up enrolling in Denmark’s Rhythmic Music Conservatory (RMC), where they met for the first time three years ago – despite both having previously been signed to Escho and having mutual friends. “We had these classes where we had to play music for each other, and it was an instant thing where we really liked what each other was doing, so we decided to try and jam,” says Thuesen. There was an emotional connection too, says Strange: “Some of the stuff we talked about when we met was having these similar experiences of losing a very good friend in your mid-20s – we were just talking in a very unfiltered way.”‘Rethink it all!’ Why is one Danish school producing nearly every cool alt-pop star?Read moreMany of the most hyped musicians of the 2020s – including the pop singer Erika de Casier, Henriette Motzfeldt (half of the electronic duo Smerz) and the experimental producers Astrid Sonne and ML Buch – have studied at the RMC, but Snuggle bristle at the idea thatthe school is the nexusof a certain scene. “It feels like the school is getting too much credit [for the] wave,” says Thuesen. “It’s more like a coincidence that all these people that are getting attention now went to that school, and I don’t really like when you put the art too much in context with institutions. I think it takes away from what art can be and can do.”Snuggle’s success certainly transcends the sometimes overly highbrow discourse surrounding the Copenhagen scene (now so renowned that it has its own officialSpotify playlist). The band recently received a DM on Instagram from a teenage girl in midwest America who said they made her want to pursue music. “It just made me so incredibly happy – when I was younger, I just wanted to go and get out there, feel the success, and [feel] hyped about the hype,” says Thuesen. “Now, it’s about these little things.”Explore more on these topicsIndieNew music for 2026interviewsShareReuse this content"

Tom Smith Big Band – A Year in the LifeUK saxophonist, composer and bandleader Tom Smith was dropping clues to his distinctively contemporary take on jazz traditions as a BBC YoungJazzMusician of the Year finalist in 2014 and 2016, and later as a leader of groups including the sax trio Gecko and the LGBTQI+ ensemble Queertet. But his powerful big band’s 2025 release, A Year in the Life, unveiled how exultantly Smith’s writing mingles orchestral influences from Maria Schneider and Carla Bley with slamming groovers from the big-band swing era, and a deep grasp of bebop chordal acrobatics, with raw and metallic guitar interventions thrown in.9. Artemis – ArboresqueView image in fullscreenEvocative … Renee Rosnes of Artemis.Photograph: Pascal Schmidt/Hans Lucas/AFP/Getty ImagesArboresque is the Artemis collective’s third and best release for the Blue Note label, evolved from an ensemble formed for International Women’s Day in 2016 by the acclaimed Canadian pianist and composer Renee Rosnes. All five members compose; standouts include saxist Nicole Glover’s ethereal Petrichor for its theme and her tenor improv, and trumpeter Ingrid Jensen’s snappy Sights Unseen with its vivacious post-bop dialogue with Rosnes. There are typically evocative Rosnes arrangements of her former employer Wayne Shorter’s Footprints, and the standard What the World Needs Now is Love. Cliche-free individuality and congenial collective spirit radiantly combined.Tell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more8. Jakob Bro – Taking TurnsDanish guitarist Jakob Bro is an undisguised admirer of Bill Frisell, but also of the unique melodic imagination of legendary Birth of the Cool alto saxophonist Lee Konitz. In 2014, ECM recorded this mini-masterpiece with Bro, an 86-year-old Konitz, and an avant-jazz supergroup of Frisell, pianist Jason Moran, bassist Thomas Morgan and former Cecil Taylor drummer Andrew Cyrille – and then unaccountably sat on it. This belated release reveals softly chiming harmonies and songlike waltzes for the inimitable Konitz to gleam and breathe through, alongside Cyrille’s and Morgan’s free-floating conceptions of swing, and the minimalist, interwoven delicacies of two sound-painting contemporary guitar masters.Read the full review7. أحمد[Ahmed] – Sama’aaView image in fullscreenFearless and compelling … أحمد [Ahmed].Photograph: Lisa GripKeyboardist Pat Thomas has been an idiomatically diverse creative maverick in UK jazz and improv for over three decades, and this two-album set features his أحمد [Ahmed] quartet’s stormily percussive, sonically abstract work, dedicated to sometime Art Blakey and Thelonious Monk bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, a pioneering merger of jazz and Middle Eastern music. Saxophonist Seymour Wright (an awesome inheritor of the methods of Albert Ayler and Evan Parker) and bassist Joel Grip often entwine raw multiphonics with melodious bowed sounds, while Thomas’s sometimes Cecil Taylor-esque chording and drummer Antonin Gerbal’s racing uptempo patterns rock between boiling free-jazz squalls and rattling folk-dances, on a session of fearless but infectiously compelling free jazz.Read the full review6. Cécile McLorin Salvant – Oh SnapTwelve originals and one quirky cover, first created alone with a computer by the French/Haitian/US vocalist Cécile McLorin Salvant, and then studio-layered with some longtime vocal and instrumental partners. Salvant draws on teenage pop memories, on folk and classical music, and the rich jazz life of her years in France. Fragile song-lines drift over drum loops, sleek jazz pianist Sullivan Fortner drives old-school swingers, while genre-spanning vocal partners June McDoom and Kate Davis join hauntingly empathic harmonies. What Does Blue Mean to You?, inspired by Toni Morrison’s Beloved, is the standout of a memorably bold and personal venture.Read the full review5. Linda May Han Oh – Strange HeavensView image in fullscreenSpecial … Linda May Han Oh.Photograph: Shervin LainezThe Malaysia-born, New York-based Australian bassist and composer Linda May Han Oh has long played for stars (Vijay Iyer and Pat Metheny among them); her own ventures have been few, but special. Strange Heavens revisits the partnership first launched in 2009 with Miles-influenced but lyrically inimitable trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire. The pair are joined here by Tyshawn Sorey, one of the great drummer-composers – and improvisational listeners – in contemporary music. Whisper-quiet melodies blossom out of bass caresses and Sorey’s spacey rimshots, Miles-like trumpet improv glides over hip-hoppish grooves, and Geri Allen’s Skin and Melba Liston’s Just Waiting get respectfully startling reinventions.Read the full review4. Joshua Redman – Words Fall ShortUS improvising saxophone master Joshua Redman’s 2023 debut for Blue Note (three decades after his spectacular 1993 emergence) was atypically and unsuitably focused on covers and vocals. But this year’s release features one vocal, an all-original repertoire and a new road band, and acclaimed Chilean saxophonist Melissa Aldana and 19-year-old west coast trumpeter Skylar Tang guesting. Both of them improvise with Redman as if they were soulmates, the ballad Borrowed Eyes develops exquisitely in spacey Redman whispers against softly plucked bass sounds, and the captivatingly ghostly voice of Gabrielle Cavassa shares a spellbinding vocal/tenor sax exchange on the closing Era’s End.Read the full review3. Anthony Braxton – Quartet (England) 1985View image in fullscreenOne of the greats … Anthony Braxton.Photograph: CTK/AlamyThe influence of the now 80-year-old Anthony Braxton, one of the great instrumental and conceptual jazz and new-music pioneers, has spanned music from free-improv to symphonies and operas. But his small jazz groups have often best showcased his multi-reeds virtuosity and the imagination that drives it. These live recordings from Braxton’s superb 1985 quartet tour of the UK feature headlong avant-bebop storms, free-collective passages, captivating warm-ups on standard songs, and the power and precision of pianist Marilyn Crispell, bassist Mark Dresser and drummer Gerry Hemingway. The cassette-recorded audio is understandably patchy, but the sense of being present at its creation is vivid.Read the full review2. Mary Halvorson – About GhostsAbout Ghosts expands New York guitarist/composer Mary Halvorson’s Amaryllis ensemble who partnered with her on 2024’s acclaimed Cloudward release. They are augmented here by two soulful saxophonists in altoist Immanuel Wilkins, and tenorist Brian Settles, whose arrival swells the surprises that Halvorson’s pieces constantly play with. Full of Neon’s march-like pulse and rich ensemble harmonies are squawked at by indignant horn exclamations, taut guitar figures mix with whooping alto improv on Carved From, and beboppish outbursts travel so fast as to sound hyper-compressed. Halvorson has said she loves singer-songwriter Robert Wyatt’s music for blending “the weird with the beautiful”. She certainly knows all about how that’s done.Read the full review1. Michael Wollny Trio – Living GhostsView image in fullscreenGenre busters … Michael Wollny Trio.Photograph: Jörg SteinmetzThe brilliant German pianist/composer Michael Wollny’s 10-year-old group with David Bowie Blackstar bassist Tim Lefebvre, and genre-busting drummer Eric Schaefer, goes from strength to strength. Living Ghosts is a live recording featuring the group’s favoured eschewal of setlists or arrangements, letting go to what the pianist has called “seances where the ghosts of the trio’s songbook visit us at their will”. Alban Berg and Paul Hindemith miniatures turn into rock-powered stomps or bass-walking bebop, swing turns into raw improv, Nick Cave’s Hand of God becomes Guillaume de Machaut’s Lasse! But governing it all is what types of music have in common, not what divides them.Read the full reviewExplore more on these topicsJazzBest music of 2025Lee KonitzfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Of the many hundreds of pianists I must have heard in more than 50 years of recital going, a multitude that has included many of the greatest names of the 20th century, none gave me more consistent pleasure or a greater sense of wonder than Radu Lupu. If ever a pianist’s appearance, especially in his later years, belied the character of his playing it was Lupu: that the intensely serious, heavily bearded figure who hunched over the keyboard in a way more appropriate to a seance than a recital could produce playing of such velvety tonal beauty was extraordinary enough; that such a beguiling sound world was allied to a mind of such penetrating musical intelligence sometimes seemed miraculous.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for The Unreleased Recordings.Photograph: DeccaLupu died in 2022, at the age of 76. He had retired from the concert platform three years before, and had ceased to make studio recordings some years before that. Decca, for whom he recorded exclusively for over two decades, released his complete recordings in 2015, and with that comprehensive box, one thought, the legacy would be complete. But now, to mark what would have been the pianist’s 80th birthday, the company has produced this wonderful surprise: six discs made up of unreleased studio sessions and BBC, Dutch and SWR radio tapes, dating between 1970 and 2002, of works that Lupu otherwise did not record.The set begins with Mozart’s G minor and E flat piano quartets, for which Lupu was partnered in 1976 by members of the Tel Aviv String Quartet, in performances of such pristine studio quality – Lupu at his most inward in the slow movements, dazzlingly buoyant in the finales – that it’s mystifying they have never previously been released. A 1990s disc of Schubert sonatas – the unfinished C major D840, and the D major D850 (in a surprisingly downbeat, almost angry performance) – complements the Lupu Schubert already in the catalogue, while a sequence of Haydn and Mozart sonatas from the 1970s and 80s ends surprisingly with Schumann’s Études Symphoniques, complete with its five “posthumous” variations.View image in fullscreenRadu Lupu, photographed at Sydney Opera House in 1974.Photograph: Fairfax Media/Getty ImagesIf those discs remain on more or less familiar Lupu territory then much of the rest of the set does not. He recorded little Chopin, but here is a thrillingly vivid (if not always technically immaculate) performance of the B minor Scherzo, while Lupu learned Bartók’s Out of Doors suite especially for the 1969 Leeds International Piano Competition, of which, half a century on, he remains the most celebrated winner. More uncharacteristic still is Copland’s Sonata, fierce and majestic, from the Aldeburgh festival in 1971, while Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition sees Lupu making a rare venture into the Russian repertory; it comes from a 1984 Dutch broadcast, his tone noticeably rawer, almost strident at times. In general, though, the recording quality serves the exemplary playing well enough; every track is a treat.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

This north-facing coastline is a magnet for exhausted migrant birds making landfall, and the pinewoods offer welcome shelter in bitter conditions. Bird hides along the woods’ southern edge look over marshland – fantastic for winter wildfowl spectacles and birds of prey.Jo SinclairProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

The walk starts overlookingPortstewart Strandand finishes in the town centre. It’s exposed to the Atlantic, so it’s always gusty and perfect for clearing the head after working too hard or overindulging. The sunsets here are to be savoured, so try to time it for dusk, and a post-walk pint by the fire in theAnchor Barfeels heavenly.CiaranA perfect hike for a frosty day in the ChilternsView image in fullscreenSnowfall on the north-facing slopes of the Chilterns.Photograph: Phototropic/Getty ImagesIf it’s frosty, this is a cracker. From the Chilterns village ofEwelme(the famous watercress beds can wait) head east uphill through fields and beech woodland to Ewelme park, turn left and skirt Swyncombe House, which has excellent views of the Vale of Oxford, keeping north and right of the church as you go up. Cross the only main road, down and up into more classic Chilterns woodland complete with deer, pheasant and dappled sunlight before descending gently through ancient earthworks back to Ewelme as the sun sets. It’s 5 miles, 2.5 hours, and there’s no pub – but you won’t care because the countryside is perfect.Rik HallewellA North Yorkshire amble for a foggy morningView image in fullscreenSkipton Moor.Photograph: Chris Dukes/AlamySkipton Mooris wonderfully quiet despite having spectacular views, perhaps because it’s just outside the Yorkshire Dales national park. Only a mile up the hill from the edge of town, its high points offers panoramic views of Airedale and Pendle, and it is home to hares and curlew. Sparkling frost outlines all the spider webs in the gorse bushes. Go on a cold, foggy morning after a clear, calm night and you may well find yourself emerging from the misty woods above a sea of clouds.Hannah PriceFollow the Skyline loop around BathView image in fullscreenA view of Bath during a cold snap.Photograph: Anthony Brown/AlamyJust outside Bath is theSkyline walk, a continuous 6-mile loop of the rolling hills surrounding the city. Mists rising over sandstone rooftops is a spectacular sight on a frosty morning. En route are panoramic views, ancient woodland, a sham castle, a cemetery clinging to the hills and the National Trust’sPrior Park, a magical 18th-century landscape garden designed for Ralph Allen, a key moderniser of the nationwide postal service. At the end, descend the footpath into Bath where you can cosy up by a pub fire – I recommend thePig and FiddleorThe Crystal Palace.SusannaA short Lake District hikeView image in fullscreenAdmiring the view of Bassenthwaite from Sale Fee.Photograph: Kay Roxby/AlamySale Fellnear Cockermouth is my favourite short winter walk. Its grassy hillside feels safe to walk even when frosty. Climbed easily from St Margaret’s church, it offers amazing views over Bassenthwaite Lake towards Skiddaw. I love the descent via the quiet path through the woods towards the Wythop valley, passing the ruins of an old church where deer can be spotted. Finish the walk with a pint in the lovelyPheasant Innor coffee and cake in the award-winningBassenthwaite Lake Station cafe, both at the bottom of the fell.ArthurBlack Mountains beautyView image in fullscreenLlanthony Priory.Photograph: Martin Wilcox/AlamyMy favourite winter walk is in the Black Mountains of south-east Wales, in the Bannau Brycheiniog (formerly Brecon Beacons) national park. Park atCapel y ffinand follow the path along the valley of theNant Bwch,with its waterfalls and steep-sided valley. Up to Rhiw y fan for spectacular views into Wales, returning along the Rhos Dirion ridge above the beautiful Vale of Eywas via a stone called the Blacksmith’s Anvil back to the start. Stop for an atmospheric pint in thecellar baratLlanthony Priory.MartinBeaches, castles and pubs in NorthumberlandView image in fullscreenDunstanburgh Castle seen from the beach near Embleton.Photograph: John Taylor/AlamyA coastal stroll with a cosy pub that brews its own beer … Is there anything better? Starting atEmbleton, head down the hill to the beach. Turn north, away from the cracking view ofDunstanburgh castle, and walk along the beach for about an hour toLow Newton, a National Trust-preserved square of fisher’s cottages and theShip Inn, a dog-friendly, cosy pub with a strong food offering. Return either via the beach or head to the dunes and the coastal path. Recover from the walk up the hill into Embleton with a pint at theGreys Inn, a proper pub with decent real ale. Bliss.HannahWinning tip: a Cut above west of GlasgowView image in fullscreenWalkers on the Greenock Cut.Photograph: Phil Seale/AlamyGreenock Cutis near Glasgow yet transports you far away. It starts in mundane fashion, a walk through the edge of a town. But within a few minutes it opens out into majestic views across the River Clyde to the hills in Argyll and continues to wow for miles. The Cut’svisitor centre and cafeoffer a warming break and good-quality paths keep it passable even on wet or icy days. Walkers can continue onwards along the hill to return via the spectacular Wemyss Bay railway station (11 miles), or loop back on a shorter route passing the calm Loch Thom (8 miles). Both are stunning.NicView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysReaders' travel tipsWalking holidaysTop 10sWalkingShort breaksDay tripsHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Drink styling: Seb Davis.The good mixerCocktailsCocktail of the week: Ambassadors Clubhouse’s Patiala peg – recipeAn old fashioned with a batty backstoryJames StevensonFri 26 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShareLegend has it that in 1920 Bhupinder Singh, the maharaja of Patiala, was determined that his cricket team would triumph over a visiting English team. To gain the upper hand, he hosted a grand party the night before the match at which he served his guests Patiala pegs, famously generous four-finger whisky pours traditionally measured from pinky to index finger. Unsurprisingly, the English players overindulged, leaving them very hungover and, inevitably, defeated the next day, and the legend of the Patiala peg was born. This Punjabi kind-of old fashioned is inspired by Singh’s drink. At the restaurant, we serve it from a bespoke five-litre bottle, but we’ve adapted the recipe to make it more suitable for a domestic environment.Patiala pegMakes1 litre, to serve 10-12725g blended scotch whisky– we useJohnnie Walker Black Label130g sugar syrup6g Angostura bitters(about 1⅓ tsp)1g orange bitters(about ⅕ tsp)A pinch of salt2g xanthan gumPut everything in a large bottle or jug, add 130g water, stir to combine, then put in the fridge, where it will now keep for up to three weeks.To serve, pour roughly 90ml Patiala peg into a rocks glass filled with ice (we use one big block), and serve – if you’re feeling traditional, measure it in by hand instead.James Stevenson, beverage director,Ambassadors Clubhouse, London W1Explore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodIndian food and drinkWhiskyrecipesShareReuse this content"

Pile crisp coffee meringues high with espresso cream, boozy cherries, a drizzle of whisky caramel and a flicker of edible gold leaf, then shake, spoon and sparkle your way into the New Year. A few tips: arrange the toppings in glass bowls or on tiered trays for a beautiful display, add labels for fun and, if it’s sitting out for a while, keep the whipped cream chilled on ice.Espresso martini pavlova barPrep10 minCook1 hr 40 minMakes24 meringuesFor the meringues (make up to 3 days ahead)140g egg whites(from about 4 large eggs)220g caster sugar2 tsp instant coffee powder dissolved in 1 tsp hot water1 tsp cornflour½ tsp white vinegar1 tsp vanilla extract1 pinch fine sea saltCocoa powderEdible gold leaf(optional)For the espresso brandy cherries (make up to 3 days ahead)400g frozen black cherries60g light brown sugar60ml black coffeeA pinch of sea salt2 tbsp brandy, or coffee liqueur (Kahlúa, Tia Maria or similar)½ tsp vanilla extractFor the whisky caramel (make up to 3 days ahead)300g caster sugar60ml water150ml double cream50ml whiskyFor the espresso mascarpone cream (make on the day)300ml double cream150g mascarpone2 tsp coffee grounds1 tsp vanilla extract½ tsp cinnamonTo make the meringues, heat the oven to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2 and line two large oven trays with baking paper. In a clean bowl of an electric mixer, whisk the egg whites on medium-high to soft peaks. Add the sugar a tablespoon at a time, whisking until thick, glossy peaks form and the sugar dissolves – test by rubbing a bit of the meringue mix between your fingers: it should feel smooth. Add the coffee, cornflour, vinegar, vanilla and salt, and whisk just to combine.Dab a little meringue under each corner of each sheet of baking paper, so they stick to the trays, then, using two small soup spoons, dollop 12 roughly 5cm-wide rounds on each tray, spacing them well apart because they will double in size when baked. Using the back of a teaspoon, make a shallow dip in the centre of each meringue.Put the trays in the oven and turn down the temperature to 130C (110C fan)/250F/gas ½. Bake for an hour and 15 minutes, until lightly crisp, dry to the touchand still slightly soft inside. Turn off the oven, leave the door ajar and leave the meringues to cool completely for about an hour. Store in an airtight container for up to three days.To make the brandy cherries,combine the cherries, sugar, coffee and salt in a small saucepan, bring to a gentle simmer, stirring so the sugar dissolves, then lower the heat and simmer for five minutes until the cherries are tender and the liquid has reduced slightly. Add the brandy (or coffee liqueur) and vanilla, then take off the heat and leave to cool completely – the syrup will thicken as it stands. Store in a jar in the fridge for up to three days; bring to room temperature before serving.For the whisky caramel, mix the sugar and water in a medium saucepan on a low heat and stir occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Turn up the heat to high, cook without stirring until the caramel turns a deep amber, then take off the heat. Carefully add the cream, then return the pan to a low heat and stir until smooth. Add the whisky, decant into a jug and store in the fridge for up to three days. Reheat in a pan over a low heat before serving.For the espresso mascarpone cream,mix all the ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat on medium-low until soft waves form. Chill until ready to serve.To assemble, arrange the meringues on a plate and dust lightly with cocoa powder. Put the espresso mascarpone cream, brandied cherries and whisky caramel in separate small bowls or jars. You now have a DIY bar from which guests can build their own dish: nestle a meringue in a glass or shallow bowl, spoon in a little cream, top with cherries and finish with a glossy drizzle of caramel. A flicker of edible gold leaf on top adds just the right touch of New Year’s shimmer.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotNew yearDessertCoffeeSpiritsEggsWhiskyrecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.At this time of year, I like to stay home, shut off from the world and do as little as possible for as long as possible. Eat all the food, embrace all the leftovers and be creative with whatever’s in the kitchen. After the big day, I like to turn leftovers into some sort of pie: they’re forgiving and malleable and work with whatever you have hanging about.This leftovers piefrom Tom Hunt andthis turkey and ham piefrom Felicity Cloake are great places to start. You could absolutely make your own pastry, as Tom does, or use shop-bought if you want to keep things as simple as possible (I always store a few rolls of pastry in the fridge over Christmas for precisely this reason). If it’s cheese that you have in abundance, meanwhile, then Rosie Birkett’s decadent-soundinglazy cheeseboard tartis a perfect way of using up the odds and ends of any remaining festive fromage.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As well as comfort food, I also find I need a change of pace after the 25th; I start craving spice and less hearty meals, too. Yotam Ottolenghi’sBoxing Day fried rice with garlic and spring onion sauceis the perfect way to be resourceful with leftover roast veg, as is Meera Sodha’sChristmas veg penang curry, a real treat of a dish that I enjoy year-round, and especially after the indulgence of December. Nigel Slater’sroast parsnip and stilton soup with beetroot crispsis another great addition to your leftovers repertoire, not least because it is a recipe that needs very few ingredients, very little work and is immensely adaptable. If I don’t have beetroot kicking around, I just leave it out. And if I have leftover comté instead of stilton, I’ll chop and stir that in instead.And then there are the puddings. No matter how well I plan, I always have an excess ofmince piesandChristmas pudding, so this year I am stocking up on the additional ingredients for Felicity Cloake’s fabulousChristmas pudding tiffin– what an inspired way of giving new life to leftovers! It’s perfect for any last-minute visits or visitors, or just to enjoy on the sofa with a glass of sherry in front of your favourite Christmas movie. Merry Christmas to all!My Christmas in sweetsView image in fullscreenClassic Christmas … Nigel Slater’s stollen.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverMore bakes|I’m clearly embracing my sweet tooth and want to share one of my favourite festive reads of all time:Advent by Anja Dunk. I adore this classic Christmas book and think it is a must for any keen bakers. Dunk shares recipes from her German heritage, and her book is filled with inspiring recipes and stories, beautiful photography and prints that she created herself. Favourites of ours include peppery gingerbread,gefüllte lebkuchen(jam-filled lebkuchen) and marzipan-filled stollen. A beautiful addition to any bookshelf.Scanditreat|My current addiction isLakrids by Bülow; these little balls of chocolate-coated artisanal liquorice are my achilles heel; I also love theirChristmas pairing of caramel balls with festive raspberry. Sous Chef also stocksa smaller festive set, as well as many of their other flavours (they’re gluten-free, too).New Year, new cake|Leaning into my Greek Cypriot roots, I love making all the traditional festive biscuits and cakes in December, such asmelomakarona,kourabiedesandvasilopita. Vasilopita is a cake that’s traditionally eaten at New Year, and features a lucky charm hidden inside, a bit like the French galette des rois. It is said that the finder will have good luck all year and myyiayia(grandma) always makes a large one for all of our family. You can absolutely have a go at making it yourself, or just order one fromGreek Mama’s Bakehouse, which makes them all by hand and is delivering before New Year. Great as a gift or to have at home to see in 2026 with loved ones.One last sugar hit for the road|If you’re still in need of a present for a fellow sweet-toothed loved one, head toGower Cottage Brownies. These treats by post have cult status – and rightly so: they are very,verygood (they have gluten-free and vegan options, too). You can either send a box by post, or set up agift box subscription. After all – and let’s be honest here – it’s in the deepest depths of January, February and March that we really need a sweet treat to get us through the short, dark days.If you want to read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive Feast in your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFoodFeastChristmasNew yearChocolateCakeDessertBakingnewslettersShareReuse this content"
