Its epicentre was about 11 miles (17.2km) from Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city.Min Aung Hlaing, the chief of Myanmar’s junta, said he expected the death toll to rise and urged “any country, any organisation” to help with relief efforts – a rare request from the isolated military government. The junta said blood was in high demand in the worst-affected areas as concerns grew about how rescuers would even reach some parts of a country already enduring a widespread humanitarian crisis.Thai authorities said eight of the nine reported deaths happened after the high-rise building crashed to the ground in the capital. Rescuers are searching for another 81 people trapped in the rubble. Damage was also reported in China.In Myanmar, witnesses and local media said people had been killed in the city of Mandalay and in the towns Toungoo and Aungban. Hundreds of casualties were taken to a hospital in the capital, Naypyidaw, where injured people were being treated outside because of damage to the building.A rescue worker from Amarapura, an ancient city and now a township of Mandalay, said the bodies of 30 people had been recovered from collapsed multistorey apartment blocks.“I have never experienced anything like this before – our town looks like a collapsed city,” he said, estimating that about a fifth of the buildings had been destroyed.“We received calls for help from people from the inside, but we cannot help because we do not have enough manpower and machines to remove the debris, but we will not stop working.”1:11Moment skyscraper under construction collapses in Bangkok after earthquake – videoThe scale of the damage in Myanmar is yet to become clear, though social media footage emerging from central regions has shown many buildings collapsed or damaged.In Bangkok, authorities declared the city a disaster area, saying they needed to assess and monitor damaged areas and help people who may still be at risk. People ran out on to the streets in panic, many of them hotel guests in bathrobes and swimming costumes, as water cascaded down from an elevated pool at one luxury hotel. In the northern tourist destination of Chiang Mai, where the power briefly went out, stunned residents also hurried outside, unsure how to respond.“I quickly rushed out of the shop along with other customers,” said Sai, 76, who was working at a minimart in Chiang Mai when the shop started to shake. “This is the strongest tremor I’ve experienced in my life,” Sai told Agence France-Presse.Mohamed Riyas, the regional director of the International Rescue Committee, said the earthquake’s impact was likely to be severe and could displace thousands of people, leaving them in need of food, shelter and medical aid.“We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake, as communication network lines are down and transport is disrupted,” he added. “The damage to infrastructure and homes, loss of life, and injuries sustained by communities affected should not be underestimated.”Map showing the location of the earthquakeThe UN secretary general, António Guterres, offered his condolences and said regional networks were mobilising to help those in need.Myanmar’s junta, which has lost swathes of territory to armed groups, declared a state of emergency across the six worst-affected regions. As well as the call for international aid, state TV made a domestic appeal for medical supplies and blood donations because of what it said were “so many” injuries in three urban centres.The quake will further stretch Myanmar’s ruling military. The anti-junta militias, known as the people’s defence forces, said their troops would provide humanitarian help.Footage reportedly taken inside Mandalay airport showed people racing to safety through dusty hallways, the floor scattered with ceiling panels. The videos, published by local media, show panicked people crouching on the floor outside the airport for safety.View image in fullscreenThe damaged emergency department of a hospital in Naypyidaw.Photograph: Sebastien Berger/AFP/Getty ImagesA witness in Mandalay, who asked not to be named, said eight people had been killed and others were feared to be trapped after a construction building in Pyigyitagon township collapsed. “The whole of Mandalay city was affected by the earthquake. The rescue teams and hospitals are now overrun. We are managing with the resources we have in the neighbourhood,” they said.Images published by Khit Thit Media, a news agency based in Myanmar, showed piles of bricks and rubble outside a damaged mosque, also in Mandalay. At least 20 people had died there, it reported, though it was not possible to verify this figure.At least three people were also killed after a mosque in Toungoo, in Bago region, partly collapsed, two witnesses told Reuters. “We were saying prayers when the shaking started … Three died on the spot,” said a witness. Local media reported that at least two people died and 20 were injured after a hotel collapsed in Aungban.0:41Water cascades down side of high-rise Bangkok hotel during earthquake – videoA spokesperson for the World Health Organization described the earthquake as “a huge event” that posed “a very, very big threat to life and health”, adding: “We’ve activated our logistics hub to look particularly for trauma supplies and things like external fixators, because we expect that there will be many, many injuries that need to be dealt with.”A programme coordinator for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, Marie Manrique, in a briefing from Yangon, said: “Public infrastructure has been damaged including roads, bridges and public buildings. We currently have concerns for large-scale dams that people are watching to see the conditions of them. We anticipate the impact to be quite large.”Myanmar has been gripped by conflict since the military seized power in February 2021 in a coup widely opposed by the public. It has since launched brutal crackdowns on any forms of opposition, and it is dangerous for journalists to operate inside the country.A senior UN official warned in November that2 million people in Myanmar’s Rakhine state could face starvationwithin months because fierce conflict and trade blockades had led to a “total economic collapse” and the imminent risk of famine.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarThailandAsia PacificEarthquakesSouth and central AsiaNatural disastersnewsShareReuse this content"

She defended the decision on security grounds butconceded on Friday that she will not accept free concert tickets in the future.The new study shows the scale of the hospitality culture around Westminster, and how senior civil servants and special advisers are also benefiting from corporate largesse.The report states:Senior Treasury officials accepted hospitality from HSBC at least 10 times, and the bank also had 24 meetings with officials during the period – more than any other stakeholder.Top Treasury officials also accepted hospitality from Barclays 11 times over that time, and the bank had the third highest number of meetings at 17.Between them, the two banks provided hospitality or attended meetings with senior officials or ministers in the Treasury on average 1.2 times a week, the report found.One of the top providers of hospitality to Treasury ministers was the lobbying group UK Finance, which was also in the top four organisations to get the most meetings with Treasury ministers.Gareth Davies, the permanent secretary of the Department of Business and Trade (DBT), accepted tickets to the Chelsea flower show courtesy of the consultancy firm Oliver Wyman, as well as Bafta and Olivier awards tickets from a film company and theatre group, all in 2024.At the DBT, accounting giants KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Oliver Wyman were in the top five firms giving hospitality to senior officials. Those three firms were also in the top seven firms getting the most meetings.Between them, the three consultancy companies provided hospitality to or attended meetings with senior officials or ministers in the DBT on average once a week.MPs have declared more than £6m in ‘freebies’ since 2010, analysis showsRead moreSenior officials in the DBT were accepting hospitality on average 3.5 times a week between 2019 and before the election in 2024 – the highest rate among the surveyed departments. The rate went up in the first three months of theLabourgovernment to an average of 5.8 times a week, according to the report.The French energy company EDF was one of the top providers of hospitality to energy ministers, with 10 occasions, and had the most meetings with ministers and officials in the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ).The report found that between meetings and hospitality, EDF provided hospitality to or attended meetings with senior officials and ministers on average once a week.Ministers and officials at the Cabinet Office accepted less hospitality, but the report showed that special advisers in that department took hospitality on more than 800 occasions, including many free tickets, more than 100 of which were also with family members.The advisers accepted hospitality from the Premier League 27 times over the five-and-a-half-year period. Special advisers have to declare hospitality but have not been not required to declare their meetings with external firms.The report also analysed the makeup of the stakeholders meeting ministers and officials in those departments, finding that the private sector meets the government 23 more times than consumer groups and charities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two of these firms also provided the most hospitality.Susan Hawley, executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said: “Restoring public trust in the fairness of government decision-making is a crucial and urgent task. We are calling on the government to radically enhance lobbying transparency and strengthen the guardrails against policy capture.“Transparency will not be enough on its own however. The government must look proactively at fostering more inclusive public policymaking, including by requiring government departments to develop inclusive access policies and update guidance on policy capture.”The data was declared in the official government register, which also includes meetings and hospitality from journalists. There is no published data on which organisations are most frequently requesting meetings.The companies were approached for a response, and KPMG, Barclays and PwC had no comment. An HSBC spokesperson said: “We engage with both the UK government and opposition parties on issues facing our customers and the wider financial services industry.” UK Finance said: “Our role is to engage with the government on behalf of our members and we have meetings to discuss a range of relevant issues. Separately, we invite ministers to speak at our events, for example our annual dinner, which is recorded by them on their transparency release.”A Premier League spokesperson said: “The Premier League runs a programme of stakeholder engagement with a broad range of individuals including MPs and officials. Like all industries, including many football organisations, this is normal practice and used as an opportunity to discuss a wide range of topics and issues that affect both our areas of work.”A government spokesperson said: “This government is committed to transparency. That’s why we have strengthened transparency requirements and introduced clear principles governing ministers’ acceptance of gifts and hospitality.“It is an important part of a minister’s role to engage with civil society, local government and other partners in sectors of the UK economy relevant to their roles.”The government has recently updated the ministerial code to include new transparency requirements, and principles governing the acceptance of hospitality. It says ministers may be required to attend functions and events in a ministerial capacity where hospitality may be offered.It adds that they should not accept any gifts, hospitality or service which would, or might reasonably appear to, compromise their judgment or place them under an obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence their work in government.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsKeir StarmerRachel ReevesLabourConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

You’re handing him a rape tool, either he’s going to use it to seduce women and lure them back to his lair or he’s going to use it to silence them … It’s terrifying. He couldn’t stop talking about it [the 2009 award] in 2018.”Lusi, who also starred in Crazy Rich Asians, said the award was handing Clarke a “loaded gun”. No allegations of rape were published by the Guardian. On Friday, Philip Williams, representing Clarke, asked Lusi whether she had ever made any such allegations against his client. She replied she had not and was not accusing him of rape but when asked whether she wanted to retract her words about the award being “a rape tool kit” she declined to do so.She also said on the call that the 2021 award was a box-ticking exercise. Asked by Williams whether she took issue with a black actor receiving an award, Lusi told the court: “I did not take issue with the fact he was black and is getting an award. I felt my issue was that his body of work did not warrant an award of that level.“It would not have made a difference what ethnicity he was.” She compared his “mediocre” work unfavourably with that of Ang Lee, another person of colour, who received the Bafta fellowship award in 2021.When Williams suggested she was “professionally jealous”, she laughed and denied it.Clarke returned to the witness box on Friday to respond to the discovery by his former best man and business partner Davie Fairbanks during the trial of a hard drive containing 15 photos of a woman given the pseudonym Ivy. Fairbanks claimed Clarke had sent them to him. Ivy said she had never seen them before.Clarke told the court: ​“My explanation about him having the photographs is he stole them from my devices. I have never shared anyone’s pictures, never have done, never would do. The only explanation is that Mr Fairbanks has … illicitly stored them for a decade and a half.”Gavin Millar KC, for the Guardian, suggested that Clarke had been forced to “come up with a theory” after the photos were found but had no evidence to support it.The writer and producer of the Kidulthood trilogy denied Millar’s assertions that he kept them for “collateral” against women and that his argument – that he kept the photos in an unprotected folder on a laptop, the password for which he had given to his friend – was implausible.Clarke said he had stored the photographs for “aesthetic reasons” and that Fairbanks only had the laptop password in case anything happened to him.Apart from one more witness on 4 April attesting to the truth of the Guardian’s reporting about Clarke, next week will be taken up by its journalists giving evidence, arguing that their reporting was in the public interest.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

Documentary film-makers often expose themselves to extreme risks to enlighten the world.”The letter further stated that “it is indefensible for an organization to recognize a film with an award in the first week of March, and then fail to defend its film-makers just a few weeks later”.‘It was revenge for our movie’: Oscar winner says soldiers helped settlers attack him in West BankRead moreBallal, one of four directors – all from Israel or Palestine – of thefilmcrowned best documentary at the Oscars on 2 March, wasbeaten by Israeli settlers on Mondayoutside his home in the village of Susya, in the Masafer Yatta area of the West Bank, anddetained by Israeli forces. Hetoldthe Guardian that he was beaten with explicit reference to No Other Land, which documents the Israeli military’s repeated attempts to evict Palestinians in Masafer Yatta and wascondemnedby Israel’s culture minister. “It was a revenge for our movie,” he said. “I heard the voices of the soldiers, they were laughing about me … I heard [the word] ‘Oscar’.”After facing criticism from the film’s co-director Yuval Abraham, an Israeli journalist, for not speaking up in Ballal’s defense, the Academy president, Janet Yang, and the CEO, Bill Kramer, issued a statement on Wednesday that did not reference Ballal or the film by name. The statement condemned “harming or suppressing artists for their work or their viewpoints”. It went on to say: “We are living in a time of profound change, marked by conflict and uncertainty – across the globe, in the US, and within our own industry. Understandably, we are often asked to speak on behalf of the Academy in response to social, political, and economic events. In these instances, it is important to note that the Academy represents close to 11,000 global members with many unique viewpoints.”Abrahamcriticizedthe statement on social media: “After our criticism, the Academy’s leaders sent out this email to members explaining their silence on Hamdan’s assault: they need to respect ‘unique viewpoints’,” he wrote on X. He compared the comments to a “rightfully strong” statement made by the Academy in 2011, when the organization condemned the Iranian government’s arrest of six Iranian film-makers, including director Jafar Panahi.View image in fullscreenBasel Adra, Rachel Szor, Hamdan Ballal and Yuval AbrahamPhotograph: Mike Coppola/Getty ImagesThe new letter, which is still updating signatories, rejects Yang and Kramer’s letter as falling “far short of the sentiments this moment calls for. Therefore we are issuing our own statement, which speaks for the undersigned members of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.” Other notable signatories include: the actors Natasha Lyonne, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Riz Ahmed, John Cusack, Elizabeth Olsen and Marisa Tomei; directors Errol Morris, Todd Haynes and Boots Riley; and documentarians Laura Poitras, Liz Garbus and Alex Gibney, among others.“To win an Oscar is not an easy task,” the letter reads. “Most films in competition are buoyed by wide distribution and exorbitantly priced campaigns directed at voting members. ForNo Other Landto win an Oscar without these advantages speaks to how important the film is to the voting membership.”It continues: “The targeting of Ballal is not just an attack on one film-maker – it is an attack on all those who dare to bear witness and tell inconvenient truths.”The letter concludes with a message to the No Other Land film team, a collective of Israelis and Palestinians whoadvocatedfor a political vision of peace on the Oscar stage just three weeks ago: “We will continue to watch over this film team. Winning an Oscar has put their lives in increasing danger, and we will not mince words when the safety of fellow artists is at stake.”Other film organizations have spoken forcefully in Ballal’s defense. CPH:DOX, a documentary film festival currently under way in Copenhagen, issued a statement condemning the Israeli authorities’ treatment of Ballal in custody, as did the European Film Academy and the International Documentary Association.Explore more on these topicsNo Other LandOscarsIsrael-Gaza warDocumentary filmsnewsShareReuse this content"

Javice, 32, faces the possibility of a lengthy prison term.Javice was in her mid-20s when she founded Frank, a company with software that promised to simplify the process of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, a complex government form used by students to apply for aid for college or graduate school.The company promoted itself as a way for financially needy students to obtain more aid faster, in return for a few hundred dollars in fees. Javice appeared regularly on cable news programs to boost Frank’s profile, once appearing on Forbes’ “30 Under 30” list before JPMorgan bought the startup in 2021.Wall Street shrinks in response to price pressures, stoking fears of Trump tariffsRead moreJPMorgan executives testified that she told them she had over four million clients and would have about 10 million by year’s end, but it turned out there were only about 300,000 customers.Javice’s lawyer, Jose Baez, told the jury that JPMorgan knew what it was getting in the deal and made up the fraud allegations due to buyer’s remorse after government regulatory changes made the data it received in the deal useless to its hopes of gaining new young customers.Javice is among a number of young tech executives who vaulted to fame and media accolades with supposedly disruptive or transformative companies, only to see their businesses collapse amid questions about whether they had engaged in puffery and fraud while dealing with investors.She founded the company not long after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania’s business school, telling interviewers she was motivated to dive into helping college students connect with financial resources because of her own frustrations navigating the process of getting financial aid.Frank’s financial backers included venture capitalist Michael Eisenberg. The company offered a product similar to online tax preparation software that it said could help students maximize their financial aid while making the application process much less painful.JPMorgan was interested in acquiring Frank partly because of the potential it saw in the startup’s supposedly huge list of satisfied customers. The bank believed those young, future college graduates could potentially be sold on the idea of a lifelong partnership with the financial institution.After buying the company, JPMorgan said it found evidence Javice had lied about her number of customers.Frank’s chief of engineering, Patrick Vovor, testified at the trial that Javice had asked him to generate synthetic data to support her claim that the company had over 4 million users. At the time, JPMorgan was insisting on verification of the customers. Vovor said he refused her request.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The results were sent to a third-party data provider that JPMorgan hired to verify the number of customers, but the data provider never checked to ensure the people were real, testimony showed.Baez said the bank knew what it was getting and the number of customers was in the hundreds of thousands rather than millions.“JPMorgan is not telling the truth,” he said. “They knew the numbers.”Javice, who lived in Miami Beach, Florida, has been free on $2m bail since her arrest in 2023.Explore more on these topicsBusinessJP MorganForbes magazinenewsShareReuse this content"

The phenomenon occurs when the moon passes between the sun and Earth. The three will not be completely aligned, meaning only part of the sun will be obscured.Honor Criswick, a Met Office meteorologist, said conditions were “slightly chillier” on Friday, adding: “We then see some milder air move through on Saturday but with this more cloud, outbreaks of rain perhaps lingering for a time across parts of the south-east through the early hours of Sunday, but then high pressure largely dominating and it sticks around as we head into next week too bringing some fine and settled conditions, perhaps even some warm sunshine.”She said Sunday morning would be cloudy with possible drizzle and mist, and that in Northern Ireland, and parts of Wales and Cornwall, there may be grey skies in the afternoon.“For the rest of the week … we have this area of high pressure building its way up from the south, dragging in some more milder air too, so it’s likely that there will be quite a settled start to the week next week, lots of sunny spells and also some quite warm temperatures,” she added.Explore more on these topicsUK weathernewsShareReuse this content"

It staged the trial in conjunction with six NHS hospitals in England and Wales.Dr Shiva Tripathi, an NHS pain consultant and the chief investigator of the trial, said if the drug is approved by regulators and becomes available it would be “a gamechanger for chronic lower back pain on the similar levels as [how] antibiotics made a difference to infection. Because if we can get these 25% of the patients with chronic low back pain back to work, back to no medications, back to no more disability, then I think [that] will be the massive gamechanger for the future.”However, the randomised controlled trial involved only 44 patients – 22 in Britain and 22 in Spain, Denmark and New Zealand – so PP353 will have to undergo further trials, and be endorsed by the medicines watchdogs, before doctors can offer it to patients to relieve their symptoms.The patients had all had severe back pain for at least six months, and in some cases more than five years, that had not responded to conventional treatment, such as painkilling medication.Persica said that a big advantage of their treatment is that the patient has two injections four days apart rather than undergoing surgery or taking tablets for a long time. Recentresearch foundthat most of the 56 ways of trying to alleviate back pain which researchers studied – ranging from massage and acupuncture to painkillers and physiotherapy – brought little or no real relief.PP353 is a combination of three substances that are already widely used in medicine: linezolid, an antibiotic; iohexol, a contrast agent or dye; and a thermosensitive gel. It is injected into the lower back in order to banish an infection that has developed around the discs.Steve Ruston, the firm’s chief executive, said: “Our first patient trial produced really positive results. [It produced] significant reductions in pain and disability and [patients also got] clinically meaningful benefit and statistically significant benefit. The patient benefit potential is enormous.“If you can reduce the pain and disability that people are living with in the way that some of our [trial] patients have responded, it will transform their lives.”Market research shows that 2 million people in the US and 250,000-300,000 in the UK could benefit, he added. “Millions of people around the world can benefit from this. But low back pain is not just a first-world problem; everybody gets low back pain.”The drug is different from other back pain treatments, Ruston added, because it targets the underlying cause of the problem rather than just its main symptom – pain.Low back painis one of the world’s commonest health problems. Six in 10 people in the UK develop it at some point. It is expected to grow as a problem worldwide because of the ageing and growing population. It is often hard to diagnose the cause and even harder to treat successfully.Many patients in the trial experienced a drop in the amount of pain they were suffering within a month of the injections and were still feeling a lot better after a year, Persica said. However, it reduced, but did not remove, the need to keep taking painkillers, Ruston added.But Dr Benjamin Ellis, a consultant rheumatologist at Imperial Healthcare NHS trust in London, who specialises in chronic pain, voiced scepticism about PP353’s potential.“Modern medicine has largely failed people with chronic – in other words, long-term – back pain. But there is little evidence that interventions using surgery or injections, or even taking medicines, makes much difference for the vast majority of people with chronic low back pain.“People with chronic low back pain are understandably desperate for anything that can help. There’s also a huge industry in supplying technologies and medicines that claim to help, but little evidence that these do.“Promising holistic approaches, such as cognitive functional therapy, often don’t get a look in, particularly when services are overstretched.“That being said, if there is a subgroup of people with chronic low back pain that can reliably and safely benefit from a simple pair of injections, then that would be fantastic news – but it seems unlikely.”Explore more on these topicsBack painDrugsMedical researchAntibioticsnewsShareReuse this content"

You have to be relatively healthy to do that. If she had gone, she would have gone months before she would have died here.”Rantzen, alongtime supporter of assisted dying, was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer in 2023. She was thought to have just weeks to live, but last year started using a “wonder drug” that helped her survive against the odds.When asked if her mother was “still improving”, Wilcox said: “I really wish that was true, but I don’t think that’s the case any more.”View image in fullscreenRebecca Wilcox, Rantzen’s daughter.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianNews of Rantzen’s deteriorating health comes in the same week that theassisted dying bill was pushed backuntil 2029, creating a delay that supportive MPs fear could mean the change of law is never realised.In November last year, the television personality told MPs “my time is running out”, but the issue was one “the public care desperately about”,and said it might not be debated by MPs for another decade if the legislation did not pass.Responding to the bill’s delay, Wilcox said: “I just wish that people understood that all the assisted dying bill is, is choice for people that want it.“All it is, is giving you peace of mind and that peace of mind, I cannot tell you how powerful that would be right now for my mum.”She said she had watched her mother suffer “trauma” over the uncertainty of her deteriorating health.“The fact that she doesn’t know how her death is going to happen, how the pain is going to progress, the exhaustion, the fatigue, what symptoms are going to come in,” she said.“She is a person who has fought her whole life for other people, and she has no control now. Why can’t we give people like my mum with a terminal diagnosis, with no other choice, some choice as to when and how and where they die?”Earlier this week Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP piloting the assisted dying bill through parliament, proposed the delay, meaning the initial timeline of two years for implementing the law will now stretch to four.The delay marks the latest major change to the assisted dying proposals, which have proven contentious in the Commons and beyond.A spokesperson for Leadbeater said she “hopes and believes the service can be delivered more quickly”, but that the changes made to the bill since last autumn meant it would “inevitably take longer to implement”.On Tuesday, the Isle of Man’s parliament approved a bill to legalise assisted dying, making it the first place in the British Isles to introduce the change.Explore more on these topicsEsther RantzenAssisted dyingCancernewsShareReuse this content"

It “protected the territory from Nazi occupation” in the 1940s and made an offer to buy the island that was rebuffed. Even going back to 1910, the US had designs on Greenland, the Russian leader noted, calling the US plans “serious” with “longstanding historical roots”.Then Putin moved on to Alaska, which was sold by the Russian empire to the US in 1867 in what has become a national case of seller’s remorse. “Let me remind you that by 1868, the purchase of Alaska was ridiculed in American newspapers,” Putin continued. Now, he said, the purchase under president Andrew Johnson had been vindicated.In short, Putin concluded, get over it. Big countries have territorial ambitions. Deals for land and annexations are not just historical relics – they are a modern reality. And, rejecting generations of international norms not to take territory by force or through extortion, it is none of our business what they do over there.“As for Greenland, this is an issue that concerns two specific states and has nothing to do with us,” Putin said, while adding that Russia would continue to defend its interests in the Arctic from “dangerous” powers such as Finland and Sweden.It does not take a Kremlinologist to understand why Putin has come out in support of Trump’s annexation plan. As US power recedes inEurope, the Kremlin is seizing its chance to establish its long-awaited “multipolar world” in which it holds dominion over a sphere of influence, particularly in Ukraine and Belarus. Putin has railed against US hegemony since his Munich speech of 2007, and he finally has a US president who is just as derisive of the postwar order as he is.Putin’s mantra that countries should mind their own business dovetails closely with Trump’s transactional view of the world, as well as his deep suspicion of transnational organisations and alliances set up after the second world war.Those range from the United Nations, to the international criminal court, to even foreign economic blocs such as the EU, which he said was “formed in order to screw the United States”.“The postwar global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us,” said Marco Rubio during his Senate confirmation hearing in January. He is among the more moderate members of Trump’s cabinet. Those toward the more extreme, including Vance, have elevated “restrainers” seeking to accelerate the US withdrawal from Europe or even openly antagonise the US’s erstwhile allies.But as US power recedes abroad, the White House has declared ambitions throughout the western hemisphere in a turn that some commentators have compared to theMonroe doctrineof 1823, under which the US proclaimed itself theprotector of the hemisphere. And with each soundbite declaring that the US should take back the Panama canal or that Canada should become the 51st state, Trump will find an enthusiastic ally in the Kremlin who will see his jaded vision of a new world order reflected in another.Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinDonald TrumpJD VanceGreenlandEuropeRussiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Among them were a group of Israeli soldiers who escorted the settlers into the village where Hamdan Ballal, one of the four directors of the Oscar-winning documentaryNo Other Land, lives.About three weeks after appearing on stage at the 97th Academy Awards in Los Angelesto accept the Oscar, Ballal has become the victim of the very violence shown in his film.Ballal said that two Israeli soldiers hadchased him outside his houseand encircled him, while a settler started beating him, before violently striking him on the head with the butt of their rifles. Bleeding from his head, handcuffed and blindfolded, Ballal, whose documentary chronicles the struggle by Palestinians of the West Bank to stop the army from demolishing their villages, was then moved to a military base and held in custody for the night before being released the following day.“It was a revenge for our movie,” he said.View image in fullscreenStill from a video shows one of the masked Israeli settlers who carried out the attack in SusiyaTheIsraelDefense Forces did not respond to Ballal’s allegations that he was beaten by soldiers in front of his house.The attack shed light on the escalating violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers and soldiers against Palestinians in theWest Banksince the onset of the Gaza war on 7 October 2023, amid threats by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu’s, far-right government to annex occupied Palestinian territory – an objective that could be put in its reach Donald Trump’s US administration.View image in fullscreenHamdan Ballal is detained by the Israeli military at his West Bank home.Photograph: Raviv Rose/APIsraeli settlers and state forces have killed at least 870 Palestinians, including 177 children, in attacks across the West Bank since that start of the latest Gaza war,according to the Palestinian ministry of health.From 7 October 2023 to 31 December 2024, at least 1,860 incidents of settler violence in the West Bank wererecorded– an average of four a day, according to data from theUnited NationsOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).The Center for Jewish Nonviolence (CJNV), an NGO that aims to bring Jewish activists from around the world to support Palestinian non-violent resistance, shared details of at least 43 attacks in Ballal’s village since the beginning of the year.Five Palestinians were injured in Masafer Yatta on Friday after another attack by settlers.View image in fullscreenAn injured Palestinian man is treated by a paramedic in Masafer Yatta“The attack against Ballal is no isolated event,” said Omar Shakir, the Human Rights Watch director for Israel, the West Bank andGaza. “Settlers routinely terrorise Palestinians, with the Israeli army often taking part. Israeli settlers have assaulted, tortured, and committed sexual violence against Palestinians, stolen their belongings and livestock, threatened to kill them if they did not leave permanently.“Settler violence, with the apparent backing of higher Israeli authorities, has reached unprecedented levels and in many cases appears aimed to force out Palestinians,” he added.Ballal said “settlers act like a mafia – they are criminals behaving like a criminal organisation”.Israel captured the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in 1967 and there are now more than 100 settlements – illegal under international law – that are home to 700,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship and live among 2.7 million Palestinians subjected to Israeli military rule.In February, for the first time in two decades, Israeldeployed tanks to the occupied West Bankas troops intensified operations against militants in Jenin. And as Israel stepped up its offensive in the West Bank, it simultaneously accelerated settlement expansion and its threat of annexing the region.The Israeli human rights organisation Peace Now, in astatementon Tuesday, said that between 1 January and 19 March this year 10,503 housing units were approved, surpassing the 9,971 units approved throughout the whole of 2024.Prof Yagil Levy, head of the Institute for the Study of Civil-Military Relations at the Open University of Israel, said Israel was exploiting the “unique circumstances” of the war to advance its plans to annex so-called Area C areas – 61% of the West Bank with the highest concentration of settlements.“October 7th provided legitimacy for a new security concept that creates demilitarised buffer zones between Israel and its neighbours. This applies to Gaza, Lebanon, and also to the West Bank through accelerating the annexation of Area C.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​’’View image in fullscreenPalestinians surrender to Israeli troops in June 1967 in the West Bank.Photograph: Pierre Guillaud/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a key partner in Netanyahu’s coalition and a settler himself who lives in Kedumim, has for years called for Israel to claim sovereignty in the West Bank.On 23 MarchSmotrich said: “Instead of hiding and apologising we raise the flag, build and settle. This is another step on the path to sovereignty in Judea and Samaria [Israel’s term for the West Bank].”Levy said: “Smotrich and his party demanded that the fighting in the West Bank be added to Israel’s war objectives in Gaza. In return, he accepted the first phase of the hostage deal – which he initially opposed – and refrained from toppling the government.”The settler movement has been buoyed up by the Trump administration, which rescinded sanctions imposed on violent Israeli settler groups and, they believe could offer them a“special opportunity”to expand Israel’s hold on occupied territory.Trump’s nominee to be US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has previously supported the annexation of the West Bank (in nomination hearings he has said he would carry out the president’s priorities, not his own). When Trump was posed the question at a press conference last month with Netanyahu he replied by saying he would probably be “making an announcement” on the matter but had not yet taken a position on it.“They won’t stop here,” Ballal said. “The settlers will continue to attack us. I’m more scared now than before. After what they did to me, I fear it could now happen to others.”Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesWest BankIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaNo Other LandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump has repeatedly railed against the US’s trade deficit with leading powers such as China and the EU.The US is the single largest individual-country trading partner for the UK, in a relationshipworth almost £300bn a year. In 2023, the UK imported £57.9bn of goods from the US, and exported £60.4bn the other way – including car exports worth £6.4bn, almost 20% of the country’s total international sales. The UK benefits from a much larger surplus in services.Downing Street officials are closely involved in the talks, including the prime minister’s “sherpa” Michael Ellam and his business adviser Varun Chandra. The latter accompanied Reynolds on his trip to Washington DC to discuss the economic prosperity deal earlier this month.On that visit, Reynolds met Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative, and Mark Burnett, Trump’s special envoy to the UK. Some officials stayed behind in Washington to keep talking through details. Staff at the UK embassy in Washington, led by Peter Mandelson who is a former EU trade commissioner, were also closely involved.While the government is concentrated on securing a deal, it has not ruled out retaliatory tariffs. Keir Starmer said on Friday that the UK “reserves the right to respond” to US tariffs next week, saying, “our national interest has to come first”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

None of them want to see a trade war, which is why we’re engaged in discussions with the US about mitigating the impact of tariffs.” The US is the second largest export market for cars built in the UK, after the EU.View image in fullscreenHoward Lutnick (right), the US commerce secretary, on a recent trip to Washington DC.Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty ImagesSome question whether the UK’s approach is the right one. David Henig, a trade expert, said amounted to “a gamble if you’re not one of the countries that’s most targeted – which we’re almost certainly not – that it’s still better to seek out a deal than, frankly, keep your head down and be ignored”.The concern is that the government is offering up big concessions to the US unnecessarily, when Trump’s package of tariffs is set to be narrower than feared and the UK was never a target for them. Ministers have offered up the £800m digital services tax, which targets US tech companies, as part of the talks for an economic deal. “You start to wonder is this going to be a good deal? It might all pay off in the end but it’s looking like a gamble,” Henig said.Britain’s trade dealings with the US have previously involved roadblocks over allowing US farmers to sellchlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beefto UK consumers, and there are signs that those difficult sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) issues are coming up again.Reynolds told the Chatham House event: “There are some difficult areas for us.

If anyone has a chance of exemptions, it is the UK.

Growing up in the south-western French city of Toulouse, she was not ignorant of dental care – her cousin was a dental surgeon, she had briefly endured a pair of wire retainers as a teen and she never had any cavities. But flossing?Mais non.“Being French, we didn’t know what flossing was,” recalls Diligenti. “Absolutely nobody mentioned it – certainly not my cousin.” Some were mysteriously familiar with the practice; once, in the 80s, she saw a French friend rubbing a string between his teeth. But she thought, “What the heck is he doing?”In 1996, she and her then husband – a Mancunian with “really bad teeth” – went to their first American dental checkup.“The dentist looked at us like we were freak shows,” she said. Every time the couple went back for a cleaning, the dentist would tell them they had to floss. “Finally, we said, ‘What do you mean?’”“Preventative care has not traditionally been a priority inFrance,” says Dr Adriana Agachi, a pediatric dentist in Paris. She suspects this is because dental care in France is largely covered by social security, so there is less concern about the financial cost of dental emergencies.Agachi says that when she worked in Switzerland, where dental care tends to be more expensive than in France, patients were diligent about scheduling checkups and cleanings every six months. When Agachi asked them why, they told her that because of the high costs, “they prefer to avoid major issues through regular prevention”.Dentistry in the US is “very focused” on preventative care, says Dr Sally J Cram, a periodontist and spokesperson and consumer adviser for the American Dental Association (ADA).“[US] dentists and researchers are putting dentists out of business in some respects,” says Cram. “When you help people take care of their teeth at home, they have fewer cavities and less gum disease.”Flossing cleans the areas between the teeth that can’t be reached with a toothbrush, Cram says. Both brushing and flossing remove plaque – a sticky buildup of bacteria and food debris that starts forming on the teeth as soon as 10 minutes after we eat.A healthy person who removes all the plaque from the surface of their teeth and under the gumline every 24 hours is unlikely to have many dental problems, says Cram. When plaque sits on the teeth for more than 24 hours, however, the bacteria in plaque begin to inflame the gums. “That’s what makes your gums bleed and feel sore,” Cram explains.Left longer than one to two days, plaque hardens and becomes impossible to remove with at-home brushing and flossing – only a professional dental cleaning can get it off. Left for months or years, the bacteria from plaque can make its way down to the jawbone and begin to erode it, leading to periodontal disease.In fairness to the French, there is actually very little data to support the benefits of flossing.In 2015, the US Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Servicescausedamediahubbubwhen they removed any mention of flossing from official dietary guidelines. The government later told theAssociated Pressthat “the effectiveness of flossing had never been researched”. Indeed, one 2015reviewfound that “the majority of studies fail to demonstrate that flossing is generally effective in plaque removal”.View image in fullscreenComposite: The Guardian/Getty Images/ArtveeCram acknowledges that there have been limited long-term studies on flossing. But she attributes this to the complexity and expense of carrying out effective long-term studies of anything.“The bottom line is, flossing is a low-risk, low-cost way to clean parts of your teeth where your toothbrush can’t reach,” says Cram. “So what is the harm in doing it?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His dentist at the time had traveled to the US, and did not recommend using floss, but small interdental brushes.When he came to the US, the dental hygienist Suaudeau saw told him to ditch the interdental brushes and use floss instead. He wonders now if his use of the brush was “not satisfactory”.The experts: dentists on 22 quick, easy ways to care for your teethRead moreSuaudeau became a regular flosser for the reason so many people do: because “it’s unpleasant to have someone scolding you when you are an adult”.Still, he says that when he travels home to Paris, some of his friends are confused by his dental accoutrements.“I get questions every now and then, like, ‘What the hell is this stuff?’” Suaudeau says. There isn’t even a word for flossing in French, he adds. Or if there is, he doesn’t know it. “I should because I’m a teacher.”I asked my French colleague, Jessica Reed, who also couldn’t think of a word for flossing. (She also said she regularly lies to her US dentist about flossing, seeing it as “another American imposition on her relaxed French lifestyle”.) Google Translate suggested “passer la soie dentaire”, which roughly translates to “passing dental silk between your teeth”.Diligenti says she does floss – sorry, pass the dental silk between her teeth – now. Well, most of the time. “Sometimes I go to bed without flossing because I come back late from work,” she admits. “But otherwise I do it.”Très bien.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyFranceHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Butas I approached the end of my trial period, my manager told me she’d taken a big gamble and put her reputation on the line for me, given that I’d worked freelance for years. She was clearly insinuating my probation period would be extended, despite colleagues telling me I’d exceeded expectations.She has a very odd management style and speaks to people of all ages as though we’re lazy teenagers,whereas we’re all very driven and pretty senior. She also micromanageswhile leaving us in the dark on important information.She wantsher team to be her mates, to go clubbing, to go on weekends together with our children and partners, and to poke fun at us.People keep telling me I have the best manager in the company, but I’m not sleeping well because I feel like I’m being robbed of my self. How can I place boundaries? I’m up against four really pushy people on the teamand can’t seem to find allies in the others. I need the help of my peers to learn the joband I need my manager to manage me, but when I don’t hang out with themI have to beg for information.The job in itself is fine and it’s an excellent opportunity, but I’m exhausted and dizzied by the amount of excuses I have to come up with to avoid all the events and trips they’re organising. I feel suffocated, infantilised and manipulated.What can I do? I need to make this work.I feel for you. My first job in journalism was very similar. I was finally doing the job I had dreamed of, yet I was so unhappy. In the end, after more than a year, and finding myself on holiday wishing the plane home would crash as I couldn’t bear to go back to my job, I realised it was time to leave. It was the best thing I did. That daily drip, drip, drip is corrosive and after a while you almost can’t see it as you become smaller and smaller.I went to the UK Council for Psychotherapy-accredited therapist Lorna Evans and she said: “You seem to have achieved a lot and this new role offers you an excellent salary and professional development after being self-employed. You also seem very aware of the work environment, culture and what good boundaries look like [all of this is great!]. But what I hear loudest is that you have a ‘bad boss’ who is negatively impacting you in this role.”Remember your value: you got a job in a great company – you can go and find another one“The reality is that most people leave great jobs due to the ‘bad boss’. It’s interesting you feel you ‘need to make it work’. Of course, I understand the importance of a good salary and professional development, but if it’s as bad as it sounds then you don’t need to make it work. You need to look at your options.”You mention that you feel your boss may extend your probation, but what does your contract say and what does HR say? I understand you may have a reluctance to “get official” or go over your boss’s head, but, frankly, she sounds like a bit of a bully, and in my experience work bullies tend to come to heel once they know someone is watching. Evans also suggested keeping notes “in case they are needed further down the line should HR be involved”.I’m a big fan of overcoming obstacles rather than leaving places because of one person, but only you know – as I had to work out – if and when you’ve exhausted the possibilities there. Feeling “robbed of your self, suffocated, infantalised and manipulated” is quite a burden.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

This film about her recovery is brutal, raw – and full of gut-wrenching moments that have nothing to do with the injuryRachel AroestiFri 28 Mar 2025 18.25 EDTShareThe first time we encounter the writer and presenter Clemency Burton-Hill in this Arena documentary, she is in full, fluent, broadcasterly flow, promoting her new book on classical music,Year of Wonder. The next time we see her, she is struggling to spell her own name. The former clip is from 2017, the latter while Burton-Hill was recovering from the brain haemorrhage she suffered in January 2020 at 38 years old.My Brain: After the Rupture covers the two years after Burton-Hill’s brain injury. She begins recording herself in her hospital bed, having clearly grasped the journalistic potential of documenting such a life-altering event. She tries to speak, but much of what she says is incomprehensible: she can remember most words, but has lost the ability to actually say them. Her terror and despair, however, is crystal clear. “I don’t know that this is going to be OK,” she eventually manages to utter, her voice wavering violently.Clemency Burton-Hill: ‘I can say now, after my brain injury, that music can save a life’Read moreIt isn’t OK. While Burton-Hill’s physical and verbal progress over the next two years seem astonishing from the outside, her emotional landscape – dominated by fury, impatience, anxiety and grief – suggests the psychological repercussions of her brain bleed are too profound to fully articulate. This is despite her absolute candour: her body, she says, is “frozen in neurological winter”. Rather than delving into the technicalities of Burton-Hill’s medical condition, this fascinating, raw and intimate documentary simply bears witness to a woman navigating the loss of her former self with bravery and superhuman determination.That former self was defined by a love of music. Burton-Hill has lost sensation in the right side of her body, which means it’s initially impossible for her to play her beloved violin. She was an accomplished player and the instrument has long been an “ally and a friend”: we see her four-year-old self perform Bach’s Minuet 1; in home videos she’s air-violining on the sofa. She has spent her career extolling the virtues of classical music, so her inability to play is now the source of much frustration and sadness.View image in fullscreenClemency Burton-Hill: ‘After the mourning stage, it’s figuring out: what can I do now that will fulfil me.’Photograph: BBC/Rooks Nest EntertainmentIt’s a career Burton-Hill is extremely keen to return to. Before the haemorrhage she was working on a sequel to Year of Wonder; soon, she has painstakingly finished the book. It’s an incredible achievement – but as she goes through a proof with her editor, Burton-Hill is suddenly overwhelmed by agony. She is desperate to put the book behind her because she “can’t have bits of my former life taunting me”. Collaborating with her past self only highlights how much she has changed.As the whole preschooler-playing-Bach thing suggests, Burton-Hill has always been a high-achieving perfectionist (she graduated with a double-first from Cambridge). Combine that with lifelong “crippling self-doubt” and you have someone for whom accomplishment and career success is hugely validating. Considering Burton-Hill’s catastrophic health issues, it’s telling that a throwaway remark by an insensitive doctor constitutes one of the film’s most brutal scenes. Shewasa writer and a musician, he implies. “So after the mourning stage, it’s figuring out: what can I do now that will fulfil me in a way that [those things] fulfilled me?” As Burton-Hill tears up, we realise she has just been robbed of something precious: her belief that she will one day excel at work in the way she once did.View image in fullscreenDefiant … Burton-Hill in the new documentary.Photograph: BBC/Rooks Nest EntertainmentYet it’s the more generic elements of Burton-Hill’s life that are most moving to watch. In the early days, she’s tormented by the fact that she is too exhausted to play with her sons; later she is gutted by her eldest’s admission that he is forgetting what she was like before the rupture. While her family background is not particularly relatable on paper – her father is Humphrey Burton, host of 70s arts programme Aquarius (he also established the BBC’s Young Musician of the Year, which Burton-Hill presented in the 2010s) – its dynamics are universal. Burton was a largely absent father, his daughter has been craving his affection her whole life. One of the most emotional moments here has nothing to do with the brain bleed; instead, it involves her 90-year-old dad crying about his parental regrets.The documentary concludes at the end of 2021, as Burton-Hill launches the second Another Year of Wonder book. Earlier, she explained the concept of a two-year recovery window after a brain haemorrhage, which is presumably why the film ends there. But it leaves you wondering how she’s coping, three years on. Has she continued to push herself career-wise or have her passions and priorities changed? Has she made peace with her new reality? I’d like to think Burton-Hill has held on to the admirably fierce mantra with which she approached her brain injury back then: no acceptance, just defiance.My Brain: After the Rupture aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionClassical musicBBCreviewsShareReuse this content"

Either you can slink off embarrassed and wait however long it takes for the furore to die down, or you can make an entire album about it.You probably don’t need to be told which option Smith took.The first plays of his new album Based on a True Story have started to air, and it’s starting to look like an awful lot of it is about the moment when he interrupted the Academy Awards to approachChris Rock, slap him, return to his seat and scream at Chris Rock, before winning an Oscar later and giving the most deranged speech in the history of the awards.According to Variety, the first track on the album – entitled Int Barbershop – Day – immediately addresses the slap. After the first words spoken on the album announce that “Will Smith is cancelled,” voices trade lines such as “Who the fuck Will Smith think he is?” and “I ain’t never going to forgive him for that shit he did.” Then Smith starts rapping, with lines like, “I heard he won the Oscar but he had to give it back / And you know they only made him do that shit because he’s Black,” and “Him and Jada both crazy girl, what you talkin’ bout ?/ You better keep his wife’s name out of your mouth.”The second song, You Lookin’ for Me? continues to elaborate on the subject, with the line, “Took a lot, I’m back on top / Y’all gon’ have to get acclimated / Won’t stop, my shit still hot / Even though I won’t get nominated.”What a lot of information to try to parse. On the one hand, Smith has every right to address what happened three years ago, it would almost be weird if he didn’t. To see him release another album of lightweight hip-hop that blankly refused to acknowledge that the slap ever happened would be baffling. It would be like, well, watching himdancing to Gettin’ Jiggy Wit Itat the Vanity Fair party hours after exploding his career in front of millions of people.On the other hand, would it be too much to ask for a little factual accuracy? While Smith did win an Oscar for King Richard on Slap Night, he was never actually asked to return it, although he was penalised in other ways. But then again, “I heard he won the Oscar but was subsequently banned from attending any events connected to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for a decade / Plus he voluntarily resigned his Academy membership andlater released a statementwhere he described himself as ‘deeply remorseful’ for letting everybody down on what should have been their big night” – probably lacks the syntax to become a memorable hip-hop track.Still, hopefully this draws a definitive line underneath the incident. After all, it took Rock a year to meaningfully comment on the slap, which he did during a blisteringly angry tirade at the end of his live Netflix special Selective Outrage, in which he reframed Smith’s loss of control as a reaction to Jada Pinkett Smith’s decision to publicly discuss the messy ins and outs of their marriage. And now Smith has had his turn, by admitting in song that he is unlikely to receive an Oscar nomination for his role in Bad Boys: Ride Or Die.Is that as good as a thorough, clear-eyed explanation of what still seems like a moment of dangerous instability? No. Is the acknowledgment particularly satisfying? No. Does it let Smith off the hook? Also no. But at least it’s something.All the parties have now had their say. And this means we can all detach ourselves from the slap and let it be what it is; the second weirdest thing to happen during theOscars, after Rob Lowe singing Proud Mary with Snow White. Finally, we can start the important work of taking the slap out of our mouths.Explore more on these topicsWill SmithOscarsChris RockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was spotted by a local actor,Andrew Schofield– who was Johnny Rotten in Alex Cox’s 1986 film Sid and Nancy – while playing Jim Hawkins in a school production of Treasure Island.Graham joined Liverpool’s Everyman youth theatre, an institution that has helped develop the acting chops of everyone fromPete Postlethwaite and Julie Walters to Jonathan Pryce and Bill Nighy, then moved to London.View image in fullscreenStephen Graham as Tommy, right, in Guy Ritchie’s film Snatch, with Brad Pitt, centre, and Jason Statham.Photograph: Cinetext/Columbia/AllstarGraham got a fortuitous bit part in the Guy Ritchie short The Hard Case: he went along to support a friend and was asked to audition. He wasn’t cast inLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrelsbut that small role planted the seed for his breakthrough as Tommy, the cockney dog enthusiast in Ritchie’sSnatch, starring Brad Pitt and Benicio del Toro.With its spotlight on the ‘manosphere’, Adolescence begs the question: how do we raise good men? | Michael FloodRead moreMartin Scorsese was impressed and cast Graham inGangs of New York, alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, which led to him playing two real-life gangsters: Al Capone in Boardwalk Empire and Baby Face Nelson in Michael Mann’sPublic Enemies. He worked with Scorsese again onThe Irishman, but for Graham – who lives in the sleepy Leicestershire village of Ibstock with his wife and co-producer, Hannah Walters, and two children – it is British drama that interests him the most.“Is it a conscious decision that I do these, what shall we call them, working-class projects?” Grahamtold the Guardianin 2019 when he was promoting Line of Duty and Shane Meadows’The Virtues. “No. But the writing resonates with me. They’re the sort of stories I saw as a kid. I saw Boys from the Blackstuff, I saw Play for Today, I saw Made in Britain.” He is drawn to “real stories about real people”, who are often living on the edges of society: marginalised, rejected and frequently very, very angry.View image in fullscreenStephen Graham with Shea Michael-Shaw in Shane Meadows’ The Virtues.Photograph: Dean Rogers/Dean Rogers / Channel 4Adolescence is slightly different. Graham isn’t just one of the leads, he’s the writer,along with Jack Thorne, and producer. The show’s director, Philip Barantini, first met Graham on the set of Band of Brothers and the pair of scouse actors forged a close relationship that remained as he evolved into a mould-breaking director. His “one shot” technique, which he used with Graham on thekitchen drama Boiling Point, has helped create one of the most talked about British TV shows of the 21st century.“He cares about the work,” says Barantini. “He’s not just coming in and saying: ‘Where do you want me?’ When he steps on set you’ve got to be on top of your game because he’s giving you everything. He thrives on being real and being in the moment. Some actors come in and they pre-plan everything: every tear, every movement. He really soaks in the environment and the room, he works off energy.”Other friends and colleagues speak about a “courteous” actor who is generous on set to cast and crew. But also someone who demands high standards, not by shouting or intimidation but by leading by example and coaching less experienced actors.Michael Socha, the Derby-based actor who starred alongside Graham in This Is England, says it’s his dedication to his work that makes his performances special. Graham brought Socha in to work with him on the BBC prison dramaTime. Before he got on set, Graham was already discussing his character’s backstory – putting flesh on the bones so the performance was stronger or – a word Graham favours – real.View image in fullscreen‘I lost myself quite a bit within that character’, said Graham of Combo in This Is England.Photograph: Optimum Releasing/Allstar“It’s difficult watching my friends act,” says Socha. “But Stephen has that quality – an ‘it’ factor. He’s got a brilliant natural performance. It’s ultra real, believable and invested acting. You’re seeing an actor really feel the emotions of the character and he does that every time. I’ve never seen him do something bad … and he’s done a lot.”Occasionally his commitment to a character has taken him to dark places. When filming This Is England, Graham embodied the character of Combo so strongly that he started to lose sight of where he began and the skinhead ended. “It was life-changing. I lost myself quite a bit within that character,” he once said. There have been other difficult times. On Desert Island Discs in 2019, Graham told Lauren Laverne abouthis battles with depression and a suicide attemptshortly after he moved to London for drama school.Graham grew up as a mixed-race child inLiverpool, a city with the oldest established black population in the UK but also one with a bad reputation for racism. Playing a fascist – one who was confused about his own racial identity and who beats another black character half to death – dredged up painful memories. “I had moments of getting back to my apartment and phoning Hannah and crying my eyes out, and I drank. For me that was where I really learned to dive into a character,” he added.Graham’s origins are central to the way he picks projects. He regularly asks if his characters can have scouse accents in an attempt to broaden the type of characters actors from Liverpool can play and to undermine certain negative stereotypes. “He’s paved the way for other scouse actors,” said Barantini. (Graham encouraged his scouse co-star in A Thousand Blows, James Nelson-Joyce, after the young actor approached him and his wife in a Liverpool Nando’s.)View image in fullscreenStephen Graham as a chef in Boiling Point. ‘When he steps on set you’ve got to be on top of your game,’ says the director Philip Barantini.Photograph: VertigoHe has also been a vocal advocate for better stories about working-class communities, ones that reflect complexity and warmth rather than rely on well-worn tropes. “Things can be hard but there’s also a lot of laughter,” hetold the Sunday Times.“My childhood was full of it and being able to represent where I’m from is integral to me. Too often I’ll watch stuff and think they’re treating the working class like an art project. It’s very condescending. ‘Ooh, look at the poor!’ But I’m proud to be this mixed-race working-class kid from a block of flats.”He likes village life: he helps run his son’s football team and is a regular face in the Co-op. “I don’t want to be sitting on Palm Beach or driving down thingy boulevard,” he once said. “It’s not for me.”When asked if he really wouldn’t rather be in LA rather than a Leicestershire village, he replied. “No, not really. But that’s just me. I love England. It’s going to the shit a bit, but I love the people in this country.”With the success ofAdolescence, the British stories he’s invested in are clearly paying off.Explore more on these topicsStephen GrahamTelevisionAdolescenceLiverpoolGuy RitchieShane MeadowsThis Is EnglandprofilesShareReuse this content"

No longer. These days there are glittery gold bow ties that claim to make your cat “look good, feel great”. There are Crocs and mouthwashes for dogs. There are puppy harnesses, bearing the different Harry Potter houses – and much, much more.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.More than half of Britons share their homes with a pet,according to market research company Mintel(in the US, it is 73%) – and many consider themselves not just owners but parents. Dogs in particular are frequently treated as precursors to children – if not preferable. With pets’ new and enlarged role in our lives have come new and different ways to treat them. Analysis byNationwide bankfound its customers had spent nearly £52m on pets in the year to June 2024 – more than on childcare (£37.1m) or dating (just £986,000). But do these accessories actually benefit our pets, or do we risk doing more harm than good?Costumes, clothing, coatsOne of the more overt signs of what’s been termed the “humanisation of pets” is the boom in pet clothing, a market expected to grow to$7bn by 2032. Instagram is a driving factor, with “petfluencers” continually refreshing their looks with costumes and accessories.Though some pets are more tolerant of being dressed up than others, it’s fair to say that few actively enjoy it – at least not as much as food, sleep or play. Experts aren’t fans, pointing out that clothing tends to be restrictive and can impede animals’ natural movement and expression.“It’s not a pleasant experience for most cats,” says cat behaviourist Mikel Maria Delgado, from Sacramento, California. “You’ll see – they’ll flop over and struggle to get out of it.”Customers spend more on pets (£52m) than on childcare (£37.1m) or dating (£986,000)Delgado has known some hairless Sphynx cats to contentedly wear sweaters for warmth – but even those disadvantaged pedigrees may prefer a blanket or heated bed.Most dogs are already equipped for most weather (and if it’s too hot, cold or otherwise extreme for you to want to go walkies, the conditions might not be appropriate for your dog, either). But some – especially older, ailing, smaller or short-coated dogs – may benefit from an extra layer through the colder months. Nick Jones,a dog behaviouristbased in Worcestershire, says he has known some animals that would “literally tremble and shake” when outside in winter without a coat.Jones puts a body fleece on his own mini goldendoodle, Ruby, after she gets wet, because her highly absorbent coat is slow to dry. “She looks completely ridiculous,” Jones admits – one onlooker crowed that she was “wearing pyjamas” – “but it’s all in the spirit of looking after the dog.”A waterproof coat can also make owners’ lives easier by protecting long-haired pets from mud and dirt. But with any clothing, says Jones, function has to come first.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Lightspruch/Getty ImagesBody wraps, backpacks and buggiesIt’s no surprise the experts are against playing dress-up with dogs and cats. Trickier is the gear that claims to improve their quality of life.For anxious dogs, for example, there are body wraps and jackets – the best-known brand being ThunderShirt – that claim to provide reassurance during periods of separation, fireworks or other triggers. Jones’s experience has been mixed. “For one dog, putting a jacket on would be an overload on top of an overload – but for the next dog, it could be life-changing.” Even if the equipment seems effective, it is not a substitute for training and behavioural change, Jones adds. The same goes for anti-pull head collars and harnesses.“It’s a tool,” he says. “It could help – provided we know that we’re never doing anything unethical or that could cause fear or harm to the dog.”With the rise of indoor-only cats, walkies are no longer just for dogs. But “you can’t just slap a harness on them and take them outside”, Delgado says. “A lot depends on the area where you live, how busy it is and whether or not your cat is confident and comfortable in new situations.” If you believe your indoor cat would not only cope with a change of scenery, but benefit from it, Delgado says it’s important to get them used to wearing a harness gradually before taking them outside.Then, if it goes well, it has to become routine. “If they really do like that activity, and you don’t provide it to them on a regular basis, they might start begging for it – so you can end up introducing new behaviour problems.”There is no evidence that indoor cats are any less content than those that roam – but if space and budgets allow, an enclosed outdoor “catio” is a safe, relatively stress-free way of granting outdoor access.As for the bubble backpack, popularised by Taylor Swift, who used one to cart around her Scottish fold, Delgado is unequivocal. “Hate them. Hate them! My main problem with them is you can’t monitor how comfortable your cat is in that situation – if they’re feeling scared, cornered or vulnerable – because you’re wearing them on your back.”Cat bubble backpacks? Hate them. Hate them!Miel Maria Delgado, cat behaviouristIf you’re intent on taking your cat outdoors for extended periods, Delgado says a better option is a “pet stroller” – a bespoke pushchair, typically for smaller animals, which gives them more freedom to move and allows you to see them. It may sound like peak pet-ownership ridiculousness – but for dogs that are post-surgery, elderly, arthritic or otherwise immobile, a buggy ride might be a valuable way to enrich their life, says Samantha Butler-Davies, director ofPetsat Home’s veterinary services arm.“Let’s say your dog loves the beach, but can’t get there – it’s OK to put them in a buggy … But the majority of dogs are designed for all four paws on the floor.” The same applies to protective booties, Butler-Davies adds, which are only necessary if a vet says so.Shampoos,scents and dyesAccording to Mintel, pet owners see bathing and grooming their pets as bonding experiences. You wonder if their pets would say the same.Pet shops today have shampoo aisles to rival those in big supermarkets, with much the same focus on scents, natural ingredients and skin barrier protection.Catsare self-cleaning, and there’s more of a risk of over-washing than under-washing dogs, says Butler-Davies – save it for when your pet is actually dirty: “Some dogs never need a bath.” Always use a pet-specific shampoo, and start with one that’s mild and unscented until you are sure of your pet’s sensitivity levels, she says. “Make sure there’s no reaction when you use it – the skin doesn’t look red, the dog doesn’t get very itchy … And wash it off fully – just as you would with a human.”The same goes for dyes – which are made for use on poodles and other white and light-coloured dogs. “There are questions in my mind about their safety,” says Jones. He also wonders what signals they send about the dog-human bond. “I’m trying not to judge people that do that to their dogs,” he says, carefully, “but I do think: ‘What’s your relationship?’”Emma Milne, a vet, author and animal welfare campaigner, is more blunt. “The main question I have with all of these things is: is there a benefit to the animal? And if there isn’t – even if there is no detrimental effect perceived by the owners – then it shouldn’t be done.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of CrocsFood supplements, sports drinks ... mushroomsTellingly, wellness trends for pets – mostly dogs – overlap almost exactly with those for humans. There are prebiotics and probiotics, multivitamins, turmeric supplements and electrolyte drinks. Pets at Home even sells immunity-boostingSuper Shrooms– a 120g bag costs £46.None of these supplements are likely to be necessary if you’re feeding your pet a complete and balanced diet. “Pet nutrition is so good now, you shouldn’t ever need to supplement unless they have a medical condition,” says Milne.Thoughinterest is increasingin raw or home‑cooked diets for pets, they carry the risk of missing vital nutrients, so approach with caution and in consultation with your vet. It is the same with supplements, says Butler-Davies. “You’ve got to make sure that what you’re giving your dog or cat is necessary … There are sometimes things out there that I think are fads.” Finally, always buy from a reputable source. In a reflection of the current demand for these products, counterfeit pet supplements wereidentified on Amazon, and removed from sale last year.Treats – and toysAccording to the American Kennel Club, most dogs prefer beef and pork over chicken and lamb – but they also typically enjoy variety, and have individual preferences, just like us. The infinite range of treats available means it’s easy to appeal to their different tastes and keep them motivated through training.“Some like soft treats, some like crunchy treats – it depends on what they fancy,” says Butler‑Davies (though older pets may find the former more manageable). But some pet treats seem intended to appeal to owners more than to their animals. “It’s not unusual to see ice-creams for dogs, beer for dogs – you name it,” says Jones.There’s also a line of feline wine, Pinot Meow and MosCATo, which featured on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragons’ Den. Such products may open wallets, but the underlying appeal is in imagining your pet as a human. Your cat doesn’t appreciate that her treats are Easter themed; your dog isn’t expecting a yoghurt-frosted muffin (or “woofin”) for her birthday. “A lot of it is unnecessary whimsy, and human substitution,” says Milne.How much is that doggie in the window seat? How we flew from Australia to Europe with our chihuahua | Aron KohRead moreSpoiling pets with anthropomorphic treats can be “quite detrimental” and may lead to obesity, rates of which arereportedly high. Instead of food, you could treat your pets with a toy. Indoor cats in particular need lots of variety as they are entirely dependent on the habitat you create – at least two scratch posts or pads, as well as different toys.Some pet toys are quite hi-tech, with balls and whirligigs that move by themselves. But Delgado says the most effective way to engage your cat is with a simple wand toy, moving it like prey to bring out their hunting instincts.With dogs, too, finding toys that tap into their particular drive can help to “redirect” destructive or problematic behaviour, says Butler-Davies. Breed, size, age and personality are all relevant; a vet or pet shop employee can help identify something suitable.But most animals won’t play independently for long, which gets to the growing issue with pet ownership and how we decide to spoil them: they benefit less from our spending sprees than from our attention and care. “If people want to treat their animals,” says Milne, “they should make time for them, play with them, go for a walk.”Explore more on these topicsPetsAnimalsDogsCatsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the devastating result hits the screen, the actor relives an extraordinary experienceFri 28 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTShare‘I’ve done any and all number of sexual situations in my 30-year career,” saysMichelle Williams, all matter-of-fact and puckishly charming. “But I’ve never masturbated on film before … and I was nervous. It’s much easier to portray mutual desire than just the desire for oneself. But God, whenLiz[Meriwether] wrote those scenes – when Molly’s alone in the hotel and by the end she’s masturbating to anything, masturbating to a fish in a bowl! – I thought: ‘Oh Liz. You’ve really done it.’”In Williams’s new show, Dying for Sex, she spends one entire episode masturbating – a staggeringly unusual thing for a woman to do on screen. Dying for Sex has a very simple premise, so grab-you-by-the-throat tragic that you’d almost take against it. Except it’s based on a true story, which wasmade into a podcast. Molly is 42, and in remission from a bout of cancer that has robbed her of the marital sex life that wasn’t all that anyway, when she gets the news that the cancer has come back, and is terminal. A palliative care nurse – brilliantly played by Esco Jouley – asks her about a bucket list. Her initial resistance gives way to the realisation that she’s never had an orgasm with another person, and that’s all she wants. So she leaves her husband to spend the rest of her short life chasing tail.I was astonished to find myself crying within 13 minutes. Williams tells me exactly the same thing happened to her when she listened to the podcast: “And I’m not a crier. Things don’t get to me. I’m thick-skinned, I’m experienced, I’m savvy. It takes a lot to break through that.” It’s a very straight-down-the-line description, and the opposite of how she looks, which is much younger than 44, wide-eyed, elfin. In so many of her roles, Williams enlivens a kind of protectiveness, which she then undercuts in some way – inDawson’s Creekit was with party-girl antics; inBrokeback Mountain, her Oscar-nominated turn, her vulnerability is both manipulative and tragic, as she ventriloquises the homophobia of her society; in Dying for Sex, everything is laced with bone-deep wit. “As soon as I had that reaction to the podcast, I thought: ‘Well, I’m sunk. Whatever this thing is, I’ve already emotionally signed on.’”View image in fullscreenClimactic scene … Michelle Williams as Molly in Dying for Sex.Photograph: Sarah Shatz/FXIt is an exquisitely affecting performance, but that’s not what’s radical about the show. First, it’s all the sex, “and we made this pre-All Fours. That book hadn’t come out yet. The world hadn’t been split wide open.” She’s talking about Miranda July’s semi (massively)autobiographical novel, which people call the first great menopause novel when it is actually (in my view) much more about female sexual appetite. In July’s telling, that appetite is immense and terrifying, can and will destroy anything in its path, particularly if what’s in its path is “marriage”. Anyway, Dying for Sex came first, and also kicks off with the protagonist leaving her partner. From there, Molly’s journey is as explosive as an Exocet missile. She discovers her inner dominatrix with a neighbour (played byRob Delaney) who doesn’t use the rubbish chute correctly, and gets there via a same-sex experiment with submission.But this is TV that’s also like Grand Theft Auto for cliches, casually shooting down norms and taboos like they’re defenceless passersby. The central female friendship is much more than a bit of sisterly support; Molly effectively swaps her husband for her best friend, Nikki (Jenny Slate), a charismatic, chaotic actor who already has amazing sex all the time. Jungians call this relationship the golden shadow – the friend who’s similar but excels you in some way you deeply value. The real-life Nikki Boyer worked with them on set, signing off the show’s embellishments – and it’s a gorgeous depiction of “that person [who] knows you in a wordless way, there’s no explaining, you’re not trying to woo, you’re not trying to impress”, but not idealised. Nikki is, as the abandoned husband Steve (Jay Duplass) constantly points out, the last person you want around when you’re having palliative chemotherapy. She can’t even reliably find her purse in her own handbag.Desire is a “portal” for Molly, says Williams, “and maybe that’s what moved us so much about it, is that she chose to see it as an opportunity – to gather something together and take it and imbibe it, own it, before she was divested of everything. She’s saying, I’m committing to this journey, and the only thing I’m taking with me is you, my best friend. I’m going to pursue my own pleasure in the midst of this illness, which is going to ultimately take my life and cause me a lot of pain. I’m going to continue to seek pleasure in this body, which is capable of both those things.”View image in fullscreenBed fellows … Jenny Slate as Nikki (left) with Williams in Dying for Sex.Photograph: Sarah Shatz/FXThen there’s the menopause, which Molly has chemically induced as part of her treatment plan (and says, plaintively, “I thought the one good thing about dying was that I wouldn’t have to go through the menopause”). It’s still high jeopardy, playing a woman experiencing menopause – like playing a grandmother, actors cross a Rubicon where they no longer get cast in younger roles. Williams shrugs the risk off, as if to indicate that she doesn’t worry about things like that. Much less so now, but omertà around talking about menopause at all was so strong until recently that a woman in her 40s might, as Williams describes, “never have had this conversation. Nobody had ever mentioned to me that this was in my future. Not my mother, not my grandmother, not a doctor.”The real Molly loved to take pictures of herself in hospital, says Williams. “She liked to buy beautiful lingerie, it made her feel great, and she would take beautiful photos of herself, hide her scars, send these selfies out, and communicate with strangers. When she was no longer able to have bodily encounters, she was still sexting from her hospital bed.”Another stunningly mould-breaking thing about Dying for Sex is that there’s a huge amount of affection and acceptance and delight between Molly and the people she sleeps with. It’s not because they’re in love – nobody’s trying to turn this into a romcom – it’s simply what’s liable to happen when people desire each other and are open about what they want. On the podcast, after Molly dies, Nikki speaks to some of her lovers and, Williams says, one of them responds: “‘She made me feel so seen, and like I was OK – like the things that I desired, there was no shame or judgment about them.’ I think there’s some connection there, between what illness does to her body, and what desire does to a body. Because bodies have a mind of their own. They do things without us wanting them to. They get sick without us wanting them to. They secrete things without us wanting them to. And desire can also work like that.”From certain angles, the cancer – as real and inexorable and based-on-true-events as it is – functions as a shortcut to utopia. “Could you live like this if you didn’t have a terminal diagnosis? Wouldn’t that be wonderful?” says Williams. At one point, she’s in an Uber with a guy, on their way to have sex, when it all gets too much for him and he prematurely ejaculates. “It isn’t making fun of him, it isn’t ‘How lame, what a disappointment’, it’s thrilling and exhilarating, just to radically accept people as they are.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If there’s a central theme, it’s sexual abuse. That’s why sexual fulfilment has eluded Molly to that point – she was abused by one of her mother’s boyfriends when she was seven: “She was split off from herself because of the abuse she experienced when she was a child. She still grew up, but a part of herself is frozen in time at that age – she’s in amber. I think that’s what she sets out to do, even though she doesn’t know that’s what she’s doing – the sexual journey is trying to repair the original wound while she still has time.”When she signed up for Dying for Sex more than three years ago, Williams discovered she was pregnant with her third child, her second with producer Thomas Kail (the father of her oldest daughter is Heath Ledger). “We toyed with the idea of using CG and painting out my stomach, but decided it would just be completely preposterous to do these scenes with a giant belly between me and my co-stars.” They had to wait, but that was fine because she really doesn’t work all that much, she says – this is the first thing she’s done since The Fabelmans, Steven Spielberg’s movie memoir. That looks like great confidence – the conviction to wait for something good, the courage to say no – but she bats that off. “No, it’s just having small children. I want to stay home with them.”I ask quickly about one of her other great roles: her 2014 Broadway turn as Sally Bowles in Cabaret – the musical about nightclub performers in 1930s Berlin as Nazism is on the rise. It felt as if that role really belonged to her, but “everybody feels like that”, she says. “Judi Dench used to say: ‘Oh, Sally Bowles? My part?’” It’s such a fantastic part, the tough-but-fragile, private-but-public siren, and no two actors ever play it the same way, and Williams brought a gaucheness and uncertainty that was truer to Christopher Isherwood’s book than the Liza Minnelli film. It must have been fun to do a production before there was so much actual fascism in the air, right? “I hope that a time comes when it loses its context,” she says, heavily. “I wish Cabaret didn’t feel so modern. I can’t wait for it to feel dusty.”Mmm, same. But such consolation to the turmoil of the world as ordinary life, sex and death can offer, Dying for Sex has in spades. One of the things that’s rarely said about dying, or the menopause for that matter, is that it might not be characterised by sadness or brain fog but by sexual voraciousness. “This is what the real Molly was facing – how is she going to use her body sexually when it’s failing her in so many ways? But she figures it out. Esther Perel [the psychotherapist] talks about sex as an antidote to death. What could make you feel more alive? I think a lot about that … If you want to continue to explore sexually through menopause, you need to become creative. If you want to explore sexually through illness, you need to become creative.”Dying for Sex is on Disney+ from4 AprilExplore more on these topicsTelevisionMichelle WilliamsDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

About half of the hundreds of garments he finds are in perfect condition. He collects what he can and adds them to the two-tonne pile of clothes he has stored at a friend’s house.On 17 March, 300 of those items, including Nike and Adidas shorts, Calvin Klein jeans and a leather skirt, were listed for sale online for the first time. The price? Zero. Customers had only to pay shipping costs. The first batch sold out in five hours, bought by customers from countries including Brazil, China, France, the US and the UK.Re-commerce Atacamais part of a campaign to raise awareness of the mountains of discarded clothes in Chile and of textile waste globally. It was set up after a fashion show staged in the desert last year, where modelswalked a catwalk of sandwearing outfits made out of the surrounding waste.“We want people to feel involved and be agents of change – not from a passive position of seeing content, but by purchasing something, showing people and telling our story of what is happening here in the desert,” says Barria, 32, a civil engineer and co-founder ofDesierto Vestido(Dressed Desert), an organisation dedicated to raising awareness of textile waste.“At first, there was a certain disbelief on my part to see this happening. I asked myself why garments in perfect condition were being discarded in the desert when there are many people who might like to wear them. It’s sad. It really makes you feel powerless.”Chile has long been a destination for secondhand and unsold clothing, most of it made in China or Bangladesh and passing through Europe, Asia or the US before arriving in the country.

We produce more and more ... faster and fasterFernanda Simon, Fashion Revolution BrazilDetermined to do something about the crisis, Barria’s organisation teamed up with fashion activists Fashion Revolution Brazil, the Brazilian advertising agency Artplan and the e-commerce platform Vtex, to tell the world about the situation.The Re-commerce Atacama operation involves a careful process of selecting and restoring the garments to ensure they are in good condition for resale. They are cleaned and made available for free, bar shipping costs, on the digital platform.View image in fullscreenClothes recovered from the Atacama desert are cleaned and sanitised ready to be put on the Re-commerce Atacama siteIn advance of the first drop of clothes, influencers and personalities including Dudu Bertholini, a judge onDrag Race Brasil, posted about the campaign on social media. The next drop is expected in April. Anyone interested can add their email to be notified when more clothes become available.Fernanda Simon, director of Fashion Revolution Brazil, sees the project as “an act of activism that reveals what is behind fashion and proves we can do things differently”.She says: “More than removing clothes from the desert, we wanted to inspire solutions, rethink the fashion model and show that we must talk about circularity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is no transparency about how these clothes are made.”While 20 years ago, most labels would release four collections of clothes annually, she says, now with the rise of fast fashion and ultra-fast fashion, there can be as many as 52 collections a year.Unsold inventory and unwanted secondhand clothes, most of which come from markets in the US, Europe and Asia, are dumped in countries in the global south. Another place where this problem is particularly visible is Accra, Ghana’s capital, where tangled webs ofclothes line the shore.View image in fullscreenThe next drop of clothes is planned for April, after the first one in March sold out in five hoursSimon labels this practice “racist and colonialist”. Most of the raw materials required to make clothes come from countries in the global south, she says. European countries and the US are the biggest consumers, and when they don’t want the clothes, they end up back in countries in the global south.“It’s a massive problem. It’s not just Chile, it’s not just Ghana. It’s a global problem. We are facing this waste and it is proof that we need to rethink the fashion system.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentChileFashion industryAmericasWasteEthical and green livingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the week has worn on, this has increasingly become the mood of today’s supposedly super-fun tourist trip to Greenland by the second lady of the United States, Usha Vance, and her husband, the vice-president, JD Vance. Who, come to think of it, does actually look like the Cabbage Patch Gerard Butler.Anyway: Greenland. Like I say, the trip has evolved this week both in style and substance. Originally, it was announced that the second lady was going to take one of her sons, immerse herself in various local events – she’s apparently simply fascinated by Greenland’s culture – and attend the famous Avannaata Qimussersua dog sled race. No more. Now, it’s her husband instead of her son, and the Vances are only going to a military facility. This is a little bit like announcing you’re travelling to Kyoto to see the blossoms, then “recalibrating” your trip so that all you’ll actually be taking in is a tour of the storage facility where they keep the most boring documents from the signing of the 1997 climate protocol. Extremely important, no doubt – and extremely, extremely boring. Or as the White House has chosen to characterise this shift in emphasis: “The Second Lady is proud to visit the Pituffik Space Base with her husband to learn more about Arctic security and the great work of the Space Base.” It is unclear at time of writing if Pituffik has spa facilities. Presumably it’s got something of a year-round après-ski vibe.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Nuuk, Greenland, 28 March 2025.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, the Vance kid now has to stay at home and go to school, instead of skipping it to enjoy a taxpayer-funded trip to a country his dad and friends are openly trying to annex. Still, the good news is that Mike Waltz should still be going. Yes! The second lady was in fact always slated to go on her little tourist jaunt accompanied by the national security adviser to the US president – and there’s nothing weird about that. Personally, I never minibreak without one. And it goes without saying that the travelling party will be joined in spirit by whichever journalists/Russian assets/assorted randos that Mike has added to the groupchat “Greenland Annexation Brunch With The Girls”.Alas, it seems that the sheer obnoxiousness of the Vances’ trailed visit was the thing that fatally repulsed the locals, leaving US organisers with no choice but to commute the trip down to just one secure base visit. It’s reported that advance-party administration officialswent door to doorin Greenland trying to find a local family who would be pleased to welcome Usha and her large adult son Mike Waltz into their humble dwelling – presumably in order that they could say something like: “Wow, what a beautiful humble home you have. Be a real shame if anything happened to it …”Strangely, no such family was forthcoming. It’s almost as if people in Greenland have the internet, and are able to read or watch the constant and intensifying statements on their country’s potential annexation by the covetous US president, Donald Trump. “It’s an island … that we need,” observed Trump with chilling mildness earlier this week. “And we’re going to have to have it.” Further matter-of-fact justifications have been repeatedly forthcoming. “We need greater national security purposes [sic],”ran another. “I’ve been told that for a long time, long before I even ran [for president]. People really don’t even know that Denmark has any legal right to it, but if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security.” Spoken with all the kindly rationale of the school bully explaining you should give up your lunch money because he needs it.View image in fullscreenThe Pituffik space base that will be visited by JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance.Photograph: Thomas Traasdahl/APMeanwhile, a series of proxies are emerging to push America’s case – or, in the case of Vladimir Putin, to not argue with it in a way that is tantamount to cheerleading. “In short, America’s plans in relation to Greenland are serious,”the Russian president observedthis week. “These plans have deep historical roots. And it’s clear that the US will continue to systematically pursue its geo-strategic, military-political and economic interests in the Аrctic.” On Friday morning, Stephen Moore – a former Trump economic adviser-turned-Heritage Foundation wingnut – explained cheerfully to the BBC that the Greenlanders were “the people who would benefit the most from this … let’s call it a sale, or acquisition.” Let’s not, but go on. “They could, overnight, turn into millionaires.” This somehow reminds me of that old statistic suggesting that instead of going to an expensive war to protect them, the British government could instead have just made every Falkland Islander a millionaire to soften the unwanted blow of having been taken over by Argentina. After all, what else do people want in life, except for money?“There could be trillions of dollars’ worth of minerals and oil and gas and other types of … precious minerals that could be of value to the United States,” speculated Moore, adding, almost by way of an afterthought about the Greenlanders, that there’s “essentially a treasure chest right below their feet”. Mm. The trouble with the nakedly rapacious hawks of Trumpworld putting it that way, of course, is that it’s only a very short hop to seeing the Greenland people as the obstacle. If only they, and their feet, could just be dug through, then the treasure chest could be rightfully – or wrongfully – claimed.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionJD VanceUS foreign policyUS politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

The world’s leaders must tell the truth about what that meansJonathan FreedlandBritain’s PM has not been open with his citizens for fear of backlash from Washington, but this crisis demands honestyFri 28 Mar 2025 13.11 EDTLast modified on Fri 28 Mar 2025 15.30 EDTShareBoris Johnson is an unlikely role model for Keir Starmer. The Etonian bluffer and the stolid lawyer could hardly be more different, but there’s one thing the former prime minister got right. Five years ago this week, Johnson spoke to the country ina direct, televised addressthat conveyed the seriousness of the threat Britons faced and steeled them for the pain to come. Now Starmer needs to do the same, not because there is a pandemic on the way – but because Donald Trump is already here.That six-minute video message of Johnson’s was transformative. It signalled that we had entered a period of emergency in which almost everything we had taken for granted – including basic human liberties – would no longer apply. “Stay at home,” he said and, with few exceptions, we did. Johnson framed the sacrifice as an act of patriotism, implicitly drawing on memories of blitz-spirit solidarity: “I know that as they have in the past … the people of this country will rise to that challenge.” They did. Hence the fury when it emerged that Johnson and his circlehad not themselves made the sacrificesthat they had demanded of everyone else, a fury that drove him and eventually his party from power. But it all began with that TV address.Now imagine if Starmer seized this current moment the same way. The right time would have been straight afterTrump humiliated Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, when people could see with their own eyes a US president destroying the post-1945 order. But it’s not too late.Each day brings fresh evidence of the Trump menace, whether it’s the US findingever more insulting waysto signal that it is abandoning its allies across the Atlantic – including byrepeating its intentionto seize, in Greenland, a European territory – or wreckingworld trade through tariffsimposed apparently on a whim. Starmer could pick any evening to clear the TV schedules and describe the threat.“I want to speak to you tonight because, in the clash of dictatorship against democracy on our continent, the US has changed sides,” he might begin. He could explain that, with Washington lining up with Vladimir Putin, there must now be a change in how Britain defends itself – and in much else. He could warn that this new era will demand a great deal from us, that it will not be easy. He could close by promising that we will get through it together, much as we have before: “We are a proud, independent nation and we will stand united in the face of this new peril.”Imagine the space that would create. Having cast Trump as a clear and present danger, he would brace Britons for a new age of rearmament, one that’s surely needed if Britain is to protect itself in a world where the US behaves more like an enemy than a friend. As for paying for those weapons, Starmer would have described a new situation in which the previous rules that bound British politics no longer hold.The question no one dares ask: what if Britain has to defend itself from the US? | George MonbiotRead moreSo just as the pandemic enabled Johnson to persuade Conservatives, historically allergic to state intervention, to spendhundreds of billionsto keep the economy functioning, so Starmer could make his own case for radical action, necessitated by the whirlwind of Trump.At its most drastic, it would have seen Rachel Reeves announce in herspring statementon Wednesday that she was discarding the limit on borrowing she had imposed on herself. If that would have risked driving up interest payments on UK debt, she could have chosen a different way to pay for the guns: a wealth tax on the richest.Instead, and having failed to depict this as a moment of national emergency, she did neither, the government preferring to place the burden of increased defence spending on the most vulnerable, whether at home, viaReeves’s cuts in benefitsfor disabled people and the poorest, or abroad, with theslashing of the aid budget.But ifLabourwere to describe the Trump threat with sufficient force, persuading voters that everything has changed, new possibilities would open up, including steps that would once have been taboo. Looking into the camera, Starmer could tell the country that we voted for Brexit nearly a decade ago when the world was very different. That world has vanished. Now that the White House is seemingly bent on starting a global trade war, we need to stand with our nearest trading partners, not stand apart from them. Just as there was no room for old Thatcherite bromides about the small state when Covid struck, so there is no room for Faragist fears about the single market now.Of course, I understand why Starmer hasn’t done it. I know why he won’t go on television and say we face an orange hurricane from the west. It’s the same reason that UK ministers, even when confronted with the Signalgate transcripts that confirm that the most senior figures in the US administration regard America’s allies in Europeas “pathetic” freeloaders, repeat pieties about the “special relationship” as if nothing has changed. The UK’s military and intelligence capability is sobound up with that of the USthat even the idea of divergence from Washington makes their heads hurt.But Trump’s behaviour leaves little doubt: decoupling will have to happen eventually. Better to begin the process now, aiming for a future in which both we and our European neighbours acquire more hard power and our deepest cooperation is with them, the Nato partners who remain true to the alliance.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer meets with Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House, Washington DC, on 27 February 2025.Photograph: Carl Court/ReutersFor now, the UK’s leaders are, naturally, scared. They fear the wrath of Trump that would descend if the slightest squeak of criticism were to be heard from London. Starmer’s preferred strategy has been to tell the playground bully that we’re not like the other kids and that we should be spared his blows.But at some point, we need to get the message. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy and pal, did his best to say it loud and clear this week when he dismissed Starmer’s plan for an international “reassurance” force to support a ceasefire in Ukraine as “a posture and a pose”, calling it the “simplistic” result of the PM and others thinking “we have all got to be like Winston Churchill”. In that same interview, Witkoff said how much he “liked” Putin, whom he praised as “gracious”, “super-smart” and “straight up”, before revealing that the Russian leader had commissioned a portrait of the US president as a gift.The penny should be dropping by now. When it comes to Trump, Starmer should follow the immortal advice given to Miranda in Sex and the City, accept that “he’s just not that into you”and act accordingly.Yes, it will be fraught with risk to acknowledge that out loud and to act on it. But it will yield benefits, too. For one thing, asMark Carney is demonstratingin Canada, there is a powerful national solidarity, a defiant patriotism, to be harnessed in standing up to Trump. But, more importantly, it will be freeing, allowing Starmer and his government to describe a reality that everyone can see and do so truthfully. It could also open up political territory long closed off to Labour, whether on taxation or Britain’s relationship with Europe. But first, Starmer must look us all in the eye – and describe the new menace that is rapidly reshaping our world.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist100 days of Trump’s presidency, withJonathan Freedland and guests.On 30 April, join Jonathan Freedland, Kim Darroch, Devika Bhat and Leslie Vinjamuri as they discuss Trump’s presidency on his 100th day in office, live at Conway Hall, London, and live streamed globally.

I am weak-willed, however, and click through to thestory in the Timesto test the principle of “my enemy’s enemy is my friend”. Musk is a real villain and Clarkson is just a motormouth, but I suspect the latter – for reasons of basic functionality and the sort of flippant humour with which Musk seems ill-equipped to cope – is capable of getting the better of the world’s richest man, should these latest remarks of Clarkson’s come to his attention.Certainly, Clarkson has upset Musk before, exciting a libel action out of him in 2011 for comments Clarkson made about Tesla on Top Gear. A judge ruled against Musk then, a fact Clarkson is only too happy to remind him about now. In his Sunday Times column, Clarkson referred to the “pan-global decision to uncrowdfund Tesla”, and took a victory lap around news of Teslas being set on fire and vandalised the world over. “I’d love to remind all you Tesla drivers that I warned you 17 years ago that no good would come of your buying choice,” he wrote in his customary low-key style. “But you didn’t listen.”Musk, as we know, is apoplectic about the hatred being directed towards Tesla right now, as is Donald Trump. Defending his buddy last week, the US president threatened, nonsensically, to send any “sick terrorist thugs” caught vandalising Teslas to “the prisons of El Salvador”. Clarkson, meanwhile, strove to point out that Musk, once popular on the left for promoting green vehicles, is now targeted by exactly the kind of people Clarkson hates, forcing him to a conclusion I fully support: that my enemy’s enemy is still kind of a jerk. There’s quite enough dislike to go round.View image in fullscreen‘Can we somehow sell the spring statement as “cheeky”?’Photograph: Malcolm Park/Alamy Live NewsTuesdayIt’s a hard video to watch: two RAF engineers caught on CCTV kicking poor old Paddington while he sits blamelessly on a bench in Berkshire. The violence escalates to such a degree that by the end of the assault, there’s nothing of the bear statue left but a hollow, metal shell. I guess at least it speaks to the fitness of the British armed forces.The incident happened at 2am on a drunken night out this month, and on Tuesday the pair wereordered by a judge to pay £2,725 and do community service. It was the judge’s emotional remarks about the target of their vandalism, however, that made one realise not all criminal damage is equal. The two men had, according to Judge Goozee, attacked “a beloved cultural icon”, that represents “kindness, tolerance and promotes integration and acceptance in our society”. On the night in question, he said, they had behaved in a way that was “the antithesis of everything Paddington stands for”.Which rather makes one hope that the next time someone in those parts rips the wing mirror off a Tesla or otherwise puts the boot into “everything it stands for”, they find themselves appearing before this same, symbolism-minded judge.WednesdayThe discourse around the Netflix showAdolescencecontinues to rage and after receiving blanket praise for two weeks, some dissent is starting to show. All the usual caveats first: extraordinary television, brilliant performances, breathtaking vision. Adolescence is smartly and interestingly done, although it remains the case that if every girl who was called an ugly bitch online killed the boy or man who said it, there’d be no men left to make the TV show.The presence of Brad Pitt as an executive producer, meanwhile, rings slight alarm bells. I’m not sure any of us needs the origins of misogyny explained, even tangentially, by a man whose kids havedroppedhis surname and whose ex-wife hasallegedthat he abused her. Pitt does, however, belong to what he has called a “really cool men’s group”, so I’m guessing that his “remarkably hands-on” involvement with the show might have brought to the project valuable insights into the self-victimising process.ThursdayOn the Americans in London social media feeds, people are sharing tips for getting in and out of the US without being cuffed and dragged to a detention centre in Louisiana. “If you plan to go, get a burner phone,” writes one frequent traveller which, blimey, I mean, I guess. Lots of people have popped up to report flying recently through Newark or Miami without incident, but the anxiety is enough to have changed the experience. Flight bookings between Canada and the US are down 70% and US tourist operators are braced for a worldwide downturn.We’re flying to the US in May and, even as citizens, I’m nervous. Six years ago, while still on a green card, I got the “step this way” nod at JFK and was escorted to the exceedingly grim Congratulations, You Have Problems With Your Paperwork side room, where a woman relieved me of my phone and shouted at me and everyone else in the room to sit down and be quiet. For travellers to the US it seems a sensible precaution to have a lawyer’s number at the ready.View image in fullscreen‘Tell me again how you’d rather have a president than this comfy old scene.’Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty ImagesFridayI haven’t had to sleep with the hall light on since the Blair Witch Project came out in 1999 – oh man, that was a bad one because my flatmate was away that weekend and after seeing the film, I felt the dank presence of something watching me from the corner of my room. This week a babysitter in Kansas tried to vanquish a child’s fear of monsters under the bed by showing them there was nothing there. Unfortunately, in this case a 27-year old man called Martin Villalobos Jr was hiding under the bed. After a scuffle that knocked over the child, he wasarrested and charged with aggravated batteryand child endangerment. A mere externalisation of what, at the moment, we know to be true: the monsters are real.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDigested weekJeremy ClarksonBrad PittNetflixAdolescencecommentShareReuse this content"

I was a pretty traumatised, messed-up kid. I had a lot of anger, mostly towards the people closest to me, but because I couldn’t do anything about that I just went around with a lot of rage that I had no way of getting rid of.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian Design/Speed Media/Shutterstock/Getty ImagesA family member had a hatred of ‘“Asians’” because of the second world war. My grandfather also hated “Asians”, and said things like “make sure you lock your doors” and “you can’t trust them”. This was when the Australian senator and One Nation leader,Pauline Hanson, was out there saying a lot of “anti-Asian” stuff.Around that time I had a medical problem and the medication I was put on gave me a lot of anger. With all this mixed together, I thought: “It must be the Asians that are causing the problems.” Suddenly I wasn’t this quiet kid any more. I started to pick fights with anyone who looked at me wrong.I was a loner and started finding other people who were loners too, and we started to form little groups. They were mostly nerdy guys or people with traumatic backgrounds like me who wanted to get their anger out.There was a lot of sexual abuse and domestic abuse survivors in the group. I remember one of the guys saying he had been raped by his dad, who fed him drugs every night to make him forget it. We were a bunch of guys with nowhere to go and no way of getting the support we needed. We found a common enemy to release our anger towards – at a time when there was a lot of racism in the community directed at “Asian gangs”. It got worse and worse, until eventually, when I was 15, guys in the group were talking about doing a full-on attack.Looking back now, I can see how it happened. But at the time we were just so filled with rage that “these people” were coming into our town, and we were being told by the community that “they’re the problem”, so they became the target of our anger. Within about six months it went from mirroring things that were being said in the community to “we should get weapons and start killing people”.It was only when I reconnected with an old friend from primary school that I realised I wanted to get out of the group. He took me to places in the city that I had never been to. I started seeing different cultures for the first time – it really took me out of that white bubble.I tried to get the other guys to drop the hatred, tried getting them into jobs and getting them away from hanging out with the group and involved in different activities. They had never been to the city. A year or so later, it eventually dissolved.Fifteen years later, after leaving the military, I heard the Australian MPAnne Alyon the radio. At the time she was a counterterrorism expert at a university and she was doing a call-out for people who had backgrounds in extremism so they could try to understand Islamic State. I called her up, and she said: “When can you come to Perth?” I flew there on Monday. After that, the New South Wales police gave me my first case.At that time, there was no disengagement programme in Australia. No one understood how to do it. Anne said: “Why don’t you set one up?” I said, yeah, I’ll jump in. And so Exit Australia came into being. The main thing I have learned from my own experience is to ask what directed this person towards anger in the first place? And then work on that.Terror time bomb: the race to defuse Australia’s far-right threatRead moreMost people drop the ideology pretty quickly once they get the support they need. They belong to these groups because they’re getting something from them. You have to become the surrogate of that support so they don’t need the group any more. One of my biggest “success stories” was a guy who was planning a mass murder, who I helped access the services he needed. There have been people who were hellbent on conspiracy theories, wanting to do things like attack the government. I have helped them reconnect with their families and they have changed their minds. I have seen people with Nazi tattoos in jail start getting the support they need, and then when I say, “Why don’t we get rid of these tattoos?”, they say “sure”.My biggest concern today is that younger people are getting involved in these groups. They are oblivious to the ways in which predators can condition and recruit them online. I’ve even had kids come up to me after a talk and say: “I now realise I’m being recruited.” A lot of the groups now are using masculinity and being “gym fit” as a way to get kids to join up. It’s always us v them with some new twist. For me, it was the “Asians” who were against us; pre-Covid, it was the “Muslims” trying to take over; during Covid, it was the “elites” controlling the government; and now it’s the “elites” and “multiculturalism” trying to “eradicate” whites.The lesson I would give people trying to disengage others is to build a rapport with them and identify the underlying cause of their anger. It’s also important to remember that not everyone has the same tools of resilience to help themselves. The worst thing you can do is to fight back against the ideology and all the terrible things a person has said. Try to find the underlying problems – and build support around that.Matthew Quinn is the founder and CEO of Exit Australia, which looks at disengaging violent extremists.

On Tuesday evening, Rumeysa Ozturk exited her apartment building and walked on to the street in Somerville,Massachusetts– a city outside Boston – into the fading daylight. Ozturk, a Turkish-born PhD student at Tufts University who studies children’s media and childhood development, was on her way to an iftar dinner with friends, planning to break her Ramadan fast.In a videotaken from a surveillance camera, she wears a pink hijab and a long white puffer coat against the New England cold. The first man, not uniformed but wearing plain clothes, as all the agents are, approaches her as if asking for directions. But he quickly closes in and grabs her by the wrists she has raised defensively toward her face.She screams as another man appears behind her, pulling a badge out from under his shirt and snatching away her phone. Soon six people are around her in a tight circle; she has no way to escape. They handcuff her and hustle her into an unmarked van. Attorneys for Ozturk did not know where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the US homeland security department that has become Trump’s anti-immigrant secret police, had taken the 30-year-old woman for almost 24 hours.The spirit of the Confederacy is alive and well in Trump’s America | Lloyd GreenRead moreIn that time, a judge ordered Ice to keep Ozturk, who is on an F-1 academic visa, in Massachusetts. But eventually, her lawyers learned that their client had been moved, as many Ice hostages are,to a detention camp in southern Louisiana, more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) from where she was abducted.In the video, before she is forced into the van, Ozturk looks terrified, confused. She may well have thought she was being robbed by street thugs; she did not seem to understand, at first, that she was being kidnapped by the state. She tries to plead with her attackers. “Can I just call the cops?”she asks. “We are the police,” one of the men responds. Ozturk remains imprisoned; she has been charged with no crime. In the video of her arrest, a neighborcan be heard nearby, asking: “Is this a kidnapping?”The answer is yes. Ozturk is one of a growing number university students who have been targeted, issued arrest warrants, or summarily kidnapped off the streets by Ice agents. She joins the ranks of includeMahmoud Khalil, the Syrian-born Palestinian former graduate student and green card holder from Columbia University;Alireza Doroudi, an Iranian-born mechanical engineering doctoral student at the University of Alabama;Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Columbia undergraduate who was born in South Korea but has long been a green card holder after immigrating to the United States with her parents at the age of seven; andMomodou Taal, a dual British and Gambian citizen who is studying for a graduate degree at Cornell University and has gone into hiding after receiving a summons from Ice to turn himself in for deportation proceedings.Many of these students had some connection – however tenuous – toanti-genocide protests on campusesover the past year and a half. Taal and Khalil, in different capacities, were leaders of protests for Palestinian rights at their respective universities. Chung attended one or two demonstrations at Columbia. Ozturk co-authored an op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper that cited credible allegations that Israel was violating international human rights law in Gaza and called on the university president to take a stronger stance against the genocide. In a statement regarding her arrest, a DHS spokespersonsaid: “Investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas.” They meant the op-ed.The state department claims that some of these students have had their visas or permanent resident status rescinded – in a video of the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, taken by his pregnant wife, agents proclaim that his student visa has been revoked, but when they are informed that he has a green card, they say: “We’re revoking that too.” This unilateral revocation of green card protections, without notice or due process, is illegal. But that is not the point – theTrump administrationclearly thinks of immigrants as a population with no rights that they need respect.Rather, the point is that Trump administration’s promise tocrack down on student protestsagainst Israel’s genocide in Gaza has the effect of articulating a new speech code for immigrants: no one who is not a United States citizen is entitled to the first amendment right to say that Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza, or that the lives of Palestinians are not disposable by virtue of their race.It is up to those us who do have citizenship to speak the truth that the Trump administration is willing to kidnap people for saying: genocide is wrong, Israel is committing it against Palestinians in Gaza, and Palestinians, like all people, deserve not only the food and medicine that Israel iswithholding from them, and not only an end to Israel’s relentless and largely indiscriminate bombing, but they deserve freedom, dignity and self-determination. This has become an unspeakable truth in Trump’s America. Soon, there will be other things we are not allowed to say, either. We owe it to one another to speak these urgent truths plainly, loudly and often – while we still can.Donald Trump is moving fast and breaking things, but that may result in a better US | Simon JenkinsRead moreHere is another truth: that the US’s treatment of these immigrants should shame us. It was once a cliche to say that the US was a nation of immigrants, that they represented the best of our country. It is not a cliche anymore. For most of my life as an American, it has been a singular source of pride and gratitude that mine was a country that so many people wanted to come to – that people traveled from all over the world to pursue their talent, their ambition and their hopefulness here, and that this was the place that nurtured and rewarded them.It may sound vulgar to speak of this lost pride after Ozturk’s kidnapping – all that sentimentality did nothing, after all, to protect her, and may in the end have always been self-serving and false. But as we grapple with what America is becoming – or revealing itself to be – underDonald Trump, I think we can mourn not only the lost delusions of the past but the lost potential of the future.Ozturk – a student of early childhood education, and someone brave enough to take a great personal risk in standing up for what she thought was right – seems like a person the US would be lucky to have. Instead we are punishing her, terrorizing her, kidnapping her and throwing her away. She deserves better, and so do all of our immigrants – hopeful, struggling people who mistook this for a place where they could thrive. Who, in the future, will continue to think of the US as a place where immigrants can make a difference, can prosper? Who will share their gifts with us now?Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS immigrationIsrael-Gaza warProtestUS universitiesGazaDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

It begins when a centrist party crushes hope in democracy. When Keir Starmer’s governmenttakes a chainsawto people’s aspirations for a fairer, greener, kinder country, he cuts off not just faith in the Labour party butfaith in politics itself. The almost inevitable result, as countries from the US to the Netherlands, Argentina to Austria, Italy to Sweden show, is to let the far right in.So what’s the game? Why adopt policies that could scarcely be better calculated to prevent your re-election? Why stick tooutdated fiscal ruleswhen projections suggest they’llmake almost everyone worse off, especially those in poverty? Why impose devastating attacks on wellbeing, such assustaining the two-child benefit cap,freezing local housing allowanceandcutting disability benefits?Why pursue austerity when the country voted so decisively to end it?

Or thosesuggested by political economist Richard Murphy, worth £90bn in tax revenue? Why abandon plans totax non-doms properly? Why not demand an end to the Bank of England’sdestructive quantitative tightening?Why bury policies that might help restore democracy, such as proportional representation? Why introducenew political funding ruleswithout actually addressing the capture of politics by the rich?It’s straight from the Trump playbook: Labour is tearing up the machinery of government | George MonbiotRead moreWhy adoptReform’s messages, Reform’s branding andReform’s cruelty, to compete over who can most brutally beat up asylum seekers? Anabundance of evidenceshows that when centre-left parties take radical-right positions, theylose more voters on the leftthan they gain on the right. Adopting far-right messaginghelps far-right parties win.These policies might seem incomprehensible. But there’s a thread running through them. They allarise from the same doctrine: neoliberalism. This ideology, which has dominated the UK since 1979, demands austerity, the privatisation and shrinkage of public services, curtailment of protest and trade unions, deregulation and tax reductions for the rich. Justified as a means of creating an enterprise society, it has instead delivereda new age of rent, as powerful people monopolise crucial assets, from water to housing to social media. It leaves a government with few options but to scapegoat asylum seekers and other vulnerable groups for the problems it fails to address.Neoliberalism has become an orthodoxy from which parties depart at their peril, exposing themselves to fierce attacks by the media and the Tufton Street junktanksit endlessly platforms. But how did it become so hegemonic that it has turned Labour almost into the opposite of what it once was? It’s hard to understand until you grasp that the purpose of neoliberalism is to break down resistance to capital. This in turn requires a better understanding of capitalism.Capitalism is constantly confused with commerce. While the two systems are often entangled, capitalism can exist without commerce and commerce without capitalism. Commerce goes back thousands of years. Capitalism is adistinct economic systemthat arose roughly 600 years ago, founded on colonial looting. It operates on a dynamic, constantly evolving frontier, pushing ever further into our lives, on which both state and powerful private interests use their laws, backed by the threat of violence, to turn shared resources into exclusive property, transforming natural wealth, labour and money into commodities that can be accumulated. You can see what it looks like, when released from democratic constraint, in Donald Trump’s America.For 150 years, capitalism has sought to undermine or crush its direct antagonist: democracy. It found a highly successful means in fascism, which was bankrolled in the early 20thcentury by some of the richest people and corporations in Europe and Japan. But in 1945, that solution ran into certain minor difficulties.Just in time, an alternative arrived. Neoliberalism was first formalised in two books published in 1944, The Road to Serfdom by Friedrich Hayek and Bureaucracy by Ludwig von Mises. Both authors opposed fascism, but their ideas were just as useful to capital.By 1947, some of the richest people on Earth were pouring money into it. They soon built an international network of “thinktanks”, academic departments, tame government advisers, editors and journalists. They refined and amplified the messaging until it began to sound like common sense, hammered home so often that Margaret Thatcher was able to proclaim “there is no alternative”.Neoliberalism is highly effective at destroying democratic hope. As hope evaporates, the far right sweeps into the political void, enabling capital to invest once more in its earlier solution. Neoliberalism, in other words, paves the road to fascism and serfdom.As the damage to human wellbeing and the living world mounts, parties once on the left, such as UKLabour, the US Democrats and Australian Labor, urgently need to recover their courage. I feel there’s great potential in building a new “politics of belonging”, in which political power and control of local resources are returned to communities.A large part of politics can be understood as a search for belonging, a fundamental human need. Even fascists seek community and belonging, albeit a version where everyone looks the same, wears the same uniform and chants the same slogans. Steering people away from fascism requires an answer to this need, an answer that can be found in vibrant inclusive neighbourhoods,strengthened by participatory democracyand community ownership of key local assets. A wealth of experience from other nations and other ages shows that disempowerment sets us apart, while shared, equal decision-makingbrings us together.I hate to give up on this government, so soon after it has taken office, but defending people from injustice and destitution, keeping out the far right, reviving communities and renewing democracy requires a mindset that seems a thousand miles away. Where we look for resistance and vision, we find a craven appeasement of capital. Labour promised change. Now it must change or die.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistThe Invisible Doctrine: The Secret History of Neoliberalism, by George Monbiot and Peter Hutchison, is published in paperback this weekExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionFar rightEconomic policyKeir StarmerTax and spendingBenefitscommentShareReuse this content"

There are short-term electoral gains to be won, but risks in the long termFri 28 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 28 Mar 2025 09.12 EDTShareFor more than eight months now, since shortly after Labour won power, more and more people have been outraged by the government’s moves to the right. Starting with its decision to keep the Conservatives’ crueltwo-child benefit caplast July, the government has regularly given these critics reasons to feel shocked, betrayed or just disappointed.Fromdeportation videostoKeir Starmer’s declarationthat “I like and respect” Donald Trump, from repeated public sector cuts to the chancellor Rachel Reeves’s talk of “tearing downregulatory barriers” in this week’s spring statement, Labour has often behaved as if the boundaries between its supposedly centre-left politics and the politics of the right or even the far right have simply melted away.Even for the millions who have faithfully votedLabourfor decades, despite all the party’s flaws, compromises and defeats, Starmer’s premiership is turning out to be extremely, perhaps uniquely, difficult to believe in. The scale of his majority threatens to be matched by the scale of disillusionment.But are left-leaning Britons right to be so thoroughly disenchanted? Is this Labour government really that different from previous ones? And if so, exactly what kind of government is it?The last question is quite difficult to answer. In part, this is because the government has been so poor at explaining its overall purpose, despite many different attempts to do so, such as the spring statement’s promise of “an active government” that is “leaner and more agile”. Compared with the last time the party was in power, when New Labour consistently and effectively promoted its plan to modernise Britain, Starmer’s administration both explains itself too much and not enough.Why Downing Street has not hired or promoted better communicators by now is a mystery as baffling as what Starmer actually believes in. In 2020, according to Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund’s book on his leadership,Get In, Starmer told colleagues: “I don’t have any ideology at all. There’s no such thing as Starmerism and there never will be. I will make decisions one after the other.” Elected to parliament relatively late in life, and by his own admission more of a problem-solver than an original thinker or compelling speaker, Starmer is an incomplete politician, governing in an era of constant crises and public alienation, when even a more multi-dimensional prime minister would struggle.View image in fullscreenHarold Wilson in 1966.Photograph: Douglas Miller/Getty ImagesYet the hard-to-define quality of his government is also down to something else. Confusingly mixed in with all its rightwing policies are still a scattering of leftwing and green ones: improvingworkers’ rights, imposingVAT on private schools,nationalising railcompanies,removing the inheritance tax loopholefor farmers andpromoting clean energymore seriously than any previous British government. Most of these measures are on a smaller scale than their equivalents proposalsunder Jeremy Corbyn. But they remain more egalitarian, class-conscious and restrictive of capitalism than the policies of Tony Blair or Gordon Brown.In the latest issue of the centre-left journal Renewal, the historian Nick Garland, who wrote speeches for Reeves when she was shadow chancellor, sums up the Starmer government as “plain old Labour” – by which he means it is part of the pre-Blair tradition of Labour governments consciously building on each other, to make concrete, cumulative improvements to many lives.Garland’s argument is convincing, up to a point. While Starmer resists comparing himself to past prime ministers, as part of his effort to elude political definition, he does occasionally express admiration forHarold Wilson, the often derided but effective Labour social reformer of the 1960s and 1970s. And like postwar Labour politicians, Garland continues, the current cabinet “believes in the capacity of the state … partnered with the more dynamic elements of the private sector, to reverse economic decline and remedy Britain’s social ills”. Under Starmer, he concludes, Labour is getting back to what it does best: overseeing unspectacular but unifying national change.Rachel Reeves swears this is not a return to austerity. What matters is that it feels like one | Gaby HinsliffRead moreYet one problem with this interpretation is that it largely ignores Starmerism’s nasty side. His party’s relentlesspurges of leftwingersand contrasting reverence for reactionary voters are starkly different from Labour under Wilson, who treated the party as a broad church and promoted social liberalism.Another huge difference is in how the current government deals with financial pressures. Previous Labour premiers faced them, too, and sometimes imposed austerity policies, but the pain was spread much more evenly between the privileged and the disadvantaged. Under Wilson, there was briefly a combined income and investment tax rate of 98% for the highest earners. By contrast, Reeves and Starmer seem to have accepted the self-serving argument from big business and its many media champions that increasing taxes on the rich is both impractical and undesirable – even though many voters and many analysts of the long boom in elite wealth, such as Thomas Piketty, strongly disagree.So, rather than a revival of postwar social democracy, Starmer’s government feels more like an attempt to create a new political hybrid: part leftwing, part rightwing, intended to appeal to a much more fragmented, politically fickle, less generous country. This toughened-up Labour party prioritises “working people” over the poor, the arms industry and the City of London over the wider economy, and traditional patriotism over more nuanced expressions of British identity. Rather than confront rightwing populism, the government tries to co-opt some of its arguments, for example about the danger of “open borders”. More and more of Labour’s current policies seem designed to appeal to actual or potential Reform voters.Will this new political model work? Recent attempts by the centre-left to toughen up have failed in other countries, such as Germany and the US. So far, the signs are not promising for Labour, either, judging by the polls and its performance in government. Starmer’s confident periods as opposition leader, when he promised stable government, no scandals, an end to “sticking-plaster politics” and a politics that “treads more lightly on people’s lives”, seem a long time ago.These are still early days. By the next election, which may not be for four years, his austere, ambiguous government might have done just enough through its more patient policies to beat a divided opposition. Victory over the toxic politics of Reform and the current Tories would still be worth celebrating. But its price might be a Labour party that longterm supporters hardly recognise. And without them, it will become harder and harder to win again.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerRachel ReevesTax and spendingcommentShareReuse this content"

At least 144 people are reported to have been killed – a death toll that is certain to rise – while a state of emergency was declared in the Thai capital, Bangkok. There, eight people are confirmed to have died while dozens of construction workers are feared trapped after the high-risebuilding that they were working on collapsed. Further aftershocks are expected and will make the work of rescuers and those delivering humanitarian assistance in both countries harder.The earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.7, is the most severe to hit the region since 1956, which means buildings areunlikely to have been designedwith this threat in mind. The disaster could not have come at a worse time for Myanmar’s people, with more than 18 million already either displaced or facing hunger, according to theUN.In Rakhine state, 2 million people are at risk from famine, with the junta accused of inflicting “collective punishment” on them. An estimated 6.7 million children live in earthquake-affected areas, including the country’s second-biggest city, Mandalay, which is 17km from the epicentre. As this was a Friday, during Ramadan, many people are thought to have been crushed as busy mosques fell down.Four years after themilitary seized controlin a coup, fighting between the army and rebel groups, many of which support a parallel national unity government formed from remnants of the deposed National League for Democracy, make the election promised by the junta an alarming prospect. Last year an investigation by the BBC estimated that resistance groups, known as the People’s Defence Force, were in charge of 42% of the country’s landmass, with just 21% under the junta’s control. Elections held in such circumstances, partly at the urging of China, will not relieve the population’s hardships and there are fears of an intensification of the country’s civil war.The earthquake is another huge setback, just six months after many villages were destroyed and at least 226 people were killed in floods and mudslides caused byTyphoon Yagi. Now, as then, Myanmar’s isolated military rulers have requested international help. With Amnesty and others warning of the impact of US aid cuts on relief efforts, the EU and other countries must do all they can do ensure that life-saving food and medical supplies are delivered, along with the secure access being demanded by human rights organisations.An assurance from Zin Mar Aung, the top diplomat of the national unity rebels, that the People’s Defence Force will provide aid in the areas it governs was welcome. But efforts to coordinate support and channel resources will be fraught with difficulty. CentralMyanmar, including Mandalay, is run by the junta, meaning international aid efforts can be delivered there with its cooperation.To find out what is going on elsewhere, and get aid to less accessible areas, the UN and international donors will have to work with the local administrations that govern them. The junta cannot be allowed to control the flow of aid. By doing so, it could use the disaster to intensify its hold on power and the suffering of its opponents among the people of Myanmar.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Boulez’s career is being celebrated on Sunday with an entire day devoted to him on BBC Radio 3. Boulez Day will culminate in a live concert from the Barbican that includes one of his most ambitious works,Pli selon Pli. It is an unashamedly anti-populist piece of programming: only Radio 3, which is used to having a niche audience, could devote a whole day to so “difficult” a composer as Boulez.Radio 3 is treating Boulez Day as a taster for a new 40-part series, starting on 6 April, called 20th Century Radicals, which showcases a range of composers from the relatively well known – Berio, Birtwistle, Kurtág, Messiaen, Stockhausen – to more obscure musical pioneers such asMauricio Kagel,Alvin LucierandÉliane Radigue. It is a bold attempt to make sense of serialism, atonality and the postwar musical experimentation that alienated many listeners.It may be that “total immersion” – the phrase Radio 3 applies to its Boulez offerings on Sunday – is the only valid way to approach new music. The way not to do it is the one chosen by many concert promoters: sandwich a 20-minute new work in between Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto and Sibelius’s Fifth Symphony. Audiences generally won’t listen to it and might even resent its presence in a concert of familiar classics. There has to be context, explanation, self-belief. All music was new once.After the second world war, “classical” music – an outmoded term; art music might be better – bifurcated into works accepted by the public (the canon, headed by Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert) and those which at best existed on the margins. First Viennese School and tonality good; Second Viennese School and atonality bad. Who do you really want to listen to – Schubert or Schoenberg? While Boulez did important work in bringing composers such as Bartók into the canon, his contribution to that bifurcation was unhelpful. As the New Yorker’s music critic, Alex Ross,notedwhen Boulez died, he had been at times – especially in his fiery youth – a divisive figure, so eager to celebrate the music of the present that he condemned everything that had gone before. Musicians had to be either for or against the cult of the new; if they couldn’t grasp atonality, Boulez argued, they weren’t true musicians.Such attitudes damaged new art music and indeed jazz, and both were marginalised in the pop explosion of the 1960s. Only in the past couple of decades, with the fragmentation of pop and the acceptance that a multiplicity of musical styles can fruitfully coexist, has the dogmatism subsided. We are now encouraged to appreciate Schubert and Schoenberg; Beethoven’s late string quartets are eternally new music; Max Richter can “recompose” Vivaldi’s Four Seasons to brilliant effect.Music is a continuum, one age building upon or reacting against what went before. There are turning points – nothing is quite the same after 1914 or 1945 – but there is no year zero. New music deserves an attentive hearing, or “classical” music will live up to its offputting name and exist only as a beautiful museum.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Parents are even less prepared, struggling to know who and what their children are interacting with online. The answer is to better support teachers, parents and young people with stronger online safety education in schools. Education on how to engage with communities safely online should be made mandatory as part of personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE), just as sex and relationships education is. It makes no sense that schools employ a scattergun approach, where some children will leave with little to no online safety education at all.It also requires investment in the subject from the government. Online safety education materials and guidance are often out of date, given how rapidly the internet is evolving. These should be reviewed annually, and co-produced by experts. This education must also be extended to primary schools; with 44% of nine-year-olds having smartphones, they must be educated before they receive them, not two years later.This must be delivered alongside full implementation of the Online Safety Act. It gives the government and Ofcom powers to make the internet safer, but, over a year after it becoming law, we’re still to see much of that become reality. As Adolescence shows, the impact of these toxic online spaces on the mental health of young people can be drastic. We owe them a duty to address this.Mark RowlandMental Health FoundationHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, she fails to recognise that in the UK, unlike inNorway, there are huge disparities across communities that will impact people’s ability and willingness to do the kinds of activitiesdugnadsåndinvolves (as well as the scale of community intervention needed).Asking people who are already well off, and live in more privileged areas, to “come together in the context of community projects” is one thing. Asking this of people who are facing the kinds of pressures that many are facing in the UK, is quite another.Dugnadsånd,moreover, is ad hoc and sporadic. There is little litter to pick in Norway’s parks, no neighbours forgotten by state agencies in urgent need of help – this allows people to engage in these activities because “it is a nice thing to do”, but not because if they did not, no one else would.Dugnadsåndis about remembering that some of the work that is involved in sustaining communities (such as litter-picking or mowing large communal lawns) is hard; this helps build appreciation for those who do these activities on a daily basis, fostering the Norwegian ideal whereby “everyone is equally important”. Notably,dugnadsåndis not about the pursuit of an individually felt “good feeling”; it is about doing something for the common good, about having a sense of common duty and shared responsibility.Francesca Vaghi and Julia HvitlockBergen, NorwayEmma Beddington invokes the spirit ofdugnadsånd,and cites recent examples of community activity. Though there is no exact equivalent ofdugnadsåndin English, the idea is embodied in the idea of “commoning” – a part of the 1217 Charter of the Forest, which Guy Standing, inThe Politics of Time(2023), calls more radical in its implications than either the Communist Manifesto of 1848 or the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948.The “forest” in question was common land taken by the crown for use as royal hunting grounds. The charter reasserted the freedom of people to draw on the resources of the common good for the benefit of the community – a word he traces to the Greekkoinoneo(“to share”). Any such work of sharing, from food banks to dementia support groups to U3A classes is “commoning”. David Cameron may have coined the phrase “big society” but it was a Tory government thatrepealed the centuries-old charterin 1971. Beddington is quite right that it is high time for us to flex our common collective muscles.Austen LynchGarstang, LancashireEmma Beddington says “over to you, Norway” when discussingdugnadsåndand its definition as a “collective willingness of people to come together in the context of community projects – emphasising cooperation and selflessness”. We already have that here in practical terms in the shape of the co-operative movement and politically the Co-operative party. Maybe their time has truly come?Andrew KyleEaling, LondonIt’s a funny old thing when you offer to listen to children read at the local primary school, to be told after a month that nothing has been actioned and it will probably be after Easter, even though I have been told there is a definite need now. Then 30 minutes later I read Emma Beddington suggestingdugnadsånd.

This is a voice that says: I am here to command. But I am also just a conduit for a divinity that flows through me and into you. Although mainly, and let’s be absolutely clear, through me.Evanilson: ‘I left 40C in Rio to go to -5 … I couldn’t finish the training session’Read moreThis is the voice of fully realised corporate schmaltz. The voice of a seven-star rooftop infinity pool filled with mountain water, new-car-smell and human deceit, that has somehow learned to say words like hope, joy, unity, Jude Bellingham, a billion dollars. It is of course the voice ofGianni Infantinoin public‑speaking mode, a man addressing you from the bridge of his private asteroid made of hope.You do have to admire Infantino at moments such as this, if only for the way he has become an instantly recognisable human brand, always the same sounds, same look, iconic blue suit and tennis shoes, eyes that seem alarmingly flat and painted on, a standard-issue bald Swiss man transformed into a living corporate logo. Celebrity is a mask that eats into the face. Have a look at what football can do.It has been a huge week for Infantino, with thelaunch of Fifa’s final marketing drivefor the Club World Cup. We are now into the period of hard sell, with fewer than 80 days to go this weekend to the opening game, Inter Miami v Al-Ahly at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.This month has already brought a soft launch with the unveiling of the trophy, a sinister and horrible golden plate that, at the turning of a key, can be transformed into a sinister and horrible golden sphere, and that is still there on Donald Trump’s desk,still spectating idly on history. And now we have this, Infantino fronting up on Fifa’s broadcast channel, offering some detail on prize money, and also an idea of the kind of ideas and phrases around which this thing will be pegged out.He talked about “a new benchmark for football”. He talked about access and equity, a genuinely creative piece of double-think given this is the most elitist club competition ever devised. This will be the playbook. Universal opportunity and the ever-giving hand of love. Who knows, if you say it enough times it might even somehow be true.View image in fullscreenGianni Infantino, in the Oval Office at the White House, has made great play of his and Fifa’s relationship with Donald Trump.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesMainly Infantino talked money. Understandably, because this is the one big wow factor element here, not least in the US, where there remains a celebratory reverence for money, where people will stand up at fancy charity dinners and applaud you simply for being rich. The headline figure is a jaw‑dropper. Infantino loves saying it. One billion dollars! It is a genuinely transformative bounty. But that massive money is also a massive problem, one that speaks to the central faultline beneath all of this.Gianni’s billion will be parcelled out among the 32 teams. Most of it will go to Europe, because Europe has 12 clubs taking part who are likely to dominate. So the richest continent will get richer. And within that the CWC will create a separate layer of inequity because the sums involved are just too big, too distorting of domestic leagues, in some cases equal to an entire season’s broadcast revenue.The winners will take almost £100m. Chelsea, to offer a non-random example, could pocket £40m for getting out of the group stage, in the process undermining the carefully laid details of domestic financial rules. This isFifadigging its fingernails right into the club game, careless of the consequences, dangling bundles of cash in front of the ownership class as an act of gaudy self-promotion.What is its mandate for this? Fifa is supposed to be a trustee. Its mission is to oversee, promote and regulate. And yet here it is acting as an investor-disrupter and general sop to the powerful. Fifa knows this is a problem, judging by the announcement of “a target of an additional $250m as solidarity for non-participating clubs”. But how will this work? Why is it only a target? What difference can it actually make in the face of this invite-only summer trough-fest?It is just as interesting to ask where the money actually comes from. There is a simple cause and effect here. Keep your eye on the $1bn. I am going to place it under this cup. Now follow the cup. Late last year it emerged Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund planned to buy a $1bn stake in the broadcaster Dazn, which has now come to pass. Shortly afterwards Dazn paid Fifa $1bn (keep your eye on the cup) for the rights to the CWC. Fifa will now pay $1bn to its participating clubs.As a subplot, a side issue, some of those taking part may well be owned by funds that also have Saudi investment. In theory it could come to pass that money given by Saudi Arabia to Dazn, by Dazn to Fifa, by Fifa to the clubs, ends up back in the pocket of an entity part-owned at one remove by its initial donor.

Something tangible is being bought, some element of the future. Hence the ramping up of noise this week, because in the end money will always talk loudest, blurring out all other concerns.Dazn has, we hear, “a very aggressive plan” to retail this thing by leveraging the global reach of its stars on social media, and, let’s face it, nobody ever went broke overestimating the power of mass celebrity fawning. Fifa has even given itself licence to fiddle around with the rules, allowing aconfusing 10-day transfer window just for this competition, with some wild talk Cristiano Ronaldo could even move from Al-Nasr just to play in it, which sounds odd until you consider Lionel Messi is somehow taking part.View image in fullscreenTodd Boehly thinks ‘the long-term future of the sport is in some form as a streaming product’.Photograph: Sean Ryan/IPS/ShutterstockAlready this is breeding confusion over timings and window planning. More widely there is just a feeling of lost control, elements dissolving in real time. What lies behind all this? To some degree, a kind of land grab. Todd Boehly gave an interesting speech at the recent Business of Football Summit. Despite appearing oddly drained of life on stage, like a man talking aloud about visions and plans just to keep himself awake on a long drive, the Chelsea co-owner kept coming back to one point, the fact the long-term future of the sportis in some form as a streaming product, blobs on a screen, piggyback for some future global tech service.This is a part of the noise behind all these developments, a jostle for position, every party gearing up and testing its reach, prepping to take a slice of whatever the new frontier looks like, from Fifa to the clubs to the people pumping in money from the fringes.The future is, as ever, up for grabs. It starts here, with an act of commercial disruption couched as benevolence, with a voice from the digital mist, out there saying unity and equity and growth, saying $1bn, just keep your eye on the $1bn.Barney Ronay wasnamed columnist of the yearin this year’s Sports Journalism AwardsExplore more on these topicsClub World CupFifaGianni InfantinocommentShareReuse this content"

The RFL chief executive, Tony Sutton, is aware of the complaints and is taking them seriously.Sutton has also told RFL staff that anyone else with concerns should feel safe to raise them with him in person, or via the whistleblowing hotline. The RFL has yet to open a formal investigation, but a source at the governing body told the Guardian it is likely to do so in line with whistleblowing policy.An RFL spokesperson told the Guardian: “Details of our internal complaints procedures are confidential.”The complaints follow the circulation of a letter signed by “The Women of the RFL and RL Commercial”, published by the website rugbyleague.com. The anonymous authors described a “pattern of misogyny, bullying, and dismissive behaviour toward women” by men working in the sport.“Over time we have gathered extensive evidence of inappropriate behaviour, including misogynistic comments and demeaning actions by a small group of men within the wider sport – behaviour that has no place in our future,” the letter stated.“Additionally, we have observed representatives of the sport publicly berating and belittling women, perpetuating a culture of disrespect and inequality.”In response to the letter an RFL spokesperson said: “We have whistleblowing procedures and confidentiality is part of that process.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His return to the RFL board was pushed by several Super League clubs led by Leigh and Leeds, disillusioned with the existing RFL leadership over a number of issues, particularly the declining value of the TV contract with Sky Sports and their handling of thefinancial crisis at Salford Red Devils.Before this month’s board changes the RFL wrote to the clubs warning that Wood’s proposed return could have “catastrophic financial consequences” as it would lead to “multiple breaches” of Sport England’s governance code, due to a perceived lack of independence as a result of his position at Bradford.A new interim board was therefore appointed by the RFL last week to ensure compliance with the code, with Wood, Sutton and the finance director, Rob Graham, becoming executive directors alongside five independent non-executive directors. The new board will meet for the first time on 1 April.The Guardian has learned, however, that rugby league’s Australian powerbrokers are distinctly unimpressed with the RFL’s board changes.This is a pivotal moment for the sport given the NRL is seriously considering buying a stake in Super League after thesuccessful Las Vegas roadshowthis month involving four NRL clubs, plus Wigan and Warrington. Significantly, the latter clubs abstained from a Super League vote to appoint Wood to lead the strategic review.“Super League are trying to attract investment, but they now seem more interested in fighting among themselves,” an NRL source said. “This will not help. We have built strong relationships with the RFL and Super League recently, and that has now been jeopardised at the worst possible time.”There is also an international dimension the English game’s civil war. As RFL chair Johnson had a seat on the IRL board, which runs the international game, but sources at the IRL have indicated he may not be replaced.Explore more on these topicsRFLRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Before she could even begin to reflect on her mixed emotions of pride and disappointment, however, she was hit by a wall of noise.The audience, still filled with Filipino fans at 12.45am, had opted to celebrate Eala’s achievements with a thunderous standing ovation. She responded immediately, raising both fists to the air and then blowing kisses to all corners of the stadium with a smile.Miami vibes: why a consistent coaching culture will be key for Emma Raducanu | Tumaini CarayolRead moreIt was a moment she fully deserved. During her time in Miami, Eala compiled one of the most spectacular and surprising breakout runs of this century. A 19-year-old from the Philippines ranked No 140, she had entered the Miami Open with a wild card and few expectations. In her short career, she had won only two matches on the WTA tour and her form in 2025 had been unimpressive.Simply winning her first-round match against the No 73 Katie Volynets marked this tournament as a success for Eala, but she just kept on going. She generated attention with her victory over Jelena Ostapenko, the mercurial 2017 French Open champion, then she forced the tennis world to take notice with her straight-sets win over Madison Keys, thereigning Australian Open championand world No 5. With all eyes on Eala, she then engineered one of the great upsets in recent times, toppling the five-time grand slam champion Iga Swiatek to reach the semi-finals.One week ago, no Filipina woman had ever defeated a grand slam champion. Eala scuppered three in succession. She then showed that those victories were no fluke by pushing Jessica Pegula, the world No 4, to the limit in an intense, bruising three-set battle.View image in fullscreenAlexandra Eala produced one of the most surprising runs in a tournament this century, beating three grand slam champions in succession.Photograph: Larry Marano/ShutterstockWhile her run was a massive surprise, Eala’s talents have been known for some time. A lefthander with a tidy, intelligent counterpunching game, she won the US Open girls’ title in 2022. By 17, before she even broke into the top 100, she was a Vogue cover star. Eala has trained for years at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca, which made her win over Swiatek even more significant. Two years ago, Swiatek was the keynote speaker at her graduation and the pair posed for a photo alongside Nadal.Before Eala, the highest ranked Filipina female tennis player, Maricris Gentz, reached No 284 in 1999. Alongside Eala’s talent, joy and composure, it has been equally interesting to see the Philippines suddenly have a horse in the race. Across the country, fans stagedwatch partiesfor her semi-final matchagainst Pegulaand a YouTube live stream alone drew more than 170,000 viewers at 9am on a Friday.She departs Miami having entered a new world. As a trailblazer in such a big country with a famously passionate fanbase, ample endorsements await her and every step she takes in her career will generate significant interest. This is only the beginning, which is an exciting prospect for a talented young player, but one great tournament does not mean that her continued success is guaranteed. Her next steps, as she tries to build even more momentum in her career and handle the unavoidable pressure that comes with success, will be intriguing.With its shock run finally ended, the women’s draw has culminated once again with a final that many predicted. Over the past year,the US Open, Cincinnati Open and now Miami Open – three of the five biggest outdoor hard-court events – have come down to finals between Aryna Sabalenka and Pegula. In the first two, Sabalenka overpowered Pegula with her more potent weaponry and greater weight of shot, winning each final in two tight sets.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka, the world No 1, faces Jessica Pegula again in a final, having beaten her twice on hard courts in the last year.Photograph: Leonardo Fernandez/Getty ImagesWhile they have long established themselves as two of the best players in the world, the past few weeks have been significant for both. Sabalenka started the season bynarrowly losing the Australian Open final to Keys, and she has rebounded brilliantly in the United States, also reaching the Indian Wells final, which she lost to Mirra Andreeva. In Miami, where she lives, the world No 1 has been in imperious form and she still has not dropped a set. As her disappointment after the Australian Open and Indian Wells showed, Sabalenka has reached a level of success where nothing but a title is acceptable.After reaching her maiden grand slam final at the US Open before losing to Sabalenka, Pegula started this season slowly and failed to win three matches at any of the big events, the Australian Open and three WTA 1000 events this year. Although she has not faced a top 25 opponent en route to the final, Pegula has shown her mental toughness across her numerous tight three-set matches. Against the best player in the world, though, only her best level will do.Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The name’s more jazz drummer than fast bowler. He is 22 and yet to play in theCounty Championship. He has had just the one game in the T20 Blast, for Somerset last summer before he moved to Hampshire. He also has England’s attention.Baker made his first-class debut on the Lions tour of Australia earlier this year, impressing enough to nab an England development contract, the same type of deal that the other young quicks Josh Hull and John Turner are on, both full internationals. The attraction is obvious, Baker possessing what England have been thirsting over: blink-and-miss pace.‘First to arrive and last to leave’ – remembering England bowler Peter LeverRead moreMaking his Hampshire debut in November at the Global Super League in Guyana, Baker enjoyed seeing the numbers on the speed gun. “I think I got to 148kph, which was good,” he says before the honesty kicks in. “I act like I don’t know the number. It was 148.7. I know the exact number.”Baker has no desire to be just about speed. “I by no means want to be very one-dimensional, like I just bowl rockets, don’t really know where it’s going and don’t have any level of skill at all. I don’t want to be that guy.” But the trait is central to the story of a late bloomer.“I was a bit of a late developer in terms of coordination,” says Baker, who made his way through Devon’s age-group teams.“Up until I was about 13, I didn’t really know how to move each limb individually.It looked like a millipede trying to move all its legs at the same time.”Before making it on to Somerset’s academy at 17, he was eyeing up life as a biology teacher.“I thought I’d really enjoy teaching, forming relationships and trying to help people be the best they can be. Why would you not want to do that?”But Somerset tied him down, a professional contract signed at 18. Then came a couple of back stress fractures, something of an inevitability with young tearaways, and little game time. Most of Baker’s first-team work took place in the One-Day Cup. Somerset did make an offer to keep him at the club but he opted to go east.“I think a few different counties were really interested,” says Baker. “The first thing I assessed was: ‘Where am I going to learn the most?’ Because that’s the most important thing.”Then came where he would have an opportunity to play, with money “basically irrelevant”in his decision.He gets giddy talking about what he will learn from Kyle Abbott and Keith Barker, keen to know how they find flaws in batters and set them up.“Seeing those things in person at the time and then watching them blow their shin off is going to be just … I can’t wait. I’m so excited for it. It’s going to be amazing.”View image in fullscreen‘Baker possesses what England have been thirsting over: blink-and-miss pace.’Photograph: Mark Evans/ECB/Getty ImagesIt all sounds like something a prospect should say, prioritising education over everything else. But with Baker it’s believable because he is unashamedly bookish about fast bowling, with Dale Steyn his hero. “I must have listened to, I don’t know, 20 podcasts with him on. Probably not 20, maybe 15 podcasts with him on it. He seems like the most relaxed guy ever. But then his celebrations and how much that lifts the team up, with the intent and the passion that he bowls with – I just want to do that.“That’s the guy I want to be. I want to be the guy where people are coming out of the bar to watch you bowl, like everyone does for Mark Wood.” Mitchell Johnson’s Ashes spells are cited as his favourites to watch, even if “it’s tough to admit” as an Englishman.Baker also mentions his notebooks full of intel. “I write all sorts of stuff down,” he says. “Ground dimensions, ways to grip different balls, action stuff. What else have I written down? Analysis on batters – love my analysis on batters, love having a detailed plan.”When called up to the Hundred in 2021 as a replacement player at Trent Rockets, he sought out the former Pakistan quick Wahab Riaz and talked reverse swing. While recovering from injury at Somerset, he made use of his teammates’ network to get in touch with some of the fastest there have ever been. “I got on the phone with Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Jason Gillespie. If you don’t ask, you won’t get, right?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Baker was two during the 2005 Ashes but is firmly aware of what Flintoff the player was like, and he is captivated by the coach too. “I’ve got the Ashes ’05 videos on DVD. They were my cricket upbringing – Freddie Flintoff with his arms out, eyes closed. He inevitably has a lot of respect from people and hearing him say really positive things about you is quite rattling to be honest.“He always laughs at me for my little notebook. He’s always like: ‘Oh yeah, notebook out again.’ We joke about that, but he loves it. He said: ‘People could potentially do a bit more of that. That’s fantastic that you’re doing things your way. And I love that you’re not apologetic about that. That’s amazing. We want you to be yourself and that’s clearly you.’”Baker provides a checklist for the next few months. “Let’s get the champo debut. Let’s nail that. Then we’ll go to a block of championship games. Let’s nail that. Then we can worry about T20 stuff.”Then comes the Hundred with Manchester Originals and more of the championship, a reminder of the summer’s treadmill. He doesn’t mention England but their recent selection policy – two fingers shown at convention – means that could crop up somewhere too. The notebooks will fill up fast.Explore more on these topicsCounty ChampionshipCricketinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Coventry enjoyed more early possession, but the home side produced the first moment of quality to take the lead in the 19th minute.Hamer picked himself up after being hauled down by the Coventry defender Bobby Thomas 25 yards from goal and curled his free-kick over the wall and into visiting goalkeeper Oliver Dovin’s top left-hand corner. It was Hamer’s eighth league goal of the season, while his celebrations were muted having left Coventry for Bramall Lane in August 2023.United extended their lead in the 30th minute. Hamza Choudhury and Femi Seriki combined down the right and the latter’s low, drilled cross was deftly turned home by Campbell for his 10th league goal of the season.Coventry were dealt another blow before the break when Dovin was carried off on a stretcher following Campbell’s challenge. Dovin was replaced by Brad Collins, whose superb reflex save from Campbell’s header denied the Blades a third goal in first-half stoppage time.Coventry began the second period with renewed purpose. Victor Torp’s flick – the visitors’ first effort on target – and Haji Wright’s low drive were both held by the home goalkeeper Michael Cooper.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hürzeler’s short international break, among family and friends, received a polite but pointed interruption. “Walking through the city, one of the Brighton supporters called my name and said he’s really looking forward to the game,” said the club’s head coach. “He said that we have to give everything in this game, and of course you feel it, but for me it’s important that we don’t make it artificial excitement.”Hürzeler, born a decade after Albionlost the 1983 finalto Manchester United in a replay, can be excused for not knowing the lore of Steve Foster’s headband, Tony Grealish’s hirsute captaincy and the striker Gordon Smith’s “must score” miss. There are always the owner, Tony Bloom, and the club’s time-served staffers to run through the details. In any case, Brighton relived that Wembley day two seasons ago, anotherhard-luck loss to Unitedin the semi-finals, this time on penalties.FA Cup quarter-finals: what to look out for this weekendRead moreThe German prefers being forward-facing. At 32, he can only be learning on the job and the signs are he learns quickly from reverses. On Saturday, Brighton face Nottingham Forest,who beat them 7-0on 1 February. Since then, Hürzeler’s team are unbeaten and in midweek return to Premier League action in seventh place, a point off fifth and probable Champions League qualifying. An open draw, only Manchester City remaining of the usual suspects, has made the FA Cup an achievable goal, Brighton one of four quarter-finalists to have never won a major trophy.“It’s very important not to overreact and to understand what makes us strong as a team,” Hürzeler said. “That was exactly the case when we lost against Nottingham. Especially the players, they took a lot of ownership. They took a lot of responsibility, and they said: ‘OK, we have to go back to the roots.’“We need to have this togetherness, we need to stick together, not only in good phases but also in negative phases, and we proved it this season so far, especially after the loss against Nottingham. We showed the spirit of togetherness, and the last thing, especially in this phase of the season, you need to have the belief, and I have the biggest belief in this group.”Forest will bewithout the injured Chris Wood, who took a wrecking ball to Brighton’s defence at the City Ground in February, scoring a hat-trick. Hürzeler offers full respect to his opposite number, Nuno Espírito Santo: “He built a winning machine. They have players who have quality and a style that fits completely to the profiles of the player. That’s something special. That shows his quality.”Hürzeler, as frontman for Brighton’s acclaimed executive structure, is very different from his predecessor Roberto De Zerbi, who in turn could hardly have been more different from Graham Potter. The Italian was the counterattacking tactical revolutionary who briefly became the hottest name in football. Potter established himself as the steadiest of hands. Hürzeler offers something else, though perhaps also something in between. When appointed last July, he talked of “challenging the establishment” and yet has developed Brighton in an often methodical, commonsense fashion. Time spent in his company reveals a passionate belief in the power of psychology and mentality.View image in fullscreenBrighton celebrate Danny Welbeck’s winner in the fifth round at Newcastle. They have not lost since their 0-7 thrashing at Forest on 1 February.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty ImagesHürzeler has drawn inspiration from the unlikely – for a German – world of rugby union: “The loss against Nottingham was a big loss but it was also a loss that helped us in our development. Now it’s important to find a good balance. There is a book about the All Blacks, and they talk about the red head and the blue head, the cool head.“And if you are always in the red head and acting with too much emotion, saying: ‘We have to make a revenge, we are angry that they beat us seven-zero,’ I think then you are too much in the emotional part of your mind and that’s why it’s so important to stay in the blue phase, in the cool head, make decisions without emotions, stay rational.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhere many clubs choose to prioritise, perhaps even third-placed Forest, with their golden chance of playing Champions League football next season, Hürzeler says he is under no pressure from Bloom or the chief executive, Paul Barber, to plump for one competition over the other, even if the Champions League has come within touching distance.“We try to go into every competition to achieve the maximum, we try to go into every game and win it, so that’s our approach, our thinking, and therefore we don’t have these kinds of discussions. It’s about building the rhythm, keeping the connection, building this consistency and therefore I am not a big fan of making too many rotations, too many changes in the starting XI.”If the FA Cup has lost lustre because managers rotate their squads to concentrate on league matters, including those from lower down the Football League, the former St Pauli coach presents a different mode of thinking. Should Brighton reach European football next season, fatigue may become of greater concern. For this season at least, Hürzeler appears convinced much of it remains in the mind.“I think when the players feel in a good shape, are in a good mood, they have a lot of belief in themselves. They are confident and want to be on the pitch. That’s my feeling; the mind can decide the feeling on the pitch so therefore the players don’t feel this tiredness, and therefore I am not a fan of making too many changes.”Explore more on these topicsBrighton & Hove AlbionFA CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With Brentford to play on Wednesday and a Champions League place still possible, Howe’s players are unlikely to get “mortalled”, to use the regional phrase, or join any after-party down the city’s Diamond Strip.Newcastle perform U-turn over open-top bus parade after fan outcryRead moreChi Onwurah, the local MP who campaigned for a parade, this week presented a parliamentary petition signed by constituents asking the government to congratulate Newcastle “and consider a national award to recognise major group sporting achievements”. It was a move given an indifferent reception within the House of Commons.Certain clubs are more used to success than others. Barcelona have the Canaletes fountain at the top of La Rambla, Real Madrid fans congregate at the Plaza de Cibeles to drape a scarf around a statue of a Greek goddess. Bayern Munich’s beer-swilling antics from the balcony of the town hall at Marienplatz are a near-annual event.Newcastle’s final arrangements follow the time-honoured traditions of slow-moving bus edging past fans, before a civic reception where players address their public from a stage. A town-hall balcony is usually the final destination. Here’s where the speeches come in. Louis van Gaal’sleder-clad call to arms in 2010 at Marienplatz, bellowing his offering of a “big kiss from the coach of the champions” for the mothers of Munich is the classic of the genre, though two examples from 1977 in England also stand out.View image in fullscreenEmlyn Hughes (second left) celebrates Liverpool’s First Division and European Cup wins in 1977. The defender called Everton ‘tragic’ during the open-top bus parade, which he later regretted.Photograph: Pictorial Parade/Getty ImagesEmlyn Hughes’s “Liverpool are magic, Everton are tragic” in celebrating a league title and European Cup was an example of high spirits misjudging the occasion. He later apologised, for the “day I could have bitten off my tongue”. Tommy Docherty addressed Albert Square in Manchester, the FA Cup adorned in United red. “We promised you last year we’d bring the Cup back,” he said, referring to United losing the previous year’s final, huge cheers greeting him. It would be his last public act as a United manager, as he was soon removed for admitting his love affair with the club physio’s wife.Manchester City kept up a parade tradition in the Pep Guardiola glory years, with Kyle Walker usually leading proceedings and Jack Grealish adopting that Leonardo DiCaprio Titanic-crossed-with-Messianic pose during 2023’s treble party. Considering Grealish’s decline through injuries and the loss of form and patronage of Guardiola, that shirtless image just about captures his zenith at City, leading player and relatable man of the people. Perhaps a little too relatable for his manager’s liking.‘Not even a watch’: No prizes if City win Club World Cup, warns GuardiolaRead moreGrealish’s state of refreshment brought back memories of Jack Wilshere’santi-Tottenham chantsas Arsenal celebrated, at Islington Town Hall,their 2015 FA Cup win. Wilshere landed a £40k fine and much moral opprobrium, though his state of inebriation was hardly much different to that of England’s 2005 Ashes winners, or England’s 2003 Rugby World Cup squad, where players became drunk to the point of unintelligibility.The last team other than City to win the Premier League, Liverpool, were denied such a moment by the Covid pandemic, though fans did flood into the city with victory confirmed, the party raging on for 24 hours,against the guidance of the time. Should, as expected, Liverpool lift this season’s title, a return to a more traditional bus parade is surely being planned. Nothing is announced to tempt fate though planning is necessary. Memories abound of 2007, when photos from a bus depot emerged of a red-bedecked bus bearing the legend “six times”, only for Liverpool to lose the Champions League final to Milan.View image in fullscreenJack Wilshere caused consternation when on the mic during Arsenal’s FA Cup parade in 2015.Photograph: Scott Heavey/PARecognition of the runners-up is a lost tradition, though Newcastle staged parades to St James’ Park after losing finals in 1974 and 1976, heroes’ welcomes to bemused, beaten but grateful players. Not so grateful the Everton squad of 1986, asked to join the double “celebration” of coming second to Liverpool in both league and FA Cup. Three buses toured the city, Liverpool occupying first and second with attendant silverware. The third had no toilet and as Everton players – on the bus swiftly named “the loser cruiser” – drowned their sorrows, empty cans were reportedly repurposed.“We had the trophies,” said the Liverpool defender Steve Nicol. “All Everton had was a few cans of ale.” Graeme Sharp, the Everton striker, said: “It was unbelievable, Liverpool were all celebrating and we were sitting there miserable.” His teammate, Peter Reid, refused to board the bus, even after the manager, Howard Kendall, threatened him with a two-week fine. “I said: ‘That’ll do me’ and pissed off. I watched the parade from a pub in Bolton.”Explore more on these topicsFootballNewcastle UnitedCarabao CupManchester CityLiverpoolManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’re looking for the vehicle that’s used to carry genetic material into cells.“The sorts of things that you could hypothesise that people might do are to introduce genetic material that might increase muscle mass, or increase the capacity to produce red blood cells. So it would have the same effects as other traditional drugs [such as anabolic steroids], but it’s done through a genetic modification.”While National Hunt and Flat horses will be screened as part of the new programme, which has been developed at a cost of about £2m over the past six years, cooperation with other jurisdictions including Australia, France, Japan and Hong Kong, will mean that the test may be of particular relevance on the high-stakes global Flat racing circuit.View image in fullscreenBrant Dunshea, the chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority, expects the technology of testing to improve.Photograph: Victoria Jones/PARunners from Britain and overseas will be subject to potential screening ahead of Royal Ascot in June, and the test has also been designed to track further developments in gene manipulation technology.“There’s a suite of common vectors that are used in science to do this, so what we’ve done is develop a method that will enable us to screen for all the common vectors, but then, as new ones come on stream, to add them,” Dunshea says. “There will also be other types of tests that come on stream as the technology develops.”Two million pounds might seem like a lot of money to spend to combat a threat that, as far as anyone knows, remains theoretical at present.High-profile doping cases both here and abroad, however, including theMahmood al-Zarooni steroid scandalin 2013 and the extraordinaryServis/Navarrocase in the United States in 2020, have shown the deep and lasting damage that can be done to racing’s image by those who are determined to win at all costs. On that basis, it is surely money well spent.Native Warrior can battle to victoryThe Qatar-based Wathnan Racing operation, a rapidly emerging power in international Flat racing, has two live contenders for today’s Lincoln Handicap and with James Doyle, their No 1 jockey, having opted to ride Midnight Gun for Hamad al-Jehani,Native Warrior(3.35) could be overpriced to give Karl Burke his first success in the traditional opener to the new Flat season on turf.Betting markets often overreact when a retained jockey is forced to choose between two mounts. Seamie Heffernan’s impressive list of Group One wins on horses that Aidan O’Brien’s No 1 at the time opted to reject is a reminder of how finely balanced these decisions can be.Burke, whose increasingly powerful stable was top five in the trainers’ championship for the first time last year, is also double-handed in today’s race. And Thunder Run, fourth home in the Balmoral Handicap at Ascot on Champions Day, is the narrow market leader in the overnight betting.Again, though, there is little or nothing to choose between Thunder Run and Native Warrior on the balance of their form to date, and Native Warrior’s close second off today’s mark in a well-run race at Glorious Goodwood last summer is arguably the best individual piece of form on offer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We must, she argues, “connect the dots between the brutal system of chattel slavery and the degradation of the natural environment … The worlds Europeans built depended on making the lives of some disposable.”The result, according to Goffe’s analysis, was a system of knowledge production that projects a logic of ownership and exploitation on to the world that understands nature – and fellow humans – as no more than a means to profit.For Goffe, Dark Laboratory is more than an environmental history. Born to Jamaican parents in London, with African and Chinese heritage, then raised and educated in the US, it is for her an exploration of her and her family’s history and how disparate ethnicities were transported across the world to the crucible of colonialism.“Reading [about] labour history in the Caribbean and how the Chinese were introduced, let’s say, to the region, it really opened up these questions of modern capitalism and I began to ask questions about Black freedom and emancipation and how the British brought the Chinese to the scene of the plantation in order to try to save the sugarcane economy.”View image in fullscreenAn illustration of sugarcane cutters in Jamaica in about 1905.Photograph: Print Collector/Getty ImagesIn a narrative spanning hundreds of years, thousands of miles and successive waves of colonial driven migration, Goffe charts the development of the modern western ideology that has come to dominate the world. “I really wanted to think about the Caribbean as a dark laboratory, as this place that’s off the map, that’s kind of shrouded in darkness and secrecy, but a place where all of these experiments happened,” Goffe said.Such experiments included the white colonialists’ introduction of the Calcutta mongoose, deftly paralleled by Goffe with the introduction of Asian indentured labourers to the island of Jamaica. Through thorough archival research, she illustrates how these plantation owners – “each … fancying himself a scientist, a gentleman farmer and a god over his estate” – applied the same instrumental pseudoscience to the importation of new species of wildlife as they did to the importation of different races of people.AsAudre Lordesaid, the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house, and so in her effort to intellectually dismantle the superstructure of western science Goffe turns to a wider set of implements. Throughout the book she flits from economic, scientific and natural history to literary and cultural analysis, weaving together the Eden myth with the birth of geology with lyrics from the reggae revival artist Chronixx, and moving from the stark Detroit techno of Drexciya to the life-cycle of coral to the eugenicist theories of Francis Galton.View image in fullscreenThe reggae artist Chronixx, whose lyrics form part of the implements Goffe uses to dismantle the superstructure of western science.Photograph: Joseph Okpako/Redferns/Getty Images“It just brings a multisensorial way of seeing the problem, so it’s more multidimensional than just a problem that is on paper or that we’re going to solve with policy or the law,” Goffe says. “I’ve noticed that there’s a lot of people who are asking these questions that are musicians. King Britt [the Philadelphia musician] is another person who’s gotten in touch, and I’m kind of imagining a global sound clash with different musicians who are thinking through our urgent problems, with a kind of soundtrack so that we can find ways of storytelling when it comes to the climate crisis.”Goffe’s method of storytelling has left some confused. ANew York Times criticdescribed her work as “disorienting”, while conceding it was “an obvious rebuke of a more conventional narrative structure”. But maybe that unconventional structure allows for unconventional thinking, and no less is required to rethink an approach to understanding the world that is so pervasive it can feel as if there is no alternative.It is the very victims of this ongoing disaster who are most qualified to show the world a way through, she says. Racialised people – and particularly island people – have already faced down, and lived through, multiple catastrophes. They can offer solutions, if only the powerful would listen.On visits to the Maroons – communities descended from escaped enslaved people – in Jamaica, the Indigenous Kalinaga people of Dominica and others, Goffe learned of ecological understandings of our place in the world that offer viable alternatives to the slash and burn capitalism we have inherited.It is to the people of the islands, in the Caribbean and elsewhere – even the UK – that we should turn, she says. “I’m not saying Britain has to be at the helm,” she adds. “But I do think that if Britain was to think of itself in terms of its shorelines, in terms of our relationship to water – the same for New York – then we might be reoriented also towards the Caribbean communities that call these islands home.“There is a lot to be said for what people from islands understand about each other. And what it means to live at the edge, and the shoreline.”Dark Laboratory is published by Hamish Hamilton, a Penguin imprint.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentCotton Capital: ongoing seriesCaribbeanJamaicaAmericasClimate crisisColonialismSlaveryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Like the UK,Swedenhad problems with air pollution and acidification during the 1960s caused by coal combustion. But unlike Britain, which turned to the natural gas fields of the North Sea for a solution, resulting in Britain’s dependence on it for central heating today, Sweden instead mobilised around the idea of creating a shared “central chimney”.“You could manage the combustion in one place, have proper purification of the flue gases and get better air quality centrally,” says the energy adviser and entrepreneur Ulrika Jardfelt, who was previously CEO of Svensk Fjärrvärme (Swedish district heating) and a vice-president at the Swedish energy company Vattenfall. This required the creation of district heating networks to transport the heat from a central boiler to individual homes and buildings. The initiative got a flying start when 1m new homes were built in the 1970s.The greenness, or otherwise, of the systems depends very much on the inputs, she explains. If you’re using gas then they’re not that green. But if, as in Stockholm’s district heating network (which also claims to be the world’s largest district cooling system), the inputs include heat from residents’ wastewater, excess heat from the electricity used to cool datacentres and supermarket refrigerators, and steam from incinerated non-recyclable waste at combined heat and power plants, the carbon footprint will be far lower.The story of Sweden’s district heating success is two-tier, says Adis Dzebo, a senior research fellow at Stockholm Environment Institute, with district heating and heat pumps meeting over 75% of energy demand. The two have successfully cut reliance on oil, which has gone from total dominance in the 1970s to less than 5% today.A pivotal factor, says Dzebo, was the 1973 oil crisis – when the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) introduced an oil embargo on Israel-supporting countries – prompting Sweden to invest heavily in renewable energy research and innovation, paving the way for the energy transition of the 1990s. “Sweden introduced a carbon tax in 1991 and together with having ample biomass resources, the change was rapid.”This, combined with the dominance at the time of a multi-dwelling housing ownership system that was communal for both privately owned properties and social and rental housing, where owners had a share in the whole building, enabled shared heat networks to flourish. The development of nuclear and hydro, which stabilised electricity prices and paved the way for heat pumps in single-dwelling properties, also played a role.But, says Dzebo, the leadership of municipal and state companies leading the transition was also crucial. “This allowed higher risk-taking and created co-benefits with creating labour opportunities. With innovation, Sweden became leading on combined heat and power plants, waste incineration and re-use of industrial waste heat.”Sweden’s district heating prowess has attracted admiration from around the world. According to SwedishEnergyAgency statistics, in 2023 district heating comprised 52% of total residential energy use for heating and hot water in Sweden. In comparison, district heating in the UK was less than 3% of the market share in 2022 – a figure that the British government wants to stretch to 20% by 2050.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The most efficient way is to use heat sources that are available locally, says Jardfelt, such as datacentres or flue gases from waste incinerators. But, she warns, it depends on property owners being willing to replace their existing boilers with district heating plants that draw heat from hot water in the district heating network. “Do you dare to trust that you will really get the heat you need and at a reasonable price? This may require government price regulation.”At Stockholm Exergi’s pioneering power station in Norra Djurgårdsstaden they burn forestry waste to produce district heating. The company, which is half-owned by the city of Stockholm, plans to build a bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) plant close to the site to produce negative emissions. They have already set up a research facility there and calculate that there is potential to capture 800,000 tonnes of CO2a year at the plant. If this was emulated across the city, they claim that figure could rise to 2m tonnes. “This is the beginning,” says Persson, a company spokesperson. “But we hope that lots of others will follow.”But there is no perfect or permanent solution to energy transition, says Dzebo. “It requires constant reconfiguration and agile decision-making. But, often the trade-offs can be perceived as being too high.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy efficiencyThe alternativesEnergySwedenGreen citiesGreen economyGreen buildingCarbon footprintsShareReuse this content"

Much of north and central Queensland was put under severe weather alert for heavy rainfall earlier this week, as six-hourly rainfall totals of 30-60mm were anticipated, with the risk of seeing up to 120mm locally in this period.In the north-west of the state, this rain caused the Haughton River to rise rapidly, with water levels reaching 2.68 metres on Wednesday night, exceeding the 2.5-metre major flood level.More centrally, the heavy showers on Tuesday led to Quilpie Shire, a local government area, recording its wettest March day in 15 years, with 130mm of rain falling by 9am. This rainfall cut off many towns from each other, including Eromanga, Australia’s farthest town from the sea.The Mediterranean also experienced severe storms this week. On Tuesday, hailstorms affected the western Mediterranean, with the town of Alhaurín el Grande turning white under a layer of hail. A similar event was seen in Fiuminata, Italy, where tractors had to be deployed to clear a 20cm layer of hail from the streets.On Wednesday, the eastern Mediterranean had the most severe storms. Heavy showers affecting the Balkan region led to severe flooding in Dubrovnik, Croatia, as 82.9mm of rain fell in just 24 hours. Landslides across the city caused road closures and turned the sea brown with the soil and debris being washed away.Meanwhile, after a record-breaking hot spell inChinaover the last week, high pressure building in the north-east of the country has been driving a sharp temperature drop as cold air pushes south.Temperatures began to climb in central and eastern parts of China from 16 March, resulting in daytime maximum temperatures reaching the low- to mid– 30Cs in places over the last week, 10-15C above the seasonal average. Beijing’s Haidian district exceeded 30C last Saturday – the earliest recording of 30C for the capital since 1959.However, as colder air moved in, temperatures in the north plunged, with Beijing reaching just 12.6C on Thursday, a drop of over 15C within days. As the cold air mass continues to advance, temperatures are expected to fall by 15-20C farther south, accompanied by strong winds and dusty conditions.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsWeather trackerAustralia weatherChinaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The section of the guideline relating to pre-sentence reports is directed to the issue of information about offenders, no more and no less.”In response, Mahmood said: “I have been clear in my view that these guidelines represent differential treatment, under which someone’s outcomes may be influenced by their race, culture or religion.“This is unacceptable and I formally set out my objections to this in a letter to the Sentencing Council last week. I am extremely disappointed by the council’s response. All options are on the table and I will legislate if necessary.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An earlier version of the guidelines, published last spring, was criticised by the then justice secretary, Alex Chalk, as “patronising”.The government has launched a drive to reduce the number and influence of arm’s-length government bodies, with Starmer arguing that the state was becoming “passive”.Explore more on these topicsSentencingUK criminal justicePrisons and probationEnglandWalesRaceShabana MahmoodnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s time for some scrutiny over what he believes and would do. Expect more of this.”The chosen territory for now is theNHS, with Labour seeking to draw attention to Farage’s previous hints that he would prefer a different model. Quizzed about this on Friday morning, Farage told the BBC that he supported it being free at point of use, but that he would like to “re-examine the whole funding model”.While Farage says his preferred idea would be more like the top-up system seen in parts of continental Europe, Labour argues that he would in fact oversee a US free-for-all.Before the rally, the party pointed to Farage’s links to a US thinktank called the Heartland Institute, which strongly argues for the American healthcare system and has criticised the NHS.Speaking at a Heartland Institute dinner in Chicagoin September last year, Farage praised its work and called for its ideas to spread to the UK. “Maybe the time has come for a bit of reverse colonialism, maybe it’s time that Heartland came and set up in Britain and Europe and brought some of the wisdom that you’ve brought to the American debate,” he told the audience.Friday’s rally at Birmingham’s Utilita Arena was a chance for him to galvanise his supporters before a major election effort – and to try to move on from bitters rows of the past few weeks.Rupert Lowe, elected as one of Reform’s five MPs in July, is in open war with Farage after he lost the party whip overallegations linked to bullying staffand threats to Reform’s chair, which Lowe has dismissed as a smear.In his speech to the rally, Farage called for a “British form of Doge”, modelled on Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency”. He also called for a complete ban on civil servants working from home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After the local elections, he said, members would be able to vote for a party board.The event, which ran very late and appeared less full than the claimed 10,000 ticket sales, also saw Arron Banks, the former aide and donor to Farage in Ukip, as the Reform candidate for the west of England mayoralty.In Runcorn, although Amesbury had a near-15,000 majority, Reform have been heavily tipped to take the seat after the MP was convicted of punching a man in the street and stepped down, and a Labour win would be a reverse for Farage.Similarly, winning the near-25% of the vote they have polled at recently would give Reform 400-plus council seats on 1 May but recent council byelections – however limited a guide – have not gone hugely well for the party.At a council byelection in Maldon in Essex on Thursday Reformtook just16.7% of the vote, and the Conservatives held the seat. Of four recent byelections in the county, billed as a Reform stronghold, the party won a lower vote share than Ukip did in 2013-14.Explore more on these topicsReform UKLocal electionsBirminghamNHSLabourNigel FarageLocal politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Detectives then established that his housemate, Everett, had not been seen for several weeks and forensic DNA testing found the remains were his.The court heard that after the murder, Majerkiewicz had tricked Everett’s family into believing he was still alive,sending them WhatsApp messages, birthday cards and gifts.Everett’s family described him as “a unique and endearing character who always put his family and many friends first”, who “loved his food, his garden, his music and a flutter on the horses”.DCS Lewis Hughes, the senior investigating officer on the case, said: “We said from the start that we wouldn’t give up, and the victim and their family remained at the forefront of our minds and actions throughout. We have been focused on both ensuring justice in this case, but also ensuring the victim could be returned to his family and laid to rest.”Explore more on these topicsGreater ManchesterCrimeSalfordEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Ali Harbi Ali was convicted of Amess’s murder in 2022, when he was 26.His school had referred him to Prevent in 2014, but his case was closed two years later, despite concerns that he could have an interest in violent Islamism. He had been referred from Prevent to the Channel scheme, for those deemed at risk of radicalisation.Ali’s trial heard he had hidden his real views while in the Prevent scheme. The review found theassessment had been made too soon, after just one coffee meeting with him at McDonald’s.MPs across parliament have called for Prevent to be overhauled since the Southport murders. Jake Davison, who had also been referred to the programme, went on to murder five people in a 12-minute rampage through Plymouth in August 2021.Stewart also led Prevent when William Shawcross reviewed it in 2023 and concluded that it was not “doing enough to counter non-violent Islamist extremism” and “has a double standard when dealing with the extreme right wing and Islamism”.Prevent is a voluntary scheme intended to deflect people away from being radicalised before they commit terrorist acts.Last month, Jarvis said the Prevent commissioner would “ensure the implementation of all relevant recommendations” from the review about the programme’s interactions with Ali.The Guardian revealed Kemi Badenochco-authored a reportthat expressed concern the Prevent programme was alienating communities.The Conservative leader co-wrote the 50-page report titled Preventing Extremism in London when she was a member of the London assembly’s police and crime committee in 2015.“Community engagement is critical to the success of Prevent,” the report went on, noting the risk that “the current ‘top-down’ approach to Prevent delivery makes it difficult to engage citizens”.The Home Office has been contacted for comment on Stewart’s departure.Explore more on these topicsPrevent strategyUK security and counter-terrorismCounter-terrorism policySouthport attackEnglandMerseysidenewsShareReuse this content"

Hopefully, it will go down well with the villagers.”The film has been financed by BBC Wales andFfilm Cymru Wales, in partnership withthe Welsh government agency Creative Wales. Talfan said he felt it was important to go to the real places connected to Burton – because of the authentic feel, and as a way of saying thank you for the public money they had used.“It’s lovely when you do something like this out in the community. It’s inspiring and helps the actors. We’re lucky to have extraordinary landscapes inWales.”Harry Lawtey plays the young Burton, and Toby Jones and Lesley Manville also star. Talfan said Jones in particular had been “blown away” by the village. The place is more verdant and less industrial than it was in Burton’s youth, so chimneys belching out black smoke have been added with the use of special effects.View image in fullscreenRichard Burton walking with his father on the aqueduct in 1953.Photograph: Raymond Kleboe/Getty ImagesThe Welsh culture minister, Jack Sargeant, said the production exemplified “authentic Welsh storytelling”. He said: “We are committed to supporting filmmaking in Wales by working with partners to share our stories with the world and establish our reputation as a premier filming destination.”Everyone in Pontrhydyfen seems to have a tale about Burton and Taylor,still arguably Hollywood’s greatest couple. Edwards said she remembers a glamorous man and woman coming into a general store when she was a young girl. “They wanted to buy some Welsh bacon and what I remember is that she smelled absolutely divine.” The young Edwards pointed out that the woman appeared to be jumping the queue and was told: “Shh, it’s Elizabeth Taylor.”A sweet shop used to be sure to get in upmarket chocolate when Taylor was around, but there were few airs and graces about the pair, who stayed with relatives and friends. “Not a fancy hotel,” said Edwards.The local schoolclosed in 2015, which was a bitter blow to the village, and Edwards said making more of the Burton heritage had helped draw the place together. Last year the committee commissioned a mural of Burton on the Miners Arms.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Mari Clark, Andrea Edwards and Johanne Harrington in front of the mural on the Miners Arms.Photograph: Kara Thomas/Athena PicturesEdwards said some local children had not been sure who Burton was until the mural appeared. “What’s been nice is that kids now understand that somebody from humble beginnings actually made it – was, you know, bigger than Beyoncé.”Anniversary celebrations later this year include an exhibition of residents’ photos and ciné film of Burton and Taylor, a concert featuring another star from the village, the Grammy award-winning soprano Rebecca Evans, and a scarecrow festival featuring characters from the actor’s films, plays or narrations.Mari Clark, the secretary of the festival committee, said: “I think everyone met Burton and Taylor. The call would come: ‘Rich and Liz are home next weekend, OK?’ Nobody would bother them.”She remembers Taylor in an Afghan coat, and the time when word came that Burton had given up alcohol. The Miners Arms got in non-alcoholic beer but the rumour that Burton was on the wagon was unfounded and the bottles went unopened for years.As well as celebrating Burton, the Burton Bont festival is marking the 200th anniversary of the aqueduct (bont is bridge in Welsh), a neat coincidence as there is a famous image of Burton and his miner father, Richard “Dick Bach” Jenkins, walking across it together.Johanne Harrington, the festival’s artistic director, said Burton and Taylor were part of the fabric of the place. “The village is such a close-knit community and he is still very much part of it.”Explore more on these topicsWalesRichard BurtonElizabeth TaylorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He attended the London Clinic, the same hospital where he was treated for an enlarged prostate in January 2024.A source described it as a “most minor bump in a road that is very much heading in the right direction”.The monarch underwent scheduled treatment on Thursday morning for cancer that required “a short period of observation in hospital”, according to a palace statement. The king had been due to meet ambassadors in audiences at Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon and to travel to Birmingham on Friday, but these were postponed.“His majesty has now returned to Clarence House and, as a precautionary measure, acting on medical advice, tomorrow’s diary programme will also be rescheduled,” a spokesperson said.The king sent his apologies to “all those who may be inconvenienced or disappointed” as a result of his decision to postpone his engagements, the statement added.After he returned home to Clarence House, the king was said to be on good form, and was reported to be working on state papers and making calls from his study.Sources told PA Media the hospital visit was not a major development and no further updates were expected on the king’s health. If any minor alterations to his diary next week were needed, they would be announced in due course, they said.The king has had a full week of engagements, including a media reception and a visit to a soil exhibition. Last week, the king made a three-day visit to Northern Ireland with Queen Camilla. Earlier this month, he hosted political figures including the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the outgoing Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and the new Canadian PM, Mark Carney.

She said he was an “extremely dangerous young man” who thought he had planned the “perfect crime”.Winchester crown court was told that on the morning of his sentencing Saadi told a member of his legal team: “I never got noticed when I did a good thing. People have only noticed me when I did a bad thing.”Sarah Jones KC, prosecuting, said a psychiatric report carried out after Saadi was convicted concluded he did not have autism spectrum disorder but exhibited features of that condition. She said he had a sense of grievance, an obsession with killing and a desire to feel powerful.Saadi’s barrister, Charlie Sherrard KC, said his client now recognised his guilt and had engaged with the neurodiversity team in prison.Sherrard said Saadi had never been in trouble before, was from a loving family and was “very much under the radar”.He said the psychiatric report revealed Saadi had “repressed socially induced trauma resulting from a combination of real and perceived rejections and social humiliations resulting in him feeling alien from general society, a social misfit, somebody who had hardly any friends at school, had never had a girlfriend and seemed to be avoided”.He had “significantly low self-esteem and a general sense of inadequacy”, which led to him becoming fascinated with violent films and “finding some level of fascination in the mind of a psychopath”. The barrister said: “There’s an ongoing sense of rage against society. The idea of high levels of notoriety became a valid goal in itself.”The trial heard Saadi, from south London, had carefully researched how police investigated murders. After the attack, he hid his weapon and disposed of all the clothes he was wearing, leaving no traces of DNA or fingerprints at the scene.Saadi refused to give police the passcode to his phone, stopping them from using technology to pinpoint him on the beach, butDorsetdetectives built a strong circumstantial case that proved he was the murderer.In the lead-up to the attack, Saadi bought six knives, including a machete and a hunting knife, and repeatedly searched for details of murders, including those of 16-year-oldBrianna Ghey in Cheshire, 13-year-oldMilly Dowler from Surrey, andthe Miyazawa family, in Setagaya, Tokyo. His online pseudonyms included “Ninja Killer” and “NSKills”.In her victim personal statement, Gray’s wife, Sian Gray, said the “world had fallen” from beneath the feet of her and the couple’s daughter.She said: “I’m not the person I was before. I fight every day to keep my career on track and continue to be a role model for our daughter who is now growing up without one of her parents.“I have to watch her drama performances, attend her army cadets remembrance parade and share her successes and disappointments, alone … the memories that should be shared.“At the age of 36, I should not have to hold my deceased wife’s cold hand, nor should my daughter have to say goodbye and grieve over a coffin.“Our tragedy has been a public display for all to see. Amie’s beautiful life has now been reduced to forever being remembered as ‘the murder victim’.”Amie Gray’s mother, Sharon Macklin, said: “Amie was an amazing, funny, kind and energetic soul. She had a big smile and a loud laugh and when she entered the room it filled with laughter.”Leanne Miles declined to give a statement because she did not want Saadi to have “any knowledge or understanding” of her.The court heard that Saadi harboured strong misogynistic views, repeatedly telling fellow students at the University of Greenwich that women were weaker than men and should not work in certain jobs.It is possible he may have taken sexual pleasure in the killing. While he was being held in the high-security Belmarsh prison in south-east London, awaiting trial, he asked a female officer if the killing was making headlines and then masturbated in front of her.DI Mark Jenkins, of Dorset police’s major crime investigation team, said he believed Saadi had gone toBournemouthto kill but had targeted Gray and Miles because they were isolated and he could surprise them. “He saw an opportunity and took it,” Jenkins said.Explore more on these topicsCrimeBournemouthDorsetEnglandKnife crimenewsShareReuse this content"

As a sovereign country – not as what he pretends we are – and on a comprehensive deal,” Carney said earlier this week.Trump said in the post that he and Carney, who has previously served as governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, “agree on many things” and that the pair would be meeting “immediately” after Canada’s federal election on 28 April.In areadout of the conversationreleased by the prime minister’s office, Carney described the call as a “very constructive conversation” and said the two would begin “comprehensive negotiations about a new economic and security relationship” after the election. Carney said he would be “working hard for the next month to earn the right to represent Canada in those discussions”.On Sunday, Carney called a snap election following numerous polls that show adramatic and unprecedented surge for his Liberal party. Current projections have the Liberals winning a majority government, a stark reversal from their dismal fortunes as recently as late February.Ahead of the call with Trump, Carney told reporters the conversation would be “only the beginning of a negotiation, not the end”.In fiery rhetoric since Trump launched his trade war and began threatening to make Canada the 51st US state, the prime ministerlamented the collapse of relationsbetween the two nations.Mark Carney laments Canada’s lost friendship with US in visit to 9/11 townRead more“It is clear that the United States is no longer a reliable partner. It is possible that, with comprehensive negotiations, we will be able to restore some trust, but there will be no turning back,” Carney told reporters in Ottawa earlier.“We will need to dramatically reduce our reliance on the United States,” he said. “We will need to pivot our trade relationships elsewhere.”Earlier this week, the White Houseannounced 25% tariffsthat threaten to destroy Canada’s auto sector. More than 1m cars and light trucks are manufactured in Canada for export to the US. Washington also promised “reciprocal tariffs” against any levies imposed by trading partners in response that it feels are unfair to American consumers.In the call, Carney also said his government would implement retaliatory tariffs “to protect Canadian workers and our economy” ahead of expected levies from the US due to come into effect on 2 April.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyDonald TrumpTrump tariffsAmericasUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Crowley, which manages the Stena Immaculate, said salvage and recovery operations are moving into the next phase.“During the weekend of 29-30 March, operations will commence at sea to transfer the remaining 202,485 barrels of Jet-A1 cargo from the Stena Immaculate tanker to tanker Fure Vyl, which is anchored nearby,” a spokesperson said.“This lightering operation is a standard and routine maritime practice that follows established safety protocols.”The jet fuel will then be delivered to its original destination of Killingholme, in Lincolnshire, the statement added.The Stena Immaculate will be towed to the Port of Tyne on the north-east coast, near Newcastle, for further inspection expected to take place in early April. A Crowley spokesperson added: “We continue to work with the appropriate authorities and remain committed to supporting the salvors and salvage operations with the highest possible regard for safety.”The Portuguese vessel Solong arrived in Aberdeen on Friday after being towed to the Scottish city for “safe berthing”. It was accompanied by a vessel with counter-pollution measures as it arrived at the Port of Aberdeen at about 7am on Friday.A total of 36 people were rescued from the ships after the incident but a sailor from the Solong – named as 38-year-old Filipino national Mark Angelo Pernia – is missing and presumed dead.The Solong’s captain, Vladimir Motin, 59, of St Petersburg, Russia, has appeared at Hull magistrates court and at the Old Baileycharged with gross negligence manslaughterand was remanded in custody. He is due to stand trial in January 2026.After the collision, thousands of plastic pellets used in plastics production, known as nurdles, were released from ruptured containers on the Solong andbegan washing up on beaches on the Norfolk coast, where a clean-up operation is continuing.According to conservationists, the nurdles are not toxic butcan harm animalsif ingested.Explore more on these topicsShipping industryNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson posted a map on X with a building marked in red, telling residents to flee more than 300 metres away, reminiscent of the daily maps the Israeli military issued before bombings during its war with Hezbollah.“You are present near facilities belonging to Hezbollah,” the spokesperson warned, pointing to a building near two schools in Dahiyeh. The warning was followed by two drone strikes.An Israeli military spokesperson later said the airstrikes targeted a truck and Hezbollah drone storage facility known as Unit 127.The warning caused people in Dahiyeh to flee, with men shooting in the air to warn those who had not seen the announcement on social media. Videos showed residents sheltering on pavements in central Beirut.Earlier in the morning, Israel announced it had intercepted one of two rockets coming fromLebanon, the second time in a week that rocket fire was directed towards it, after three rockets were fired at the town of Metula on 22 March.According to the military, one of the rockets was intercepted, while the other fell short inside Lebanese territory as rocket sirens sounded in the city of Kiryat Shmona and the communes of Tel Hai, Margaliot and Misgav Am.No one claimed responsibility for Friday’s rocket fire, and Hezbollah issued no statement.Israel conducted several airstrikes in southern Lebanon before the evacuation warning in Beirut on Friday. Lebanon announced the closure of schools in the south in fear of further strikes.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Friday’s strike marked an “example” of Israel’s “determination” to act against its northern neighbour.“We will not allow firing on our communities, not even a trickle,” Netanyahu said in a statement. “We will continue to vigorously enforce the ceasefire; we will attack everywhere in Lebanon, against any threat to the State of Israel, and we will ensure that all our residents in the north return to their homes safely.”The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said: “If calm does not prevail in the Galilee towns, there will be no calm in Beirut … We will not allow a return to the situation before October 7.“I am sending a clear message from here to the Lebanese government: if you do not enforce the ceasefire agreement we will enforce it,” Katz added.It is unclear how Hezbollah willrespond to a strike on Dahiyeh, where the groupenjoys large public support. Hezbollah claims its role is to protect Lebanon from the Israeli military, so a strike near the country’s capital could challenge the basis of its legitimacy.There has been no resumption of major hostilities since the ceasefire began in November, despite Israel conducting hundreds of strikes in Lebanon. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for one strike in Israel a few days after the signing of the ceasefire.The ceasefire had brought an end to more than 13 months of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel, which killed more than 3,900 people and displaced about 1 million in Lebanon. Lebanon’s prime minister, Nawaf Salam, has emphasised his commitment to the ceasefire deal and reiterated that the decision for Lebanon to go to war lay with the state, not with Hezbollah.Salam issued a statement calling on the military to “uncover those behind the irresponsible rocket fire that threatens Lebanon’s stability and security”.The new Lebanese government, elected after the signing of the ceasefire, has made disarming the non-state militia a priority.In Gaza, whereIsraelresumed its military operation on 18 March, shattering the relative calm of a January ceasefire with Hamas, the aid group World Central Kitchen said an Israeli airstrike killed one of its volunteers near a facility distributing meals to besieged Palestinians. The strike wounded six other people, the US-based charity said.World Central Kitchen said it would continue to operate its field kitchens “where possible, based on daily assessments”. It did not give the location of the strike and the Israeli military did not immediately comment.The UN Human Rights Office accused Israel on Friday of violating international law by forcibly displacing Palestinians in Gaza under “mandatory evacuation orders”.The Israeli army has issued what the UN described as 10 mandatory evacuation orders, which ‘‘fail to comply with the requirements of international humanitarian law”, the body’s spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said in a statement on Friday.Israel’s permanent mission to Geneva said it was operating in accordance with international humanitarian law. “Israel is evacuating civilians to protect them from Hamas terrorists, who relentlessly use them as human shields in a blatant violation of international law,” the mission said.Explore more on these topicsLebanonIsraelHezbollahMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Since Brexit, it has been impossible for British eel fishers to export glass eels to restocking projects in EU countries, but a loophole made it permissible to catch and export elvers to non-EU destinations in their natural European range if they were used for conservation purposes, such as restocking lakes or rivers.Wood said a ban on eel exports to Russia would stop the traditional fishery on the River Severn because there were no other markets to export to.“It is absolutely devastating,” said Wood. “All my team are going to lose their jobs. This will be hundreds of years of heritage and culture gone.”A Defra spokesperson said: “We have robust rules and laws in place to safeguard protected species, including glass eels, and any applications to export them are rigorously assessed to ensure they are legal and sustainable.“This application for the export of glass eels has been refused over concerns of significant risks of illegal trading compounded by the current situation in Russia.”More than 55,000 peoplesigned a petitioncalling for an end to the export of elvers to Russia following an outcry after the Guardian revealed plans toincrease the Kaliningrad exportamount to five tonnes.Wood said the restocking project in Kaliningrad was a legitimate conservation project and preventing it would also stop his facility’s contribution to UK restocking projects. “Fishermen are very generous. They’ve provided the glass eels and we provide the facilities to do it. All that is going to come to an end,” he said.Andrew Kerr, chair of the Sustainable Eel Group, welcomed the government decision, saying the focus for eel conservation should be on restocking English and Welsh rivers from the glass eel surplus in the Bristol Channel.“It’s a much better use of the precious natural resource that they should migrate up the Severn than be sent to Russia. This means that the future is conservation elvering for [UK] restocking programmes,” he said.Young elvers enter river systems and spend years developing before migrating to the Sargasso Sea, in the Atlantic Ocean, to reproduce. But no English or Welsh river is close to meeting its “eel escapement target” – the number of mature silver eels that successfully get out to sea.Removing barriers such as weirs – or building fish passes around them – is one way to help eels, but moving glass eels from estuaries to suitable habitat upriver is another way to increase populations.Explore more on these topicsEndangered speciesConservationRussiaFishRiversWildlifeBrexitnewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday at a summit in Paris, European leaders led by France and the UK reiterated their support forVolodymyr Zelenskyyand Ukraine.Few experts consider the Russian demand that Ukraine holds elections to be realistic, but the Kremlin has tried to highlight Kyiv’s decision not to hold a presidential poll while the war continues as a precondition for achieving a final settlement, as US-brokered peace negotiations proceed slowly.On Tuesday, the White House announced that Ukraine and Russia had agreed to maritime and energy infrastructure ceasefires – but both sides claimed there were fresh violations on Friday as the land war continued unabated.In Ukraine, the governor of Poltava region said storage sites for spare parts used by gas supplier Naftogaz were struck by a Russian drone. Russia’s ministry of defence said a gas metering station in the border village of Sudzha in Kursk province had been struck by US-made Himars missiles.Ukraine’s general staff said the attack in Poltava showed that “the Russian aggressor cynically continues to lie about its aspirations for peace” – while Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “The Ukrainian armed forces aren’t following orders from the country’s leadership”.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said it was premature to expect fresh higher level talks between the US and Russia to try to achieve a breakthrough. Asked by a reporter as he flew back from a tour of the Caribbean, he said before that, “I think you have to make more progress on a technical level”.Ukrainian officials also confirmed on Friday that the US had revised a proposed deal for the jointexploitation of minerals and rare earthsin the country amid briefings that the new terms were dramatically more favourable to the US.The new proposal stipulates that a joint investment fund be set up and the US would be given the first option to buy resources extracted until it recoups the aid money it has given Ukraine plus 4% interest. Only after that could Ukraine access the fund’s profits.A previous proposal, which Zelenskyy had travelled to the US to sign with Trump before he was dragged into arow with the US leader in the Oval Office, had proposed a 50/50 split.Yuliia Svyrydenko, Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, would not be drawn into a detailed discussion of the suggested terms, telling the country’s parliament that a public debate would harm the country’s position.But she confirmed a US proposal had been received and Ukraine was formulating its response. “This is a working version that essentially reflects the position of the American legal advisers. We are forming our own position, and the process is currently formalised,” she told legislators.The pressure group Global Witness said the US demands were extreme. Dominic Kavakeb, a co-director of campaigns, described the reported terms as “the pure, unabashed exploitation of Ukraine as the price to avoid total devastation at the hands of Putin. This is neo-colonialism laid bare.”Ukraine suspended elections when it introduced martial law after Russia’s full scale invasion in February 2022. Zelenskyy’s five-year term was supposed to end last May, but a vote is not expected to be held until security conditions allow – and there is little public pressure to have one.Russia, where presidential elections are heavily managed and not considered to be free or fair, has been highlighting the democratic hiatus in Ukraine as a talking point in its favour as initial US-brokered peace talks have begun.At times a similar position has been adopted by Trump, who last monthdescribed Zelenskyy as a “dictator”with a 4% approval rating, although a poll from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology published in early March put the figure at 68%.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinUS foreign policyDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Pro-democracy and republican groups held a counter-protest that passed peacefully.The pro-royalist movement is calling for the return of Gyanendra Shah, who was Nepal’s last reigning monarch and still has a loyal following in the country.Support for the pro-monarchy movement has surged recently as Nepal grapples with ongoing political and economic instability that has led to widespread dissatisfaction with the government.Friday’s protests took a violent turn after pro-royalists broke through police barricades and began throwing stones at officers. The police responded by firing teargas into the crowds and shooting rubber bullets and live ammunition into the air.View image in fullscreenAn injured protester lies on the ground.

Several political party headquarters were vandalised, as were the offices of a prominent newspaper and a TV news channel.The police spokesperson Shekhar Khanal said 17 people had been arrested so far. “When the protesters tried to force their way past the restricted area, the police had no choice but to use teargas. Following this, the protesters then resorted to vandalism and arson,” he said.One protester was killed in the clashes and pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. A journalist was killed when a building was set alight.The government declared a curfew in areas of the capital and security personnel were deployed on the streets. Nepal’s prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the security situation.Royalist protesters claimed the police had acted first against the protesters. “Right now, we are not demanding the return of the monarchy, we are advocating for the institution of the monarchy,” said Ravi Shrestha, who was among the protesters. “The situation escalated beyond control because of police suppression.”The protests were the largest since 2023 and demonstrated the growing base of support for the return of the king in Nepal. Earlier this month, upwards of 10,000 supporters gathered at Kathmandu airport to celebrate Gyanendra’s arrival in the capital, with cries of “bring back our monarch”.View image in fullscreenRoyalists rally on the streets in Kathmandu.Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/Getty ImagesIn a statement before the protests, the committee for the restoration of monarchy emphasised they were calling for the return of a “constitutional monarchy” that would coexist with the democratic government and would have a “parental role above politics”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was crowned in 2001 after most of his family were killed in a mass shooting at their home, and initially ruled as more of a ceremonial head of state, with no executive powers. But, in 2005,he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and jailing politicians. He declared a state of emergency and deployed the army to run the country.After massive protests rocked the country,he was forced to hand over the governing of the countryto a democratically elected government in 2006. In 2008, the parliament voted to abolish the monarchy altogether.In the years since, Nepal has experienced continuing political instability, with weak coalition governments regularly only lasting a matter of months before being toppled, and senior politicians being engulfed in corruption scandals. Anger at the political system has been steadily rising, and this has been capitalised on by the pro-monarchy movement.Sunita Chudal, from Jhapa, was among those who protested for the abolition of the monarchy in 2006, and recalled shouting slogans in the streets calling Gyanendra a thief. Now she is among those calling for his return.“I have joined this movement, not because I believe the king will return and make things better, but because of the way corruption and degradation have increased in the country, and how our children are being forced to migrate abroad,” she said.“I am so disillusioned that I had no choice but to take to the streets.”Explore more on these topicsNepalSouth and central AsiaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

But Harlingen is strong. We have faced adversity before and we will get through this together,” Mayor Norma Sepulveda said at a Friday afternoon news conference.In Alamo, the police and fire department responded to more than 100 water rescues, including people stranded in their vehicles and trapped in their homes, the fire department chief, RC Flores, said at a news conference on Friday afternoon.Officials estimated a couple of hundred homes in Alamo were flooded by the heavy rainfall.Flores said Alamo was one of many cities in the Rio Grande valley in southTexasthat were flooded and had damage from Thursday’s thunderstorms – but that all were working to help their residents.“I assure the public that we are assessing the situation on the hour, every hour. We’re constantly going out, not just in our city,” Flores said. “Just because the storm is over, it doesn’t mean that the emergencies and the disaster is over. We are going to continue to work as long as we need to.”Weslaco’s mayor, Adrian Gonzalez, said his city was inundated with about 14in of rain, prompting 30 to 40 water rescues of stranded motorists and residents trapped in their homes by rising floodwaters.“It’s a historic rainstorm and it’s affecting all the valley, not just Weslaco. It’s just so much water in a short period of time,” Gonzalez told reporters at a news conference.Television news footage from flooded communities in south Texas showed multiple waterlogged cars abandoned on streets on Thursday and drivers waiting on sidewalks for the floodwaters to recede.View image in fullscreenMuch of Primera in Cameron county is seen underwater on Friday.Photograph: APBetween 6in and 12in of rain fell in many parts of south Texas in the past 24 hours, according to the National Weather Service.In neighboring Cameron county, officialsaskedthe governor,Greg Abbott, to declare a disaster for the county after more than 17in of rain caused significant flooding.“The rainfall amounts we received have been record-setting, and not in a good way. All county resources are being utilized right now, and we are assisting in all ways possible,” the Cameron county judge, Eddie Treviño Jr, the county’s top elected official, said in a Facebook post.Valley international airport in Harlingen was closed on Friday and all flights were canceled due to area flooding.“We are working tirelessly to reopen and focused on ensuring safety,” airport officials said in a statement.Trump’s ‘climate’ purge deleted a new extreme weather risk tool.

One shelter had been opened in Weslaco and officials in Harlingen had opened the city’s convention center as a shelter.More than 20 south Texas school districts and college campuses canceled classes on Friday due to the severe weather and flooding.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherTexasUS-Mexico borderFloodingExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on its website that 97% of the confirmed cases this year so far involved people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccine status was unknown – and 75% of the cases this year have affected people under the age of 19.The CDC said that there had been one death confirmed from measles this year and one under investigation as connected to the viral infection.The main outbreak this year has been inTexas, withlethal consequences. The state health department has reported 400 measles cases in Texas as of 28 March.Meanwhile the New Mexico health department on Friday reported that there were currently 44 cases of measles in the state, up from its previous count of 43 cases on 25 March.Most of the cases were reported in Lea county, which is adjacent to Gaines county in Texas, which is considered the center of the current measles outbreak that began in late January across the two states.In recent years, federal health officials have attributed some outbreaks to parents refusing to vaccinate children.The CDC said in a health advisory to doctors on 7 March that the risk for widespread measles in the US remains low.The US health secretary,Robert F Kennedy Jr, who for years has sown doubts about the safety and efficacy of immunization despite evidence about its safety and efficacy widely accepted by public authorities, said last month that he recognized the serious impact of the current measles outbreak in Texas.He added that the government was providing resources, including vaccines.But theNew York Times reportedearlier this week that some children are suffering complications including liver damage because they have been given huge doses of vitamin A at home, without medical supervision, a therapeutic idea promoted by vaccines skeptics, including Kennedy.The 20 jurisdictions affected this year are Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York state, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Washington state.The CDC said on its website that the agency was aware of probable measles cases being reported by jurisdictions but the data referred to on its website, such as the number of cases so far being 483, only includes confirmed cases.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS healthcareMMRTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

Hundreds of guests are expected, possibly even the US president, Donald Trump.Far from decrying overtourism, which has intensified in Venice in the 11 years since the Clooneys’ big day, leading to the introduction last year of anaccess chargefor pesky day-trippers, Luigi Brugnaro, the city’s mayor, publicly thanked Ceron for luring the couple. “The event will have economic repercussions worth millions of euros for our city,” he told the Veneto edition ofCorriere della Sera.But not everyone sees it that way.“It’s going to be a great big nuisance,” said Francesca, a tour guide. “I think most people are of the same opinion. We are exasperated by a whole series of problems related to overtourism and this is the umpteenth thing foisted on the city that we have to suffer.”The Clooney wedding was also a nuisance for Francesca because it caused “a lot of confusion and was impossible to move around”, but the actor and his bride, a human rights barrister, were well liked. “They were very kind, and easy-going, they perhaps seemed less invasive,” she said. “We have no idea what kind of behaviour to expect from this lot.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Clooney and Amal Clooney on the way to their wedding in Venice in 2014.Photograph: Robino Salvatore/GC ImagesThose rumoured to be on the guest list include Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Eva Longoria, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Orlando Bloom and his fiancee, Katy Perry. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, have also reportedly been invited. Bezos and Sánchez had front-row seats at Trump’s inauguration in January, meaning his attendance is highly possible too.It is unclear where exactly the wedding will take place, although it could be held at the Doge’s Palace, which was the seat of power during Venice’s years as a republic.Giusi Giudice, another tour guide, said Venice was used to hosting big events and with everyone earning from the occasion, she was unable to grasp why people were complaining. “Are they just envious of the rich? It didn’t seem to matter with the Clooneys, but here we have a billionaire who is a Trumpian and so is maybe perceived as less pleasant,” she said.View image in fullscreenGeorge Clooney travelling in a taxi boat a few days before his wedding.Photograph: Stefano Rellandini/ReutersMatteo Secchi, who leads Venessia.com, a residents’ activist group, said everyone, “whether rich or poor”, was welcome to Venice. “However, what bothers us is that we bend over backwards because a rich guy is coming. We are the city that sells itself to the highest bidder.”The social media accounts of Venezia Non è Disneyland (Venice Isn’t Disneyland), a group set up by young Venetians with the aim of sensitising visitors to the city, were filled with comments in response to the Bezos nuptials, with one person joking that tariffs should be imposed on weddings inEurope. “We are waiting for more details before making an official comment,” said one of the activists from the group. “But the city hosted Pope Francis [last year]. Therefore I think we can tolerate this kind of wedding too.”Explore more on these topicsVeniceEuropeJeff BezosItalyWeddingsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Uberto Pasolini likes to say he has been thinking about adapting The Odyssey for 30 years – 10 years longer than it took Odysseus to win the Trojan war. A nephew of the director Luchino Visconti, the 67-year-old Italian film-maker has lived in London for 50 years. Pasolini, who won a Bafta for producing The Full Monty, first approachedRalph Fiennesto play Odysseus in 2011, after the actor had made his directorial debut with Coriolanus, believing Fiennes might also be able to direct the film.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.They got as far as a location scout in Turkey, where Fiennes, then about to play Prospero ina Trevor Nunn production of The Tempest, practised his “Such stuff as dreams are made on” speech in an abandoned outdoor amphitheatre at dusk. “It was me and two goats,” recalls Pasolini over a video chat. “I get the hair sticking up on the nape of my neck just thinking about it. It was amazing.” Wearing glasses and with a distinguished-looking beard, he comes across like a voluble Italian academic.View image in fullscreenUberto Pasolini on set for the shooting of his 2013 film Still Life.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyReturning from the trip, Fiennes told him: “I can’t do both. I’d love to play Odysseus, but I can’t also direct.” Undeterred,Pasolinisays he kept on “benignly nagging” the actor about the project whenever they met. Then, in 2022, as Fiennes toured England’s regional theatres with a recital of TS Eliot’s Four Quartets, Pasolini had dinner with the actor in Plymouth.They again talked about their planned adaptation of The Odyssey. Fiennes thought Pasolini should direct it himself. This time, it was the Italian’s turn to demur. “I can’t direct it,” he replied. “This is much bigger than anything else I’ve done.” But Fiennes, who had seen Pasolini’s films Machan and Still Life, pushed him to take up the reins of the project. “But what do we do about Penelope?” asked Pasolini. “It should be Juliette, of course,” said Fiennes.View image in fullscreenFiennes as Odysseus and Binoche as Penelope in The Return.Photograph: Maila Iacovelli“Juliette” wasJuliette Binoche, Fiennes’ co-star in Anthony Minghella’s Oscar-winning The English Patient and, before that, Wuthering Heights. “We have a very deep friendship from those two parts, even though we don’t spend that much screen time together,” says Fiennes, also over video call. He delivers thoughtful answers in his soft, limpid cadence, weirdly reminiscent of the fur on a peach, or maybe the plums Binoche fed him in The English Patient.An approach was made to the French actor, then she and Fiennes met in Georgia, where Fiennes was filming The Menu and Binoche was shooting The Staircase for HBO. Fiennes bought Binoche a copy of Emily Wilson’s translation of The Odyssey; the pair took a selfie and sent it to Pasolini. Binoche was in. “I was emotional, actually,” says Fiennes. “Juliette has very strong instincts about what she will or won’t do. So when she said yes, there was a wonderful sense of completion.”The finished film, The Return, was shot in two months in Corfu and just north of Rome for $20m – a fraction of the$250m Christopher Nolan has reportedly got to spendon his version of The Odyssey. The two adaptations are diametrically opposed. Featuring no gods, monsters, sirens, cyclops or six-headed monsters, Pasolini’s film compacts the last nine books of Homer’s epic poem into a film as lean and sinewy as its hero.View image in fullscreenLost soul … Fiennes in The Return.Photograph: Fabio Zayed/Maila IacovelliFiennes’ Odysseus is a lost soul returning from 20 years of war, who washes up on the shore of his homeland, Ithaca, unrecognisable to his family, deeply ashamed of the “butchery” he practised on the streets of Troy and carrying guilt that he returns alone, his men all dead. He seems to accept the defacement of his kingdom – where his wife, Penelope, is beset by suitors – almost as a punishment. This is a homecoming as if from the modern theatre of war, be it Vietnam or Ukraine.“We did do one very specific thing with the script, which is taking out the gods,” says Pasolini, who commissioned a screenplay with the writers Edward Bond and John Collee that was steeped in modern accounts of war. “It was important to us that the guilt that comes out of the wars and his dead companions, that pain, was his own doing.” It was all there in Homer’s poem, where Odysseus cries “as a woman weeps” when recounting the siege of Troy – but a line in which Fiennes’ Odysseus describes Troy as a city that “could not be conquered, only destroyed” was taken from an American captain describing the destruction of the city of Huế during the Vietnam war. That speech was pivotal for Fiennes, who loves playing men enmeshed in the workings of their own conscience, be they the adulterousMaurice Bendrix in The End of the Affair, orCardinal Lawrence in Conclave. Even his monsters, like Coriolanus, are moral self-auditors.“I am probably drawn to roles where [there is a] sort of undecided space in someone, where there’s a question mark about who they are and what they’re doing,” says the actor. He says his mother read him the adventures of Odysseus when he was a child, but he found the text, particularly in Wilson’s translation, had grown with him when he returned to it.“Is Odysseus good? Essentially, he’s gone to war and done terrible things to people, and what I got from this script is he carries that on his shoulders. So, he’s not overtly a Greek hero, but he’s trying to claim something. I think the key for this is the scene where he talks around the fire about what it was to destroy Troy. I’ve not been through a war, obviously, but I was 60 when I did this,” says Fiennes, now 62. “The bulk of your life is lived. I think a sense of fatigue with life, or a sense of: ‘Well, what’s left now?’ comes to us as we get a bit older. ‘What does it all mean?’ You ask these bigger existential questions and I think all that bled into the imaginative leap I had to make. Even if you haven’t been in wars, that sense of the weight of the past – you can intuit that better.”View image in fullscreenFiennes as Cardinal Lawrence in Conclave.Photograph: Courtesy of Focus Features. © 2024 All Rights Reserved/APAt the same time, there is an unmistakable buoyancy to Fiennes these days. The piercing, icy blue stare is still there, but the “nimbus of depression and intensity around him” that theplaywright David Hare detected25 years ago appears to have lifted, as demonstrated bythe show-stopping dancearound a villa to the Rolling Stones’ Emotional Rescue in Luca Gaudagnino’s 2015 A Bigger Splash. Or his more recent rendition of the influencer Jools Lebron’s viral TikTok “demure” speech (“See my shirt? Only a little chichi out …”) for CNN’s New Year’s Eve broadcast was one of the highlights of the recent Oscar season. “I started off slightly uncomfortable about the way actors are expected to present themselves repeatedly on the red carpet and at events,” says Fiennes of the three-month stretch from the release of Conclave at the end of November to the Oscars ceremony this month. “I think maybe I’ve just got a bit more relaxed about all that.”Italian directors seem to have acted as midwives to the newfound physicality of Fiennes’s performances – after the sun-kissed luxuriance of Guadagnino’s film, the lean sinew of Pasolini’s, for which Fiennes underwent five months of physical training to get the muscular yet wiry frame of Odysseus. “Uberto was very clear. He didn’t want me to have a sort of bulked-up gym body,” says Fiennes, who told his personal trainer, Dan Avasilcai: “He should look like a bit of old rope.” Then, two and a half months before shooting, he embarked on a regime of weight-training and running and a diet rich in proteins, complex carbohydrates and vegetables to lose pretty much all the fat he had on his body. Pasolini says: “At the beginning, I have to confess, I was slightly suspicious that there was so much protein going in and so much exercise that we would have a body that looked exercised instead of a body that was consumed, a lived body. There is no gym in ancient Greece.”In Corfu, they found forests of olive trees 30 metres high, with trunks of dark bark, that spoke to the agedness they were after. “We were very interested in the simplicity of the elements,” says the director. “So, rain and water and sand and soil and fire and blood. More than anything else, it’s a spiritual and psychological journey that he’s been on. The physicality that Ralph was able to bring to the film is the physicality of somebody who has suffered and travelled and is scarred and is dried by the sun and consumed by living in a way that maybe 20 years ago would have been more difficult. The guilt and the responsibility of war would have sat on Ralph’s shoulders and in his soul and in his eyes in a similar way. But I think we were lucky to make it when we did. He brings more to the role because of the life he’s lived.”View image in fullscreenA very deep friendship … Fiennes with Binoche in the 1992 film Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Paramount Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe scenes with Binoche, in particular, enjoy the resonance of a friendship that spans nearly three decades. Fiennes recalls the first scene they shot together on The Return, where Odysseus and Penelope first meet in a temple. Penelope seems to see through Odysseus’s disguise as a beggar, but does not confront her husband, so horrified is she by his self-dereliction. “Juliette was so extraordinary,” he says. “The depth of remorse and frustration and anguish she suggests were just extraordinary to witness.”They shot the scene over two nights. Pasolini says: “There was a certain strange tension and emotion on set that had to do with the reconnection of these two individuals who had been away from one another for so long.

It’s a show that looks a million bucks and probably cost far more: at a time when American gameshows areflying contestants to Irelandto save on filming costs, The Studio shoots at notoriously pricey LA locations like Sunset Boulevard, the Chateau Marmont and Warner Bros Studios.All this glitz is in service to a series that manages to be both a love letter to Hollywood, and a “must do better” report card. The setting is Continental Studios, a fictional old Hollywood giant in the style of Universal or Warner Bros that is experiencing turbulence in the streaming age. Rogen plays Matt Remick, a newly installed studio head who dreams of making great art. But instead he and his underlings (a great supporting cast that includes Kathryn Hahn, Ike Barinholtz and Catherine O’Hara) find themselves dragged down by the worst aspects of a flailing industry: a focus on empty brand IP over real stories; budget balancing over creativity; and even some gentle dabbling in AI. All of which might make the show sound like a bit of slog, but it’s often a (stressful) hoot, full of sight gags, slapstick comedy and one very Seth Rogen-ish subplot about a horror movie where zombies infect people through diarrhoea.The Studio is very starry, perhaps off-puttingly so for some viewers. Each episode features at least one – and often multiple – celebrities playing themselves. These range from arthouse darlings (director Sarah Polley and Past Lives’ Greta Lee in a belting episode satirising Hollywood’s love of a “single take” scene) to A-listers (Zac Efron and Charlize Theron) to, on the highest tier of all, Martin Scorsese. The effectiveness of these appearances varies: occasionally they seem to detract from the show’s compelling core quartet, but at their best – and for the most part – they add a generous coating of special sauce to what is already a delicious, drum-tight Hollywood satire.View image in fullscreenSeth Rogen, left, and Catherine O’Hara in a scene from The Studio.Photograph: APThe Studio’s fondness for a celeb cameo makes it a bit of an outlier in TV at the moment. While the guest spot isn’t dead by any means (as anyone who saw Bradley Cooper’s slightly stilted appearanceon Abbott Elementarylast year will know), it feels like the era of the cameo-stuffed show – think Extras, Entourage, Curb Your Enthusiasm and 30 Rock – has largely been and gone.That period, stretching from the mid 00s to the end of last decade, was a crazy and thrilling time when a galaxy of stars – actors, world leaders, David actual Bowie – would rock up unannounced on your screen. But for all the glitz and glam, what marked out many of the shows of that era was the willingness of its guest stars to get dirty, playing grotesque exaggerations of their public personae. It made for, at times, wildly entertaining TV – but by the end of that era, such public abasement was losing its shock value. After all, when you’ve got Liam Neeson appearing in Atlantasending up his commentsaboutwanting to kill a black man, there aren’t many more boundaries for a celeb guest spot to push.At the same time there’s a feeling that audiences have become dulled to the other type of A-lister appearance: the one where a megastar turns up out of nowhere on a workaday sitcom and acts all understated and normal while everyone around them shrieks with excitement (The Purple One’s appearance on New Girlis the apotheosis of this style of cameo). There’s an inescapable sense of self-importance attached to the act of playing yourself – and we live in a time of markedlylow tolerance for celebrity self-importance. The stock of traditional Hollywood celebrities is lower than it has been in decades. So if an A-lister canno longer “open” a movie, guaranteeing ticket sales, why would their presence automatically lift a TV show?Given all that, what’s interesting about The Studio’s star turns, and what makes the best of them work, is that they gently reckon with this insecurity of the modern-day movie star. Performances tend towards the craven or cynical: actor-directors using underhand tricks to extend their shoots, or starlets publicly declaring that awards don’t matter while secretly masterminding an entire awards season of carefully calibrated tearful speeches. There’s an “arranging deckchairs on the Titanic” feel to all this: petty industry power plays being made while the iceberg advances.Still, my favourite of The Studio’s guest appearances has little to do with industry satire. Instead it owes a lot to the stoner comedies of Rogen’s early career. It’s Zoe Kravitz, playing herself high as a kite on the morning of an important studio presentation, after Rogen’s studio head, in an attempt to be a cool, relatable boss, accidentally gives her a dangerously large dose of mushroom chocolate. As Kravitz flails and gurns and giggles, it underscores the simple pleasure of the celebrity cameo: watching an impossibly famous person making a bit of a prat of themselves. That’s something that, even as the industry contracts and changes, will never get old.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The winner of the Nobel prize for literature in 1920 is described by the London Review Bookshop as “a disturbing and darkly humorous masterpiece of existential fiction”, leaving many questioning if it mirrors Lochlan’s own deepening identity crisis.View image in fullscreenParker Posey’s character’s choice of F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Beautiful and the Damned is apt.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOMeanwhile, his mother, Victoria, played byParker Posey, has been reading F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Beautiful and the Damned. Regarded as a meditation on money, power and excess, the novel seems apt for the status-obsessed lorazepam addict who is seemingly oblivious to her husband’s breakdown.The White Lotus ‘goes too far’: Duke University unhappy over their prominence in showRead moreThese type of details are known as “Easter eggs” – the term used in pop culture for covert messages plantedwithin TV shows, films, music and video games. They arewidely used by the popstar Taylor Swift, with her fans deciphering everything from lyrics to jewellery.The White Lotus creator, Mike White, has long been a fan of the technique. In the second series, for example, thetesta dimorobusts warn of a lover’s doomed fate, while a floral dress from the 1972 film The Godfather foreshadows the fate of Jennifer Coolidge’s Tanya. The characters’ holiday reads have played a key part in previous series. Jack Edwards, a social media influencer who describes himself as “the internet’s librarian” says that BookTok – a corner of TikTok devoted to reading – particularly enjoys discovering them. “It feels quite rewarding. I like that Mike White wants us to slow down and linger, giving us time to theorise and delve into the mise en scène.”View image in fullscreenSurrounded by Narcissists, the book choice of Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), is more on the nose than other reading choices.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOIn the new series, Chelsea (played by Aimee Lou Wood) is seen leafing through a book of poems by Rumi – the 13th-century Persian poet whose works explore love and spiritual reflection – as she lounges by the pool of a luxury hotel in Thailand’s Koh Samui. It’s fitting for a star-sign obsessed 24-year-old who believes her shady 50-year-old boyfriend, Rick (Walton Goggins), who is visibly irritated by her presence, is her “soulmate”.Meanwhile, the dynamic of the three female friends on a group holiday is writ large in their reading choices.Laurie (Carrie Coon) is reading Emma Straub’s Modern Lovers, a novel about a trio of friends grappling with ageing; the TV star Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) has brought along Barbra Streisand’s 992-page memoir to read by the pool; and perhaps most revealingly, the newly outed Trump voter Kate (Leslie Bibb) just scrolls on her phone. Other choices such as Belinda’s (Natasha Rothwell) book, Surrounded by Narcissists, are a little more on the nose.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it’s my factory setting!’ Natasha Rothwell on taking The White Lotus by stormRead moreMichael Cory, the props master on season three, says he and White worked together on choosing the titles. White suggested Hunger for Lochlan and Outlive, a book about longevity, for his father, Timothy (Jason Isaacs), a man facing financial ruin.“Once the actors arrived, we would meet to discuss all the little details that make up their characters and it became much easier to see the whole person,” Cory says. “The Beautiful and Damned, I originally intended for Jaclyn, but it ended up being perfect for Victoria, andThe Lonely Cityby Olivia Laing [a book about isolation and creativity] was bought for Laurie but we ended up giving it to Piper [Ratliff, an aspiring Buddhist].”Some of the books were made by the props team including those by the fictional monk Luang Por Terra and the resort owner, Sritala Hollinger. “Mike loved the idea of creating Sritala’s book Glowing so that she would leave a copy in Jaclyn’s room,” says Cory. “We not only created the fake cover but one of the Thai producers wrote part of the book itself.”In fact, the books are so pivotal to characterisation that not every one is even in shot. Cory says one title would have given too much away about a character “but it makes me happy knowing it’s in their bag”.Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusTelevisionDramaFictionPoetryUS televisionHBOfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Abracadabra! There’s barely a trad circus trick missed in this one-woman puppet show, first seen in 2022, with its red and gold trimmings, accordions a-go-go and Tardis-like top hat. That vintage vibe, perfectly suiting the atmospheric Little Angel, includes the performing animals introduced by George the ringmaster (Lizzie Wort, who co-wrote and devised with director Miranda Pitcher).We behold lions, tigers and monkeys that George says – a little too nostalgically – once did stunts with the show. They have been replaced by jumping fleas and playful mice although this reformed spectacle with pet-friendlier tricks rather queers its pitch by then including bunnies who apparently ride bikes. The big finale is a canine spin on aSavitsky Cats-style routine.Aimed at children aged two to five, it’s a jaunty, 45-minute whirl boosted by some lively rhymes, Wort’s warm approach (matched by Sherry Coenen’s lighting) and a bouncy score from Julian Butler. Neither this circus’s hazy backstory nor the trifling plot pull you in: it’s about the carousel of acts, most featuring attractive puppets designed by Lyndie Wright (including a cheery clown) and some involving participation from the audience. Wort does particularly well with one young volunteer who appears to have second thoughts when in the spotlight.View image in fullscreenWarm welcome … Lizzie Wort in Little Angel Theatre’s Miniature Travelling Circus.Photograph: Ellie KurttzThe attention to detail impresses: a ruffing dog wearing a ruff, the sparkly eyed Miss Scratchy Cat with a luxuriously fluffed-up tail, a stamped addressed envelope handed to an audience member with a flea in their hair, for them to return the insect at their leisure. Some of the designs are too teeny to fully appreciate, at least from my row, but there is a marvellous big top that pops up inside a book, designed by Vicki Fullick, and a carefully strung thread of mini-bunting. Pitcher’s set and costume design have a bygone charm and, while it lacks a real wow moment, this whimsical show has plenty of nice touches.At theLittle Angel theatre, London, until 19 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreCircusPuppetryLittle Angel theatreMagicChildren's theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The answer, according to developer Rebellion, is that it would be considerably more picturesque and feature loads of pasties. Aping the nuclear catastrophe fiction of series such asFalloutandStalker, Atomfall offers a mildly diverting scientific whodunit. But it struggles to muster the same clear identity of the games that inspired it.Using the 1957 Windscale fire as its launchpad, Atomfall thrusts you into a postwar Britain where that accident was dramatically worse, prompting the government to send in the army before walling off a large portion of the Lake District, sealing everybody inside. Your character, an archetypal video game amnesiac, awakes inside the exclusion zone several years later. To escape, they must unravel the mystery behind what caused the disaster, who is responsible and how to fix it.This mystery, and how it unfolds, are by far the most interesting parts of Atomfall. The story reframes conventional quests as “leads”, where points of interest are revealed by collecting documents such as letters and military reports, and speaking to the surviving locals in the zone. At the heart of the enigma is a vast underground research facility, which you must reactivate by unlocking its entrances and locating atomic batteries to power its various sectors, ultimately unlocking the heart of Windscale and the dark secret kept inside.View image in fullscreenWicker Man-esque … Atomfall.Photograph: RebellionIt’s a tale that offers plenty of intrigue. The characters that assist you on your journey, including soldiers, scientists and a publican, have their own motivations for doing so, which you’ll only uncover by cross-referencing them with other players in Atomfall’s unspoken game of zones. These will often relate to diversions you’ll find along the way, such as infiltrating a castle occupied by Wicker Man-style druids to retrieve a special medicine and solving a quintessentially British murder in a church.Unpicking these threads is fun, and the tale benefits from a tighter focus and better pacing than most open-world adventures. Unfortunately, the accompanying game mechanics feel as if they turn up more from obligation than enthusiasm. Combat lets you choose between guns that are serviceable but unremarkable, and melee fighting that will make you appreciate every rusty firearm you collect. There is a rudimentary crafting system you’ll mostly use to make bandages and the occasional molotov cocktail. A stealth system exists in theory, but perhaps fittingly I never saw it function in any meaningful fashion. Enemies can spot you from half the map away and seem telepathically connected to nearby allies, which makes sneaking around awkward and unrewarding.It probably doesn’t help that it’s always a bright sunny day in Atomfall’s exclusion zone, which would be unusual for any part of the UK, let alone the Lake District. On the whole, it could make better use of its Cumbrian setting. Although Atomfall’s four maps are lavish and fun to explore, including craggy valleys filled with shells of dry-stone buildings, and the most meticulously recreated English village sinceEverybody’s Gone to the Rapture, the world is not especially atmospheric.Moreover, the enemy factions, druids and crazed marauders clad in cricket gear, feel like vague attempts to anglicise the kooky gangs of Fallout. Where are the feral ramblers, the roving bands of literati fighting over whether Wordsworth or Coleridge was the better poet? Why are pasties so abundant, while Kendal mint cake and Grasmere gingerbread are absent? This may seem flippant, but given we have recently seen such a brilliant lampoon of northern life inThank Goodness You’re Here!, Atomfall’s own depiction of the north, and indeed Britain in general, feels superficial and haphazard, a jumbled assemblage of cultural touchstones.To use another example, one of Atomfall’s key inspirations is Stalker, a series whose strength lies in how it is so specifically, uncompromisingly Ukrainian. Stalker and its sequels are completely unafraid to be weird, bold, challenging and bleak, to wholly envelop the player in its nation’s radioactive trauma. The UK simply doesn’t share that trauma in the same way, so Rebellion’s “what if” scenario can only ever be a shadow of Chornobyl.Atomfall is out now, £45Explore more on these topicsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

A genre swerve on the collab front, but all the while, Cunningham stays true to their own path as a creator of very formal, understated dance that invariably piques your curiosity.In Crow, Samson is installed behind a mixing desk on the vast Sadler’s Wells East stage, playing bubbling electronics, fizzy sounds and pulsating bass. Cunningham and dancer Harry Alexander meanwhile are dressed in long boots and short dresses, warming up with a strut. Crow is inspired by queer American composers Pauline Oliveros and Julius Eastman and a particular (undocumented) performance of theirs from the 1970s. Cunningham takes the idea of outsiders and marginalisation, and compares it to birds living in hostile urban spaces. At one stage the three performers gather and turn an inquisitive and accusatory stare on the audience; it is very much like being eyeballed by a gang of crows.With their mastery of the body’s geometry, their skill for the precision control of exacting choreography, Cunningham and Alexander are two of the most zen-like, brilliant dancers. You can see them watching each other, sometimes mirroring, sometimes chasing an idea round the stage. There’s bemusement and seriousness, rigour and play, details like the slide of a toe along the ground in sync with two falling quavers in the score that gives the effect of a question mark, or a raised eyebrow. It’s an avant-garde delight.Pigeons features five dancers and is set to Eastman’s 1980 piece Gay Guerilla, the sound of several pianos layering up the same chord. It’s music that expands and shifts while staying on the spot. The dancers, however, are always moving, in unison, canon or counterpoint; they cluster and part, like pigeons do, performing their very particular footwork, motoring on by their own logic. It’s mildly hypnotic. Cunningham was a longtime dancer with the legendary Merce Cunningham (no relation) and you can’t help but spot the link with Merce’s BeachBirds, performed last week as part of the Dance Reflections festival, just shifted into Jules’ own world, own time.AtSadler’s Wells East, London, until 28 March.

You’re likely to keep a vacuum cleaner for years, relying heavily on its ability to suck up dust, crumbs, mud, pet hair and any other dry spillages or sheddings that end up on your floor. Choosing the right model can be the difference between an effective cleaner that’s a delight to pull out of the cupboard and a dud that you dread having to unblock, detangle and clean after every use.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In this review, I took 10 of the leading cordless vacuum cleaners from a range of manufacturers and at various prices and inflicted the same cleaning tests on each one. That takes all the guesswork out of picking your next cleaner: I can tell you exactly which ones picked up the most mess.At a glanceBest cordless vacuum cleaner overall:Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251£369.91 at John LewisBest budget cordless vacuum cleaner:Vax HomePro Pet-Design£317 at AmazonBestcordless vacuum for deep cleaning:Dyson Gen5detect£649 at John LewisBest cordless vacuum for clean emptying:Henry Quick Pro£399 at AmazonBest handheld cordless vacuum cleanerDyson Car+Boat£199 at AOWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing technology and home products for more than 30 years. In the past few years, I’ve been a freelance writer specialising in testing vacuum cleaners. During that time I’ve tested more vacuum cleaners of various shapes, sizes and types than I’d care to count, from handheld helpers to heavy-duty dirt-shifters.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach vacuum was put to the test against flour, cat litter pellets and pet hair.Photograph: Andy ShawMost cordless vacuum cleaners are designed to work on carpet and hard floors, so I tested them all on both. To do this I weighed out spillages of flour, recycled wood cat litter pellets and pet hair. Flour and cat litter are easy enough to come by, but my dog doesn’t shed enough hair to test this many vacuums. So I’m also the proud owner of a box of sweepings from a friendly (but slightly bemused) local dog groomer.I gave each vacuum cleaner a chance to pick up as much of the spillages as possible, with a single push-forward and pull-backwards motion, and weighed the collection bins before and after.Most vacuums will collect more if given more chances to go over a mess, particularly from a different angle, but I wanted relatively tough tests that would truly differentiate one vacuum from another, so I allowed only a single sweep.I also tested the batteries by seeing how long it took them to run down from a full charge – at full suction and in each one’s most economical setting. I performed these tests with the floor head attached, where possible.Lastly, I tested the suction using a pressure gauge. While strong suction is useful, the cleaning tests were more important because other factors play a big part in the overall cleaning prowess. For example, a well-designed floor head can make a moderate sucker as good a cleaner as a more powerful model with an inferior brush or roller.All the machines I tested are being sent back to their manufacturers or donated to the British Heart Foundation.The best cordless vacuums in 2025View image in fullscreenThe lineup of test subjects.Photograph: Andy ShawBest overall cordless vacuum cleaner:Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw£369.91 at John Lewis£549.99 at CurrysIf there’s one thing that makes cordless vacuum cleaners a pain, it’s the emptying: taking it to the bin and jettisoning the debris after vacuuming. And, if your family is anything like mine, you may have to do it before you clean too because someone else didn’t bother to empty it. That won’t be the case with this Shark vacuum, though: it empties itself. It’s also very good at cleaning.Why we love itThe Shark IP3251 comes with a base station that operates as a stand and charging dock. When you rest the cordless vacuum cleaner on it, it springs into life, opening the base of the vacuum’s collection bin and sucking its contents into a larger container, leaving the cordless stick empty and ready for next time. The secondary bin has a volume of two litres, so can take a few empties of the 0.7-litre stick.That would all be pointless if the device itself wasn’t up to snuff, but it’s an excellent cleaner. Its floor head has a fluffy roller for hard floors and a brush bar for carpet, and it works well on both surfaces, performing a literal clean sweep in my tests.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty got to work on the flour, pet hair and cat litter.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …I found it worked better if I held it lower while vacuuming on some carpets, with fins on the base otherwise catching when I pulled it back.

It also performed well in all the tests.Why we love itIt’s comfortable to hold and use, and simple to operate, with just two large buttons – one to switch it on and the other to boost the power. Battery life is displayed by a light-up ring and lasted a decent 34 minutes in our rundown test.Emptying it is straightforward, too, with a button to open the collection bin, while a pump action lifts dirt off the filter, so you don’t have to poke your hands in. It’s one of the few cordless stick vacuums that can support itself when standing up, so there’s no need to find somewhere to lie it down between cleaning jobs.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Vax HomePro Pet-Design took to the floor to suck up the flour, cat litter and pet hair.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …the floor head is a basic single-brush bar, which is unsophisticated when compared with the alternatives you get on Shark and Dyson models.

It’s also the best, making short work of all my tests. If it’s any recommendation, it’s the vacuum cleaner I used to clean up any residual mess when I’d finished testing the other models.Why we love itAs with Shark, Dyson provides a soft roller for hard floors and a brush bar for carpets. However, it does this with two separate detachable floor heads, rather than rolling both into one. That means you have to switch heads each time you change surface, but it also means that they’re adept at their assigned roles.The hard-floor head has a green light that illuminates the dust on the floor as you clean. Not only can you see where you need to clean but also you can witness what a super job the roller does of vacuuming everything up. The carpet-floor head has an anti-tangle mechanism that combs it free of long hair as it rotates.A dusting brush and crevice tool are inside the extension wand, so you don’t have to seek them out when converting to handheld mode. It also comes with a mini motorised tool that’s perfect for lifting pet hair from upholstery or just cleaning the stairs.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Dyson Gen5detect tackled the flour, cat litter and pet hair.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …its screen is useful to indicate battery life but it also insists on counting how many particles of various sizes it’s collected – a feature no one asked for.Weight:3.5kgMax suction power (measured):31kPaBattery life (measured):56minsDust capacity:0.77lAdditional filters supplied?noBest cordless vacuum for clean emptying:Henry Quick ProView image in fullscreen£399 at Currys£399 at AmazonMost cordless sticks create a dust cloud when you deposit the contents of their collection bins into your dustbin. The Henry Quick Pro is the only cordless vacuum we’ve reviewed here that doesn’t do that because of its disposable dirt-capturing bags.Why we love itWe can’t emphasise this enough – it’s frustrating to vacuum the floor only to have the dust billowing out of your bin and back into the air when you empty it. With the Henry Quick Pro, you push a lever on the top and the base opens, jettisoning the bag of collected rubbish out of the bottom. It leaves no mess and has the added benefit of no filters to clean.In my tests, the Quick Pro performed decently enough, other than on hard floors with the cat litter, which it pushed ahead instead of sucking up. That job would be better tackled by removing the extension wand and using the device with a handheld attachment. It comes with a comprehensive selection of accessories, including a motorised mini head for stairs and upholstery, a flexible hose and a useful handle extension for taller users.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Henry Quick Pro tackled the flour and pet hair but left some of the cat litter behind.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …the bags have a plastic top that holds them in place inside the collection bin.

They also cost £1.30 per 1-litre bag.Weight:3.2kgMax suction power (measured):10.75kPaBattery life (measured):1hr 11minsDust capacity:1lAdditionalbags supplied?yes, six pods (bags)Best handheld cordless vacuum cleaner:Dyson Car+BoatView image in fullscreen£199 at AO£249.99 at John LewisDyson doesn’t manufacture a vacuum purely for handheld use, instead opting to repackage an existing cordless stick without the extension wand. The result is a handheld device so powerful that you may wish you could also use it on the floor.Why we love itThe Dyson Car+Boat is a cunning repackage of theDyson V8. That model is now the bottom of the range of Dyson’s regular cordless stick cleaners, but it makes for a handheld unit that performs above and beyond expectations.It comes with three key attachments: a mini motorised tool for upholstery and stairs; a crevice tool for gaps; and a combination dusting brush and funnel. It’s a powerful combo that cleaned up my test messes with aplomb. I had to use the funnel rather than the motorised tool to collect cat litter, though, because there’s no way this smaller device wouldn’t just push them ahead.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Dyson Car+Boat devoured the detritus on the mat.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …you can stillbuy the V8, with the extension tube and attachments, for a similar price. It also comes with Dyson’s old mini-motorised tool. Newer models come with a better-designed tool, which has a tapering roller that doesn’t trap longer hairs.

The AirFox is light and well-balanced enough to stand on its own, so you can leave it in the middle of the room while you do some dusting, and it won’t fall to the floor.The trigger needs to be held down to keep the vacuum running and while there is a trigger lock to keep it in place, it’s fiddly to use.

That’s largely thanks to the lack of additional features you get when compared with the likes of Shark and Dyson. It performed well in my cleaning tests but generally proved better on carpets than on hard floors.It operates in either floor or handheld mode. The floor head is basic, with a simple brush bar and no anti-tangle features. It comes with three handheld attachments – a crevice tool, a basic upholstery nozzle and a dusting brush.View image in fullscreenHow it started v how it’s going with the Miele Duoflex HX1 Total Care.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …emptying relies on gravity alone, so you end up having to poke your fingers into the collection bin to clear it out.

It’s useful, but possibly not useful enough to justify its higher-than-average cost.The overall build quality is excellent, though. I loved the spring-loaded filter clearing lever on the back, which means you can empty the collection bin in a smooth single-push motion rather than the banging and poking you have to do with most other vacuums. This lever can also compact the rubbish as you clean to reduce how often it needs emptying.

It’s light and petite but has small attachments, too, which aren’t large enough to pick up larger particles. It doesn’t collect dirt as well as the best vacuum cleaners here, but for a fraction of the price it does a reasonable job.The biggest problem was cat litter, which was sucking OK from the floor but caused a blockage after only a tiny amount had entered the collection bin. It was surprisingly proficient at flour on hard floors but failed to agitate my test carpet enough to replicate that success.

There’s no cable to unwind and no need to find a power socket – you just take the vacuum to the mess and get started.The downside is that they run on battery power. The batteries can last anywhere between an hour or so on light settings and down to a few minutes on full blast. They should last long enough to get around an average-size housein one go, but larger spaces might need a mid-clean charge, which can take a few hours (or an expensive extra battery).What should you look for in a cordless vacuum cleaner?All cordless vacuum cleaners will have a good go at your carpeted areas, but they work on hard floors, too. The best hard-floor models tend to come with a fluffy roller, which will be better at picking up dust from smooth surfaces, as well as a standard brush bar.One particularly good thing about cordless vacuums is that they tend to break down into handheld devices if you remove the extension wand. Check it comes with the attachments you require. If you have stairs you may like to look for a mini motorised tool, which is a bit like a miniature version of a regular floor head, ideal for vacuuming smaller areas, such as stairs and upholstery.Do cordless vacuums have good filtration systems?Yes, cordless vacuums quote high levels of filtration, with some claiming to trap even the tiniest of particles, such as pollen. However, emptying cordless vacuums that don’t use bags can create a messy dust cloud, so these may not be the models for you if you’re allergic to dirty particles. Filters also need regular cleaning, which is something you won’t be used to if you’re moving away from a vacuuming system that uses disposable bags.Andy Shaw is a freelance consumer journalist and technology addict.

Such as: can you really turn Korean kimchi into crisp fritters, in much the same way as the French make beignets with courgette flowers? Or can pork terrine, the centrepiece of any trad Frenchpique-nique, be served with a Koreanssamjang, or fermented soybeans and hot pepper? Some people may say: “Heck, no”, but Cálong’s chef/owner Joo Young Won would disagree.Won was head chef at Michelin-starredGalvin at Windowsfor seven years, where he served reassuringly expensive French classics to a moneyed, West End audience who appreciated the tablecloths, prompt service and 28th-floor views of London. Here at Cálong, however, he’s bringing those Euro-dining techniques and flexing them with Korean influences in a pretty but mainly practical room. Cálong, which is very much an independent restaurant, has clearly passed the sniff test with Stokey’s feisty anti-gentrification crowd, who love to gather outside aGail’sor a Nando’s and wield their Down With This Sort of Thingbanners. Then again, it’s hard to take offence at something that’s so wilfully niche as a man serving French-style pressed brawn withbossammooli, orhwangtae(dried pollock) croquettes with tartare sauce. This is not a Korean restaurant, but neither is itnota Korean restaurant. It is a melange, an experiment, a delicious, Korean-flecked hotch-potch.View image in fullscreenCálong’s ‘very good, crisp, thickly battered take’ on Korean fried chicken comes with sweet chilli and peanut.And, yes, kimchi can be turned into fritters, by the way. I know because I’ve eaten a large plate of them, and dipped them into a pleasingly fiery chilli mayo. To a less able cook, kimchi might prove a bit damp to batter and fry – after all, it’s like trying to do the same to coleslaw – but with Won’s ingenuity, these are just the right mix of funky, crisp and sating. At an earlier Cálong pop-up, he made kimchi risotto.Those dried pollock croquettes are also adorable: Alaskan pollock, frozen and dried in winter, which turns it a deep yellow (orhwang) shade, are mixed with fluffy potato, then breadcrumbed, fried and perched on a blob of tart, vibrant tartare. And, although there is nothing remotely groundbreaking about fried chicken with sweet chilli and peanut – fried chicken being fried chicken and all that – this was certainly a very good, crisp, thickly battered take.We lunched at Cálong on a Friday, half-expecting to be the only guests, because that’s the thing with semi-fancy neighbourhood restaurants: who on Earth uses them for lunch? Yet, by mid-service, every one of the dozen or so tables was full. Ladies lunching, gangs of friends, at least two dates. Then again, that’s the thing about gentrification: suddenly you’ve got folk who, at the drop of a hat, fancy a lunchtime onglet with mustard onions and greens for £26 with somesot bapfor a further £12 on the side. Sot bap, or Korean claypot rice, is slightly sticky and very fragrant, and at Cálong that day Won made it with earthy mushrooms and brown butter. It’s possibly not £12-worth of exciting, but we live in the land of the pricey side dish these days; a more humble side of winter leaves with pear in a soy vinaigrette was £6.View image in fullscreenCálong’s ‘incredibly good’ spicy seafoodjjamppongwith aïoli.We ordered that onglet, and it was nothing short of fantastic. Griddled to a copper brown outside and medium-rare within, it came flanked by some crunchy brassica leaves. Also incredibly good was seafoodjjamppongwith aïoli, which was a bit like a spicy bouillabaisse and resplendent with langoustine, mussels and squid, and a vibrant orange, garlicky emulsion with enough bite to make your forehead sweat.There’s an awful lot to like about Cálong; it’s a cool, calm, confident restaurant, staffed by a youngish crew who are clearly not industry veterans, but who certainly know the menu backwards. Those hints of Korea among all the Frenchness may be subtle and sometimes almost moot – for example, the stracciatella with butter beans, AKA a bowl of cheesy beans, had only the merest hint ofdoenjangpaste. But there’s still plenty enough spark, light, fire and crunch here to intrigue even Korean food enthusiasts.View image in fullscreen‘Genuinely delicious’: Cálong’s blood orange chocolate crémeux with roasted tea ice-cream.We finished with a blood orange chocolate crémeux, which was served sundae-style with layers of blood orange and a slightly bitter ice-cream made from roasted tea. Like so much else here, it seemed a strange idea that sounded as if it might just work, though at the same time perhaps wouldn’t, but in Won’s hands it turned out to be genuinely delicious. Cálong may not have panoramic views of the metropolis, but you can eat for half the price of Galvin and have a wander through Clissold Park and see the goat on the way home afterwards. In many ways, that’s just as good.Cálong35 Stoke Newington Church Street, London N16, 020-3561 4798. Open lunch Fri-Sun, noon-2.30pm (Sun 3.30pm); dinner Weds-Sat, 6.30-10.30pm.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Thanks to Reddit (a phrase I’ve broken the glass on more times than I’d care to admit), I’m aware thatLidl now sells soju. That makes three out of the big six selling Korea’s national drink, which is solid proof that supermarket buyers now feel that soju is popular enough to shift plenty of the stuff.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But I think it’s deserving of even more attention than that. Soju, meaning “burned liquor”, is a clear, rice-based distilled liquor that dates back to the Three Kingdoms period in ancient Korean history. It’s traditionally made from rice fermented withnuruk, a Korean grain-based starter but, due to staple food shortages, sweet potato and tapioca were later introduced to strengthen the alcohol.“Soju was a rather muddled and indistinct drink compared with its competitors,” says Marie Cheong-Thong, ofThe Larder at 36, who was recommended to me as a brilliantly knowledgable soju expert. “Shochu from Japan was cleaner, smoother and gave you fewer headaches, whereas China’s baijiu, with an ABV up to 53%, could ‘hit the spot’ cheaper and faster.”Soju is commonly drunk neat, well-chilled and straight from a shot glass; the bottle is also commonly shared – you pour for others using both hands and, according to tradition, you never pour your own.But, as ever, new ways to enjoy the drink are being introduced to meet new trends in drinking. “Korean drinks brands are very innovative,” Cheong-Thong explains. “In the past few years, new product lines have slipped in: fruit infusions [which are especially popular], lower ABVs, fun labels targeting younger generations. By creating a single-serving flavoured drink, they’ve changed the soju game.”This so-called “green bottle soju” is the most widely available in and around the UK, and you can get it atSainsbury’s,Tescoand, now, Lidl. The most prevalent brand over here, and by quite some way, isJinro, Korea’s biggest-selling soju. And judging by that distiller’s presence at various music festivals over the past couple of summers, it’s definitely trying to tap into that younger audience Cheong-Thong refers to. At such events, the soju is usually served as a half-bottle, and in a paper cup, then topped up with ice. It makes sense, too, not least with the rise of alcopops and the small-format boom (these days, it sometimes feels as ifeverythingis being put in a can or bottle).Soju is also being mixed into cocktails (Câvin Bethnal Green, east London, for example, mixes peach soju into a gimlet, while gin, sweet vermouth and berry soju are combined at Bristol’sBokman); I’m told that adding it to beer (somaek) is particularly delicious, too.That said, I’d love to see similar attention paid to more artisan, premium, smaller-production sojus, particularly on the part of boutique drinks retailers.

Their heads are in the middle of the circle, their bodies splayed out like a multi-pronged sundial. Slowly, asJordana Ezra guides them, they insert a finger into their vaginas. As they breathe, they push a pressure point.“Go to noon … press in, breathe,” she says. “And now, three o’clock.”They go again. Ezra is working them through what she calls a “somatic reflexology practice”.Somatic sexology is a field ofalternative therapythat merges the practice of treating how trauma is stored in the body with the aim of developing a deeper understanding of sexuality and pleasure.Lying side by side, the women are trying to “disarm” their bodies – by releasing the tension.This is all part of a three-night “trauma-informed luxury retreat for queer pussy owners” held in the huge house that looks out across Port Phillip Bay.The setting is luxurious – there’s a basketball court no one is using and a pool people dip in and out of. Sailboats drift in the distance. The walls are white, the carpet is so soft you sink a centimetre into it. Downstairs a chef is making lunch.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsSexual empowerment retreats have been running for decades but this one, targeted at queer women, is believed to be one of the first of its kind.“I’m the only one that does what I do,” Ezra says.The retreat is her baby. It promises to help participants “create a devotional relationship” with their bodies and “embody a new depth of pleasure and queer celebration”. This is sex education like you’ve never seen it before.And it costs up to $6,500.Vivid vulvas and colossal carrots: what I learned from my night at a sex workshopRead moreThough the luxury retreat comes with a luxury price tag – the eight women here aren’t all surgeons and bankers – there’s a nurse, a student, a lifelong public servant, a small business owner, a paramedic, a social worker. Some say they have saved for a while, others went on a payment plan to get here.They come from across Australia – as far as Perth and Brisbane. They’re between 30 and 50.Most have realised within the last few years that they are queer. Ezra, who works as a sex coach and offers girlfriend experiences outside running the retreats, says her clientele are for the most part “lesbian first-timers”.“People that are attracted to my work are either coming out later in life or they want to have a deeper sense of sexual liberation in their queerness,” she says.“They see other people feeling really free in their sexuality and they want to be able to experience that.”The ‘wheel of consent’Some have known their whole lives but are struggling with different aspects of their sexuality. Some have husbands and kids at home, and some are bi-curious or bisexual.In the first workshops, participants are taken through “the wheel of consent”. They’re paired off to ask each other, “Can I do this to you?” before the other takes a breath, thinks about it, then answers.“Sit with it,” Ezra tells them.View image in fullscreenEzra: ‘I don’t want fucking normal people coming’.This is about not just knowing your own boundaries but being able to hear a no and not take it personally, or giving a no without losing the flow. It’s about learning to ask for what you want.“Taking with consent,” Ezra says. “The retreat is all about safety.”On the first night everyone keeps their clothes on.An early exercise is eye gazing – strangers locking eyes, staring at each other for minutes. By the end of the retreat they are gazing at each other’s vaginas.Half lie with their heads in the middle of the workshop room, their partner between their legs. They stare one another’s eyes before the partner spends a few minutes looking down below.“You are looking at the most beautiful part of this person,” Ezra says.Then they swap places.Why it’s never too late to be a lesbianRead moreAfterwards, when Ezra asks them to share how it was for them, they all say it was incredibly intimate, that it felt liberating, that it was an honour to look at that part of the body.“I … am a lesbian,” one says. She giggles.Another says: “At the start, all I wanted to do was shut my legs. But by the end I felt really seen.”There’s a lot of nodding. A lot of “mmm”s.The four days are filled with a burlesque workshop, plenty of massaging, and a death and rebirth ritual, in which they “attend their own funerals”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

As they remove an item of clothing, they loudly say what is “dying” with it. “Shame”, “the feeling of not being queer enough”, “being too scared to ask for what I want”, they say as they strip down.Until everybody is shown that they can love and relate in so many different ways, then we are still living in a very oppressive societyJordana EzraNext they lie with a piece of red sheer material over them, while two people massage their feet and two whisper words of affirmation into their ears. When they stand they declare who they now are.There’s a lot of talk about reverence, of hydrating parts of the body that have been neglected, of holding space and of being enough.Yet peel back the unconventional exercises and woo-woo language and you’ll see there’s something more serious going on.Ezra vets everyone – spending hours on the phone with people who have applied for for a place. To suss their vibe and how they will fit with the group. She rejected two people this time around.There are some rules – people can’t be experiencing “highly activated” sexual trauma, no cisgendered men are allowed and participants are encouraged to do some “somatic work” first.“It’s got to work,” Ezra says. “And some people aren’t ready or it would be too much.”‘Cracked open’One person is there because her sister recommended it. Another heard about it via her ex-girlfriend. One saw it on Facebook.A lot of these women are trying to shed something. Internalised homophobia, a deep dislike of their own bodies, nervousness or shame surrounding their sexuality. Others are trying to find something – community, the belief they are queer enough, a deeper connection to themselves, pleasure.“Some of these people have never been seen in their authentic sexuality,” Ezra says. “They’ve never had that space in their life to be in a room that doesn’t judge you for who you are.”She talks about them being “cracked open” and, as the retreat rolls on, there are changes.There’s less clothing – a lot of lounging by the pool, tops off. It gets flirty, the sexual undercurrent becomes supercharged. The consent exercises escalate from tops-on touch to yoni massages.The word pussy is said – a lot.Everything you ever wanted to know about vaginas … but were too afraid to GoogleRead moreEzra and her crew don’t stay in the main house. Each day they come back, often with gifts left on the beds – vibrators in the shape of peaches and cactuses, a splash blanket for moments of intimacy. There are hats that say “lil prick” and “vibe” and lots of lube.This isn’t for everyone. “I don’t want fucking normal people coming,” Ezra says. She also knows that some may balk at the price tag – the $6,500 “luxury” tier includes two solo sessions while the “pleasure” tier costs $4,500.She says the retreat is growing. There are two return participants. And next year she will take it to Bali where it will run for a week. There are more people having a late blooming experience, she says – more people looking for this.She isn’t wrong. Research shows that more women are realising they are queer later in life. Changing social beliefs means they can be more open about their sexuality. In 2024 Gallup reported that nearly one in 10 Americans now identify as part of the LGBTQ community.Countering ‘comphet’Ezra says a lot of what the retreat is trying to do is dismantle “compulsory heterosexuality” – or “comphet” as it’s called in the community. This is the idea that heterosexuality is the assumed, default sexuality that you learn.“I still feel like we’re living in a society that celebrates and over-glorifies the hetero experience,” Ezra says.“And that is homophobia in itself. Until everybody is shown that they can love and relate in so many different ways, then we are still living in a very oppressive society.”There are jokes that this is like joining a cult and the agenda is definitely unorthodox. But the women who are here feel they have found something profound.One, who spent a week in bed after she realised she was gay in her late 40s, says she feels as though she has “shed dead skin and shame”.“And gently moved into new skin, new insights and acceptance of my queerness,” she says.Explore more on these topicsSexualitySexVictoriaAlternative medicineLGBTQ+ rightsHealth & wellbeingWomen (Life and style)featuresShareReuse this content"

You decide which argument doesn’t washFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorinterviews byGeorgina LawtonFri 28 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 28 Mar 2025 10.08 EDTShareThe prosecution: LiamSurely doing a favourbadly is worse than not doing it at all? It took me three hoursto fixA few weeks ago, while I was preoccupied with medical exams, my housemate Ray kindly offered to wash my car. I was very thankful for the gesture as the stress from studying meant that some key chores had fallen by the wayside. I usually wash my car once a month and it was hard to see it gathering dirt.However, I later found out that he had used only soap and water. No car cleaning products like tyre cleaners, wax or glass polish – just a basic soap I had lying around. He thought it would work fine, but my car looked streaky and unclean afterwards. I actually think it looked worse than before.The glass wasn’t as clear as I’d like it to be and the paint was all marked. After it rained, it looked even worse. I cleaned it myself later that week, and had to go over the whole car again, using proper shampoo, microfibre cloths and a decent wax to undo the damage Ray had done.I think Ray is great but he needs to take a bit of responsibility for doing a bad jobRay thought I was being dramatic. “It’s just a car,” he said. “It gets dirty again anyway.” But that’s not the point. A car is a reflection of its owner. If it looks messy and unkempt, what does that say about me? I like things to be neat, polished, and well maintained. Ray, on the other hand, seems to think rainwater counts as a second rinse.We had a bit of a debate about it, but I knew better than to start a proper argument with him as we get on very well. But I think he should have offered to reclean it, or at least help me reclean it. If not, I would have appreciated a few quid towards a professional clean.I did make a couple of jokes about it, such as “When are you going to give me the cash for a new car wash?” But Ray just laughed them off. I was kind of being serious though.Ray still insists he did me a favour, but I see it differently as I had to fix his so-called favour with three hours of hard work. Surely doing a favour for someone badly is worse than not doing it at all? I think Ray is great, but he needs to take a bit of responsibility for doing a bad job.You be the judge - send us your domestic disputesRead moreThe defence: RayCarsaremachines. They don’t need pampering.You clean them, they get dirty again; life goes onI should have known better than to offer to help Liam wash his car when he was stressed. I thought it was a simple gesture, like holding the door open or lending a drill, but now I wish I hadn’t bothered. I haven’t heard the end of it.I turned up with a bucket, sponge, and a bottle of Fairy Liquid: the standard kit. This is how my dad did it, how his dad did it, and presumably how Henry Ford did it too.I got the job done in 45 minutes and Liam was very grateful at first. He’d been so busy studying and hadn’t had time to clean his precious car.However, he recoiled when I told him what I’d used. He went out to inspect it and made a few comments like, “Oh, it’s streaky.” Then after it rained, he inspected the car again and found more streaks. I didn’t care: in my mind I had done him a favour.Liam treats his secondhand Fiesta like a priceless work of art. He ‘preps’ the cleaning with a clay bar – he’s lost his mindBut Liam said he had to reclean the car for hours, and that I should have helped him a second time. He even suggested that I pay for a professional wash to remove the streaks. I laughed in his face and refused on both counts. I think he’s got a cheek: I did a nice thing for him, and he tried to make money off me to “correct” that.Soap and water have worked for generations. Why complicate things? Anything else – waxes, polishes, ceramic coatings – is just car vanity. But Liam insists on treating his secondhand Ford Fiesta like a priceless work of art. I caught him using a clay bar last week to “prep” the cleaning process. He’s got special shampoos, two buckets – the man has lost his mind.Frankly, I’m embarrassed to be seen with him at the petrol station. Last week, he was standing there buffing his bonnet while I was filling up. He spends entire Sunday afternoons massaging his car as if he’s trying to bring it to life.A car is a machine. Machines do not need to be pampered. You clean them, they get dirty again; life goes on. I won’t be paying him a penny and I think he should be thanking me for washing his car at all, instead of complaining about my tried-and-tested technique.The jury of Guardian readersShould Ray make amends for doing a bad job?Ray did not offer to wash Liam’s car in a particular way and Liam, quite rightly, did not set out a list of minimum requirements or specifications. Get a grip. No defence is required from Ray.Peter, 49If the cleaning mattered so much, Liam should have shared his method and given Ray an opt-out, or declined upfront. Frustration is understandable, but if you demand high standards, you can’t expect others to meet them without clear communication.Seren, 32Ray is a bona fide mate, selflessly offering to help out a stressed friend. It is finicky Liam who has transgressed. As a medical student, his attention to detail and meticulous cleanliness is good news for his future patients, but his propensity to charge fees suggests a career outside the NHS.Liam, 63A car may be a reflection of its owner, but Liam needs to take a look in the mirror. Even if the results were sub-par, Ray acted from a good place. Another wash and no harm done – passive-aggressive hints for cash are just petty and shameful.Joshua, 42In the end, this comes down to Liam complaining about the quality of a gesture Ray performed for no other reason but kindness. Ray owes Liam nothing, and Liam needs to recognise that kindness – however unskilled – is still kindness. Though Ray could be less flippant about Liam’s feelings.Andy-Lee, 42Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: should Ray get the chamois out again?The poll closes on Thursday 3 April at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherMargaret should have consulted her familyover her forthcoming Christmas trip to Vietnam, as her son Paul argues.41%of you said yes –Margaret is guilty59%of you said no –Margaret is innocentExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeRelationshipsFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was July 1981, andyears of frustration had boiled over into uprisingsacross England. By the third night, police moved into the neighbourhood with a display of force unprecedented in England.The city was the moth-eatenManchesterof the 80s, with the cotton industry that shaped it long in decline. Peaceful resistance to the constricts of Thatcher’s Britain – and personal liberation – came in the form of Moss Side’s Abasindi Co-operative, founded at the turn of that decade as one of the first Black women-only organisations in the UK, and the most influential in the post-industrial north.Manchester’s industrial growth owedan unacknowledged debt to transatlantic slavery, which still cast a shadow over Black Britons in the late 70s and early 80s in the shape of employment discrimination, police racism and thwarted, wasted potential.Then, when the smoke and shouts of the uprising engulfed Moss Side, white and Black youths alike having taken to the streets to protest against police brutality,James Anderton,the city’s authoritarian police chief, resorted to tactics refined by the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland’s Troubles. Anderton, an evangelical Christian, knew Moss Side’s young Black people had been denied opportunity amid record unemployment – but was determined to restore order to the streets “fast and hard”.View image in fullscreenAn uprising in Moss Side, Manchester, 1981.Photograph: Mike Forster/ANL/Shutterstock“With the uprisings, people’s eyes were opened … they began to see the value of organisations such as Abasindi,” said Diane Watt, theco-author of a book on the history of Black women’s activism in the UK, recalling how Abasindi’s headquarters,Moss Side People’s Centre, became a shelter in the storm. Police vans were driven at protesters as the state cracked down and bystanders arrested and assaulted. “Those who were young people then, men and women now, have not forgotten us because we didn’t close the door against them then,” she added.Abasindi emerged as a distinct group from Manchester’s self-help Black Women’s Co-operative, which was established in the mid-70s. Among BWC founder members wasOlive Morris, the Jamaican-born Black British feminist community leader and squatters’ rights activist who was last year posthumously honoured with ablue plaquein Brixton, where she lived as a squatter and hosted study groups for Black women.“However, [BWC] membership was for men and women – and, to a degree, the voices of the men were more dominant,” Watt said. “So we felt as though we weren’t being heard. And the only way for us to be heard is for us to create a space for ourselves. We weren’t defining ourselves as feminist. We were seeing ourselves as Black female activists.”The name Abasindi – Zulu for “born to survive” – was influenced by the anti-apartheid struggle in SouthAfrica. Men could be allies but not members. Abasindi was one Black activist group among many that fought for a better society in a radical era, but the scale of members’ achievements – as a collective, as individuals and in collaboration with other groups – distinguished them.In Manchester, the legacy of the Abasindi women is everywhere. Its poets and performers, such as Abina Likoya, SuAndi and Shirley May, have influenced countless others. Whether it is afamily centre,a business park, anarts collective, aneducation trust,specialist NHS centre, ahousing associationor acommemorative plaque– if it was set up in Manchester in the 80, 90s or 00s for the benefit of the Black community, there will be an Abasindi connection.The proceeds from arts and crafts, drumming, dancing and natural women’s hairdressingallowed Abasindi to be financially self-sufficient. All were determined to reawaken pride in African cultures that had been outlawed, demeaned or diminished by the legacy of slavery.Founders and members challenged systemic inequalities in the education system by founding supplementary schools, working to get Black students into university via access courses.View image in fullscreenKath Locke and Diane Watt carry a banner as Abasindi members lead an anti-deportation demonstration.Photograph: AbasindiThey campaigned for good-quality, affordable housing in a city where Black home-ownership rates had been devastated by so-called slum clearance programmes, which knocked down streets of terraces but did not compensate the owners enough to buy again.Abasindi women also gave their children African names, travelled to the continent and collected oral histories for posterity, affirming a Black identity subjugated by society.Then there was the practical work of looking after elderly people and campaigning for the NHS to recognise the devastating impactsickle cell anaemia and thalassaemiahad on Black and Asian patients. They also successfully fought to prevent the deportation of domestic violence survivors whose migration status depended on abusive husbands, asSouthall Black Sistersdid in London,leading to a change in the law.The founding of the Nia centre in Hulme, the first Black arts centre in Europe of its size, also involved Abasindi women. Fittingly, the civil rights activist and musicianNina Simoneperformed on its opening night.Watt said: “We were very good at making alliances – we were all about working with other organisations. When a lot of feminists wouldn’t work with men, we would look for ways of working together, rather than things that divided us.”Abasindi’s influences and mentors were from the Windrush generation.

Born in Blackpool in 1928, the daughter of a white mother from Lancashire and a Nigerian seaman, she was a child of Britain whose Britishness was always being questioned.Commitment to community and dedication to the betterment of society united these activists, as did the pan-African ideology which – with Manchester having hosted the fifthPan-African Congress, advancing decolonisation in 1945, as well as having been home to intellectuals such the St Lucian economist and Nobel laureateW Arthur Lewis– was well rooted in Manchester.“But they couldn’t have done what they did without a groundswell, the grassroots, behind them,” said Adele Jones, a co-author with Watt, about the ordinary Black women and men who have not become storied figures among historians.For the writer and broadcasterLemn Sissay,a former chancellor of the University of Manchester, coming into contact with the group was an act of personal emancipation, as he emerged from a repressive state-care system that had separated him from his mother and his Ethiopian heritage.“It was at the Abasindi Co-op where I first read poetry live. I’d never been in a room with so many people of colour before … I was in awe,” he said.“I had a broad Lancashire accent – with dreadlocks. I wasn’t like anybody else who was there. At the same time, I really felt the community was saying: ‘Tell us what you’ve been through.’ That was the beginning of the rest of my life as a poet.”For Watt, coming into contact with Black scholars and activists, through Abasindi, opened new horizons. “When you were at school, you got told you can’t,” she said. “With that group, you were told: ‘You can, and you owe it to yourself.’ People like myself came out from thinking: ‘I’m going to stay at being a secretary’ and started going to classes and then growing and growing.“We left that stereotype that we had inherited from society about Black people being limited, Black people not being aspiring or not able. All those things we removed from our vocabulary.”Manchester is a cityproud of its radical past. The fifth Pan-African Congress, the fight for women’s suffrage, the Peterloo Massacre, the campaign for gay rights – all milestones in the mythology of a city on the right side of history, each touching, in different ways, on the lives of the women in Absasindi’s orbit. But it was the persistence of injustice – in spite of that campaigning legacy – that made the group’s resistance necessary, adding their names to the pantheon of the city’s greatest activists.By 2008, the group had wound down. But Jones, 45 years on from the New Year’s Day meeting where Locke, Duduzile Lethlaku, Yvonne Hypolite, Maria Noble, Popgee Manderson, Madge Gordon, Abena Braithwaite and Shirley Inniss formed Abasindi, is acutely aware that the battles they fought continue.“The transatlantic slave trade has created the conditions in which modern society still functions – the issues of race and inequality,” Jones said. “Young people have to be aware that progress towards any form of equality is a long-term thing – you have to be in it for the long haul.”Unsung Stories of Black Women’s Activism in the UK: Spirits of Resistance and Resilienceby Adele Jones and Diana Watt,is published by Springer Cham and features in the Black Britishbookfestival at Manchester Central Library on 29 March.Explore more on these topicsBlack British cultureCotton Capital: ongoing seriesManchesterRaceFeminismGreater ManchesterNorth of EnglandCaribbeanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It means nobody apart from the sender and receiver can access messages, including Signal and WhatsApp.Privacy is at the heart of Signal’s business model, and its chief executive, Meredith Whittaker, has been a vocal proponent.Is it more secure than other messaging apps?For most people, Signal is “very secure”, said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey. “If somebody were to try to intercept messages sent on Signal, then they would not be able to decrypt it.”Signal is considered more secure than WhatsApp because it is open source, so researchers can audit it. Also, unlike WhatsApp, Signal does not collect any metadata, such as information about the duration and location of calls and messages.Both Signal and WhatsApp offer a functionality known as key transparency, which gives people a means of identifying that the person they are communicating with is who they say they are through the use of public keys, which are posted to a public log that can be universally audited.If you use this functionality, in theory, this should mean you need never risk adding the wrong person to a group chat. “I think it’s clear the people [the US politicians] who’re in this chat did not do this,” said Dowling, adding: “Even as a cryptography nerd, I don’t do this as a matter of standard practice.”Is it secure enough to share classified material?Woodward said all national security-related communications must meet three requirements: confidentiality – that they are secret; integrity – that nobody has intercepted and altered them; and authenticity – that you know exactly who you are communicating with.Personal devices do not meet this test, he said, because it is impossible to be certain that no spyware has been downloaded.Officials must instead use officially approved intelligence-communications systems, which may use different networks according to the level of security classification, and will only connect them to authorised people and places around the world.This is usually accessed in secure rooms with official phones, or in the absence of these, an SCIF – a sensitive compartmented information facility. These structures are set up wherever senior officials go, often within aFaraday cagethat blocks electromagnetic fields, with secure lines and radio equipment.What are Signal's flaws?Areportpublished by Google in February revealed Russian “state-aligned threat actors” had exploited Signal’s “linked devices” functionality, which enables people to read their messages on laptops and tablets as well as their phone by connecting them through a QR code. Phishing operations had been used to circulate malicious QRs masked as legitimate Signal communications.Why are politicians using such apps?These apps are not permitted by either the US or UK government for sensitive communications because no amount of encryption can prevent human error, such as adding the wrong person into a chat.However, they are sometimes used informally – possibly for convenience or to circumvent transparency and record-keeping rules.Signalgate has echoes of the “government by WhatsApp” scandal that occurred during the Covid pandemic in the UK, in which senior ministers discussed crises on their personal phones. The then prime minister, Boris Johnson, and Scotland’s then first minister, Nicola Sturgeon,told the Covid inquirythat messages sent during crises were deleted.“It means the transparency of government decision-making is not there and we’re losing it. That, to me, seems dangerous,” said Woodward.Explore more on these topicsSignal group chat leakThe AtlanticTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS foreign policyUS militaryexplainersShareReuse this content"

Now her granddaughter, the playwright Dalara Williams, has written a play celebrating the historic vibrancy of RedfernGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailBySteve DowFri 28 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 28 Mar 2025 10.02 EDTShareOn a Friday night in April 1966, 16-year-old Norma Ingram was one of seven young Aboriginal women formally “presented” as part of the inaugural Sydney Indigenous debutante ball at Paddington Town Hall. “It was a lot of that old English stuff, ‘coming out into society’,” the Wiradjuri woman says of the event, which was attended by some 200 Aboriginal people.Revellers passed under a boomerang arch to enter the hall, which was festooned with Indigenous motifs in ochre colours. Ingram wore a white ballgown. “We were all just teenagers,” she says of her debutante cohort. “It was fun for us, and we made a whole lot of new friends.”Ingram had just left school. She was born in the country town of Cowra in central-west New South Wales, but like many Aboriginal people made the trek to Redfern, seeking employment opportunities among the kinship of extended family. “You’d get out at Redfern station and go to the Empress hotel – because that was the only pub that would allow Aboriginal people in – and say, ‘I’m looking for my cousin’,” she laughs.“Usually, landlords wouldn’t rent to Aboriginal people, so the ones lucky enough to rent would take all their cousins in. That’s why the houses were so full.”View image in fullscreenNorma Ingram, pictured at the Belvoir St theatre rehearsal rooms.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianThe deb ball was set up by theFoundation for Aboriginal Affairs, which held dances at Redfern Town Hall and concerts each week at its cultural centre in George Street. On Sunday nights an Aboriginal band,the Silva Linings, performed, and anyone else with musical talent was allowed on stage. Ingram and three friends – Marjorie, Bertie and Jimmy – would jump into the spotlight and “go-go dance” to entertain the throng.Nakkiah Lui and Miranda Tapsell on 'tearing down another statue': the debutante ballRead moreIngram’s granddaughter, Gumbaynggirr/Wiradjuri playwright and actor Dalara Williams, recalls listening to her nan and aunties share tales of dancing and laughter. “Even in the world of segregation, they found time to dress up and go to dances in places theywereallowed to go in,” she says. In the face of racism, “they still found joy connecting and holding on to each other”.Their stories inspired Williams’s playBig Girls Don’t Cry, making its premiere at Belvoir St theatre in April, about three young Redfern women (one of whom, Cheryl, she will play) who seek their own joy at a deb ball in 1966.Williams understands the power of joy as resistance. Born in 1989, she grew up on The Block – a historic site of activism in Redfern – “raised and surrounded by single Black women”, with her younger sister Jacinda. She attended the childcare centre Murawina (meaning “black woman”), which her grandmother helped set up in the early 1970s – the same era in which Redfern became home to Australia’s first Aboriginal-owned and controlled legal and medical services, and the trailblazingNational Black Theatre.View image in fullscreen‘How do we pour love into each other, to keep going?’… Dalara Williams.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianWilliams, like her nan, still lives in Redfern. Looking back across her life there she recalls police brutality and the unrest following thedeath of teenager Thomas “TJ” Hickeyin 2004, and laments the ongoing gentrification pushing Indigenous people out of the area – which she calls “the second coming of colonisation”. In the face of this, Aboriginal people are “really good” at finding joy, she says.“If we kept pouring hatred or frustration and anger towards a group of people that don’t want us, we would be burnt out,” says Williams. “And so how do we pour love into each other, to keep going?”Seated next to her nan at Belvoir’s rehearsal space and listening to her talk about her experiences as a young woman in Redfern, Williams admits to mourning the loss of the weekly inner-Sydney Indigenous socials of the 1960s. “Where are those spaces now, those gathering places for Indigenous people to mingle and mix?” she asks. “There needs to be spaces for dancing and gathering that kind of energy, rather than just sitting around a pub. That engagement needs to be intergenerational, across Elders and teenagers, and not just an annual festival or event.”Williams’s most joyful childhood memories include her mum inviting cousins and their babies over to their house on The Block for nights of painting at the kitchen table, listening to music.View image in fullscreenWilliams hopes her new play will fill a gap in ‘sisterhood stories’.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianMany old terraces have since been torn down at The Block, but Redfern Park, site of prime ministerPaul Keating’s 1992 speechacknowledging the damage done by colonisation, remains a gathering ground for Aboriginal joy and protest, including in the lead-up to the 2023 referendum for anIndigenous voice to parliament.On adjoining hallowed ground, in 2013, Williams’ mother Lisa was elected the first female president of the Redfern All Blacks rugby league team, and Williams has “great memories of how much a gathering ground” the oval was during Sunday football.Williams studied in Redfern, too: at Eora Tafe, founded in 1984 (as the Eora Centre for the Visual and Performing Arts) by playwright Robert Merritt, author of The Cake Man, the first full-length play by an Indigenous Australian to be professionally produced. It was there that Williams met fellow actor-turned-playwright Megan Wilding, for whom she wrote the role of Queenie, one of the three young women at the centre of Big Girls Don’t Cry.Having also studied Aboriginal theatre at Waapa in Perth and acting at Nida in Sydney, Williams hopes her new play will fill a gap in “sisterhood stories” and stories about “the blackness I know, only taught in the city”.She cannot see herself leaving Redfern – at least not permanently. “Aboriginal people have not disappeared; you can walk down Redfern Street and still connect with Aboriginal people there,” she emphasises.“I really think people don’t understand how special Redfern is to the Aboriginal community here. It’s not just another suburb. The roots run deep.”Big Girls Don’t Cryruns 5-27 April at Belvoir St theatre, Sydney.Explore more on these topicsAustralian theatreIndigenous AustraliansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They carried flowers, herbs and photos of their loved ones to lay at the foot of an altar on a tiny strip of land in the middle of a pond. For the last few years, this ritual at the start of the annual Gullah Geechee herbal gathering on Johns Island,South Carolina, has served as a link between the living and the dead. “It gives them a sacred space to connect with the land,” the gathering’s founder, Khetnu Nefer, said about the attendees, and to “connect with our communal ancestors”.Held on Nefer’s family’s land, a stretch of 10 acres (four hectares) of flat grass surrounded by woods, the gathering educates attendees on the herbal traditions of the descendants of west Africans enslaved on the Sea Islands along the south-east US. Over the course of the three-day conference, Black and brown instructors – some of whom areGullah Geechee– host around 20 workshops ranging from English-based creole lessons to foraging for herbs including chaney root, which is boiled into a tea to heal fatigue or arthritis. During an herbal remedy class, attendees learn which herbs can be used to treat chronic pain, including mullein, a flowering plant that is sometimes boiled into a tea to heal symptoms associated with asthma or bronchitis.When she was growing up, Nefer remembers, her grandmother walked the lands to search for herbal remedies for common ailments. The Sea Islands were only accessible by boat until the erection ofbridgesin the mid-20th century, so many Gullah Geechee people relied on herbs instead of western medicine due to a lack of access to doctors. For 50-year-old Nefer, teaching younger generations who aren’t as familiar with the old ways to identify and connect with herbs in the wild is important. “Our elders are transitioning, and a lot of them tend to gatekeep because they feel like the next generations aren’t interested,” Nefer said. “I felt like it was incumbent of my generation to be that bridge between the elders and gen Z and lower to make sure that this stuff doesn’t die out and that we have a repository for this information.”View image in fullscreenAttendees at the Gullah Geechee Herbal Gathering on Johns Island in South Carolina.Photograph: Khetnu NeferLargely unknown outside the Gullah Geechee community,many herbsin North America were brought over during the middle passage by enslaved Africans to treat common maladies. They wore necklaces made of licorice plant seeds to treat coughs, andbraidedokra seeds into their hair to use its ground-up leaves as a poultice for wounds. Formerly enslaved Africans also used herbs in spiritual practices to deal with conflicts. Now, Gullah Geechee people are continuing their ancestral traditions by holding intergenerationalgatheringsto trade their knowledge on sustainable herb farming and medicine making. And perhaps now more than ever, due to social media and a desire to connect to ancestral roots, younger Gullah people are expressing a renewed interest in the craft.“In my generation, we live in both worlds: there is a lot of discrimination and anti-Blackness in the medical industry,” said Akua Page, a 31-year-old Gullah Geechee tour guide based in Charleston, South Carolina. “My generation will go to the hospital because they have the machinery to get diagnosed, but we’ll still sit down with our elders [and ask]: ‘What plant did you utilize to help with this?’”In March 2020, Nefer held the first conference at a small Black-owned farm in Charleston with 80 attendees. The conference doubled in attendance the next year when it was held on her family’s property, and then tripled the following year, with the majority Black attendees, some of whom were Gullah Geechee, ranging in age from 25 to 70 years old. Last October, the conference shrunk to 90 people after a hurricane struck the area the day before.Nefer plans to host the next conference in the spring of 2026, when she believes that herbal remedies may be more important than ever as state and federal regulations continue to limit access to healthcare including birth control. “There are herbs that can help with different maladies,” Nefer said. “If we can connect our resources together, we won’t have to be reliant on big pharma and the doctors and we could be self-reliant.”‘When we came here, we brought our plants with us’The origins of Gullah herbal medicines are a melting pot of the knowledge of enslaved people from different parts of west Africa and Native Americans, said Khet Waas Hutip, a 46-year-old Gullah herbalist.“When we came here, we brought our plants with us,” said Hutip, founder of the holistic healing store Sacred Rootz in Summerville, South Carolina. “We may had necklaces with seeds, we may had cornrows or hairstyles with beads. Those beads had seeds in them, and then these things start to cultivate over here.”View image in fullscreenKhet Waas Hutip, a Gullah herbalist and founder of Sacred Rootz, with Spanish moss.Photograph: Khet Waas HutipMuch of the knowledge about enslaved Africans’ herbal practices are based on oral history and passed down between generations. Most enslaved Africans were illiterate and white writers weren’t incentivized to document Black practices, according to Faith Mitchell, a medical anthropologist and author of the groundbreaking 1978 bookHoodoo Medicine: Gullah Herbal Remedies. “So there’s this enormous silence where you just wish you knew what was going on and what happened from one day to the next,” Mitchell said. “The history of folk medicine and herbal medicine belongs to that period that lasted decades – of cultural mingling and adaptation, but it isn’t documented.”Enslaved people were able to apply their pharmacological skills on the Sea Islands since plant and animal life along the Carolina coast slightly resembled west Africa’s. They probably treated their ailments by themselves using herbal remedies and sought help from plantation doctors as a last resort, Mitchell wrote in her book. They also practiced magical medicines by using feathers, bones, blood, leaves, sand or water to cast spells on people or to counteract magic directed toward them. Black folk medicine was likely also practiced clandestinely prior to emancipation since enslaved people could face punishment for practicing any type of medicine.When Mitchell first arrived to the South Carolina Sea Islands in the early 1970s, she met elders who shared some of this knowledge with her by pointing out plants that could be used as medicines as they walked along the road. “You had these oral traditions, but the middle generation wasn’t there to pass them down to and then there were little kids who would come there in the summer when their parents were working,” she said. So Mitchell wrote the book to document some of the oral traditions that the working generation were not on the island to learn because they were pursuing job opportunities elsewhere.Faith Mitchell.Photograph: AJBrownIn the decades since the book was originally published, Mitchell said, she has seen a growing interest in Gullah herbal remedies. She credits the renewed interest to a malaise around the pharmaceutical industry, and a desire to tap into ancestral roots fueled by greater access to information. She now sees youth citing the book, as well as Gullah traditional practices on social media.Page, the Gullah tour guide, uses TikTok to disseminate information about natural medicine and herbal traditions. In one video, she swishes around a jar ofstinging nettle, which reduces inflammation and is believed to offer spiritual protection and help break curses. In another video, she poursrice in a waterwayas an offering to heal her enslaved ancestors from the middle passage.Her foster mom taught her how to harvest elderberries and make them into a syrup to help treat colds and flus. But she advised Page not to share the skill with anyone because it might be viewed as witchcraft. “The practice of hoodoo, people still look at that as evil or demonic,” Page said. “But when you call it herbalism, then it’s like: ‘Oh, that’s great.’”Now she conducts tours at a former rice plantation, where she educates visitors on Gullah practices including praying over Spanish moss and then stuffing it into shoes to help treat asthma and high blood pressure. Page regularly visits elders to learn about the natural medicine they’ve used to heal ailments, but she has found that some are reticent about sharing their traditions or being recorded due to the fear of stigma associated with the spiritual practice of hoodoo.As a workaround, Page documented the elders’ teachings in her recent book, Gullah Geechee Adventures: Hoodoo Magick, which is about an elder who passed away and left her descendants a hoodoo magic book that included instructions on various herbal remedies. Through her storytelling, Page hopes to keep the ancestral practices alive and help destigmatize spiritual traditions that were demonized by slavery and colonialism.‘Without good health, you can’t experience life’Herbs have also linked Hutip with his elders throughout his life. When he was growing up as a child with asthma, his older family members taught him to drink natural medicines including life everlasting and chickweed to help clear his respiratory tract before he played outside. And as he began to develop a passion for the craft in high school, an elder in the neighborhood named Ms Mack became his first patient as he helped her manage her diabetes symptoms. Hutip instructed her to eat the dandelions in her yard to help heal her pancreas, eat raw string beans and drink tea with gymnema leaves to help regulate her blood sugar. After implementing the changes for several months, she eventually weened herself off insulin after having relied on it for decades. He recalled her saying: “This is your calling. This is what you got to do.”View image in fullscreenAn ancestor altar in the middle of a pond, at the Gullah Geechee Herbal Gathering.Photograph: Khetnu NeferAfter college and a visit to Ghana, where he learned to create tonics from bitter roots and herbs that aid in digestive health, Hutip decided to dedicate his life to herbalism. In 2012, he started Sacred Rootz and sold herbs out of a stall at a flea market in Charleston before eventually opening up a storefront in Summerville.“Without good health, you can’t experience life,” Hutip said. “You can’t even fulfill your purpose.”At his store, he sells more than 200 herbs imported from the Caribbean or that he has harvested from the nearby forest. He also hosts monthly classes to educate the local Gullah Geechee and Black communities on how to treat common illnesses including type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure with lifestyle changes and natural medicine.“These doctors don’t really explain to them what is going on in their body, what it is, how you get it, how you can reverse it,” Hutip said. “And since they lack the information, they suffer because of it.”In recent years, Hutip said, younger generations have visited his shop after hearing about the power of herbal medicine on social media. He uses it as an opportunity to teach them about some of the Gullah herbal traditions that were passed down to him by his elders. To keep the traditions alive, he is working on a children’s herbal book written in the Gullah Geechee language that’s about a girl who can communicate with plants and uses her power to help people heal their ailments through natural medicine.View image in fullscreenA class at the annual Gullah Geechee Herbal Gathering, where students learn about self-care practices and herbs to treat common maladies.Photograph: Khetnu NeferAt home, Hutip also imparts his skills to his children through regular lessons. During walks, he notes different plants and quizzes them on their names to ensure that the knowledge is carried on. The teachings have translated to his 10-year-old daughter’s playtime: she often whips up concoctions with various plants that she harvests in the yard and then seeps in cups of water, to which he’ll tell her: “You just made medicine.”“They’re doing it subconsciously, because it’s something ancestral,” Hutip said. “So it’s just our job to point out what it is.”Explore more on these topicsGullah GeecheeCotton Capital: ongoing seriesBlack US cultureHealthHerbs and spicesMental healthSouth CarolinaMedicinefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The authors put forward a positive pitch for “abundance liberalism”: a vision of the US where policymakers spend less time fighting over how to apportion scarce resources and more time making sure there’s no scarcity to start with.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Avid Reader Press/Simon & SchusterAbundance has received a mostly positive reception so far, but also sparked debate, with critics arguing that the bookignoresthe effect of corporate power, downplays Republicans’ role in the crises that the US faces or overstates the effectiveness of its policy prescriptions. A writer in the left-leaning magazine American Prospectaccusedthe “abundance agenda” of being “neoliberalism repackaged for a post-neoliberal world”.The book opens with a striking image of a US, in the year 2050, that is close to utopia. Americans’ electrical needs are powered by sustainable energy “so clean it barely leaves a carbon trace and so cheap you can scarcely find it on your monthly bill”. AI breakthroughs, labor rights and economic reforms mean that most people can do their jobs in a shorter workweek. Vertical farms provide cheap and fresh vegetables, desalinated water from the ocean is used as drinking water, and lab-grown meat has replaced animal slaughter.This near-future America – less the gritty neon smog of Blade Runnerthan a hi-tech Copenhagen – is entirely achievable, the authors argue. It just requires political vision and a willingness to reconsider certain assumptions.Despite being the richest country in the world, the US has a problem of scarcity, particularly in Democratic-run metropolitan areas, where the costs of housing and other basic needs have spiraled out of control. This is exacerbated by the traditional progressive solution of giving people money or vouchers to help them pay for finite resources such as housing, healthcare and food, the book argues, which increases demand and merely makes those things even more expensive.“The problem is that if you subsidize the cost of something that there isn’t enough of, you’ll raise prices or force rationing,” Klein hassaid. He and Thompson have described themselves as “supply-side” progressives, borrowing a term usually associated with conservativeeconomic theories.What the US badly needs to do is build, they argue – build more houses, public transportation, power plants and other infrastructure – but that isn’t happening.One obstacle is nimbyism, thetendencyof people to support public works and development in the abstract but fight them when they affect their own neighborhoods. Another is “everything bagel” logrolling that complicates what should be narrowly focused legislation by layering it with other social and political objectives, such as diverse hiring requirements or climate crisis goals, in order to appease interest groups or political constituencies.In an example Thompson recentlydiscussedon a podcast, then president Joe Biden signed legislation in 2021 providing $42bn of funding to expand access to broadband internet in rural America. As of this December,accordingto Politico, the program had “yet to connect a single household”. Critics told Politico that this was partlybecauseof a “suite of federal conditions” that required states “accepting the money to make sure providers plan for climate change, reach out to unionized workforces and hire locally”, as well as guarantee affordable broadband plans for people with low incomes.“I don’t want the state of Virginia taking, say, federal money to build broadband internet and then charging poor rural folks, like, $200 a month to go online,” Thompson said. “But by holding those values so closely … we accidentally built just about nothing.” A “confusion of process versus outcomes” meant that “very little was actually done on behalf of the Americans for whom we wanted to raise their living standards”.Another example is California, which in 1982 began studying the idea of implementing a high-speed rail system across the state. The idea was, and is, extremely popular with voters, and billions of dollars were budgeted for the project. Four decades later, almost none of it has been built. A “vetocracy” of regulatory, legal, environmental and political considerations have caused endless delays and continually narrowed the project’s ambition.What does Elon Musk believe?Read more“In the time California has spent failing to complete its 500-mile high-speed rail system,” Thompson and Klein write, “China has built more than 23,000 miles of high-speed rail.”The solution to these problems, Abundance argues, is a combination of techno-optimism, ambitious and clearly defined policy goals, and political leadership that is willing at times to say no to progressive pressure groups.Klein and Thompson favorably cite what happened when a bridge collapsed in Pennsylvania in 2023, crippling an essential highway. To fix it would typically take months of planning, consultation and reviews; Governor Josh Shapiro instead declared a state of emergency that allowed the reconstruction of the bridge with union labor but free from many normal processes. The highway reopened in 12 days, instead of the 12 to 24 months that it might have taken.Abundance makes clear that it is a book written for the left, and isn’t really interested in elaborating the ways that Republicans and conservatives have contributed to these problems, though Klein and Thompson acknowledge that they have. Yet within the left the book has proved controversial.“[I]t would be a huge mistake,” Matt Bruenig, a policy analyst,wrotein Jacobin, “to sideline whatever focus there is on welfare state expansion and economic egalitarianism in favor of a focus on administrative burdens in construction.”He continued: “Indeed, we have now seen what it looks like when the government supports and subsidizes technological innovation and implementation without concerning itself with the inegalitarianism of the system. His name is Elon Musk. In its desire to promote electrical vehicles and rocketry innovations, the US government made him the richest man in the world and then he used his riches to take over a major political communications platform and then the government.”While agreeing with some of Abundance’s aims, the journalists Paul Glastris and Nate Weisberg, writing in the Washington Monthly,arguedthat the book’s prescriptions wouldn’t necessarily bring the kind of sweeping changes that Klein and Thompson believe. For example, according to examples they cite, areas of the US that have reformed zoning laws to make it easier to build apartment buildings and multifamily homes haveseenonly modest reductions in the cost of housing.Thompson and Klein have argued that the abundance agenda is bigger than any individual policy proposal, and more about the Democratic party and other left-leaning institutions rethinking their own ambitions and how they conceive of success and failure.“Liberals should be able to say:Vote for us, and we will govern the country the way we govern California!” they write. “Instead, conservatives are able to say:Vote for them, and they will govern the country the way they govern California!… What has gone wrong?”Explore more on these topicsUS domestic policyUS politicsDemocratsInequalityRegulatorsPlanning policyTransport policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You always hear about TV shows being absolutely heartbreaking but this is one of the first to actually leave me wanting to cry, but not knowing how. Shows always try to capture what teenagers are like, but they never get it as accurately asAdolescencehas. I could relate to some of the scenes, but Jamie and Eddie Miller really had an impact on me. Their struggles with anger are ones I’ve witnessed from people I’ve known. It was triggering because it was so accurate. I have a son who I adore and you never know what a child’s future is going to be like. You want the best for them. To raise them to succeed and be great, kind people. I don’t know how I’d feel if he did something like Jamie [did].Danielle, 20, Oxfordshire‘Society is constantly belittling and putting down young men’The larger issue is society constantly belittling and putting down young men (particularly young white men). Yes,Andrew Tateand ideas which degrade women are obviously bad, and young men do get exposed to it all sometimes. But they have been conditioned to feel guilty for who they are and this causes a crisis of identity, which can lead some men to embrace the extreme ideas of someone like Tate.Men don’t want to be told they are “toxic”. By constantly putting men down, society is driving young men to be influenced by people such as Tate, as they see no approval from anywhere in their life.Justin, 22, self-employed, Melbourne‘Not being on social media until senior year of high school was the best decision’‘Seeing the real-life effects of social media was chilling”’ … Calden.Photograph: Calden/Guardian CommunityIt was chilling to see a real-life look into the effects of social media and cyberbullying on my generation and the next. My parents didn’t give me an iPhone until 8th grade (when children are about 13 years old) and I didn’t get social media until senior year of high school (about 17 years old) – that was the best decision they ever made. I was bullied as a kid and I can only imagine the impact it would’ve had on me if I had been on social media at the same time.Calden, 21, student, Boston, Massachusetts‘I couldn’t take it seriously after the emoji conversation’The technical achievement and harrowing performances should be applauded, but at times I felt I could really tell that this programme was not written in consultation with the age group of the main character. The emoji conversation in episode two totally ruined my immersion in the show, and I found the rest of the programme difficult to take as seriously. Yes, young people do use emojis to communicate in code (as do adults!), but I have not come across a single person, internet result or Urban Dictionary post explaining that the “100” and “kidney bean” emojis might have a nefarious double meaning.Anna, 25, student, London‘It was a wake-up call to oblivious parents and teachers’View image in fullscreen‘It painted a harrowing reality’ … Anika.Photograph: Anika/Guardian CommunityI thinkAdolescencepainted the harrowing reality of today’s online world. I see people idolising Andrew Tate, spewing misogynistic rhetoric, and passing it off as a joke. The idea of victimising young boys, the “incels”, takes away their agency and pins the blame on “choosey” females. Even in my old school, the guys would comment on girls’ bodies, their intellect, and shame them, laugh at them and belittle them. The worst part was that they never realised the wrongness of their actions. But I don’t hate them. I grew up with these people; they are good people, but I pity them. They are young teens like us girls, and I hate that they have been subjected to such nonsense under the guise of truth. I think the show was a wake-up call to oblivious parents and teachers, and I hope it paves the way for real change. *Anika, 18, student,midwestern US‘I could have been radicalised by Jamie’I’ve been out of school for years now, but the issue is still the same. I nearly became an incel. I was a prime candidate: chubby, sensitive, a learning disability and the child of a particularly ugly divorce I was old enough to process. I could have been radicalised by Jamie. I recognised some of my old classmates in the show – all of them diagnosed with serious mental health issues, all of them medicated and with appropriate levels of care. It’s been heartening to see the incel issue finally be acknowledged by the government; the glaring omission of discussion around Jamie’s quite clear emotional and mental disorders, however, is extremely concerning. I worry that by blaming the violence exclusively on inceldom we risk reducing the violence to just another “culture war” topic, a political football to make arguments with.*Dan, 27, Kent‘Young people need to feel seen – they need us to acknowledge their pain’View image in fullscreen‘We shouldn’t shame this behaviour – we should understand it’ … Olivia.Photograph: Olivia/Guardian CommunityAfter watching the show, I found myself reflecting on what the character, Jamie, really needed. It became clear that his pain wasn’t about being the most attractive or popular – it was about not feeling enough, not feeling seen. Young people don’t always need an adult to tell them what is wrong with social media or what to be afraid of. They already know that. What they need is for us to acknowledge the pain they’re carrying, whether it’s from a friend betraying them, or from the crushing feeling that no one is paying attention to them. They need to know that their feelings are valid, and that it’s OK to hurt. We shouldn’t shame the behaviour that comes from these feelings; we should understand it, and work with it.Olivia, 21, works for a youth organisation,Bentleigh, Melbourne‘I’ve seen it first-hand – my ex-boyfriend got into Andrew Tate’I’ve seen it first-hand with boys falling down this pipeline, unfortunately – it’s scary how much someone can change because of it. I remember noticing it with my ex-boyfriend. We were both 16 at the time, and he and his friends started getting into Andrew Tate and spouting really toxic views. Within a few weeks we had broken up because he had started losing basic respect for me, while his friends started speaking about women as simply a hole and not much more. Around the same time, a friend of mine was getting death threats after she rejected a boy (who was known to be in the incel community at the time). Luckily, nothing ever came of it, but I remember her not bothering to go to our teachers since she thought they wouldn’t do anything, as he was perceived as a “good, misunderstood kid”.*Lydia, 19, sales assistant, Essex‘The lack of voice or perspective from the victims seemed a strange omission’View image in fullscreen‘The pressure on girls from misogyny should have been investigated’ … Joseph.Photograph: Joseph/Guardian CommunityThere is no question that the camerawork was technically very impressive, as was the acting. However, I was quite surprised that there wasn’t more criticism of the absence of Katie, Jamie’s victim, or her family, and with little depth given to her best friend who is only briefly seen. While the pressures on young men are obviously important to investigate, as is the pressure on women and girls from the resultant misogyny – and the lack of any voice or perspective from the victims seemed a strange omission.Joseph, student, Shropshire‘Unfortunately entirely accurate’Absolutely stunning and unfortunately entirely accurate. Kids are young but they’re the oldest they’ve ever been. And they’re consuming content aimed even older. In that gap is where insecurity, self-loathing and anticipation can really grow. Not to mention a whirlwind of hormones.*Jennifer, 23, works in marketing, Sydney‘It didn’t live up to the hype’View image in fullscreen‘The whodunnit tone felt confused to me’ … Rosie.Photograph: Rosie/Guardian CommunityI didn’t think Adolescence lived up to the hype. Episodes one and three were great, but episode two was awful and I didn’t finish the last one. The tone felt confused – even though the writers said that the show is not meant to be a whodunnit, episode two was still framed as one as it revolved around the search for the murder weapon. For this reason, it didn’t work at all for me. I think the show would have been much better if the tone was more consistent, and Jamie’s misogyny and how it led to violence had been explored further.Rosie, 21, student, Glasgow‘I’m just so scared of this social environment we’re in’I think it’s one of the most important shows for this age and generation. I thought it was really well done in actually exploring the harmful realities of social media and our online presence – and not in a “social media bad” kind of way. I have a younger brother who goes to an all-boys school and I’m constantly checking on what he talks about, what his friends do and what he’s looking at online. I even point out explicitly when it’s misogynistic or inappropriate because I’m just so scared of this social environment that we’re in. *Katie, 18, Sydney*Names have been changedIn the UK, the charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393 andChildlineon 0800 1111.

Probably not what the new owners want it to. It sounds like an accountancy practice. This is laughably see-through and we are already talking about it as a desperate pivot.”Modella has made clear that the brand is “not a reference to any individual”, a point taken to heart by fans of Thomas George “TG” Jones, the “prince of centre halves”who played for Everton and Wales in the 1930s and 1940s and died in 2004.Jones’s Wikipedia pagehas been rapidly updated to reflect that he is not associated with either WH Smith or TGJones, although in later life he did end up running a newsagent in North Wales.And naturally, the debate about Smith and Jones conjures memories ofAlas Smith and Jones, the BBC comedy series of the 1980s and 1990s starring Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones.To further reinforce that the new name is a branding-lite facsimile of WH Smith, an internal email to staff has said that Modella has “chosen to keep the blue and white brand colours which you will all be familiar with”, for “a sense of reassuring continuity”.“It feels incredibly close, a poor mirror of WH Smith and not necessarily very well thought through,” says Charlotte Black, the chief strategy officer at Saffron Brand Consultants. “I would say it feels hasty – an ‘insert here’ strategy – and a bit of a missed opportunity. Buying the high street stores could have been a blank sheet of paper to put a lot of meaning behind what the future offering might be for the public.”WH Smith is the latest in a string of once-ubiquitous names to disappear from high streets, including Debenhams, Topshop, Woolworths and Littlewoods, and rebrandings have a decidedly patchy history of working out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the 1980s, River Island’s switch from Chelsea Girl andKendall’s to Nextalso proved successful.While the first public outing of the TGJones name has been an inauspicious start for WH Smith’s new owners, the replacement of such a venerable household was always likely to have come in for criticism.“When it comes down to putting out a new name, especially dealing with such an iconic legacy brand, there is always going to be a lot of negative sentiment,” says Black. “By just changing the name in the way they have, they now really need to come swiftly to what their new value proposition is going to be.“They could have used the new name as a way to ignite change.

Adrian Horton and Lorenzo Tondo reportEarlier this month,No Other Land won the Oscar for best documentary feature. The film chronicles the West Bank community of Masafer Yatta as it resists being driven off its land by settler violence and the demolitions of the Israeli military. The film’s two protagonists, Palestinian film-maker Basel Adra and Israeli film-maker Yuval Abraham, gave speeches when they accepted their award.Yuval Abraham: “We live in a regime where I am free under civilian law and Basel is under military laws that destroy his life … There is a different path, a political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people.”In the global spotlight alongside the pair were the film’s other co-directors, Rachel Szor and Hamdan Ballal.Adrian Horton, an arts writer for Guardian US, explains toMichael Safithe challenges that the film had to overcome during its production and the fact that despite huge critical success,No Other Landdid face difficulty in the run-up to the Oscars.And on Monday, only a few weeks after the awards ceremony, co-directorHamdan Ballal was attacked by settlers and detained by the Israeli military. He describes to Guardian correspondentLorenzo Tondowhat he believes happened that night and how since the Oscar win the Masafer Yatta community has experienced even more violence than before.Tondo explains that many analysts believe settler violence is part of a broader attempt by the Israeli state to annex the West Bank during the current Trump presidency. Horton adds that at the same time, the currentUS administration has created a chilling effect on the distribution of some political documentaries.Photograph: Hazem Bader/AFP/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsNo Other LandToday in FocusWest BankPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelDocumentary filmsOscars"

Gelernt is the deputy director of the ACLU’s immigrants’ rights project and lead counsel in the case.As the executive branch continues to battle the constitutionally coequal judiciary branch for primacy, the US justice department said in its filing on Friday that the case presents the question of who decides how to conduct sensitive national security-related operations, the president or the judiciary.“The Constitution supplies a clear answer: the President,” the department wrote. “The republic cannot afford a different choice.“On 15 March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime statute allowing the government to expel foreign nationals considered to be enemies to the US. When invoking the act, Trump, without proof, claimed that theVenezuelan gangTren de Aragua had “infiltrated” the US at the behest of the Venezuelan government.‘Deported because of his tattoos’: has the US targeted Venezuelans for their body art?Read moreA US intelligence document accessed by the New York Times contradicts Trump’s claim about the Venezuelan government’s ties to the gang.That day, attorneys filed an emergency motion to block the use of the Alien Enemies Act to expel migrantsto El Salvador. Then planes took off from the US, transporting the nearly 300 immigrants accused of being gang members. As the planes were in mid-air, a federal judge in Washington blocked the use of the Alien Enemies Act to expel the immigrants, but the Venezuelans were not returned to the US.Despite theTrump administrationin its supreme court filing claiming that it engaged in a “rigorous process” to identify members of the Venezuelan gang, news stories are increasingly placing those claims into question. Family members of many of the deported Venezuelan migrants deny the alleged gang ties. This month, the US district judge James Boasberg ordered the Trump administration to engage in “individualized hearings” for immigrants accused of being members of Tren de Aragua.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationUS supreme courtTrump administrationLaw (US)El SalvadorDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

As a sovereign country – not as what he pretends we are – and on a comprehensive deal,” Carney said earlier this week.Trump said in the post that he and Carney, who has previously served as governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, “agree on many things” and that the pair would be meeting “immediately” after Canada’s federal election on 28 April.In areadout of the conversationreleased by the prime minister’s office, Carney described the call as a “very constructive conversation” and said the two would begin “comprehensive negotiations about a new economic and security relationship” after the election. Carney said he would be “working hard for the next month to earn the right to represent Canada in those discussions”.On Sunday, Carney called a snap election following numerous polls that show adramatic and unprecedented surge for his Liberal party. Current projections have the Liberals winning a majority government, a stark reversal from their dismal fortunes as recently as late February.Ahead of the call with Trump, Carney told reporters the conversation would be “only the beginning of a negotiation, not the end”.In fiery rhetoric since Trump launched his trade war and began threatening to make Canada the 51st US state, the prime ministerlamented the collapse of relationsbetween the two nations.Mark Carney laments Canada’s lost friendship with US in visit to 9/11 townRead more“It is clear that the United States is no longer a reliable partner. It is possible that, with comprehensive negotiations, we will be able to restore some trust, but there will be no turning back,” Carney told reporters in Ottawa earlier.“We will need to dramatically reduce our reliance on the United States,” he said. “We will need to pivot our trade relationships elsewhere.”Earlier this week, the White Houseannounced 25% tariffsthat threaten to destroy Canada’s auto sector. More than 1m cars and light trucks are manufactured in Canada for export to the US. Washington also promised “reciprocal tariffs” against any levies imposed by trading partners in response that it feels are unfair to American consumers.In the call, Carney also said his government would implement retaliatory tariffs “to protect Canadian workers and our economy” ahead of expected levies from the US due to come into effect on 2 April.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyDonald TrumpTrump tariffsAmericasUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

That’s why we’ve formally initiated the process of applying for licences and permits under the existing US seabed mining code.”View image in fullscreenThe International Seabed Authority talks in Kingston, Jamaica.Photograph: IISDLeticia Carvalho, the secretary general of the International Seabed Authority, a UN body set up to govern deep sea mining, has expressed “deep concern” over TMC’s announcement.At a meeting of delegates on Friday, Carvalho said: “All exploration and exploitation activities in the Area must be carried out under the Authority’s control.“Any unilateral action would constitute a violation of international law and directly undermine the fundamental principles of multilateralism, the peaceful use of the oceans and the collective governance framework” set up under the treaty.Countries have been meeting in Jamaica this week at the UN-affiliated International Seabed Authority (ISA) to decide rules governing the extraction of metals such as copper and cobalt from the seabed.They also discussed actions to take if a mining application was submitted before regulations were set. The ISA council has said no application should be considered before its rules are finalised, which is a long way off.The Metals Company said it had initiated a process under the US Department of Commerce to apply for exploration and permits to extract minerals from the ocean floor. It plans to apply under the 1980Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Actinstead of the ISA, and is moving forward “with urgency”.TMC has already carried out extensive exploratory work in theClarion-Clipperton Zone, an area of the Pacific Ocean seabed between Mexico and Hawaii that is rich in polymetallic nodules but also a wealth of newly discovered species.The ISA, established in 1994 under a treaty ratified by 169 member states plus the EU, has jurisdiction over mining in international waters and decides how extraction should proceed. However, the US has never ratified the treaty.Deep-sea mining: why is interest growing and what are the risks?Read moreLouisa Casson, a campaigner for Greenpeace International, said: “This announcement is a slap in the face to international cooperation,” adding that it was “an insult to multilateralism”.Duncan Currie, legal adviser for the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, said: “TMC appears to want to pivot from seabed mining without regulations to seabed mining entirely outside of all international frameworks. A moratorium is needed to prevent this kind of international conflict, discord and chaos.”Georgina María Guillén Grillo, a representative from Costa Rica at the ISA talks, told the New York Times: “This seems a totally improper move by the Metals Company.”Explore more on these topicsDeep-sea miningSeascape: the state of our oceansUS politicsMining (Environment)Mining (Business)CanadaAmericasOceansnewsShareReuse this content"

European carmakers alone sold more than 750,000 vehicles to American drivers.France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Thursday he had told his US counterpart that tariffs were not a good idea. They “disrupt value chains, create an inflationary effect and destroy jobs. So it’s not good for the US or European economies,” he said.Paris would work with the European Commission on a response intended to get Trump to reconsider, he said. Officials in Berlin also stressed that the commission would defend free trade as the foundation of the EU’s prosperity.1:28Donald Trump announces new 25% tariffs on cars from overseas – videoGermany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, bluntly described Trump’s decision as wrong, and said Washington appeared to have “chosen a path at whose end lie only losers, since tariffs and isolation hurt prosperity, for everyone”.France’s finance minister, Eric Lombard, called the US president’s plan “very bad news” and said the EU would be forced to raise its own tariffs. His German counterpart, Robert Habeck, promised a “firm EU response”. “We will not take this lying down,” he said.Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said Europe would approach the US with common sense but “not on our knees”. Good transatlantic relations are “a strategic matter” and must survive more than one prime minister and one president, he said.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, described the move as “bad for businesses, worse for consumers” because “tariffs are taxes”. She said the bloc would continue to seek negotiated solutions while protecting its economic interests.The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the tariffs were “very concerning” and that his government would be “pragmatic and clear-eyed” in response. The UK “does not want a trade war, but it’s important we keep all options on the table”, he said.One option for Canada is to impose excise duties on exports of oil, potash and other commodities. “Nothing is off the table to defend our workers and our country,” said Carney, who added that the old economic and security relationship between Canada and the US was over.South Korea said it would put in place a full emergency response to Trump’s proposed measures by April.China’s foreign ministry said the US approach violated World Trade Organization rules and was “not conducive to solving its own problems”. Its spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, said: “No country’s development and prosperity are achieved by imposing tariffs.”The Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, said Tokyo was putting “all options on the table”.Japan“makes the largest amount of investment to the US, so we wonder if it makes sense for [Washington] to apply uniform tariffs to all countries”, he said.Reuters and Agence-France Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationAutomotive industryFranceGermanyEuropean UnionPolandnewsShareReuse this content"

Its epicentre was about 11 miles (17.2km) from Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city.Min Aung Hlaing, the chief of Myanmar’s junta, said he expected the death toll to rise and urged “any country, any organisation” to help with relief efforts – a rare request from the isolated military government. The junta said blood was in high demand in the worst-affected areas as concerns grew about how rescuers would even reach some parts of a country already enduring a widespread humanitarian crisis.Thai authorities said eight of the nine reported deaths happened after the high-rise building crashed to the ground in the capital. Rescuers are searching for another 81 people trapped in the rubble. Damage was also reported in China.In Myanmar, witnesses and local media said people had been killed in the city of Mandalay and in the towns Toungoo and Aungban. Hundreds of casualties were taken to a hospital in the capital, Naypyidaw, where injured people were being treated outside because of damage to the building.A rescue worker from Amarapura, an ancient city and now a township of Mandalay, said the bodies of 30 people had been recovered from collapsed multistorey apartment blocks.“I have never experienced anything like this before – our town looks like a collapsed city,” he said, estimating that about a fifth of the buildings had been destroyed.“We received calls for help from people from the inside, but we cannot help because we do not have enough manpower and machines to remove the debris, but we will not stop working.”1:11Moment skyscraper under construction collapses in Bangkok after earthquake – videoThe scale of the damage in Myanmar is yet to become clear, though social media footage emerging from central regions has shown many buildings collapsed or damaged.In Bangkok, authorities declared the city a disaster area, saying they needed to assess and monitor damaged areas and help people who may still be at risk. People ran out on to the streets in panic, many of them hotel guests in bathrobes and swimming costumes, as water cascaded down from an elevated pool at one luxury hotel. In the northern tourist destination of Chiang Mai, where the power briefly went out, stunned residents also hurried outside, unsure how to respond.“I quickly rushed out of the shop along with other customers,” said Sai, 76, who was working at a minimart in Chiang Mai when the shop started to shake. “This is the strongest tremor I’ve experienced in my life,” Sai told Agence France-Presse.Mohamed Riyas, the regional director of the International Rescue Committee, said the earthquake’s impact was likely to be severe and could displace thousands of people, leaving them in need of food, shelter and medical aid.“We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake, as communication network lines are down and transport is disrupted,” he added. “The damage to infrastructure and homes, loss of life, and injuries sustained by communities affected should not be underestimated.”Map showing the location of the earthquakeThe UN secretary general, António Guterres, offered his condolences and said regional networks were mobilising to help those in need.Myanmar’s junta, which has lost swathes of territory to armed groups, declared a state of emergency across the six worst-affected regions. As well as the call for international aid, state TV made a domestic appeal for medical supplies and blood donations because of what it said were “so many” injuries in three urban centres.The quake will further stretch Myanmar’s ruling military. The anti-junta militias, known as the people’s defence forces, said their troops would provide humanitarian help.Footage reportedly taken inside Mandalay airport showed people racing to safety through dusty hallways, the floor scattered with ceiling panels. The videos, published by local media, show panicked people crouching on the floor outside the airport for safety.View image in fullscreenThe damaged emergency department of a hospital in Naypyidaw.Photograph: Sebastien Berger/AFP/Getty ImagesA witness in Mandalay, who asked not to be named, said eight people had been killed and others were feared to be trapped after a construction building in Pyigyitagon township collapsed. “The whole of Mandalay city was affected by the earthquake. The rescue teams and hospitals are now overrun. We are managing with the resources we have in the neighbourhood,” they said.Images published by Khit Thit Media, a news agency based in Myanmar, showed piles of bricks and rubble outside a damaged mosque, also in Mandalay. At least 20 people had died there, it reported, though it was not possible to verify this figure.At least three people were also killed after a mosque in Toungoo, in Bago region, partly collapsed, two witnesses told Reuters. “We were saying prayers when the shaking started … Three died on the spot,” said a witness. Local media reported that at least two people died and 20 were injured after a hotel collapsed in Aungban.0:41Water cascades down side of high-rise Bangkok hotel during earthquake – videoA spokesperson for the World Health Organization described the earthquake as “a huge event” that posed “a very, very big threat to life and health”, adding: “We’ve activated our logistics hub to look particularly for trauma supplies and things like external fixators, because we expect that there will be many, many injuries that need to be dealt with.”A programme coordinator for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, Marie Manrique, in a briefing from Yangon, said: “Public infrastructure has been damaged including roads, bridges and public buildings. We currently have concerns for large-scale dams that people are watching to see the conditions of them. We anticipate the impact to be quite large.”Myanmar has been gripped by conflict since the military seized power in February 2021 in a coup widely opposed by the public. It has since launched brutal crackdowns on any forms of opposition, and it is dangerous for journalists to operate inside the country.A senior UN official warned in November that2 million people in Myanmar’s Rakhine state could face starvationwithin months because fierce conflict and trade blockades had led to a “total economic collapse” and the imminent risk of famine.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarThailandAsia PacificEarthquakesSouth and central AsiaNatural disastersnewsShareReuse this content"

The US, he said, would also conduct bilateral special operations forces training in Batanes, near Taiwan.The defence secretary’s Manila visit, to be followed by trips to Tokyo and second world war battleground Iwo Jima, follows months of confrontations between Philippine and Chinese vessels in the disputedSouth China Sea.Beijing claims almost the entirety of the crucial waterway despite an international ruling that its assertion has no merit.“Friends need to stand shoulder to shoulder to deter conflict to ensure that there’s free navigation, whether you call it theSouth China Seaor the West Philippine Sea,” Hegseth said.“Peace through strength is a very real thing.”The trip – aimed at bolstering ties in the Asia-Pacific region amid rising tensions with Beijing – comes as Hegseth faces calls to resign by Democratic lawmakers and a Republican congressman’s push for an independent report.The US defence chief revealed details of strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels inYemenin a group of top administration officials on the messaging platform Signal, according to asenior journalist added to the chat by accident.Hegseth is expected to meet his Philippine counterpart, Gilberto Teodoro, on Friday.In response to China’s growing influence, the US has been strengthening alliances with countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including thePhilippines.Manila and Washington have deepened their defence cooperation since Marcos took office in 2022 and began pushing back on Beijing’s sweeping South China Sea claims.A new flashpoint has emerged at Sabina Shoal in the South China Sea – and a new dangerRead moreIn recent years, top US officials have warned that an “armed attack” against the Philippines in the waterway would invoke the two countries’ mutual defence treaty. They have expanded the sharing of military intelligence and boosted to nine the number of bases US troops have access to on the archipelago.Given the Philippines’ proximity to Taiwan and its surrounding waters, Manila’s cooperation would be crucial in the event of a conflict with China.Hegseth’s visit overlaps with bilateral military exercises that will expand in April to include the countries’ navies and air forces.The Signal chat leak raises questions about accountability in Trump’s cabinetRead moreDespite mounting pressure over the Signal leak, Donald Trump has defended Hegseth. “Hegseth is doing a great job, he had nothing to do with this,” said the US president when asked by AFP whether the defence secretary should be considering his position.He also repeated his insistence that no classified information was shared in the breach, adding that national security adviser Mike Waltz “took responsibility” for the error.Waltz added Goldberg to the group chat that included Hegseth, the vice-president, JD Vance, the national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, and others.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesSouth China SeaAsia PacificUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

At the Boao Forum for Asia, a conference in south China’s Hainan province, Chinese officials and academics stressed the need forpartnerships with global south countries. Despite its rapid economic growth in the past three decades, China still identifies as being part of this group.China can live with Trump’s tariffs – his bullish foreign policy will help Beijing in the long term | Steve TsangRead moreDing, China’s sixth-ranking official, said on Thursday that policies would be implemented this year to “stabilise foreign trade and investment”.At the Boao Forum, an annual business and political summit, the line-up of speakers reflected China’s diplomatic pivot towards low- and middle-income countries. The only head of state to participate was the Laos prime minister, Sonexay Siphandone, while the deputy prime ministers of Russia and Kazakhstan also attended. One panel featured a senior Iranian official who wasreportedly involvedin talks for Iran to acquire ammonium perchlorate, an explosive agent used in missiles, from China. The official told the Guardian he did not remember the reports and had not been involved in the negotiations.“The US is never on the side of the global south,” said Aravind Yelery, an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, on one panel, adding that countries like India should look “within the global south” for economic support. Yelery’s comments came as the Indian government is said to be in discussions about relaxing restrictions on Chinese trade and investment, which were put in place five years ago after clashes at the India-China border.US tariff resilienceA major theme at Boao was how Asian economies could improve their resilience against US tariffs. Ding said that countries should “resolutely oppose trade and investment protectionism”, a reference to the US levies.Zhang Yuyan, an economist from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, warned that the “major turbulence” of US policies would affect Asian economic outlooks, although he, along with a group of other researchers, nonetheless predicted Asia’s GDP growth would be 4.5% in 2025, a slight increase on 2024’s growth figures, in a report released on Tuesday.Huang Yiping, an economist from Peking University and an influential adviser to the People’s Bank of China, stressed the importance of countries co-operating without the US. “Barriers for trade are rising very quickly,” he said, warning that US-led globalisation could go into reverse.The comments come a few months after Xi Jinping, China’s leader, unveiled a raft of measures to support global south countries at the G20 summit in Brazil last year.China now has more than a dozen free trade agreements with global south countries, and the share of its exports bound for the US is shrinking, down to around 13% in 2023. But experts have noted that rising exports to South-east Asian countries may just represent companies shipping goods to the US via third countries to avoid tariffs. “A significant part of China’s trade with the global south is derivative of US demand,” said Brad Sester, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, in an interview earlier this year.But for all the talk of deepening trade – and political – relations with global south countries, many economists believe that the real answer to tariff-proofing China’s economylies in domestic demand. Policymakers expect exports to contribute little to China’s growth this year, meaning that they will have to turn to other levers to reach the 5% GDP growth target. As well as stabilising foreign investment, Ding said China would find ways to “comprehensively” expand domestic demand. Several provinces have been told to focus on boosting consumption rather than investment, although the mechanisms for doing this remain unclear, as many ordinary Chinese people still choose to save a higher share of their incomes than global averages.Huang, the Peking University economist, addressed this explicitly at Boao. “The priority for China is to boost domestic demand,” he told the forum, with another economist arguing that China should take steps to boost consumption’s share of GDP to 70% by 2035.Explore more on these topicsChinaInternational tradeGlobal economyAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

Groceries up by a staggering 30%.”According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, rents did rise by 18% between the March quarter in 2022 and December quarter in 2024.House prices have risen 6.5% nationally since May 2022, according to CoreLogic, and units 5.1%.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailOn grocery prices, Dutton appears to have taken the 30% figure froma Daily Telegraph secret shopping study in March. The ABS puts the increase in food costs at about 14% with only fats and oils surpassing the 30% increase mark.Power billsDutton said Australia has some of the highest power prices in the world. Specifically, that electricity was “up by 32%” this term despite Labor promising an average reduction of $275 per household, and that gas bills had increased by up to 43%. He blamed “Anthony Albanese and Chris Bowen’s reckless renewables-only policy train wreck”.Nuclear curious? Here’s what you need to know about the Coalition’s energy claimsRead moreElectricity and gas bills did rise significantly shortly after Labor was elected, but the experts say the hike was mostly not due to the rollout of solar and windfarms. It waslargely due to a rise in fossil fuel pricesafter Russia invaded Ukraine, and to a quarter of the country’s coal plants being offline during winter.ABS stats show electricity bills have actually fallen 10% between the March 2022 quarter and the December 2024 quarter, largely due to a series of government subsidies. The ABS indicates power bills in the December quarter would have been almost 50% higher but for billions of dollars in federal and state government rebates.Gas prices are up by 31% in the 33-month period, according to the ABS.Experts have said it is very likely the rises would have happened whoever was in government.It’s worth also noting Labor’s policy is not “renewables only” – it is renewable energy backed by “firming” from batteries, pumped hydro and fast-start gas plants.HealthDutton claims bulk-billing availability has fallen by 11 percentage points, resulting in 41m fewer bulk-billing claims.“On this government’s watch, bulk billing nationally has fallen by 11%. There’s 41m fewer bulk-billing episodes with GP services under this government, and more than 270 GP practices have closed under this government’s watch,” he said.“Australians should never have to choose between seeing a doctor or paying their bills.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAvoiding the doctor due to cost is at a 10-year high. Here’s why GP bulk billing needs to changeRead moreThe Australian Institute of Health and Welfare says the bulk-billing rate peaked in 2020 and 2021 at 89% after the Morrison government doubled the bulk-billing incentive for six months and required bulk-billing be applied to a number of services.In 2022 it fell back to 85% before dropping to 77% in 2023 and 78% for the first 10 months of 2024.Between 2021 and 2024 the fall was 11 percentage points, but that includes more than a year under the Morrison government.Is a flood of migrants driving up houses prices?Dutton claimed a million people came through Australia’s migration program in the Albanese government’s first two years in government – which, he said, amounted to 70% more migrants than in any two-year period in the country’s history.Analysis of the figures suggests that’s broadly accurate, although the ABS migration figures stretch back only as far as 1981.The opposition leader also linked these figures to the cost of housing.“Australians are generous and welcoming people, but they want migration to be sustainable and the government to be in control of it. Labor is neither in control of migration, nor has it kept migration at sustainable levels, and Australians know it,” he said.High migration levels do have an effect on house prices, but it’s not the primary driver as Dutton has suggested.Thepopulation is no largernow than it was expected to be before the pandemic. In other words, an unusually large rise in housing costs has not been matched by an unusually large rise in the population.Dutton also said Labor’s housing policies had not delivered a single new home.Peter Dutton keeps blaming migration for the housing crisis. But can it really be that simple?Read moreIt’s true that no new houses have been built from scratch under the $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund, although a number have been acquired or renovated to an acceptable living standard where they were not before.Under the $2bn Social Housing Accelerator, 402 social housing dwellingshave been completedacross the country, including some from scratch, but the majority have also been acquired and refurbished.A ‘national gas emergency’?Dutton said Labor had “created a national gas emergency due to insufficient supply” and as a result the country was facing “blackouts and brownouts” and energy rationing. He said the Coalition would create a gas reservation policy that would require gas companies to supply an extra 10-20% of gas locally, rather than export it.Australia does not have a gas emergency. The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) has said it expectsan annual shortage in southern states from 2029– later than previously forecast – unless more supply is found. Some steps are being taken to address it. Aemo proposed new production, new gas storage facilities and short-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. Analysts have suggested an additional option: doing more to cut gas demand by replacing it where possible with renewable electricity.The potential medium-term gas shortfall is not putting the national electricity grid at risk of blackouts and brownouts. Relatively little gas is used in the national grid supplying the eastern states – it providedonly 5.2% of generation in the past year– and the reliability of the system has remained within the target band. When concern about potential shortages has been raised on particular days it has mostly been due to old coal plants being offline.Peter Dutton’s new energy plan sounds like a gas. In reality it means more emissions – and more profits for industry | Tim BuckleyRead moreAemo has suggested there could be reliability issues if all proposed new renewable generation is not built roughly within the proposed timeframe. Labor has taken steps to accelerate the rollout – the Coalition has said it would slow it.Few details were available about the Coalition’s gas reservation policy, but it is worth noting that its rationale that Australians are using more gas – as claimed by the resources spokesperson, Susan McDonald – is not backed by data. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found gas demand in eastern Australia, not counting that used for LNG exports, had fallen 32% since peaking in 2012-13.Rewiring the NationDutton said the Coalition would “end the reckless $20bn Rewiring the Nation Fund” and stop the rollout of 28,000km of new transmission lines under Labor.That will be difficult as $16.75bn of the funding has already been allocated to the states and territories, including transmission links to the Snowy Hydro 2.0 project and Marinus Link to Tasmania, both of which have had Coalition support. Rather than 28,000km, Labor says it is planning about 10,000km of new or strengthened transmission lines, consistent with what Aemo calls a “step change scenario” in the grid. About 4,500km has to be built by 2030.The funding for Rewiring the Nation is not a direct cost on the federal budget. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation manages it as a series of loans issued at below market rates. The loans are designed make the government a profit.Explore more on these topicsAustralian budget 2025Election Reality CheckAustralian election 2025Australian politicsAnthony AlbanesePeter DuttonanalysisShareReuse this content"

Helater told the ABC this price drop could be achieved by the end of this year.But experts were frustrated at the lack of detail on how a Coalition government could implement such a plan.Dutton unveils gas reservation scheme and vows to sack 41,000 public service workers in ‘sliding doors’ budget replyRead more“What was announced by the Coalition is not policy – it’s lines in a speech,” said Stephanie Bashir, chief executive of energy analysts Nexa Advisory, who said a “well-considered and permanent gas reservation policy” had long been needed.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAccording to theAustralian Energy Market Operator, seasonal shortfalls in gas supply for the southern states could occur by 2028 “with annual supply gaps emerging from 2029”.Australian Energy Producers, the body representing the gas industry, said Dutton’s plan to “artificially reduce prices” was a “damaging market intervention that will drive away investment and exacerbate the supply challenges in the longer term”.Gas is ... unequivocally more expensive than renewables and batteriesStephanie BashirTony Wood, the director of the Grattan Institute’s energy program, who has previously worked in the gas industry, said there was little detail on how the Coalition might simultaneously force more gas into the domestic market and push the price down.“That’s a huge intervention in the market,” he said, adding if the Coalition’s proposals slowed the move to renewables, emissions would rise.The Guardian asked the Coalition for more detail on how it planned to divert gas to the domestic market and if it was planning to place restrictions on LNG exports, but did not get a reply before deadline.Currently, LNG companies can opportunistically sell gas not tied to long-term contracts in spot markets internationally or domestically.The Coalition has said that, if elected, it wants to increase the use of gas and keep coal plants running for longer while it builds taxpayer-funded nuclear reactors.Gas has been identified by the electricity industry as an important backstop to cover times when renewable energy generation is low. But gas is one of the most expensive forms of electricity on the market.Tristan Edis, a director and analyst at Green Energy Markets, said even if gas prices did fall to $10 a gigajoule, “it still leaves us with expensive electricity if we are going to significantly increase our reliance on gas”.“Coal power plants typically have a fuel cost that is half that level, so if they are replaced with gas instead of renewables, then power prices will go up,” he said.He said a new gas-fired power plant would need to charge about $170 per MW-hour to recover its costs if gas cost $10 per gigajoule.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the rain eases on Sunday morning, winds are expected to pick up, and temperatures are forecast to reach 25C.Showers are also expected in Melbourne as a cool change pushes through, with a top of 22C forecast on Saturday and 21C on Sunday.On Friday, heavy rain continued to drenchalready soddencommunities across inland Queensland, many still isolated as more than 200 roads remained closed due to flooding.Queensland communities cut off by flood waters after up to a year’s worth of rain dumped across outbackRead moreA severe weather warning for heavy rainfall remained in place for parts of the Maranoa, Warrego, Darling Downs and the Granite Belt, with 24-hour rainfall totals of 50 to 100mm likely. The Bureau of Meteorology also issued a severe thunderstorm warning for heavy rainfall for the state’s central coast, Whitsundays and Capricornia districts.Teemburra Dam, west of Mackay, recorded 274mm in the 24 hours to 9am Friday, according to the bureau’s senior meteorologist Jonathan How.He said multiple flood warnings remained in place across the state, including major flood warnings for the Pioneer, Warrego, Paroo, Bulloo, Thomson, Barcoo, Georgina and Western rivers and Cooper and Eyre creeks.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAccording to How, the deep and slow-moving trough, which has been funnelling tropical moisture on to inland areas, was finally starting to shift towards the coast. “The system is finally getting a move on,” he said.Brisbane residents and communities in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales were reminded to keep an eye on the rain and any flood warnings, How said. “It has been so wet, it won’t take much to see rivers and creeks rise.”Saturday would also be a “very wet day” on the NSW coast, he said. And even as the rain cleared on Sunday, the wild weather would continue as powerful winds affected the east coast.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You have underinvested in the people of Greenland and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass.”Speaking alongside US troops, as well as Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who is at the centre of theSignal message group security breach, Waltz’s wife, Julia Nesheiwat, the US energy secretary, Chris Wright, and the senator for Utah, Mike Lee, he said the Trump administration’s “argument” was not with the people of Greenland. It was, he said, “with the leadership in Denmark”, which he accused of having underinvested in Greenland and its security.“That simply must change,” he added. “It is the policy of the United States that that will change.”Greenland, he said, would better off “coming under the United States’s security umbrella than you have been under Denmark’s security umbrella”. He claimed the territory was not being kept safe by Denmark “from a lot of very aggressive incursions from Russia, from China and other nations.”Shortly after he flew into the ice-locked US military base of Pituffik in north-west Greenland with his wife, Usha, and other senior US officials on Friday, the vice-president told US troops he was “really interested in Arctic security”.“As you all know, it’s a big issue and it’s only going to get bigger over the coming decades,” he said. Vance also said it was “cold as shit here” as he arrived to temperatures of -19C.1:55'It’s cold as shit': US vice-president arrives in Greenland – videoIn the White House, Trump reiterated his previous claims that the US needs Greenland for “world peace”.“I think Greenland understands that the United States should own it,” he said in a press conference on Friday. “And if Denmark and the EU don’t understand it, we have to explain it to them. We need Greenland. Very importantly, for international security, we have to have Greenland.”There are, he claimed, “Chinese and Russian ships all over the place”.Hours before Vance’s arrival, in Nuuk political leaders agreed to form a broad four-party coalition government in a show of national unity. In a rebuke to the Trump administration and its public campaign to gain control of Greenland, four of the territory’s five parties signed the coalition agreement on Friday, which states on page one: “Greenland belongs to us.”There has been a week of heightened tension, amid already strained relations between the US, Greenland and Denmark as a result of Trump’s repeated threats to acquire Greenland. Writing on social media before his plane landed,JD Vancesaid: “We’re on our way and looking forward to it!”Greenland, a former Danish colony, is a semi-autonomous territory within the kingdom of Denmark, its foreign and security policies run by Copenhagen.‘Welcome to the top of the world’: the Pituffik US space base in GreenlandRead moreEarlier in the week, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, accused the US of putting“unacceptable pressure”on Greenland and Denmark to give up the territory, adding: “It is pressure that we will resist.”On Thursday Trump renewed his vow to take control of the island: “We need Greenland for national security and international security. So we’ll go as far as we have to go. We need Greenland. And the world needs us to have Greenland, including Denmark. Denmark has to have us have Greenland. And we’ll see what happens. But if we don’t have Greenland, we can’t have great international security.”The US delegation took off from Maryland and were due to fly directly to the ice-locked American military base, built after a 1951 defence agreement between Denmark and the US – with no further stops on the island now planned by the vice-president or his wife.The delegation’s plans were hastily rescheduled just days before to cut out visits to the capital, Nuuk, and a dog sled race in Sisimiut after widespread outrage in Nuuk and Copenhagen over the unsolicited trip. Originally the second lady was scheduled to travel without the vice-president.Under the changed plans, understood to include a “traditional” troop visit, Vance made an address from the base at 5.45pm GMT.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The most US-friendly party, Naleraq, which came second in the election, left the talks on Monday, and will not be part of the coalition.The first page of the coalition agreement states that “no one” should have any doubt that “Greenland belongs to us.“We decide our own future. We must choose our partners ourselves. And we are the ones who dictate the pace in this regard,” it reads.“We must show the world that we are a people and a country that stands together in prosperity and adversity. Our unity as a people must always outweigh political disagreements in individual areas.”In response to a reporter’s question about Vance, the new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said the US had not shown respect for Greenland. “JD Vance is landing at a facility that is theirs [the US base]. This whole situation of coming to visit when there is no government in place, we insist, is not showing respect for an ally. It’s a shame, but now we have a government that needs to get its act together,” he said.Map of GreenlandFrederiksen congratulated Greenland’s new prime minister, saying: “I wish Jens-Frederik Nielsen and the rest of the Greenland government all the best for your work and for Greenland.“And I look forward to close cooperation in an unnecessarily conflict-filled time. Strong with a broad government and unity between different political parties. You show the strength of democracy.”Denmark’s King Frederik said: “There should be no doubt about my love for Greenland, and my connection to the Greenlandic people is intact.”The new coalition has also stated that it will work to significantly increase Greenland’s self-determination. “A clear roadmap must be drawn up as soon as possible for which areas it is realistic to take back, after which the process must be initiated,” it stated.The former Greenlandic prime minister, Múte B Egede, leader of Inuit Ataqatigiit, who will now be minister for finance and taxes, said that it is only together that Greenland can “meet the great pressure from outside”.The leader of Siumut, Vivian Motzfeldt, said: “We have listened to the Greenlandic population. We have listened to the need for us to be united as the Greenlandic population. We must be able to look forward and not get stuck in the past.”She added: “It is important that we gather our strengths, our identity and our culture.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandJD VanceDonald TrumpUS foreign policyDenmarkEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It “protected the territory from Nazi occupation” in the 1940s and made an offer to buy the island that was rebuffed. Even going back to 1910, the US had designs on Greenland, the Russian leader noted, calling the US plans “serious” with “longstanding historical roots”.Then Putin moved on to Alaska, which was sold by the Russian empire to the US in 1867 in what has become a national case of seller’s remorse. “Let me remind you that by 1868, the purchase of Alaska was ridiculed in American newspapers,” Putin continued. Now, he said, the purchase under president Andrew Johnson had been vindicated.In short, Putin concluded, get over it. Big countries have territorial ambitions. Deals for land and annexations are not just historical relics – they are a modern reality. And, rejecting generations of international norms not to take territory by force or through extortion, it is none of our business what they do over there.“As for Greenland, this is an issue that concerns two specific states and has nothing to do with us,” Putin said, while adding that Russia would continue to defend its interests in the Arctic from “dangerous” powers such as Finland and Sweden.It does not take a Kremlinologist to understand why Putin has come out in support of Trump’s annexation plan. As US power recedes inEurope, the Kremlin is seizing its chance to establish its long-awaited “multipolar world” in which it holds dominion over a sphere of influence, particularly in Ukraine and Belarus. Putin has railed against US hegemony since his Munich speech of 2007, and he finally has a US president who is just as derisive of the postwar order as he is.Putin’s mantra that countries should mind their own business dovetails closely with Trump’s transactional view of the world, as well as his deep suspicion of transnational organisations and alliances set up after the second world war.Those range from the United Nations, to the international criminal court, to even foreign economic blocs such as the EU, which he said was “formed in order to screw the United States”.“The postwar global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us,” said Marco Rubio during his Senate confirmation hearing in January. He is among the more moderate members of Trump’s cabinet. Those toward the more extreme, including Vance, have elevated “restrainers” seeking to accelerate the US withdrawal from Europe or even openly antagonise the US’s erstwhile allies.But as US power recedes abroad, the White House has declared ambitions throughout the western hemisphere in a turn that some commentators have compared to theMonroe doctrineof 1823, under which the US proclaimed itself theprotector of the hemisphere. And with each soundbite declaring that the US should take back the Panama canal or that Canada should become the 51st state, Trump will find an enthusiastic ally in the Kremlin who will see his jaded vision of a new world order reflected in another.Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinDonald TrumpJD VanceGreenlandEuropeRussiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

On Thursday at a summit in Paris, European leaders led by France and the UK reiterated their support forVolodymyr Zelenskyyand Ukraine.Few experts consider the Russian demand that Ukraine holds elections to be realistic, but the Kremlin has tried to highlight Kyiv’s decision not to hold a presidential poll while the war continues as a precondition for achieving a final settlement, as US-brokered peace negotiations proceed slowly.On Tuesday, the White House announced that Ukraine and Russia had agreed to maritime and energy infrastructure ceasefires – but both sides claimed there were fresh violations on Friday as the land war continued unabated.In Ukraine, the governor of Poltava region said storage sites for spare parts used by gas supplier Naftogaz were struck by a Russian drone. Russia’s ministry of defence said a gas metering station in the border village of Sudzha in Kursk province had been struck by US-made Himars missiles.Ukraine’s general staff said the attack in Poltava showed that “the Russian aggressor cynically continues to lie about its aspirations for peace” – while Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “The Ukrainian armed forces aren’t following orders from the country’s leadership”.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said it was premature to expect fresh higher level talks between the US and Russia to try to achieve a breakthrough. Asked by a reporter as he flew back from a tour of the Caribbean, he said before that, “I think you have to make more progress on a technical level”.Ukrainian officials also confirmed on Friday that the US had revised a proposed deal for the jointexploitation of minerals and rare earthsin the country amid briefings that the new terms were dramatically more favourable to the US.The new proposal stipulates that a joint investment fund be set up and the US would be given the first option to buy resources extracted until it recoups the aid money it has given Ukraine plus 4% interest. Only after that could Ukraine access the fund’s profits.A previous proposal, which Zelenskyy had travelled to the US to sign with Trump before he was dragged into arow with the US leader in the Oval Office, had proposed a 50/50 split.Yuliia Svyrydenko, Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, would not be drawn into a detailed discussion of the suggested terms, telling the country’s parliament that a public debate would harm the country’s position.But she confirmed a US proposal had been received and Ukraine was formulating its response. “This is a working version that essentially reflects the position of the American legal advisers. We are forming our own position, and the process is currently formalised,” she told legislators.The pressure group Global Witness said the US demands were extreme. Dominic Kavakeb, a co-director of campaigns, described the reported terms as “the pure, unabashed exploitation of Ukraine as the price to avoid total devastation at the hands of Putin. This is neo-colonialism laid bare.”Ukraine suspended elections when it introduced martial law after Russia’s full scale invasion in February 2022. Zelenskyy’s five-year term was supposed to end last May, but a vote is not expected to be held until security conditions allow – and there is little public pressure to have one.Russia, where presidential elections are heavily managed and not considered to be free or fair, has been highlighting the democratic hiatus in Ukraine as a talking point in its favour as initial US-brokered peace talks have begun.At times a similar position has been adopted by Trump, who last monthdescribed Zelenskyy as a “dictator”with a 4% approval rating, although a poll from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology published in early March put the figure at 68%.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinUS foreign policyDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

As he had already spent more than a year on remand, Alves was released under legal supervision shortly afterwards.Now the appeal court, presided over by two female judges and one male, has ruled unanimously that the conviction was unsafe because of what it described as a “series of gaps, inaccuracies, inconsistencies and contradictions over the facts, the judicial assessment and their consequences”.The court added that the victim’s claim that she had non-consensual sex in a VIP bathroom in the Sutton nightclub in Barcelona on New Year’s Eve 2022 was undermined because she was “an unreliable witness” whose testimony could not be verified. “Her story doesn’t correspond with reality,” they decided. In their ruling, the judges also stated that during the trial Alves’s right to the presumption of innocence had been denied.The prosecution had demanded a nine-year sentence. As part of his conviction, the court ordered Alves to pay €150,000 (£125,000) in compensation to the victim, banned him from approaching the victim’s home or place of work, and from communicating with her by any means for nine years. At the time, the then Catalan equality minister, Tania Vergè, described the conviction as “a milestone” following a series of high-profile footballers being accused of sexual assault and avoiding prosecution.Alves won dozens of titles with clubs including Sevilla, Barcelona, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain and played 126 times for Brazil, including at three World Cups. He helped Brazil win two Copa Américas and an Olympic gold medal.The defender played for Barcelona from 2008-16, briefly rejoined the club in 2022 and still has a residence near the city. Alves was with the Mexican club Pumas when arrested and immediately had his contract terminated.Explore more on these topicsFootballSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Since Brexit, it has been impossible for British eel fishers to export glass eels to restocking projects in EU countries, but a loophole made it permissible to catch and export elvers to non-EU destinations in their natural European range if they were used for conservation purposes, such as restocking lakes or rivers.Wood said a ban on eel exports to Russia would stop the traditional fishery on the River Severn because there were no other markets to export to.“It is absolutely devastating,” said Wood. “All my team are going to lose their jobs. This will be hundreds of years of heritage and culture gone.”A Defra spokesperson said: “We have robust rules and laws in place to safeguard protected species, including glass eels, and any applications to export them are rigorously assessed to ensure they are legal and sustainable.“This application for the export of glass eels has been refused over concerns of significant risks of illegal trading compounded by the current situation in Russia.”More than 55,000 peoplesigned a petitioncalling for an end to the export of elvers to Russia following an outcry after the Guardian revealed plans toincrease the Kaliningrad exportamount to five tonnes.Wood said the restocking project in Kaliningrad was a legitimate conservation project and preventing it would also stop his facility’s contribution to UK restocking projects. “Fishermen are very generous. They’ve provided the glass eels and we provide the facilities to do it. All that is going to come to an end,” he said.Andrew Kerr, chair of the Sustainable Eel Group, welcomed the government decision, saying the focus for eel conservation should be on restocking English and Welsh rivers from the glass eel surplus in the Bristol Channel.“It’s a much better use of the precious natural resource that they should migrate up the Severn than be sent to Russia. This means that the future is conservation elvering for [UK] restocking programmes,” he said.Young elvers enter river systems and spend years developing before migrating to the Sargasso Sea, in the Atlantic Ocean, to reproduce. But no English or Welsh river is close to meeting its “eel escapement target” – the number of mature silver eels that successfully get out to sea.Removing barriers such as weirs – or building fish passes around them – is one way to help eels, but moving glass eels from estuaries to suitable habitat upriver is another way to increase populations.Explore more on these topicsEndangered speciesConservationRussiaFishRiversWildlifeBrexitnewsShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson posted a map on X with a building marked in red, telling residents to flee more than 300 metres away, reminiscent of the daily maps the Israeli military issued before bombings during its war with Hezbollah.“You are present near facilities belonging to Hezbollah,” the spokesperson warned, pointing to a building near two schools in Dahiyeh. The warning was followed by two drone strikes.An Israeli military spokesperson later said the airstrikes targeted a truck and Hezbollah drone storage facility known as Unit 127.The warning caused people in Dahiyeh to flee, with men shooting in the air to warn those who had not seen the announcement on social media. Videos showed residents sheltering on pavements in central Beirut.Earlier in the morning, Israel announced it had intercepted one of two rockets coming fromLebanon, the second time in a week that rocket fire was directed towards it, after three rockets were fired at the town of Metula on 22 March.According to the military, one of the rockets was intercepted, while the other fell short inside Lebanese territory as rocket sirens sounded in the city of Kiryat Shmona and the communes of Tel Hai, Margaliot and Misgav Am.No one claimed responsibility for Friday’s rocket fire, and Hezbollah issued no statement.Israel conducted several airstrikes in southern Lebanon before the evacuation warning in Beirut on Friday. Lebanon announced the closure of schools in the south in fear of further strikes.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Friday’s strike marked an “example” of Israel’s “determination” to act against its northern neighbour.“We will not allow firing on our communities, not even a trickle,” Netanyahu said in a statement. “We will continue to vigorously enforce the ceasefire; we will attack everywhere in Lebanon, against any threat to the State of Israel, and we will ensure that all our residents in the north return to their homes safely.”The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said: “If calm does not prevail in the Galilee towns, there will be no calm in Beirut … We will not allow a return to the situation before October 7.“I am sending a clear message from here to the Lebanese government: if you do not enforce the ceasefire agreement we will enforce it,” Katz added.It is unclear how Hezbollah willrespond to a strike on Dahiyeh, where the groupenjoys large public support. Hezbollah claims its role is to protect Lebanon from the Israeli military, so a strike near the country’s capital could challenge the basis of its legitimacy.There has been no resumption of major hostilities since the ceasefire began in November, despite Israel conducting hundreds of strikes in Lebanon. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for one strike in Israel a few days after the signing of the ceasefire.The ceasefire had brought an end to more than 13 months of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel, which killed more than 3,900 people and displaced about 1 million in Lebanon. Lebanon’s prime minister, Nawaf Salam, has emphasised his commitment to the ceasefire deal and reiterated that the decision for Lebanon to go to war lay with the state, not with Hezbollah.Salam issued a statement calling on the military to “uncover those behind the irresponsible rocket fire that threatens Lebanon’s stability and security”.The new Lebanese government, elected after the signing of the ceasefire, has made disarming the non-state militia a priority.In Gaza, whereIsraelresumed its military operation on 18 March, shattering the relative calm of a January ceasefire with Hamas, the aid group World Central Kitchen said an Israeli airstrike killed one of its volunteers near a facility distributing meals to besieged Palestinians. The strike wounded six other people, the US-based charity said.World Central Kitchen said it would continue to operate its field kitchens “where possible, based on daily assessments”. It did not give the location of the strike and the Israeli military did not immediately comment.The UN Human Rights Office accused Israel on Friday of violating international law by forcibly displacing Palestinians in Gaza under “mandatory evacuation orders”.The Israeli army has issued what the UN described as 10 mandatory evacuation orders, which ‘‘fail to comply with the requirements of international humanitarian law”, the body’s spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said in a statement on Friday.Israel’s permanent mission to Geneva said it was operating in accordance with international humanitarian law. “Israel is evacuating civilians to protect them from Hamas terrorists, who relentlessly use them as human shields in a blatant violation of international law,” the mission said.Explore more on these topicsLebanonIsraelHezbollahMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It is thedeadliest conflictfor media workers in recent history. In a sobering report,Thaslima Begumgathered some of their stories. And attacks on journalists worldwideare on the rise, with deaths occurring everywhere from the Middle East to Europe.Just this week, Hossam Shabat, a 23-year-old reporter, was killed in Gaza. Shabat had feared death sinceIsraelaccused him of terrorist activity. He had already written a message to be published in the event of his death: “For the past 18 months, I have dedicated every moment of my life to my people. I documented the horrors in northern Gaza minute by minute, determined to show the world the truth they tried to bury … I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest – something I haven’t known in the past 18 months.”For today’s newsletter, I spoke with Palestinian journalistHind Khoudary, who has been reporting fromGazasince the start of the war, about the situation on the ground for reporters and Guardian journalistRuth Michaelsonabout what is driving the decline in press freedom around the world. That’s right after the headlines.Five big storiesUK economy| Lower-income households are on track to become £500 a year poorer by the end of the decade as a result of the UK chancellor’s spring statement,according to analysisby the Resolution Foundation.Monarchy|King Charles requiredhospital observation on Thursday after experiencing “temporary side-effects”as part of his medical treatment for cancer, Buckingham Palace said.Canada| Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, has saidthe era of deep ties with the US“is over” as governments from Tokyo to Berlin and Paris sharply criticised Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on car imports, with some threatening retaliatory action.Asia-Pacific| Japan has for the first time released plans toevacuate more than 100,000 civilians from some of its remote islands near Taiwanin the event of conflict amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Taipei.Environment| Supporters of the climate group Just Stop Oil have announced that after three years of disruptive protests they areending their campaign of civil resistance. Hannah Hunt, whose speech on Valentine’s Day 2022 marked the beginning of the campaign, made the announcement outside Downing Street in London on Thursday.In depth: ‘No Palestinian journalist is too high-profile to be targeted or harmed’View image in fullscreenHossam Shabat (left) and Mohammed Mansour.Photograph: handoutThis week, two Palestinian journalists werekilled in Israeli airstrikes: Al Jazeera’s Shabat (above left), who died in Beit Lahiya, and Palestine Today’s Mohammed Mansour (above right), who was killed in his home alongside his wife and son. Israeli forces deny targeting journalists, but in this case the IDF confirmed it had deliberately killed both reporters, calling them terrorists. Shabat, widely known for his reporting from northern Gaza, had alreadyrejected such claimswhen they were first levelled against him in October, calling them part of a “systematic propaganda campaign to justify the unjustifiable”.Israel has barred foreign journalists from entering Gaza, an unprecedented move in modern times, leaving the task of documenting the violence solely to Palestinian reporters working on the ground without protection.Within months of the war starting, press freedom organisations accused the Israeli military of targeting journalists and their families. In the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, reporters face growing hostility from Israeli forces.Human Rights Watchhas said the Israeli government “has taken an unprecedented series of steps to curtail media freedom, effectively resulting in the establishment of a censorship regime”.Life as a journalist in GazaJournalists in Gaza are not only working under heavy bombardment. Like every other civilian, they are contending with perilous conditions. Khoudary, who has been displaced in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip for the past year and a half, does not remember the last time she saw her family, who evacuated to Cairo. “Since then I have been on my own,” she says. “All I want is a hug after a very harsh day. I want to sit on my mother’s lap and hug my brothers. It has been so hard losing everything you own and love. I never thought that I would ever live this in my life.”Khoudary says the situation has been particularly bad since the collapse of the ceasefire and therenewal of the total blockade of aid. “Journalists have been literally living everything they have been reporting – we have been displaced, starved, dehydrated, not sleeping,” she says. Making things harder, she adds, is the distress of learning that colleagues and friends have been injured or killed.Shabat’s death was felt particularly acutely because he was one of the few journalists who remained in northern Gaza. “There was an intimacy to his coverage, the way he documented his home and what was happening there, and because of this the outside world had grown to know him,” Ruth says. “The other thing Shabat said was that he felt like he was being hunted, and that is a sentiment we hear time and time again from our colleagues reporting in Gaza – that they feel like they are being singled out for attack.”The Israeli government has strenuously denied targeting journalists, or has said that those who have been targeted were involved in violent activity.This is not the first time Israeli authorities havemade such claims. Last year they designated six Al Jazeera journalists based in Gaza as members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), an allegation the network vehementlydenies. The Committee to Protect Journalists has previously condemned Israeli authorities for the “smearing of killed Palestinian journalists with unsubstantiated ‘terrorist’ labels”.Foreign media have been pressuring the Israeli government to allow them into Gaza, but Ruth points out that this slightly obscures the reality that Palestinian journalists are already reporting for international outlets. Khoudary says Palestinian journalists have been marginalised and neglected: “People have been using us as tools for their media agencies. Most of us don’t have protection gear, we are working with the bare minimum of tools to tell the story.“Sometimes people forget the fact that we are also humans,” Khoudary continues. “We have been reporting with zero break, no days off, because there is no days off. I just want the world to know that we are very tired and overwhelmed and we do not want to lose more.”West Bank and East JerusalemThe attacks on media are not limited to Gaza. In September, Israeli forces raided Al Jazeera’s office in the occupied West Bank andbanned its operations in Israel. And last weekenda German journalistwas arrested by Israeli police in the occupied West Bank for allegedly assaulting a settler, despite video footage showing settlers blocking him and acting threateningly. A few days later Oscar-winning director Hamdan Ballal was attacked by settlers and then arrested, in what he says wasretaliation for his documentaryon the displacement of Palestinians in Masafer Yatta. “As we tragically saw with the killing ofShireen Abu Aklehin 2022, no Palestinian journalist is too high-profile to be targeted or harmed,” Ruth says.The latest data from theCPJshows that 75 journalists have been arrested in the Palestinian territories of the occupied West Bank and Gaza, as well as in Jerusalem. In 2024 Israel was added to the list of the“worst jailers of journalists”for the first time andaccording to the UN, Israeli forces have fired live ammunition at journalists or their vehicles while they were reporting on military operations and civilian casualties. The image that emerges is one of a country deeply hostile to and suspicious of critical coverage, willing to go to great lengths to clamp down on it.The Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank has also mirrored Israeli crackdowns on the press,suspending Al Jazeerafrom broadcasting due to its coverage of fighting between the PA and Palestinian armed groups. “The PA has a track record of detaining journalists and curbing coverage it doesn’t like,” Ruth says. “It is, unfortunately, not a free media environment, and that is really cutting off visibility to the outside world.”It’s a problem everywhereIn the past few months alone, the press has faced an onslaught. In the US, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw funding forRadio Free Europe and Voice of America, threatened media outlets with lawsuits, and revoked press credentials of organisations critical of the White House. In Turkey this week, journalists have beenarrested and deported. InIndonesia, reporters are facing increasing intimidation, with decapitated pigs and rats being sent to their offices.Media crackdowns can also take the form of seemingly mundane bureaucratic obstacles. In India, the government has beenrefusing to renew work permitsfor some foreign journalists.“When a journalist is mistreated, it should be an international incident,” says Ruth. “One of the consequences when it isn’t is this increasing climate of impunity towards journalists, which we’ve seen over at least the past decade, since 2012, whenMarie Colvin and Rémi Ochlikwere killed in Syria.”What else we’ve been readingView image in fullscreenDale Berning Sawa cooks in cast iron casserole dishes, comparing Aldi and M&S options with Le Creuset.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianCan a £20 pot from Aldi really match up to a £300Le Creuset?Dale Berning Sawa puts heavy bottomed pansto the test so you don’t have to …Toby Moses, head of newslettersSandra Laville and Michael Goodierhave spoken with activists who are urging the government to do more about thesewagethat is still being pumped into Britain’s waterways, including in Windermere, a lake once known for its beauty but marred by pollution.NimoLloyd Green is fascinatingon how the spirit of theconfederacy is alive and wellin Trump’s Maga movement: “He has even heaped praise upon Robert E Lee, the leader of the losing army during the US civil war.”Toby“The lessons are clear: understand the science and check the small print.

Adrian Horton and Lorenzo Tondo reportEarlier this month,No Other Land won the Oscar for best documentary feature. The film chronicles the West Bank community of Masafer Yatta as it resists being driven off its land by settler violence and the demolitions of the Israeli military. The film’s two protagonists, Palestinian film-maker Basel Adra and Israeli film-maker Yuval Abraham, gave speeches when they accepted their award.Yuval Abraham: “We live in a regime where I am free under civilian law and Basel is under military laws that destroy his life … There is a different path, a political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people.”In the global spotlight alongside the pair were the film’s other co-directors, Rachel Szor and Hamdan Ballal.Adrian Horton, an arts writer for Guardian US, explains toMichael Safithe challenges that the film had to overcome during its production and the fact that despite huge critical success,No Other Landdid face difficulty in the run-up to the Oscars.And on Monday, only a few weeks after the awards ceremony, co-directorHamdan Ballal was attacked by settlers and detained by the Israeli military. He describes to Guardian correspondentLorenzo Tondowhat he believes happened that night and how since the Oscar win the Masafer Yatta community has experienced even more violence than before.Tondo explains that many analysts believe settler violence is part of a broader attempt by the Israeli state to annex the West Bank during the current Trump presidency. Horton adds that at the same time, the currentUS administration has created a chilling effect on the distribution of some political documentaries.Photograph: Hazem Bader/AFP/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsNo Other LandToday in FocusWest BankPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelDocumentary filmsOscars"

In these instances, it is important to note that the Academy represents close to 11,000 global members with many unique viewpoints.”Posting a screenshot of the full statement on Xon Thursday, Abraham criticised the Academy for failing to name Ballal.“After our criticism, the Academy’s leaders sent out this email to members explaining their silence on Hamdan’s assault: they need to respect ‘unique viewpoints’,” he wrote.Abraham compared it to a “rightfully strong” statement made by the Academy in 2011 when the organisation condemned the arrest of six Iranian filmmakers by the Iranian government, including the detention of director Jafar Panahi.The Academy did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.Ballal, one of the documentary’s four directors – all from Israel and Palestine – was released from Israeli detention on Tuesday.Hetold the Guardianthat he “thought I was going to die” when Israeli soldiers had aided the settlers who attacked him on Monday outside his home in the village of Susya, in the Masafer Yatta area of the West Bank.Hamdan Ballal: Oscar-winning Palestinian director released from Israeli detentionRead moreBallal told the Guardian he was beaten while in detention.“It was a revenge for our movie,” he said. “I heard the voices of the soldiers, they were laughing about me … I heard [the word] ‘Oscar’.”No Other Land won the Oscar for best documentary less than a month ago, at a ceremony in Los Angeles.Earlier this week Basel Adra, another of No Other Land’s directors, told the Guardian he thought the film’s international recognition might havespurred escalating settler violence in Susya.“Palestinians in the village have been under physical attack by settlers almost daily. The settlers’ violence is increasing here. Maybe it’s a revenge for the movie and the Oscar,” he said.Explore more on these topicsFilmOscarsWest BankIsraelPalestinian territoriesDocumentary filmsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Pro-democracy and republican groups held a counter-protest that passed peacefully.The pro-royalist movement is calling for the return of Gyanendra Shah, who was Nepal’s last reigning monarch and still has a loyal following in the country.Support for the pro-monarchy movement has surged recently as Nepal grapples with ongoing political and economic instability that has led to widespread dissatisfaction with the government.Friday’s protests took a violent turn after pro-royalists broke through police barricades and began throwing stones at officers. The police responded by firing teargas into the crowds and shooting rubber bullets and live ammunition into the air.View image in fullscreenAn injured protester lies on the ground.

Several political party headquarters were vandalised, as were the offices of a prominent newspaper and a TV news channel.The police spokesperson Shekhar Khanal said 17 people had been arrested so far. “When the protesters tried to force their way past the restricted area, the police had no choice but to use teargas. Following this, the protesters then resorted to vandalism and arson,” he said.One protester was killed in the clashes and pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. A journalist was killed when a building was set alight.The government declared a curfew in areas of the capital and security personnel were deployed on the streets. Nepal’s prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the security situation.Royalist protesters claimed the police had acted first against the protesters. “Right now, we are not demanding the return of the monarchy, we are advocating for the institution of the monarchy,” said Ravi Shrestha, who was among the protesters. “The situation escalated beyond control because of police suppression.”The protests were the largest since 2023 and demonstrated the growing base of support for the return of the king in Nepal. Earlier this month, upwards of 10,000 supporters gathered at Kathmandu airport to celebrate Gyanendra’s arrival in the capital, with cries of “bring back our monarch”.View image in fullscreenRoyalists rally on the streets in Kathmandu.Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/Getty ImagesIn a statement before the protests, the committee for the restoration of monarchy emphasised they were calling for the return of a “constitutional monarchy” that would coexist with the democratic government and would have a “parental role above politics”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was crowned in 2001 after most of his family were killed in a mass shooting at their home, and initially ruled as more of a ceremonial head of state, with no executive powers. But, in 2005,he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and jailing politicians. He declared a state of emergency and deployed the army to run the country.After massive protests rocked the country,he was forced to hand over the governing of the countryto a democratically elected government in 2006. In 2008, the parliament voted to abolish the monarchy altogether.In the years since, Nepal has experienced continuing political instability, with weak coalition governments regularly only lasting a matter of months before being toppled, and senior politicians being engulfed in corruption scandals. Anger at the political system has been steadily rising, and this has been capitalised on by the pro-monarchy movement.Sunita Chudal, from Jhapa, was among those who protested for the abolition of the monarchy in 2006, and recalled shouting slogans in the streets calling Gyanendra a thief. Now she is among those calling for his return.“I have joined this movement, not because I believe the king will return and make things better, but because of the way corruption and degradation have increased in the country, and how our children are being forced to migrate abroad,” she said.“I am so disillusioned that I had no choice but to take to the streets.”Explore more on these topicsNepalSouth and central AsiaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s time for some scrutiny over what he believes and would do. Expect more of this.”The chosen territory for now is theNHS, with Labour seeking to draw attention to Farage’s previous hints that he would prefer a different model. Quizzed about this on Friday morning, Farage told the BBC that he supported it being free at point of use, but that he would like to “re-examine the whole funding model”.While Farage says his preferred idea would be more like the top-up system seen in parts of continental Europe, Labour argues that he would in fact oversee a US free-for-all.Before the rally, the party pointed to Farage’s links to a US thinktank called the Heartland Institute, which strongly argues for the American healthcare system and has criticised the NHS.Speaking at a Heartland Institute dinner in Chicagoin September last year, Farage praised its work and called for its ideas to spread to the UK. “Maybe the time has come for a bit of reverse colonialism, maybe it’s time that Heartland came and set up in Britain and Europe and brought some of the wisdom that you’ve brought to the American debate,” he told the audience.Friday’s rally at Birmingham’s Utilita Arena was a chance for him to galvanise his supporters before a major election effort – and to try to move on from bitters rows of the past few weeks.Rupert Lowe, elected as one of Reform’s five MPs in July, is in open war with Farage after he lost the party whip overallegations linked to bullying staffand threats to Reform’s chair, which Lowe has dismissed as a smear.In his speech to the rally, Farage called for a “British form of Doge”, modelled on Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency”. He also called for a complete ban on civil servants working from home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After the local elections, he said, members would be able to vote for a party board.The event, which ran very late and appeared less full than the claimed 10,000 ticket sales, also saw Arron Banks, the former aide and donor to Farage in Ukip, as the Reform candidate for the west of England mayoralty.In Runcorn, although Amesbury had a near-15,000 majority, Reform have been heavily tipped to take the seat after the MP was convicted of punching a man in the street and stepped down, and a Labour win would be a reverse for Farage.Similarly, winning the near-25% of the vote they have polled at recently would give Reform 400-plus council seats on 1 May but recent council byelections – however limited a guide – have not gone hugely well for the party.At a council byelection in Maldon in Essex on Thursday Reformtook just16.7% of the vote, and the Conservatives held the seat. Of four recent byelections in the county, billed as a Reform stronghold, the party won a lower vote share than Ukip did in 2013-14.Explore more on these topicsReform UKLocal electionsBirminghamNHSLabourNigel FarageLocal politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Crowley, which manages the Stena Immaculate, said salvage and recovery operations are moving into the next phase.“During the weekend of 29-30 March, operations will commence at sea to transfer the remaining 202,485 barrels of Jet-A1 cargo from the Stena Immaculate tanker to tanker Fure Vyl, which is anchored nearby,” a spokesperson said.“This lightering operation is a standard and routine maritime practice that follows established safety protocols.”The jet fuel will then be delivered to its original destination of Killingholme, in Lincolnshire, the statement added.The Stena Immaculate will be towed to the Port of Tyne on the north-east coast, near Newcastle, for further inspection expected to take place in early April. A Crowley spokesperson added: “We continue to work with the appropriate authorities and remain committed to supporting the salvors and salvage operations with the highest possible regard for safety.”The Portuguese vessel Solong arrived in Aberdeen on Friday after being towed to the Scottish city for “safe berthing”. It was accompanied by a vessel with counter-pollution measures as it arrived at the Port of Aberdeen at about 7am on Friday.A total of 36 people were rescued from the ships after the incident but a sailor from the Solong – named as 38-year-old Filipino national Mark Angelo Pernia – is missing and presumed dead.The Solong’s captain, Vladimir Motin, 59, of St Petersburg, Russia, has appeared at Hull magistrates court and at the Old Baileycharged with gross negligence manslaughterand was remanded in custody. He is due to stand trial in January 2026.After the collision, thousands of plastic pellets used in plastics production, known as nurdles, were released from ruptured containers on the Solong andbegan washing up on beaches on the Norfolk coast, where a clean-up operation is continuing.According to conservationists, the nurdles are not toxic butcan harm animalsif ingested.Explore more on these topicsShipping industryNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

You’re handing him a rape tool, either he’s going to use it to seduce women and lure them back to his lair or he’s going to use it to silence them … It’s terrifying. He couldn’t stop talking about it [the 2009 award] in 2018.”Lusi, who also starred in Crazy Rich Asians, said the award was handing Clarke a “loaded gun”. No allegations of rape were published by the Guardian. On Friday, Philip Williams, representing Clarke, asked Lusi whether she had ever made any such allegations against his client. She replied she had not and was not accusing him of rape but when asked whether she wanted to retract her words about the award being “a rape tool kit” she declined to do so.She also said on the call that the 2021 award was a box-ticking exercise. Asked by Williams whether she took issue with a black actor receiving an award, Lusi told the court: “I did not take issue with the fact he was black and is getting an award. I felt my issue was that his body of work did not warrant an award of that level.“It would not have made a difference what ethnicity he was.” She compared his “mediocre” work unfavourably with that of Ang Lee, another person of colour, who received the Bafta fellowship award in 2021.When Williams suggested she was “professionally jealous”, she laughed and denied it.Clarke returned to the witness box on Friday to respond to the discovery by his former best man and business partner Davie Fairbanks during the trial of a hard drive containing 15 photos of a woman given the pseudonym Ivy. Fairbanks claimed Clarke had sent them to him. Ivy said she had never seen them before.Clarke told the court: ​“My explanation about him having the photographs is he stole them from my devices. I have never shared anyone’s pictures, never have done, never would do. The only explanation is that Mr Fairbanks has … illicitly stored them for a decade and a half.”Gavin Millar KC, for the Guardian, suggested that Clarke had been forced to “come up with a theory” after the photos were found but had no evidence to support it.The writer and producer of the Kidulthood trilogy denied Millar’s assertions that he kept them for “collateral” against women and that his argument – that he kept the photos in an unprotected folder on a laptop, the password for which he had given to his friend – was implausible.Clarke said he had stored the photographs for “aesthetic reasons” and that Fairbanks only had the laptop password in case anything happened to him.Apart from one more witness on 4 April attesting to the truth of the Guardian’s reporting about Clarke, next week will be taken up by its journalists giving evidence, arguing that their reporting was in the public interest.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

The phenomenon occurs when the moon passes between the sun and Earth. The three will not be completely aligned, meaning only part of the sun will be obscured.Honor Criswick, a Met Office meteorologist, said conditions were “slightly chillier” on Friday, adding: “We then see some milder air move through on Saturday but with this more cloud, outbreaks of rain perhaps lingering for a time across parts of the south-east through the early hours of Sunday, but then high pressure largely dominating and it sticks around as we head into next week too bringing some fine and settled conditions, perhaps even some warm sunshine.”She said Sunday morning would be cloudy with possible drizzle and mist, and that in Northern Ireland, and parts of Wales and Cornwall, there may be grey skies in the afternoon.“For the rest of the week … we have this area of high pressure building its way up from the south, dragging in some more milder air too, so it’s likely that there will be quite a settled start to the week next week, lots of sunny spells and also some quite warm temperatures,” she added.Explore more on these topicsUK weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Businesses are getting 23 times more access than charities, consumer groups and third-sector organisations to ministers in five key departments and their predecessors.Defence companies, Saudi Arabian state entities, energy firms, tech firms, big banks and lobbying outfits have all spent money wining and dining ministers and senior officials in key departments over a five and a half year period.As the campaign group’s report puts it: “There are legitimate questions as to whether corporate hospitality can help ensure decisionmakers are more well disposed towards the provider, and thus enables soft influence.“We found considerable crossover between firms that are providing hospitality and those getting meetings, suggesting that these firms may be getting a second bite at the influence cherry.”There is also a question of whether officials – politically neutral and in the service of the state – should be accepting free lunches at all. They appeared to rarely accept tickets to events but frequently accepted invitations to lunches and dinners, giving firms casual contact with the people running departments, who are not generally very accessible.While ministers and special advisers are accountable to their constituents and can take personal and political decisions about who they associate with, officials are meant to be unimpeachably impartial.For things to improve, transparency about who is getting hospitality and meetings is only the first step. One of the report’s recommendations is that more proactive measures are needed to get the whole of society represented in policymaking so that those with the biggest hospitality budgets are not the dominant voices around the table.While the government is naturally keen to keep business on board, especially with relations at a low ebb after the tax rises in the budget, there is a case for non-business stakeholders to be getting a bigger hearing.As the thinktank Demos argued recently, the delivery of the government’s missions depends onmore of the publicbeing involved in the process. When businesses can buy the attention of ministers and officials with meals, there is a risk of charities, consumer groups and other civil society organisations being squeezed out.Explore more on these topicsLobbyingLabourHospitality industryanalysisShareReuse this content"

Trump has repeatedly railed against the US’s trade deficit with leading powers such as China and the EU.The US is the single largest individual-country trading partner for the UK, in a relationshipworth almost £300bn a year. In 2023, the UK imported £57.9bn of goods from the US, and exported £60.4bn the other way – including car exports worth £6.4bn, almost 20% of the country’s total international sales. The UK benefits from a much larger surplus in services.Downing Street officials are closely involved in the talks, including the prime minister’s “sherpa” Michael Ellam and his business adviser Varun Chandra. The latter accompanied Reynolds on his trip to Washington DC to discuss the economic prosperity deal earlier this month.On that visit, Reynolds met Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative, and Mark Burnett, Trump’s special envoy to the UK. Some officials stayed behind in Washington to keep talking through details. Staff at the UK embassy in Washington, led by Peter Mandelson who is a former EU trade commissioner, were also closely involved.While the government is concentrated on securing a deal, it has not ruled out retaliatory tariffs. Keir Starmer said on Friday that the UK “reserves the right to respond” to US tariffs next week, saying, “our national interest has to come first”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

None of them want to see a trade war, which is why we’re engaged in discussions with the US about mitigating the impact of tariffs.” The US is the second largest export market for cars built in the UK, after the EU.View image in fullscreenHoward Lutnick (right), the US commerce secretary, on a recent trip to Washington DC.Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty ImagesSome question whether the UK’s approach is the right one. David Henig, a trade expert, said amounted to “a gamble if you’re not one of the countries that’s most targeted – which we’re almost certainly not – that it’s still better to seek out a deal than, frankly, keep your head down and be ignored”.The concern is that the government is offering up big concessions to the US unnecessarily, when Trump’s package of tariffs is set to be narrower than feared and the UK was never a target for them. Ministers have offered up the £800m digital services tax, which targets US tech companies, as part of the talks for an economic deal. “You start to wonder is this going to be a good deal? It might all pay off in the end but it’s looking like a gamble,” Henig said.Britain’s trade dealings with the US have previously involved roadblocks over allowing US farmers to sellchlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beefto UK consumers, and there are signs that those difficult sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) issues are coming up again.Reynolds told the Chatham House event: “There are some difficult areas for us. We have a manifesto commitment to maintaining our SPS regime. That is something we very much committed to, that is not always something other countries see eye to eye to us on.”William Bain, the head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “There will be frantic discussions from all countries with the US administration over the weekend to get to best place they can ahead of the announcements. If anyone has a chance of exemptions, it is the UK. We always felt it was going to come down to the wire before the 2nd [April] and there’s a fair chance it might go beyond the wire as well.”Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeGlobal economyAutomotive industryEconomicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

But Harlingen is strong. We have faced adversity before and we will get through this together,” Mayor Norma Sepulveda said at a Friday afternoon news conference.In Alamo, the police and fire department responded to more than 100 water rescues, including people stranded in their vehicles and trapped in their homes, the fire department chief, RC Flores, said at a news conference on Friday afternoon.Officials estimated a couple of hundred homes in Alamo were flooded by the heavy rainfall.Flores said Alamo was one of many cities in the Rio Grande valley in southTexasthat were flooded and had damage from Thursday’s thunderstorms – but that all were working to help their residents.“I assure the public that we are assessing the situation on the hour, every hour. We’re constantly going out, not just in our city,” Flores said. “Just because the storm is over, it doesn’t mean that the emergencies and the disaster is over. We are going to continue to work as long as we need to.”Weslaco’s mayor, Adrian Gonzalez, said his city was inundated with about 14in of rain, prompting 30 to 40 water rescues of stranded motorists and residents trapped in their homes by rising floodwaters.“It’s a historic rainstorm and it’s affecting all the valley, not just Weslaco. It’s just so much water in a short period of time,” Gonzalez told reporters at a news conference.Television news footage from flooded communities in south Texas showed multiple waterlogged cars abandoned on streets on Thursday and drivers waiting on sidewalks for the floodwaters to recede.View image in fullscreenMuch of Primera in Cameron county is seen underwater on Friday.Photograph: APBetween 6in and 12in of rain fell in many parts of south Texas in the past 24 hours, according to the National Weather Service.In neighboring Cameron county, officialsaskedthe governor,Greg Abbott, to declare a disaster for the county after more than 17in of rain caused significant flooding.“The rainfall amounts we received have been record-setting, and not in a good way. All county resources are being utilized right now, and we are assisting in all ways possible,” the Cameron county judge, Eddie Treviño Jr, the county’s top elected official, said in a Facebook post.Valley international airport in Harlingen was closed on Friday and all flights were canceled due to area flooding.“We are working tirelessly to reopen and focused on ensuring safety,” airport officials said in a statement.Trump’s ‘climate’ purge deleted a new extreme weather risk tool. We recreated itRead moreMore than 3,400 in several counties in South Texas remained without power on Friday afternoon, according to AEP Texas.A flood warning was still in effect for portions of south Texas, including Cameron, Hidalgo and Willacy counties, through early Friday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service.“There’s a break from the rain this morning, which will allow flood waters to gradually recede, but we’ll still need to keep an eye on the development of isolated showers and thunderstorms once again this afternoon,” the National Weather Service said on social media. “Any additional rainfall will be quick to cause flooding issues given the heavy rainfall that has already fallen.”One middle school in Alamo was scheduled to remain open as a shelter for residents through Friday. One shelter had been opened in Weslaco and officials in Harlingen had opened the city’s convention center as a shelter.More than 20 south Texas school districts and college campuses canceled classes on Friday due to the severe weather and flooding.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherTexasUS-Mexico borderFloodingExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on its website that 97% of the confirmed cases this year so far involved people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccine status was unknown – and 75% of the cases this year have affected people under the age of 19.The CDC said that there had been one death confirmed from measles this year and one under investigation as connected to the viral infection.The main outbreak this year has been inTexas, withlethal consequences. The state health department has reported 400 measles cases in Texas as of 28 March.Meanwhile the New Mexico health department on Friday reported that there were currently 44 cases of measles in the state, up from its previous count of 43 cases on 25 March.Most of the cases were reported in Lea county, which is adjacent to Gaines county in Texas, which is considered the center of the current measles outbreak that began in late January across the two states.In recent years, federal health officials have attributed some outbreaks to parents refusing to vaccinate children.The CDC said in a health advisory to doctors on 7 March that the risk for widespread measles in the US remains low.The US health secretary,Robert F Kennedy Jr, who for years has sown doubts about the safety and efficacy of immunization despite evidence about its safety and efficacy widely accepted by public authorities, said last month that he recognized the serious impact of the current measles outbreak in Texas.He added that the government was providing resources, including vaccines.But theNew York Times reportedearlier this week that some children are suffering complications including liver damage because they have been given huge doses of vitamin A at home, without medical supervision, a therapeutic idea promoted by vaccines skeptics, including Kennedy.The 20 jurisdictions affected this year are Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York state, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Washington state.The CDC said on its website that the agency was aware of probable measles cases being reported by jurisdictions but the data referred to on its website, such as the number of cases so far being 483, only includes confirmed cases.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS healthcareMMRTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

Both Bedoya and Slaughter havesued the administrationover their respective dismissals, which they argue were illegal.In an interview with the Guardian, Bedoya expressed fear that his firing is a sign of billionaires’ growing power over the federal government. “This isn’t about progressive versus conservative,” he said. “This is about the rule of law versus the rule of billionaires.”Independent and bipartisan agencies like the FTC are typically shielded from direct control by the White House. Supreme court precedents interpret the FTC Act’s terms, which only allow the president to remove FTC commissioners for “insufficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance” in office.When Bedoya first confirmed his firing on social media, he declared that the president “wants the FTC to be a lap dog for his golfing buddies”. In the days that followed, he has continued to express alarm about actions taken under Trump – and the striking group of wealthy allies and supporters he has amassed leading up to, and since, his victory last November.Fired FTC commissioners sue Trump administration over ‘indefensible’ terminationsRead moreAt the FTC, Bedoya was involved in several cases against Amazon, for example, including allegations of the company keeping children’s voice data despite parental objections, and forcing small businesses into unfair pricing schemes. Amazon was founded byJeff Bezos, who joined a string of tech billionaires including Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, and Sundar Pichai, the Google CEO, at Trump’s inauguration.“I think it’s remarkable that one of the last public statements I made before the president tried to fire me was denouncing the high injury rates and the working conditions atAmazonwarehouse floors, such that the company literally has to position vending machines on its warehouse floors that dispense painkillers,” said Bedoya.The connection between Trump and Bezos should be clear to anyone watching closely, he suggested. Amazondonated $1mto the president’s inaugural fund, and its streaming arm reportedly paid millions of dollars for therights for a documentaryabout the first lady, Melania Trump.“When you see a company with a safety track record like Amazon’s, then you see the donations from Mr Bezos and the deals that are being cut between the first family and Mr Bezos’s company, and then you see that theperson nominatedto head up the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is none other than an Amazon safety executive … it would be foolish to not worry about the possibility of corruption and the possibility of corporate pardon,” said Bedoya.“I don’t know what most Americans think, but I know what I think when I see it,” he added.Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, said: “President Trump has the lawful authority to manage personnel within the executive branch. President Trump will continue to rid the federal government of bad actors unaligned with his common sense agenda the American people decisively voted for.”Bedoya’s claims about Amazon are “inaccurate and misleading”, a spokesperson for the company said.“Like any responsible employer, we make basic first aid items like over-the-counter pain relievers available to employees,” the spokesperson added, claiming that injury rates have fallen since 2019. Parents can “easily delete individual child voice recordings and transcripts” on an app linked to Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant, according to the company.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, a registered Democrat, is involved in anongoing sagaof corruption allegations, even as the Department of Justice seeks todismiss the chargesin a move that has been questioned by many.“For me, it’s a blinking red alarm about what happened withEric Adamsat the Department of Justice, where it appears there was some kind of deal struck between senior administration officials and the mayor to drop the charges against the mayor in exchange for some kind of quid pro quo,” Bedoya said.“I’m worried that that is going to come for a place like the FTC,” he said. “Because in a world where the president can fire anybody on that commission at any time, how do you say no, right?”Though Bedoya can’t say whether a majority of Americans see things the way he does, he’s hopeful that the influence of billionaires will becoming increasingly obvious, alerting more and more people to corruption within the US government.Over the weekend, he spoke at apacked rallyhosted by Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. While Trump continues to openly mock Democrats, such as in hiscontroversial addressto a joint session of Congress, certain leftist politicians are seeing an opportunity to foster the unity Trump failed to bring to the White House.“I think what was so exciting about that rally is that it wasn’t just aboutDemocrats. Yes, Senator Sanders and Representative Ocasio-Cortez are Democrats, but afterwards at that rally, I was talking to the people in the audience and it was all kinds of people,” Bedoya said.“It was Democrats, it wasRepublicans, it was people who hated politics but know that something is wrong.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationRegulatorsAmazonMetaGoogleJeff BezosDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

But to ensure legal certainty and avoid unnecessary labor strife, they first seek declaratory relief to confirm that they are legally entitled to proceed with doing so,” the lawsuit states.Liz Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, said the move was “straight out ofProject 2025”, the rightwing Heritage Foundation’s manifesto to remake the federal government.“This executive order is the very definition of union-busting. It strips the fundamental right to unionize and collectively bargain from workers across the federal government at more than 30 agencies,” said Shuler. “It’s clear that this order is punishment for unions who are leading the fight against the administration’s illegal actions in court – and a blatant attempt to silence us.”According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 29.9% of federal employees are union members as of 2024,representingmore than 1.2 million workers.Unions representing federal workers have criticized the order and vowed to take immediate legal action.“President Trump’s latest executive order is a disgraceful and retaliatory attack on the rights of hundreds of thousands of patriotic American civil servants – nearly one-third of whom are veterans – simply because they are members of a union that stands up to his harmful policies,” said Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest union representing federal workers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Americans will not be intimidated or silenced. AFGE isn’t going anywhere. Our members have bravely served this nation, often putting themselves in harm’s way, and they deserve far better than this blatant attempt at political punishment.”Kelley added: “AFGE is preparing immediate legal action and will fight relentlessly to protect our rights, our members, and all working Americans from these unprecedented attacks.”The union held apress conferencewith Democratic lawmakers on Friday afternoon at the US Capitol, during which Kelley criticized the invocation of national security to strip federal workers of their union rights and called for support from the public.“This isn’t about safety or security. It’s about silencing workers who are courageously standing up to this non integrity, non accountability in the government,” said Kelley. “We won’t be silenced.”The congressman Jamie Raskin said the Trump order was an attempt to bring “chaos and retaliation” against the US labor movement.“It’s clear as day that they are retaliating against the labor movement for standing up for the rights of workers,” said Raskin. “When rightwing coups and authoritarian takeovers happen all over the world, the first thing they do is they attack the civil service, and then they attack the labor movement.”Unions representing federal workers can only bargain over conditions of employment, with wages, benefits, and classifications set by law and Congress. Bargaining is governed by the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act. Federal workers are also barred from conducting strikes.“President Trump’s attempt to unlawfully eliminate the right to collectively bargain for hundreds of thousands of federal workers is blatant retribution,” said Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). “This attack is meant to silence their voices, soElon Muskand his minions can shred the services that working people depend on the federal government to do.”Sara Nelson, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, warned Trump’s executive order was a warning for more attacks on workers and labor unions to come from this administration.“If we allow this administration to tear up federal union contracts, fire federal workers who stand up for our legal rights and target federal unions and union activists, they won’t stop there,” Nelson said. “An injury to one is an injury to all. It is time for the labor movement and the American workforce to rise up for our rights and fight for our country – whatever it takes.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS unionsProject 2025Donald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, excluding volatile items such as food and energy, the index rose more than expected on an annual basis in the previous month, while consumer spending rebounded after falling in January.The PCE price index is the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation and core PCE – excluding food and energy – rose by 2.8% in February, up from 2.6% in January, still uncomfortably above the Fed’s 2% annual inflation rate target.The Fed has held off cutting interest rates as it monitors the rate of inflation citing“heightened uncertainty”for the decision earlier this month.Adding to the unease, final figures released by the University of Michigan showed consumer sentiment deteriorated further in March to its lowest level since 2022.Equities have experienced significant declines over the past month, driven by concerns that Donald Trump’s wavering policies might steer the economy towards a period of heightened inflation and tepid growth, potentially complicating the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy trajectory.“The problem is we don’t know the rules and businesses really struggle with that,” said Bob Doll, chief executive officer of Crossmark Investments.“Part of the economic weakness we’re experiencing and likely to see more of is a function of individuals and businesses saying, ‘I’m not quite sure what tomorrow’s going to bring, so I’ll just be a little more cautious.’”Trump’s steadfast commitment to a 25% tariff on auto imports, set to take effect next week, weighed on auto stocks for a second day, with General Motors and Ford falling over 2% each.Attention now turns to a fresh round of tariffs the US intends to unveil on 2 April, with Trump hinting that these measures might diverge from the straightforward tit-for-tat duties previously pledged.Simultaneously, a report indicated that the European Union is weighing concessions to Trump after the enactment of reciprocal tariffs.Reuters contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsStock marketsNasdaqDow JonesStandard & Poor'sInflationUS interest ratesnewsShareReuse this content"

European carmakers alone sold more than 750,000 vehicles to American drivers.France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Thursday he had told his US counterpart that tariffs were not a good idea. They “disrupt value chains, create an inflationary effect and destroy jobs. So it’s not good for the US or European economies,” he said.Paris would work with the European Commission on a response intended to get Trump to reconsider, he said. Officials in Berlin also stressed that the commission would defend free trade as the foundation of the EU’s prosperity.1:28Donald Trump announces new 25% tariffs on cars from overseas – videoGermany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, bluntly described Trump’s decision as wrong, and said Washington appeared to have “chosen a path at whose end lie only losers, since tariffs and isolation hurt prosperity, for everyone”.France’s finance minister, Eric Lombard, called the US president’s plan “very bad news” and said the EU would be forced to raise its own tariffs. His German counterpart, Robert Habeck, promised a “firm EU response”. “We will not take this lying down,” he said.Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said Europe would approach the US with common sense but “not on our knees”. Good transatlantic relations are “a strategic matter” and must survive more than one prime minister and one president, he said.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, described the move as “bad for businesses, worse for consumers” because “tariffs are taxes”. She said the bloc would continue to seek negotiated solutions while protecting its economic interests.The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the tariffs were “very concerning” and that his government would be “pragmatic and clear-eyed” in response. The UK “does not want a trade war, but it’s important we keep all options on the table”, he said.One option for Canada is to impose excise duties on exports of oil, potash and other commodities. “Nothing is off the table to defend our workers and our country,” said Carney, who added that the old economic and security relationship between Canada and the US was over.South Korea said it would put in place a full emergency response to Trump’s proposed measures by April.China’s foreign ministry said the US approach violated World Trade Organization rules and was “not conducive to solving its own problems”. Its spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, said: “No country’s development and prosperity are achieved by imposing tariffs.”The Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, said Tokyo was putting “all options on the table”.Japan“makes the largest amount of investment to the US, so we wonder if it makes sense for [Washington] to apply uniform tariffs to all countries”, he said.Reuters and Agence-France Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationAutomotive industryFranceGermanyEuropean UnionPolandnewsShareReuse this content"

That filing came months after the company said it would likely run out of cash early this year.Milton was convicted of fraud, portrayed by prosecutors as a con man six years after he had founded the company in a basement in Utah.Prosecutors said Milton falsely claimed to have built its own revolutionary truck that was actually a General Motors product with Nikola’s logo stamped onto it.Called as a government witness,Nikola’s CEO testifiedthat Milton “was prone to exaggeration” when pitching his venture to investors.Milton resigned in 2020 amid reports of fraud that sent Nikola’s stock prices into a tailspin. Investors suffered heavy losses as reports questioned Milton’s claims that the company had already produced zero-emission 18-wheel trucks.The company paid $125m in 2021 tosettlea civil case against it by the SEC.

At the Boao Forum for Asia, a conference in south China’s Hainan province, Chinese officials and academics stressed the need forpartnerships with global south countries. Despite its rapid economic growth in the past three decades, China still identifies as being part of this group.China can live with Trump’s tariffs – his bullish foreign policy will help Beijing in the long term | Steve TsangRead moreDing, China’s sixth-ranking official, said on Thursday that policies would be implemented this year to “stabilise foreign trade and investment”.At the Boao Forum, an annual business and political summit, the line-up of speakers reflected China’s diplomatic pivot towards low- and middle-income countries. The only head of state to participate was the Laos prime minister, Sonexay Siphandone, while the deputy prime ministers of Russia and Kazakhstan also attended. One panel featured a senior Iranian official who wasreportedly involvedin talks for Iran to acquire ammonium perchlorate, an explosive agent used in missiles, from China. The official told the Guardian he did not remember the reports and had not been involved in the negotiations.“The US is never on the side of the global south,” said Aravind Yelery, an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, on one panel, adding that countries like India should look “within the global south” for economic support. Yelery’s comments came as the Indian government is said to be in discussions about relaxing restrictions on Chinese trade and investment, which were put in place five years ago after clashes at the India-China border.US tariff resilienceA major theme at Boao was how Asian economies could improve their resilience against US tariffs. Ding said that countries should “resolutely oppose trade and investment protectionism”, a reference to the US levies.Zhang Yuyan, an economist from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, warned that the “major turbulence” of US policies would affect Asian economic outlooks, although he, along with a group of other researchers, nonetheless predicted Asia’s GDP growth would be 4.5% in 2025, a slight increase on 2024’s growth figures, in a report released on Tuesday.Huang Yiping, an economist from Peking University and an influential adviser to the People’s Bank of China, stressed the importance of countries co-operating without the US. “Barriers for trade are rising very quickly,” he said, warning that US-led globalisation could go into reverse.The comments come a few months after Xi Jinping, China’s leader, unveiled a raft of measures to support global south countries at the G20 summit in Brazil last year.China now has more than a dozen free trade agreements with global south countries, and the share of its exports bound for the US is shrinking, down to around 13% in 2023. But experts have noted that rising exports to South-east Asian countries may just represent companies shipping goods to the US via third countries to avoid tariffs. “A significant part of China’s trade with the global south is derivative of US demand,” said Brad Sester, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, in an interview earlier this year.But for all the talk of deepening trade – and political – relations with global south countries, many economists believe that the real answer to tariff-proofing China’s economylies in domestic demand. Policymakers expect exports to contribute little to China’s growth this year, meaning that they will have to turn to other levers to reach the 5% GDP growth target. As well as stabilising foreign investment, Ding said China would find ways to “comprehensively” expand domestic demand. Several provinces have been told to focus on boosting consumption rather than investment, although the mechanisms for doing this remain unclear, as many ordinary Chinese people still choose to save a higher share of their incomes than global averages.Huang, the Peking University economist, addressed this explicitly at Boao. “The priority for China is to boost domestic demand,” he told the forum, with another economist arguing that China should take steps to boost consumption’s share of GDP to 70% by 2035.Explore more on these topicsChinaInternational tradeGlobal economyAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

Before she could even begin to reflect on her mixed emotions of pride and disappointment, however, she was hit by a wall of noise.The audience, still filled with Filipino fans at 12.45am, had opted to celebrate Eala’s achievements with a thunderous standing ovation. She responded immediately, raising both fists to the air and then blowing kisses to all corners of the stadium with a smile.Miami vibes: why a consistent coaching culture will be key for Emma Raducanu | Tumaini CarayolRead moreIt was a moment she fully deserved. During her time in Miami, Eala compiled one of the most spectacular and surprising breakout runs of this century. A 19-year-old from the Philippines ranked No 140, she had entered the Miami Open with a wild card and few expectations. In her short career, she had won only two matches on the WTA tour and her form in 2025 had been unimpressive.Simply winning her first-round match against the No 73 Katie Volynets marked this tournament as a success for Eala, but she just kept on going. She generated attention with her victory over Jelena Ostapenko, the mercurial 2017 French Open champion, then she forced the tennis world to take notice with her straight-sets win over Madison Keys, thereigning Australian Open championand world No 5. With all eyes on Eala, she then engineered one of the great upsets in recent times, toppling the five-time grand slam champion Iga Swiatek to reach the semi-finals.One week ago, no Filipina woman had ever defeated a grand slam champion. Eala scuppered three in succession. She then showed that those victories were no fluke by pushing Jessica Pegula, the world No 4, to the limit in an intense, bruising three-set battle.View image in fullscreenAlexandra Eala produced one of the most surprising runs in a tournament this century, beating three grand slam champions in succession.Photograph: Larry Marano/ShutterstockWhile her run was a massive surprise, Eala’s talents have been known for some time. A lefthander with a tidy, intelligent counterpunching game, she won the US Open girls’ title in 2022. By 17, before she even broke into the top 100, she was a Vogue cover star. Eala has trained for years at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca, which made her win over Swiatek even more significant. Two years ago, Swiatek was the keynote speaker at her graduation and the pair posed for a photo alongside Nadal.Before Eala, the highest ranked Filipina female tennis player, Maricris Gentz, reached No 284 in 1999. Alongside Eala’s talent, joy and composure, it has been equally interesting to see the Philippines suddenly have a horse in the race. Across the country, fans stagedwatch partiesfor her semi-final matchagainst Pegulaand a YouTube live stream alone drew more than 170,000 viewers at 9am on a Friday.She departs Miami having entered a new world. As a trailblazer in such a big country with a famously passionate fanbase, ample endorsements await her and every step she takes in her career will generate significant interest. This is only the beginning, which is an exciting prospect for a talented young player, but one great tournament does not mean that her continued success is guaranteed. Her next steps, as she tries to build even more momentum in her career and handle the unavoidable pressure that comes with success, will be intriguing.With its shock run finally ended, the women’s draw has culminated once again with a final that many predicted. Over the past year,the US Open, Cincinnati Open and now Miami Open – three of the five biggest outdoor hard-court events – have come down to finals between Aryna Sabalenka and Pegula. In the first two, Sabalenka overpowered Pegula with her more potent weaponry and greater weight of shot, winning each final in two tight sets.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka, the world No 1, faces Jessica Pegula again in a final, having beaten her twice on hard courts in the last year.Photograph: Leonardo Fernandez/Getty ImagesWhile they have long established themselves as two of the best players in the world, the past few weeks have been significant for both. Sabalenka started the season bynarrowly losing the Australian Open final to Keys, and she has rebounded brilliantly in the United States, also reaching the Indian Wells final, which she lost to Mirra Andreeva. In Miami, where she lives, the world No 1 has been in imperious form and she still has not dropped a set. As her disappointment after the Australian Open and Indian Wells showed, Sabalenka has reached a level of success where nothing but a title is acceptable.After reaching her maiden grand slam final at the US Open before losing to Sabalenka, Pegula started this season slowly and failed to win three matches at any of the big events, the Australian Open and three WTA 1000 events this year. Although she has not faced a top 25 opponent en route to the final, Pegula has shown her mental toughness across her numerous tight three-set matches. Against the best player in the world, though, only her best level will do.Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is of course the voice ofGianni Infantinoin public‑speaking mode, a man addressing you from the bridge of his private asteroid made of hope.You do have to admire Infantino at moments such as this, if only for the way he has become an instantly recognisable human brand, always the same sounds, same look, iconic blue suit and tennis shoes, eyes that seem alarmingly flat and painted on, a standard-issue bald Swiss man transformed into a living corporate logo.

And now we have this, Infantino fronting up on Fifa’s broadcast channel, offering some detail on prize money, and also an idea of the kind of ideas and phrases around which this thing will be pegged out.He talked about “a new benchmark for football”. He talked about access and equity, a genuinely creative piece of double-think given this is the most elitist club competition ever devised. This will be the playbook.

The headline figure is a jaw‑dropper. Infantino loves saying it. One billion dollars! It is a genuinely transformative bounty. But that massive money is also a massive problem, one that speaks to the central faultline beneath all of this.Gianni’s billion will be parcelled out among the 32 teams. Most of it will go to Europe, because Europe has 12 clubs taking part who are likely to dominate. So the richest continent will get richer. And within that the CWC will create a separate layer of inequity because the sums involved are just too big, too distorting of domestic leagues, in some cases equal to an entire season’s broadcast revenue.The winners will take almost £100m. Chelsea, to offer a non-random example, could pocket £40m for getting out of the group stage, in the process undermining the carefully laid details of domestic financial rules. This isFifadigging its fingernails right into the club game, careless of the consequences, dangling bundles of cash in front of the ownership class as an act of gaudy self-promotion.What is its mandate for this? Fifa is supposed to be a trustee. Its mission is to oversee, promote and regulate. And yet here it is acting as an investor-disrupter and general sop to the powerful. Fifa knows this is a problem, judging by the announcement of “a target of an additional $250m as solidarity for non-participating clubs”. But how will this work? Why is it only a target? What difference can it actually make in the face of this invite-only summer trough-fest?It is just as interesting to ask where the money actually comes from. There is a simple cause and effect here. Keep your eye on the $1bn. I am going to place it under this cup. Now follow the cup. Late last year it emerged Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund planned to buy a $1bn stake in the broadcaster Dazn, which has now come to pass. Shortly afterwards Dazn paid Fifa $1bn (keep your eye on the cup) for the rights to the CWC. Fifa will now pay $1bn to its participating clubs.As a subplot, a side issue, some of those taking part may well be owned by funds that also have Saudi investment. In theory it could come to pass that money given by Saudi Arabia to Dazn, by Dazn to Fifa, by Fifa to the clubs, ends up back in the pocket of an entity part-owned at one remove by its initial donor.

Something tangible is being bought, some element of the future. Hence the ramping up of noise this week, because in the end money will always talk loudest, blurring out all other concerns.Dazn has, we hear, “a very aggressive plan” to retail this thing by leveraging the global reach of its stars on social media, and, let’s face it, nobody ever went broke overestimating the power of mass celebrity fawning. Fifa has even given itself licence to fiddle around with the rules, allowing aconfusing 10-day transfer window just for this competition, with some wild talk Cristiano Ronaldo could even move from Al-Nasr just to play in it, which sounds odd until you consider Lionel Messi is somehow taking part.View image in fullscreenTodd Boehly thinks ‘the long-term future of the sport is in some form as a streaming product’.Photograph: Sean Ryan/IPS/ShutterstockAlready this is breeding confusion over timings and window planning. More widely there is just a feeling of lost control, elements dissolving in real time. What lies behind all this? To some degree, a kind of land grab. Todd Boehly gave an interesting speech at the recent Business of Football Summit. Despite appearing oddly drained of life on stage, like a man talking aloud about visions and plans just to keep himself awake on a long drive, the Chelsea co-owner kept coming back to one point, the fact the long-term future of the sportis in some form as a streaming product, blobs on a screen, piggyback for some future global tech service.This is a part of the noise behind all these developments, a jostle for position, every party gearing up and testing its reach, prepping to take a slice of whatever the new frontier looks like, from Fifa to the clubs to the people pumping in money from the fringes.The future is, as ever, up for grabs. It starts here, with an act of commercial disruption couched as benevolence, with a voice from the digital mist, out there saying unity and equity and growth, saying $1bn, just keep your eye on the $1bn.Barney Ronay wasnamed columnist of the yearin this year’s Sports Journalism AwardsExplore more on these topicsClub World CupFifaGianni InfantinocommentShareReuse this content"

But his quest for success was built on dubious fights and a fatal disregard for his own healthThomas HauserFri 28 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 28 Mar 2025 21.06 EDTShareView image in fullscreenComposite: Guardian Design; Photo courtesy of Gardea ChristianAs 2023 drew to a close, Paul Bamba was a marginal club fighter with a record of five wins and three losses, compiled against mediocre opposition. Then his career changed in a very strange way. Bamba fought 14 times in 2024 and won all 14 of those fights by knockout. On 21 December 2024 he was credited with defeating Rogelio Medina Luna in a fight for the WorldBoxingAssociation ‘gold’ cruiserweight championship when Medina quit on his stool after the sixth round.Bamba was living his dream. But the dream appears to have been a fantasy built in significant measure on fixed fights.Six days after fighting Medina,Bamba was dead.More than two dozen people have been interviewed for this story. Some of them asked that they not be mentioned by name out of concern that it could damage professional relationships. Others had no such reservations. The cautionary tale of Paul Bamba follows.Bamba was born in Puerto Rico on 15 August 1989. His early years were mired in horrible deprivation that –he later told friends and posted on social media– led to his being taken from a crack-addicted mother when he was four years old. He never knew his biological father. He was moved from foster home to foster home before enlisting in the US Marines at the age of 17. He served in Iraq, left the military when his tour of duty ended, and, at 19, reunited with a man named Ismael Bamba who had befriended him when they were stationed together in San Diego.Ismael Bamba is a career military officer. He and first wife were from Ivory Coast. They separated in 2006 when their daughter, Linda, was nine years old.“My dad took Paul under his wing when Paul got out of the service,” Linda says. “Then he remarried and Paul moved in with us in San Diego. It was the first time Paul had ever been in a cohesive family unit. He was valued and had a home. That meant a lot to him.”View image in fullscreenPaul Bamba survived a tough upbringing to build a life for himself.Photograph: AlevtinaIsmael Bamba had 17 brothers and sisters. “Paul was the only light-skinned one in the family,” Linda says. “But everyone took to him. He was the family favorite. Later, my dad had a son with his second wife. So there was Paul, myself, and our little brother. My dad encouraged Paul to go into therapy to deal with the things he suffered as a child. He and my father spent a lot of time together. He looked up to my dad. He wanted to be like him. He took our last name. He even had ‘Bamba’ tattooed on his body. He said he was half-Puerto Rican and half-Ivorian. Then my father got orders to go to Hawaii and Paul moved to New York. Later on, he liked to say he’d been homeless in New York. He wasn’t homeless; not really. There was a time when he was broke and struggling to pay the rent. He might have been without a place to live now and then. But he wasn’t homeless the way you think of it.“Paul was a protector. He was always texting me. ‘You good? Do you need anything?’ He was a ladies man. He liked women, but he liked a lot of women. Women would say, ‘He’s my man.’ No, not from Paul’s point of view, they weren’t. He was getting to a point where he wanted to settle down and have a family. But he wasn’t quite there yet.”Then Linda echoes what friend after friend says was one of Bamba’s defining characteristics.“Paul was the most hard-headed individual I ever met. He was driven, stubborn, prideful,” she says. “Because of his childhood, he always felt that had to prove himself and prove people wrong when they looked down on him. He had big dreams and was passionate about what he did. He’d been to hell and back and was planning on traveling further. He would stop at nothing to be successful.”The people who knew Bamba best describe him as having a big personality and a big heart. People liked him. He had a charming way about him.“Paul was my friend,” says Thomas LaManna, a fellow fighter and boxing promoter. “He was a great dude. But Paul was Paul. He had a lot of dreams. And he was a stubborn motherfucker. He’d listen to you and then go out and do exactly what he wanted to do.”Gardea Christian was Bamba’s best friend and later his business partner. Like Bamba, he had served in the Marines. They met after their time in the service and were loyal to each other.“Paul was an inspiration for a lot of people,” Christian says. “He was determined. He had a drive to get things done. I’m very protective of Paul and his legacy.”Jason Harris co-founded a creative agency called Mekanism that specializes in brand development. In 2018, he helped Bamba and Christian launch a health and fitness business called Trifecta Strong.The George Foreman I knew was generous, kind and determined to set an exampleRead more“I advised them,” Harris says. “I created the logo. We got some investors. We were going to open a gym, but Covid happened and we pivoted to a Trifecta app. Then we ran out of money for marketing and advertising, and the business became personal training. Paul had some high-profile clients [including R&B singer and songwriter Ne-Yo] that kept things going. But he still wanted to open a gym.”Multiple friends and associates recount the setting for what came next.Paul craved attention … Paul needed money to open a gym … Paul was driven to prove himself … Paul wanted street cred … Paul wanted people to admire him … Paul saw boxing as his way of getting everything he wanted. Boxing would be his stairway to the next level. He had this scenario in his mind and he was going to play it out regardless of what happened.When Jake Paul brought social-media influencer boxinginto the mainstream, Bamba took note. It was a wave that he thought he could ride to bigger and better things.“[Bamba] began talking about boxing as a means to an end,” Harris says. “He saw what Jake Paul was doing. And his plan was to become an influencer boxer, get well-known, and make big money so he could get the business rolling and open a gym.”And there was another motivation.“[Bamba] really wanted to be famous,” Harris says.But there was a problem. Bamba didn’t have the physical gifts necessary to be a quality fighter.“There’s an epidemic in boxing,” matchmaker Eric Bottjer says. “And it’s very dangerous. A fighter with extremely limited ability is backed financially, either by himself or someone else. He uses social media to build an image. He fights. A lot of commissions look the other way or don’t even understand what’s going on. But the fighter can get badly hurt.”A trainer who worked with Bamba sums up his talent. “Paul wasn’t very good and never would be,” says a trainer who worked with him in the amateurs. “He just wasn’t gifted physically like you have to be to be even an average amateur boxer. He was never gonna win an amateur tournament in New York, not even a novice one. In one of his early fights, he got knocked out ugly, face first.”The fighter who knocked Bamba out finished his professional ring career with a 1-and-8 record.A longtime cornerman agrees that Bamba was a limited boxer. “I never worked with Paul but I saw him a lot around the gym,” the cornerman says. “He was outgoing, always respectful. He had a lot of heart, a lot of grit. But some people, you introduce them to boxing and they take right to it. I used to watch Paul sparring. Even after he’d been boxing for a while, he was very novice.”Bamba moved from trainer to trainer. In 2021, he turned pro and hired Sarah Fina, who works for Dave McWater, one of boxing’s best managers, to book fights for him.“I liked Paul as a person,” Fina says. “I thought he was a good guy. And he was marketable. But a real boxer? No. Realistically, his lane was the YouTube world. I told him that. I was always real with him. We never had any official paperwork but he wanted my name on [boxing website] BoxRec as his manager. I took it off at one point and he pleaded with me to put it back on.”On 21 April 2023, Bamba fought Chris Avila in New Orleans and suffered a bad beating en route to a 40-34, 40-35, 40-35 defeat. That was the last fight Fina made for him. As 2023 drew to a close, he was a club fighter with a 5-3 professional record.Chris Avila v Paul BambaPutting those numbers in further perspective; the three fighters Bamba had lost to had a composite ring record of three wins against nine losses at the time he fought them. Looking at the fighters he did beat; three of them now have a composite ring record of 0 wins against 19 losses. The fourth has a 2-13 record. And the fifth has won one of his last 17 fights.Bamba was fighting as well as he could. But he wasn’t good enough to succeed even as a club fighter. So he opted for a new strategy.And “the knockout streak” began.It’s a common (and legal) practice in boxing for managers to “buy” bouts on fight cards for young prospects. The manager reimburses the promoter for the purse paid to both his fighter and the opponent. Other fight-related expenses, such as travel, are also reimbursed. The opponent is overmatched and has little chance of winning. But the opponent does try to win and occasionally pulls off an upset.There are also instances where a fighter is matched against a “professional loser”.“This is how it works,” Jason Nesbitt, who finished his career with 10 wins, 197 losses, and four draws,told writer Mark Turley. “Before we go out there, I get a quiet word in my ear. ‘Jase, you’ve got to take it easy. This lad’s sold six grand worth of tickets, so we can’t have him losing. If you go out there and knock him out, I promise you, you’re not getting any more fights.’ I’m not actually trying to win because I’m told not to. And that’s basically what I do to earn my money in boxing. It’s my weekly wage, so I’m going to do what I need to do to keep it coming.”Bamba was neither young nor a prospect. He had begun his career with “real” fights. Then, to fuel his dreams, he moved to questionable ones.Bamba’s first 11 “knockout victories” in 2024 took place in Latin America, eight of them in Colombia.BoxRec is the closest thing to an official record-keeper the sport has. John Sheppard created and oversees the website. He does his best to maintain the integrity of the site. But “integrity” and boxing don’t always go hand in hand.Sheppard says that, from 2018 through 2020, there were roughly a dozen fights a year in Colombia that involved a boxer from the United States. In 2024, that number had risen to 278. And according to reports submitted to BoxRec, the American fighter won all 278 of those bouts. These numbers speak for themselves. Sheppard calls the practice “win tourism”.“Win tourism is the same business model wherever you find it and there’s complicity at every level of the sport,” Sheppard says. “We’re record-keepers. We’re not Interpol. We try to keep accurate records but we can’t police every boxing match around the world. A few years ago, we started cracking down on some of the results coming out of Mexico. We were successful to the extent that the number of reported fights involving an American against a non-American in Mexico was cut in half and the win percentage for the non-American fighter doubled. But it’s hard to make progress. Some people who work at commissions look the other way or worse. And some are scared. Two Mexican commissioners who were working with us had funeral wreaths delivered to their homes.”“Some people make good money from it,” Sheppard continues. “Most of it probably goes to the promoters. The so-called opponent gets something. Sometimes they put one fighter in the ring and use another fighter’s name for a fee. Sometimes they don’t even have the fight and just report a win for a particular fighter.”Bamba’s knockout streak began in Santa Marta, Colombia, in January 2024,with two reported fights in less than a week. On three occasions in 2024, he was listed as having fought twice in Colombia within a span of six days or less.“As far as I know,” Fina says, “Paul booked all the fights he had last year himself. I had nothing to do with them.”Christian supports Fina’s version of events, saying, “Paul represented himself in negotiating his fights. He had contacts with promoters. I didn’t go to his international fights but I dealt with a lot of the logistics like setting up the travel.”Christian also says that an average trip to Colombia cost about $5,000 all inclusive and that he helped finance the trips through the business he ran with Bamba. Asked whether the fights were fixed, he answers: “Paul got in the ring with fighters. There were crowds. He hit and got hit.” Pressed for more detail, Christian says, “I’ve seen guys fight and it looked to me like a guy wasn’t fighting. I never had any doubts about Paul’s opponents.”But others have a different view.View image in fullscreenPaul Bamba trained hard but was viewed as a limited fighter.Photograph: Sean O’Neill“From what I heard,” says a trainer who worked with Bamba, “in a lot of those fights, Paul knew the other guy was coming to lose and would quit on his stool.”Someone who was on site for one of Bamba’s fights in Colombia says, “Paul knocked his guy out. And I remember thinking: ‘No way.’”A cornerman who worked with one of Bamba’s opponents gives further context, saying, “Some guys aren’t fighting to win. They’re fighting to feed their families. They don’t care about their record. They need the money. Put yourself in that position. People don’t like to talk about it. They pretend it’s not happening. But it is. Bamba wasn’t much better the year he won all those fights than he was the year before. But it was like building a house. If you have the money to pay for it, you can build the house any way you want.”Did Bamba know that some of his fights were fixed? Three people who knew and liked him offer their thoughts.“Paul was a fighter. When a fighter is in the ring, he knows whether or not someone is trying to hurt him.”“I’m sure that some of the guys Paul fought were so unskilled or so far gone that they had no chance of winning. But some of the others would have beaten him in an honest fight. And it’s hard to believe that Paul was so delusional that he thought all of the guys he was fighting were trying to win.”“Of course he knew. Someone had to set things up.”On 19 October 2024, Bamba fought in the United States for the first time since his knockout streak began. The opponent was Francisco Cordero (listed on BoxRecas born and living in Colombia). The fight took place in New Hampshire, a state with minimal regulatory oversight for boxing. Bamba was required to submit the results of bloodwork taken within the previous six months (to check for hepatitis), an eye examination and an EKG (both taken within the previous year), and to undergo a cursory physical examination before the fight. He knocked Cordero out in the third round.Michael Reyes was the promoter for Bamba v Cordero.“It was a paid-for fight,” Reyes says. “Bamba’s team got in touch with me and paid for everything. Travel, lodging, the opponent’s purse. They chose the opponent. There was a slot fee to get on the card. Typically, I get $500 for that. The only reason he was on the card is that it was a paid-for fight. He wasn’t selling any tickets. No one was traveling to New Hampshire to watch him fight. The contract said his purse was $1.”“He seemed like a nice guy,” Reyes continues. “He was polite. Our interaction was pretty much, ‘Hello. How are you? Thanks for coming.’ There was nothing else one way or the other that I remember about him. When it’s my event, I’m so busy that, unless it’s a fighter who’s directly connected to me, I might not even watch the fight. I don’t remember watching this one.”Two weeks later, Bamba fought again; this time in Alabama, another state with minimal regulatory oversight. The opponent was Colombian-born Santander Silgado Gelez who lives in Florida. Bamba was credited with a sixth-round stoppage.‘I didn’t really plan it’: what Ali told me when we rewatched The Rumble in the JungleRead more“Paul was introduced to me by a promoter in Mississippi who was a friend of a friend of a guy who promoted with me,” says Dexter Sutton, who promoted the fight. “Paul wanted to buy a spot on the card and we sold him the spot for $300. Paul did all the arrangements for the opponent and took care of all the expenses. All we had to do was make sure the fighters got their bloodwork and everything was OK with the commission. Alabama isn’t as strict as some other places with the physicals.”Sutton continues: “I thought Paul was a nice guy. He had somebody with him that worked his corner. We had the normal conversation. ‘How was your trip? Welcome to our promotion.’ The opponent fought pretty much like he came for a payday. It looked like Paul carried him for a few more rounds than it could have been. Then the other guy just quit. Later on, I heard Paul died and I wanted to send flowers to his funeral. But when I contacted the people who put him in touch with me, they never got back with where to send the flowers.”There’s no indication that Reyes or Sutton did anything improper. They were following the laws of the states in which they did business.Meanwhile, there’s no way to know how many of Bamba’s final 14 fights were honestly fought. But statistics and the available video suggest that a significant number of them weren’t. That brings the narrative to Bamba’s final fight on 21 December 2024, in Carteret, New Jersey against Rogelio “Porky” Medina Luna.Medinais a 36-year-old journeymanwho entered the ring for his fight against Bamba with a 42-10 record that included 36 knockouts. There was a time long ago when he was a prospect with 23 wins in 23 fights. In recent years, he has been a stepping stone for big-name fighters such as Gilberto Ramírez, David Benavidez, Badou Jack, James DeGale and Caleb Plant. The prevailing view among boxing insiders was that Bamba was nowhere near Medina’s level as a fighter.Bamba v Medina was designated as a fight for the World Boxing Association ‘gold’ cruiserweight championship. The WBA isn’t known for the validity of its championship processes. At present, it recognizes 43-year-old Kubrat Pulev as “heavyweight champion of the world” – a distinction that Pulev earned last December when he defeated 40-year-old Manuel Charr, who underwent double hip replacement surgery in 2017.“Thomas LaManna set it up with us,” says Alex Barbosa, who promoted Bamba v Medina. “Thomas also worked things out with the WBA. We didn’t have to pay Paul. Paul and Thomas paid Rogelio’s purse and all of the other expenses associated with the fight. That’s standard practice these days. And Paul was super nice. We never had any problem with him. He was a good guy.”LaManna explains more. “Paul wanted to do his thing,” he says. “It was pretty simple to put together. The sanctioning fee we paid the WBA for the gold belt was $25,000. That was the big expense. You had Medina’s purse, some travel and other expenses. Paul had financial backers and sponsors who covered most of it. He sold some tickets. It was a common boxing deal structured so Alex wouldn’t lose any money on it.”On 12 November 2024, Bamba posted on X: “12/21/24 I’ll take on my biggest challenge and fight for the opportunity to live my dream.” On 15 December he posted again: “6 days till my 14th fight this year. WBA GOLD Cruiserweight World Title. I have sacrificed this entire year and have given everything I have to boxing.”Bamba v Medina was a dreary outing. At the end of round six, Medina told his corner to stop the fight, saying that he had leg cramps.A veteran trainer who was at the fight says, “Paul got hit with some big punches. I remember his head snapping back a lot. But each time Porky hit him, he backed off and didn’t press the action. And then Porky quit on his stool. From where I sat, it looked like, if Porky came to fight, it would have been a different story.”“I was there,” says another boxing veteran. “And if you knew what you were watching – to me, at least – it didn’t add up. The whole fight didn’t seem right.”LaManna worked Bamba’s corner that night. “Paul’s regular trainer couldn’t make it,” LaManna says, “so someone else was the chief second and I helped out. I thought Paul would do better than he did in the early part of the fight. But as it went on, Porky faded.”“How good a fighter was Paul?” LaManna is asked.“We could all be better,” he says.“There was nothing crazy in the fight,” Barbosa adds. “Paul didn’t take any ‘Oh my God’ punches that I saw. I wasn’t surprised when Rogelio stayed on his stool. You can see it in a fighter’s face when he doesn’t want to continue.”Then Barbosa is asked the same question as LaManna: How good a fighter was Paul?“You’re as good as your record says you are,” Barbosa answers. “And Paul’s record was pretty good.”Bamba v Medinais available on YouTube. Readers can watch it and make their own judgment as to the merits of the fight.Paul Bamba vs Rogelio MedinaIn the dressing room after the fight, Bamba was ecstatic. “If Jake Paul wants to take boxing seriously,” he proclaimed, “I’m probably the first call he’s going to make. If he wants to do something real, I’m right here.”“That was the goal,” Christian says. “Almost from the start, getting a fight against Jake Paul was the goal of everything,”If Bamba v Jake Paul had happened, it would have been an ugly beatdown. Jake Paul has become a solid club fighter; Bamba wasn’t close to that level. But fantasies aren’t bound by the same rules as reality.“Tonight I accomplished a goal I set out with this year,” Bamba posted on X after the Medina fight. “14 fights 14 KOs. Thank you to everyone who’s been behind me. Truly grateful for anyone who’s breathed belief into me. The redemption arc is finally over and big things are on the horizon for 2025. THANK YOU ALL!”On 22 December, Bamba posted again on X: “Possibly will be fighting on New Year’s Eve in Dubai. Might be able to hit 15. Huge announcement coming.”It wasn’t to be.Six days later, the news spread from friend to friend: Bamba had died in his sleep.There was an autopsy. No official statement regarding the cause of Bamba’s death has been released. The most common belief among his friends is that he died as the result of a brain bleed. But whatever the cause, Bamba is dead. And his friends are sifting through their memories.“I went to Paul’s last fight,” Fina says. “And it was the same story as most of his fights. It was competitive, which it shouldn’t have been. Paul took a lot of unnecessary punishment. He texted me after the fight. It was the last text I ever got from him.”Bamba’s text to Fina read,You still think I suck, don’t you?Paul Bamba died in his sleep on 27 December 2024, at the age of 35. There were clear signs before then that his health was in jeopardy.There’s no good way to get hit. And Bamba got hit a lot. He was hit in the gym. He was hit in fights even when there was an understanding that he would win. For a while, he was a paid-by-the-round sparring partner. They take a beating.“I told him to slow down,” Fina says. “He never took a break. He never gave himself time to heal. He was fighting way too much and taking much too much punishment. But Paul did what he wanted to do. There was no saying ‘no’ to him.”The most troubling documentary evidence relating to Bamba’s medical condition is a 25 July 2023 letter written by a neurologist, Dr Alina Sharinn. Bamba’s last fight prior to the letter being written was his 21 April 2023 beatdown at the hands of Chris Avila. He was scheduled to fight Anthony Taylor in Tennessee on 22 July but the fight was cancelled. Then Paul posted Sharinn’s letter on social media.The letter read in part, “Mr Bamba has suffered a concussion and an episode of traumatic diplopia [double vision] within the past year and now presents with increasing headaches. His MRI of the brain revealedwhite matter changesin both frontal lobes. At this time, I discussed with Mr Bamba to stop boxing temporarily as well as to avoid any other activity that can produce head trauma. He will be reevaluated in 4-6 weeks.”Why did Bamba post the letter? Who knows.Then, in a 28 July video post on X, Bamba declared: “The first thing we’re gonna go over is the medical itself. She said she wanted to take a second look. She said there’s signs of early onset trauma. Is there anything I want to tell her. So as soon as she said ‘early onset trauma,’ I was like ‘trauma?’ And she said ‘brain trauma’. So I said ‘Oh!’ That freaked me out. I can’t lie. I have a bunch of twitchin’. I got headaches. It was scary to hear it. It’s brain trauma, bro. It’s a lot different from just some bullshit. I’m not gonna get too deep into my health. But there’s a few things that are alarming.”Nitin Sethi is a neurologist and the medical director for the New York State Athletic Commission.“A lot of people have white matter changes,” Sethi explains. “It’s most common in older people and can result from hypertension, diabetes; there are many possible causes. But this was not an older person and it’s certainly possible that the changes were related to boxing. So what you have to do is compare MRIs over time, look at the differentials, and then decide whether to say, ‘That’s it. No more. We won’t license you to fight.’ At the very least, it’s a red flag.”Dr Margaret Goodman, also a neurologist, founded the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (Vada) to combat the use of banned performance-enhancing drugs in boxing and is one of the foremost advocates for fighter safety in the United States.“I agree with Nitin,” Goodman says. “Based on this letter and the fighter’s history, it certainly looks as though the fighter was at increased risk of serious injury and shouldn’t have been allowed to fight again without a serious medical review.”But there was no serious medical review because Bamba brought his career to jurisdictions where there was little if any regulatory oversight. He fought next in Colombia on 25 January 2024, which was when his 14-fight knockout streak began.The details around Bamba’s final fight, held in New Jersey, are particularly troubling.“Before that fight,” one of Bamba’s friends says, “he was complaining to me about headaches. He said: ‘My head is killing me.’ I told him: ‘Look, if your head is hurting, slow down. Get checked out.’ But he wouldn’t listen to anybody. He did what he wanted to do.”The New Jersey State Athletic Control Board (NJSACB) is thought of as having high medical standards.“A lot of people have questions about how Paul got approved for that fight,” a well-respected trainer says.Larry Hazzard, the commissioner of the NJSACB, declined comment when asked about Bamba. Instead, a public information officer for the New Jersey Attorney General’s office told the Guardian that “Mr Bamba fulfilled both the license and medical requirements and was granted clearance to compete in Carteret on 21 December 2024.”In that regard, matchmaker Eric Bottjer, who keeps an eye on these things as part of his job, says, “There was a show in New Jersey earlier this year where phoney medicals were submitted to the commission for three fighters [two bloodwork and one MRI]. It’s being looked at now.”After Bamba’s final victory, his publicity machine went into overdrive, claiming that his 14 knockouts in 2024 had broken Mike Tyson’s mark for most consecutive knockout wins in a calendar year. Even if all of Bamba’s wins had been legitimate – which they weren’t – that claim would have been inaccurate.Mike Tyson had 15 fights in 1985and won all of them by knockout. But we live in an age in which, if something is repeated often enough, it’s accepted as true no matter how false it might be. Many of the obituaries written about Bamba in mainstream publications cited his “knockout record”.Bamba’s friends speak of him with fondness.“He was determined to make something of himself,” Harris says. “He was passionate about chasing the impossible. He was determined to achieve what he considered success. He was relentless. That caught up with him in the end. But he will always be a motivating force in my life and the lives of many, many others.”But there was a downside to what Bamba did. He deserves respect for what he accomplished as a 5-3 club fighter who got in the ring and fought as honestly as he could. The fixed fights he had after that – and some of them were fixed – tarnished his legacy. There were times when he punched other men in the head and tried to hurt them with the understanding that they would not try to hurt him back. Some of those men – who were human punching bags – are likely to have suffered brain damage too.Fighters also have to take responsibility for their own physical wellbeing. And Bamba didn’t do that. He recklessly put his own life at risk.Bamba’s sister, Linda, puts his life in perspective.“To the very end,” Linda says, “Paul would ask our dad, ‘Are you proud of me?’ But we were all proud of Paul for getting to where he was in life before boxing. Boxing was about how Paul felt about himself. Nobody who loved him would have loved him less without those fights. I didn’t go to his fights. It scared me. I didn’t want to watch him get hit. Before the last fight, I knew he was hurting. His head hurt really bad. But it was, ‘Let me just get this win. Let me just win this championship.’ It wasn’t till after we got the postmortems that I understood how bad things were. Someone should have said, ‘Slow down. This isn’t normal. This is dangerous. Your life comes first. You don’t have to keep doing this. We love you and we’re proud of you with or without boxing.’ I wish I’d asked more questions about what was really going on. It sucks that Paul’s life was cut short. It really sucks.”"

It means she has not been lionized in the same way as a similarly brilliant playerEtan ThomasFri 28 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 28 Mar 2025 05.02 EDTShareUConn’s Paige Bueckers, the probable No 1 pick in this year’s WNBA draft,is a brilliant talent, although she may not want you to point that out.“Everybody was focused on me and what I did at UConn my freshman year,” she said during last year’sNCAA Tournament. “But I think it’s more important for the game to share the spotlight to grow the game and show all the stars of college basketball and not just focus on one particular player, whether it be me, Caitlin [Clark], JuJu [Watkins], Angel [Reese]. There’s so many names in college basketball now that are huge, that are stars that deserve credit.”That’s very admirable of her, but sometimes praise is due. In 2021, Bueckers was the first freshman to earn the Wooden Award, Naismith Trophy, AP Player of the Year and USBWA Player of the Year. She also led the Huskies in points, assists, steals and three-point percentage for a team that played in the Final Four and finished 28-2 overall.Then, in July 2022, she tore her ACL and missed the entire 2022-23 season. She had also been sidelined by injury for 19 games the previous season.But this season she is healthy and wreaking havoc on every team she faces. She is the model of efficiency. Right now, Bueckers is the only player across the NBA, WNBA and college basketball witha 50/40/90 lineand top assist to turnover ratio. She’s averaging nearly 20 points per game and a conference-best 4.8 assists per game. It’s little wonder her team are one of the favorites to win the championship.Paige Bueckers: UConn’s point guard sensation doesn’t need to be the next Caitlin ClarkRead moreTo bounce back from a series of serious injuries is amazing in itself, but to come back arguably better than she was before deserves a standing ovation. And, yet, Bueckers doesn’t receive the same fawning attention from large parts of white America as Clark, a player of similar skills. Why?Perhaps it’s because, unlike Clark, Bueckers has always been outspoken about issues off the court. At the 2021 ESPYs, Bueckers was named the college athlete of the year. She used her acceptance speech to celebrate and honor Black women in particular.“With the light that I have now as a white woman who leads a Black-led sport and celebrated here, I want to shed a light on Black women,” said Bueckers. “They don’t get the media coverage that they deserve. They’ve given so much to the sport, the community and society as a whole and their value is undeniable.”Only 19 at the time, she told the audience that in the previous WNBA season, 80% of the postseason awards were won by Black players, but they received a fraction of the coverage given to their white peers.“I think it’s time for change. Sports media holds the key to storylines,” she said. “Sports media and sponsors tell us who is valuable, and you have told the world that I mattered today, and everyone who voted, thank you. But I think we should use this power together to also celebrate Black women.”She went on to acknowledge Black female trailblazers. “To Maria Taylor, Robin Roberts, Maya Moore, Odicci Alexander. To all the incredible Black women in my life and on my teams,” she said. “To Breonna Taylor and all the lives lost, and to those names who are not yet learned, but I hope to share, I stand behind you and I continue to follow you, follow your lead and fight for you guys so I just want to say thank you for everything,”While Black America cheered Bueckers, it seemed like mainstream, white America – a demographic that once viewed her as, in her words, a “media darling” – weren’t singing her praises quite as much. And still don’t. Is this coincidence? Or maybe because her injuries have made people forget her greatness as an athlete? Possibly. But she’s back from injury now, so why aren’t people as focused on Bueckers as they were on Clark last season, when she was tearing up college basketball? Maybe if Bueckers had delivered a more vanilla ESPYs speech things would have been different.Another factor is the Angel Reese effect. Women’s college basketball ratings surged in the last two NCAA Tournaments, some of that was to do with the excellence of the players on show. But some of it was for less edifying reasons. Much of the media made Reese the villain to Clark’s heroine after the Black Princess upstaged the Great White Hope in the 2023 NCAA Tournament championship game. The viral image of Reese defiantlywaving her hand in front of her face– the same taunt Clark had used in a previous game – transformed Clark and Reese from great players to lightning rods for racial animus. People who had no interest in women’s basketball suddenly became fanatics – in every sense of the word – for all the worst reasons. They were there to cheer Clark’s whiteness, and attack Reese’s Blackness, not their talent. When she was drafted into the WNBA last year Clarkrepeatedly asked fans not to weaponize her, but it didn’t stop her becoming a dubious hero for bigots, who oftenspewed racist abuse at her Black opponents. Clark had become a huge star, because of her sheer talent – she was an WNBA All-Star and rookie of the year in 2024 – but also because of her supposed rivalry with Reese, a rivalryboth players have played down(and, it has to be said,profited financially from).Meanwhile, there has been no Black villain for Bueckers to compete against. The fact that that has meant she has gained less attention and adoration from middle America says a lot about the state of the country.Meanwhile, during Ramadan Bueckerscooks breakfastfor her muslim teammate, Jana El-Alfy, sings gospel songs (the Black versions)before games, has a level of connection with her Black teammates that truly resembles a sisterhood, wasraised by her Black stepmother, has Black stepbrothers and sisters, has had Black boyfriends has designated herself an ally to her Black teammates on multiple occasions, not just in her ESPYs speech. All of this simply does not sit well with “that certain demographic” who embraced Clark and championed her for the wrong reasons. That’s not to say all of Clark’s fans fall into this category nor is this the fault of Clark, who just wants to play basketball.Bueckers is a special player and deserves every ounce of praise and respect both on and off the court. But if she does end up winning a championship, and still doesn’t receive the praise given to Clark, you’ll know why.Explore more on these topicsNCAA TournamentCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsCaitlin ClarkBasketballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The deal was reached with three years remaining on Sanders’ existing five-year, $29.5m deal he signed when he was brought in from Jackson State.Why hasn’t middle America given Paige Bueckers the Caitlin Clark treatment?Read more“Coach Prime has revolutionized college football and in doing so, has restored CU football to our rightful place as a national power,” athletic director Rick George said in a statement. “This extension not only recognizes Coach’s incredible accomplishments transforming our program on and off the field, it keeps him in Boulder to compete for conference and national championships in the years to come.”Sanders and the Buffaloes are coming off a 9-4 season in which they earned a spot in the Alamo Bowl.The Buffaloes have big cleats to fill, though. They’re losing Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter and Sanders’ sons, Shedeur – a projected high pick in the upcoming NFL draft – and Shilo. Next season will mark the first time in many years that Deion Sanders won’t be coaching one of his kids.Sanders and his high-profile staff have assembled another talented recruiting class – from high school recruits to transfer portal additions. The headliners of the class are Liberty transfer quarterback Kaidon Salter, Alabama transfer defensive lineman Jaheim Oatis and Julian ‘JuJu’ Lewis, a five-star high school quarterback who arrived on campus early to get a head start. Either Salter or Lewis figures to step in and take over for Shedeur Sanders as Colorado attempts to make back-to-back bowl games for the first time since 2004 and 2005.With Sanders’ decision to stay put, the Buffaloes avoid all sorts of mass exodus – from the new fans and celebrities he’s attracted to all the media attention the Buffaloes have received. In addition, the high-level recruits who were lured to town by the presence of Sanders figure to be staying, too.Should Sanders take another job – in the NFL or another NCAA team – his buyout is $12m if he terminates the deal on or before 31 December 2025; $10m in 2026, $6m in 2027, $4m in 2028 and $3m in 2029.Among his incentives are $150,000 if the Buffaloes win nine games in the regular season and $100,000 for each additional victory in the regular season.He also receives $150,000 if the team plays in the Big 12 title game and $150,000 if Colorado are invited to a non-college football playoff bowl. It’s $400,000 should the team win the conference championship or appear in the first round of the College Football Playoff. A first-round win earns him another $50,000. From there, it’s $100,000 for the semi-finals; $200,000 for the championship game and $250,000 if the Buffaloes win the national championship.His selection as the Big 12 Coach of the Year would earn him $75,000 and the national award $150,000.He’s certainly helped raise the profile of Colorado since taking over:22 of Colorado’s 24 games have been selected to be on network television or the flagship ESPN.The two highest average home attendance seasons have been 2023 (53,180 fans) and last season (52,514).Colorado was sixth in viewership during the 2024 regular season, trailing only Georgia, Ohio State, Alabama, Texas and Michigan.The football team generated $31.2m in ticket sales in Sanders’ first season in Boulder (a 4-8 record), according to the annual University of Colorado athletics NCAA financial reports. The program had $13m in ticket sales the year before his arrival.Colorado has seen its applications to attend the school increase 20% from a year ago.Home football games have meant a combined $93.9m in direct economic impact for Boulder and $146.5m in regional economic impact, according to the school.“To be honest, I don’t think that anybody fully was prepared for just how much national and international attention Coach Prime would generate for our community and the economic benefits that it would also engender,” John Tayer, the president and CEO of the Boulder Chamber, recently said in an interview. “There’s just a great deal of enthusiastic energy.”The success has carried over into the classroom as well. The football team had a GPA of 3.011 for the fall semester. It’s the first time the football program has been over 3.0, the school announced.“We’ve just scratched the surface of what this program can be,” Sanders said in a statement. “It’s not just about football; it’s about developing young men who are ready to take on the world. I’m committed to bringing greatness to this university, on and off the field. We’ve got work to do, and I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else but here, making history with these incredible players and this passionate fan base.“Lastly, anybody got at least a five bedroom home with acreage for sale?”Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

He was let go with the team on the verge of playing three home games in a four-day span starting Saturday – first the Lakers, then Boston on Monday, then Golden State on Tuesday.That starts a stretch where eight of Memphis’ final nine opponents are either playoff clubs or contending for a play-in spot. But it’s still possible, at least mathematically, that Memphis could get back to No 2 in the West, and it’s highly unlikely that the Grizzlies will fall into the play-in tournament range.Still, Memphis decided it was time for a change.“This was a difficult decision, given the consistent and tangible development of our players and overall success under Taylor’s leadership,” Zach Kleiman, the Grizzlies’ president and general manager of basketball operations, said in a statement.The Grizzlies will not be practicing Friday and announced no media availability.Jenkins was the fifth longest-tenured coach with his current club in the league, behind only San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich, Miami’s Erik Spoelstra, Golden State’s Steve Kerr and Denver’s Michael Malone – all of them having wonNBAtitles.Results against the league’s best teams so far this season weren’t a good sign for Jenkins.The Grizzlies were 0-4 against Oklahoma City, losing those games by 24, 13, 17 and 21 points. They’re 3-6 so far this season against Houston, Denver and the Lakers, the next three teams ahead of them in the West.And that’s been a trend all season for Memphis. The Grizzlies were really good against the sub-.500 teams, but struggled mightily against the winning clubs.Against the 13 other teams that currently are over .500, the Grizzlies are 11-20 this season and getting outscored by 77 points. Against the 16 clubs at .500 or worse, the Grizzlies are 33-9, outscoring those opponents by 462 points.Jenkins, with a career record of 250-214, passed Lionel Hollins for most wins in franchise history on 20 November with a victory against the Philadelphia 76ers. He also coached the most games in Grizzlies’ history, with the franchise launching in 1995.He took Memphis to the postseason three times during his tenure but only got to the second round once.In the 2021-22 season, the team won 56 games for the Grizzlies’ most in a season under Jenkins. The Grizzlies captured the Southwest Division and were a No 2 seed in the West. They ousted the Minnesota Timberwolves in the opening round, but lost to Golden State in the second with star Ja Morant dealing with an injury.Jenkins replaced JB Bickerstaff, who was fired after failing to make the playoffs in the 2018-19 season. He had served as an assistant with the Milwaukee Bucks and Atlanta Hawks, both working for coach Mike Budenholzer.He also served a stint in the San Antonio Spurs organization, eventually becoming head coach of the Spurs G League team in Austin.Jenkins’ arrival in Memphis coincided with the Grizzlies drafting Morant with the No 2 overall pick in 2019. Memphis made the postseason three straight seasons from 2021 to 2023. Then the Grizzlies went through a season plagued with injuries to major players.Morant played only nine games because of a 25-game league suspension and a right shoulder injury that ended his season. Fellow guard Desmond Bane missed considerable time with a left ankle sprain, and frontline reserve Brandon Clarke managed only six games because of a left Achilles tendon tear.That left Jenkins to manage the season with forward Jaren Jackson Jr and a bunch of makeshift lineups, eventually finishing 27-55.This season, Jenkins turned over his coaching staff and brought in a new offense based on spacing. Despite being plagued with turnovers, Memphis spent a large part of the season second in the West. Other teams surged as the Grizzlies’ rough patch dropped them to fifth place.Again, Jenkins spent another season piecing together lineups around Morant limited to 43 games with various illnesses, soreness, contusions and sprains. Morant missed Thursday night’s game, his sixth straight, with a strained hamstring.Explore more on these topicsMemphis GrizzliesNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Managers, staff, players – we don’t deserve it. Not even a watch.”In September Rodri ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament that had been expected to rule him out until next season. With the midfielder back in light training, Guardiola was asked whether there was any chance Rodri could play inthe Club World Cup. City’s first group match is on 18 June against the Moroccan club Wydad.“I hope – wish,” the manager said. “Will be nice if he could play tomorrow, but we have to be careful to not make the wrong decision and take a step back.“He has been injured for seven-eight months. He is behaving really well on the pitch … step by step, what the doctors or physios say. Not to say: ‘Play the World Cup,’ and then lose him again.”The verdict regarding more than 130 Premier League charges against City of alleged financial wrongdoing is yet to be returned. Guardiola denied this was causing him and his players agitation.“We are more than one year with that,” he said, “so nothing changes with one more week or two more weeks or three more weeks or four more weeks.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With Brentford to play on Wednesday and a Champions League place still possible, Howe’s players are unlikely to get “mortalled”, to use the regional phrase, or join any after-party down the city’s Diamond Strip.Newcastle perform U-turn over open-top bus parade after fan outcryRead moreChi Onwurah, the local MP who campaigned for a parade, this week presented a parliamentary petition signed by constituents asking the government to congratulate Newcastle “and consider a national award to recognise major group sporting achievements”. It was a move given an indifferent reception within the House of Commons.Certain clubs are more used to success than others. Barcelona have the Canaletes fountain at the top of La Rambla, Real Madrid fans congregate at the Plaza de Cibeles to drape a scarf around a statue of a Greek goddess. Bayern Munich’s beer-swilling antics from the balcony of the town hall at Marienplatz are a near-annual event.Newcastle’s final arrangements follow the time-honoured traditions of slow-moving bus edging past fans, before a civic reception where players address their public from a stage. A town-hall balcony is usually the final destination. Here’s where the speeches come in. Louis van Gaal’sleder-clad call to arms in 2010 at Marienplatz, bellowing his offering of a “big kiss from the coach of the champions” for the mothers of Munich is the classic of the genre, though two examples from 1977 in England also stand out.View image in fullscreenEmlyn Hughes (second left) celebrates Liverpool’s First Division and European Cup wins in 1977. The defender called Everton ‘tragic’ during the open-top bus parade, which he later regretted.Photograph: Pictorial Parade/Getty ImagesEmlyn Hughes’s “Liverpool are magic, Everton are tragic” in celebrating a league title and European Cup was an example of high spirits misjudging the occasion. He later apologised, for the “day I could have bitten off my tongue”. Tommy Docherty addressed Albert Square in Manchester, the FA Cup adorned in United red. “We promised you last year we’d bring the Cup back,” he said, referring to United losing the previous year’s final, huge cheers greeting him. It would be his last public act as a United manager, as he was soon removed for admitting his love affair with the club physio’s wife.Manchester City kept up a parade tradition in the Pep Guardiola glory years, with Kyle Walker usually leading proceedings and Jack Grealish adopting that Leonardo DiCaprio Titanic-crossed-with-Messianic pose during 2023’s treble party. Considering Grealish’s decline through injuries and the loss of form and patronage of Guardiola, that shirtless image just about captures his zenith at City, leading player and relatable man of the people. Perhaps a little too relatable for his manager’s liking.‘Not even a watch’: No prizes if City win Club World Cup, warns GuardiolaRead moreGrealish’s state of refreshment brought back memories of Jack Wilshere’santi-Tottenham chantsas Arsenal celebrated, at Islington Town Hall,their 2015 FA Cup win. Wilshere landed a £40k fine and much moral opprobrium, though his state of inebriation was hardly much different to that of England’s 2005 Ashes winners, or England’s 2003 Rugby World Cup squad, where players became drunk to the point of unintelligibility.The last team other than City to win the Premier League, Liverpool, were denied such a moment by the Covid pandemic, though fans did flood into the city with victory confirmed, the party raging on for 24 hours,against the guidance of the time. Should, as expected, Liverpool lift this season’s title, a return to a more traditional bus parade is surely being planned. Nothing is announced to tempt fate though planning is necessary. Memories abound of 2007, when photos from a bus depot emerged of a red-bedecked bus bearing the legend “six times”, only for Liverpool to lose the Champions League final to Milan.View image in fullscreenJack Wilshere caused consternation when on the mic during Arsenal’s FA Cup parade in 2015.Photograph: Scott Heavey/PARecognition of the runners-up is a lost tradition, though Newcastle staged parades to St James’ Park after losing finals in 1974 and 1976, heroes’ welcomes to bemused, beaten but grateful players. Not so grateful the Everton squad of 1986, asked to join the double “celebration” of coming second to Liverpool in both league and FA Cup. Three buses toured the city, Liverpool occupying first and second with attendant silverware. The third had no toilet and as Everton players – on the bus swiftly named “the loser cruiser” – drowned their sorrows, empty cans were reportedly repurposed.“We had the trophies,” said the Liverpool defender Steve Nicol. “All Everton had was a few cans of ale.” Graeme Sharp, the Everton striker, said: “It was unbelievable, Liverpool were all celebrating and we were sitting there miserable.” His teammate, Peter Reid, refused to board the bus, even after the manager, Howard Kendall, threatened him with a two-week fine. “I said: ‘That’ll do me’ and pissed off. I watched the parade from a pub in Bolton.”Explore more on these topicsFootballNewcastle UnitedCarabao CupManchester CityLiverpoolManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hürzeler’s short international break, among family and friends, received a polite but pointed interruption. “Walking through the city, one of the Brighton supporters called my name and said he’s really looking forward to the game,” said the club’s head coach. “He said that we have to give everything in this game, and of course you feel it, but for me it’s important that we don’t make it artificial excitement.”Hürzeler, born a decade after Albionlost the 1983 finalto Manchester United in a replay, can be excused for not knowing the lore of Steve Foster’s headband, Tony Grealish’s hirsute captaincy and the striker Gordon Smith’s “must score” miss. There are always the owner, Tony Bloom, and the club’s time-served staffers to run through the details. In any case, Brighton relived that Wembley day two seasons ago, anotherhard-luck loss to Unitedin the semi-finals, this time on penalties.FA Cup quarter-finals: what to look out for this weekendRead moreThe German prefers being forward-facing. At 32, he can only be learning on the job and the signs are he learns quickly from reverses. On Saturday, Brighton face Nottingham Forest,who beat them 7-0on 1 February. Since then, Hürzeler’s team are unbeaten and in midweek return to Premier League action in seventh place, a point off fifth and probable Champions League qualifying. An open draw, only Manchester City remaining of the usual suspects, has made the FA Cup an achievable goal, Brighton one of four quarter-finalists to have never won a major trophy.“It’s very important not to overreact and to understand what makes us strong as a team,” Hürzeler said. “That was exactly the case when we lost against Nottingham. Especially the players, they took a lot of ownership. They took a lot of responsibility, and they said: ‘OK, we have to go back to the roots.’“We need to have this togetherness, we need to stick together, not only in good phases but also in negative phases, and we proved it this season so far, especially after the loss against Nottingham. We showed the spirit of togetherness, and the last thing, especially in this phase of the season, you need to have the belief, and I have the biggest belief in this group.”Forest will bewithout the injured Chris Wood, who took a wrecking ball to Brighton’s defence at the City Ground in February, scoring a hat-trick. Hürzeler offers full respect to his opposite number, Nuno Espírito Santo: “He built a winning machine. They have players who have quality and a style that fits completely to the profiles of the player. That’s something special. That shows his quality.”Hürzeler, as frontman for Brighton’s acclaimed executive structure, is very different from his predecessor Roberto De Zerbi, who in turn could hardly have been more different from Graham Potter. The Italian was the counterattacking tactical revolutionary who briefly became the hottest name in football. Potter established himself as the steadiest of hands. Hürzeler offers something else, though perhaps also something in between. When appointed last July, he talked of “challenging the establishment” and yet has developed Brighton in an often methodical, commonsense fashion. Time spent in his company reveals a passionate belief in the power of psychology and mentality.View image in fullscreenBrighton celebrate Danny Welbeck’s winner in the fifth round at Newcastle. They have not lost since their 0-7 thrashing at Forest on 1 February.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty ImagesHürzeler has drawn inspiration from the unlikely – for a German – world of rugby union: “The loss against Nottingham was a big loss but it was also a loss that helped us in our development. Now it’s important to find a good balance. There is a book about the All Blacks, and they talk about the red head and the blue head, the cool head.“And if you are always in the red head and acting with too much emotion, saying: ‘We have to make a revenge, we are angry that they beat us seven-zero,’ I think then you are too much in the emotional part of your mind and that’s why it’s so important to stay in the blue phase, in the cool head, make decisions without emotions, stay rational.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhere many clubs choose to prioritise, perhaps even third-placed Forest, with their golden chance of playing Champions League football next season, Hürzeler says he is under no pressure from Bloom or the chief executive, Paul Barber, to plump for one competition over the other, even if the Champions League has come within touching distance.“We try to go into every competition to achieve the maximum, we try to go into every game and win it, so that’s our approach, our thinking, and therefore we don’t have these kinds of discussions. It’s about building the rhythm, keeping the connection, building this consistency and therefore I am not a big fan of making too many rotations, too many changes in the starting XI.”If the FA Cup has lost lustre because managers rotate their squads to concentrate on league matters, including those from lower down the Football League, the former St Pauli coach presents a different mode of thinking. Should Brighton reach European football next season, fatigue may become of greater concern. For this season at least, Hürzeler appears convinced much of it remains in the mind.“I think when the players feel in a good shape, are in a good mood, they have a lot of belief in themselves. They are confident and want to be on the pitch. That’s my feeling; the mind can decide the feeling on the pitch so therefore the players don’t feel this tiredness, and therefore I am not a fan of making too many changes.”Explore more on these topicsBrighton & Hove AlbionFA CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The proposed ground is further into the park than a previous design, in which the stadium would have overlapped with the footprint at St James’ Park.Newcastle would therefore be able to continue playing at St James’ during construction, which would significantly ease the financial burden. Newcastle are due to stage several group games at the 2028 European Championship at St James’, which would be unaffected.Newcastle are working with the London-based architecture firm KSS, whose recent sport projects include the Ahmed bin Ali Stadium in Qatar, No 1 Court at Wimbledon and Leicester City’s new training ground. The club have appointed a planning consultant but have yet to make an application to Newcastle city council.Obtaining planning permission may not be straightforward because the project involves building on land in the city centre that is subject to a conservation order, and an application could lead to legal challenges. A commitment to build a replacement green space on the site of St James’ is likely to be essential to getting the project signed off.Newcastle’s ambition is to build the second-largest club ground in the country after Old Trafford. Plans for the new stadium, which would take an estimated seven years to complete, show a multisport and entertainment venue able to stage concerts and other large events.Newcastle’s chief executive, Darren Eales, is understood to have told staff that 65,000 is the proposed capacity, a 13,000 increase on St James’, because every seat needs to be filled at every game. The project is being led by the chief operating officer, Brad Miller, who was involved in expansion projects at East Midlands, Stansted and Manchester airports.Miller has told the club’s nine-person fan advisory body that a new stadium, which will also have more corporate hospitality and more leisure facilities, could double Newcastle’s match-day revenue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, he never seemed to get to grips with the national-team job and failed to earn the trust of Brazil’s demanding fans after winning only seven of his 16 games in charge.After a lacklustre Copa América campaign when Brazil were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Uruguay last year, the CBF was willing to wait and see until the 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Paraguay in June to reassess the situation following the end of the European season and the Club World Cup in the US in June and July.View image in fullscreenThe Brazil players during their 4-1 defeat by Argentina.Photograph: Eduardo Carmim/SPP/ShutterstockHowever, after Brazil slumped to their heaviest ever loss in a qualifierwhen they were thrashed by Argentina, the CBF president, Ednaldo Rodrigues, decided to act.Brazil have been in unfamiliar territory for over two years since crashing out of the 2022 World Cup against Croatia on penalties in the quarter-finals, an elimination that led to the exit of the long-time manager, Tite.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Coventry enjoyed more early possession, but the home side produced the first moment of quality to take the lead in the 19th minute.Hamer picked himself up after being hauled down by the Coventry defender Bobby Thomas 25 yards from goal and curled his free-kick over the wall and into visiting goalkeeper Oliver Dovin’s top left-hand corner. It was Hamer’s eighth league goal of the season, while his celebrations were muted having left Coventry for Bramall Lane in August 2023.United extended their lead in the 30th minute. Hamza Choudhury and Femi Seriki combined down the right and the latter’s low, drilled cross was deftly turned home by Campbell for his 10th league goal of the season.Coventry were dealt another blow before the break when Dovin was carried off on a stretcher following Campbell’s challenge. Dovin was replaced by Brad Collins, whose superb reflex save from Campbell’s header denied the Blades a third goal in first-half stoppage time.Coventry began the second period with renewed purpose.

As he had already spent more than a year on remand, Alves was released under legal supervision shortly afterwards.Now the appeal court, presided over by two female judges and one male, has ruled unanimously that the conviction was unsafe because of what it described as a “series of gaps, inaccuracies, inconsistencies and contradictions over the facts, the judicial assessment and their consequences”.The court added that the victim’s claim that she had non-consensual sex in a VIP bathroom in the Sutton nightclub in Barcelona on New Year’s Eve 2022 was undermined because she was “an unreliable witness” whose testimony could not be verified. “Her story doesn’t correspond with reality,” they decided. In their ruling, the judges also stated that during the trial Alves’s right to the presumption of innocence had been denied.The prosecution had demanded a nine-year sentence. As part of his conviction, the court ordered Alves to pay €150,000 (£125,000) in compensation to the victim, banned him from approaching the victim’s home or place of work, and from communicating with her by any means for nine years. At the time, the then Catalan equality minister, Tania Vergè, described the conviction as “a milestone” following a series of high-profile footballers being accused of sexual assault and avoiding prosecution.Alves won dozens of titles with clubs including Sevilla, Barcelona, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain and played 126 times for Brazil, including at three World Cups. He helped Brazil win two Copa Américas and an Olympic gold medal.The defender played for Barcelona from 2008-16, briefly rejoined the club in 2022 and still has a residence near the city. Alves was with the Mexican club Pumas when arrested and immediately had his contract terminated.Explore more on these topicsFootballSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

TheFulhammanager could only watch on as João Palhinha, Tosin Adarabioyo and Willian left the club in the summer. Silva is no stranger to losing key players, having previously had to cope with the exits of Fábio Carvalho and Aleksandar Mitrovic. When Fulham lost their first game of the season, it looked like it could be a tough year for the club. But, with the end of the campaign looming, they are flying high in two competitions.The Premier League is likely to have five clubs in the Champions League next season and, as outlandish as it sounds, Fulham could be one of them. They are eighth in the table, just three points behind fifth-placed Manchester City. A place in the Europa League is more realistic, especially as they have two routes to the competition. Fulham hostCrystal Palacein the FA Cup quarter-finals on Saturday, with a Wembley semi-final up for grabs. Fulham have only played in one FA Cup final, 50 years ago, which they lost to West Ham. This season they have a great opportunity to go back to Wembley and win the first major trophy of their history.Silva is doing a brilliant job. Impressively, he is hauling Fulham up the table despite the efforts to remove the rug from underneath him. “It’s not easy to find other clubs in thePremier Leaguethat lost four key players who normally are starting XI players. It’s going to be important for us to rebuild everything again,” said Silva in September as he contemplated the season ahead. The fact that Fulham are within a whisker of a Champions League place is a testament to his coaching ability. Previously considered a yo-yo club, Fulham are now firmly established as top-tier side.View image in fullscreenMarco Silva’s Fulham have two paths to European football.Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesSilva routinely sets his side up in a 4-2-3-1 formation but he is tactically flexible and will tinker with his team to match his opponents. Take the recent2-1 win at Wolves, where he moved to a three-man backline to counter Vítor Pereira’s system. Even so, the 4-2-3-1 is Silva’s bread and butter and the players know the setup like the backs of their hands.When one full-back pushes on, the other tucks inside to forge a three-man defence. The team has a solid defensive shield in Sasa Lukic and Sander Berge, the latter joining from Burnley over the summer to add a physical presence to the midfield to cover Palhinha’s exit. In attack, Adama Traoré, Alex Iwobi, Emile Smith Rowe, Harry Wilson and Willian – who returned to the club in February – interchange positions. Their movement adds to the unpredictability of the forward line led by Raúl Jiménez, with backup striker Rodrigo Muniz proving Silva’s supersub having scored more goals off the bench (five) than any other player in the Premier League this season.What stands out about Fulham is their ability to play attractive football while also limiting the number of chances they face. They are conceding just 11 shots per game this season, which is the fifth lowest in the Premier League – for context, Liverpool and Arsenal (both 9.7) top this metric. They have conceded just 38 league goals, the same asCarabao Cup winners Newcastleand two fewer than defending champions Manchester City.No longer are Fulham an easy ride for the Premier League’s bigger sides. And, even when opponents do breach their defence, getting the better of goalkeeper Bernd Leno is far easier said than done; the German ranks sixth for saves (80) in the league this season. The former Fulham striker Louis Saha made the case recently that Silva is the best manager in London at the minute, even above Mikel Arteta and Enzo Maresca despite their teams sitting higher up the table. “Fulham never had this type of consistency with any other manager,” said Saha.Raúl Jiménez used his Fulham form to revitalize Mexico in Nations LeagueRead moreSilva has said goodbye to some high-profile players – they lost £100m worth of talent when Mitrovic left for Saudi Arabia and Palhinha moved to Bayern Munich – but the club has spent well. Signing experienced Premier League players has helped, with last summer’s arrivals, Joachim Andersen, Berge and Smith Rowe, all well versed in top-tier English football. Silva has remained consistent with his tactics, which means the players know what they are doing and new additions fit in quickly.There have been reports that Tottenham are eyeing up Silva as a replacement for Ange Postecoglou if he leaves in the summer, which is no surprise given his fine work in west London. Fulham fans, who have never seen the club finish higher than seventh in the top flight, will be hoping he stays.Saturday marks the beginning of a key period for the club as they hope to enjoy the most successful season of their history. After theirFA Cuptie with Palace, Silva takes his side to the Emirates in midweek before they welcome Liverpool to Craven Cottage next weekend. Between now and the end of the season, Fulham also face Bournemouth, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Brentford and Manchester City. In previous years, that would have had fans fretting, but this Fulham team will approach these games with confidence. This could be a special season for them.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsFulhamGuardian Sport NetworkPremier LeagueFA CupCrystal PalacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 27-year-old, who has scored 15 times in all competitions this season, will wear a protective helmet.“He feels comfortable,” Glasner said of the helmet. “When he scores a header tomorrow then it was the right mask with the right protection. When I’ve watched JP in training he looks the same like before. He needs to get back into his rhythm; he couldn’t train for two weeks. One week he was just at home then he trained for a week individually.“He’s been lucky that nothing was fractured, no concussion. It was just the ear. I know it was a terrible injury. Some players say that the ear looks better than before now.”Asked whether he was worried Mateta might be affected mentally by the injury and be reluctant to go into challenges with his head, Palace’s manager said: “He did it the whole last two weeks. The doctor and the team did a great job finding the right protection. We tried two or three different ones – everything is approved by the Premier League.

It is their highest position in a world championship segment and puts them in a podium place heading into Saturday’s free dance – just 0.82 points ahead of fourth-placed Charlène Guignard and Marco Fabbri of Italy.Infantino’s $1bn prize: act of commercial disruption disguised as benevolence | Barney RonayRead moreNo British ice dance team have reached the podium at a world championships or an Olympics since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean won bronze on their comeback at the 1994 Winter Games. After fourth-place finishes at the last two worlds, Fear and Gibson are now closer than ever to ending that three-decade hoodoo.“I think today we had the most blast all season,” Fear said. “It was fantastic. It’s the way we want it. Of course, there are nerves. If there weren’t nerves, something probably would be wrong. But we had the most fun out there.”The standard at the top was formidable as expected. Chock and Bates posted the world’s highest rhythm dance score in two years – 90.18 points – with a smooth and technically secure routine set to a high-energy disco and retro rock medley blending Jive Bunny throwbacks with the Bee Gees, the Jacksons and Donna Summer. Having won the last two titles after years of near misses, the Americans are looking to become the first team in 28 years to win three consecutive world titles, and the first Americans ever to do so.Gilles and Poirier, silver medallists in Montreal last year, scored 86.44 to stay within striking distance. The Canadians beat Chock and Bates by half a point at February’s Four Continents Championships and are in position to challenge again.Guignard and Fabbri, the reigning European champions, are making their 13th world championship appearance and remain contenders for the podium after taking bronze and silver in the past two seasons.View image in fullscreenAmericans Madison Chock and Evan Bates are aiming to become the first duo to win three world titles in a row for 28 years.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersFear and Gibson’s display follows a strong season that included Grand Prix wins in France and Finland and a bronze medal at the Grand Prix final, Britain’s first ever in the discipline. Their rhythm dance was one of the most charismatic of the afternoon, combining speed, musicality and a signature dose of theatrical flair that brought the crowd to its feet at the finish. On Saturday, they will perform their free dance to a Beyoncé medley, a bold and popular program that has earned ovations across the season.“Maybe it seems from the outside that we had such a brilliant season, winning medals here and there,” Gibson said. “But actually, it was a quite challenging season for us. We had to do a lot of changes in the programs. There was my [practice accident] in Finland. So it wasn’t all easy, but these challenges made us grow and made us stronger.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Guardian has learned that the Indian buyers of the Manchester Originals and Northern Superchargers have also queried elements of the contract, and as a result the ECB has agreed to an extended deadline. None of the eight new owners is planning to sign until all of them are ready to do so.Multiple sources at the ECB, the existing Hundred franchises and representatives of the new investors expressed confidence that agreement will be reached eventually, but there remain problems to resolve. The biggest stumbling block revolves around who will control the Hundred’s next TV deal, with many of the new investors wanting to take over the sale of TV rights and to retain the revenue, rather than the ECB.The Hundred is now part of the ECB’s exclusive domestic rights deal with Sky Sports, which includes all of England’s men’s and women’s home matches, and the governing body wants to retain the right to sell a bundled deal for the 2028 to 2032 cycle. Several of the new owners have queried why the Hundred cannot be sold separately to the highest bidder, however, which is how cricket rights deals work in India.Oval Invincibles’ new partner Reliance, which is owned by India’s richest family, the Ambanis, has a particular interest in media rights through its joint venture with Disney and ownership of telecoms firm Jio, which streams IPL matches free of charge to its subscribers in India. Increasing the value of the Hundred’s overseas TV deal will be crucial in enabling the new owners to recoup some of their planned £520m investment, and given their expertise in the area, Reliance and Cricket Investor Holdings in particular are determined to gain control.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The RFL chief executive, Tony Sutton, is aware of the complaints and is taking them seriously.Sutton has also told RFL staff that anyone else with concerns should feel safe to raise them with him in person, or via the whistleblowing hotline. The RFL has yet to open a formal investigation, but a source at the governing body told the Guardian it is likely to do so in line with whistleblowing policy.An RFL spokesperson told the Guardian: “Details of our internal complaints procedures are confidential.”The complaints follow the circulation of a letter signed by “The Women of the RFL and RL Commercial”, published by the website rugbyleague.com. The anonymous authors described a “pattern of misogyny, bullying, and dismissive behaviour toward women” by men working in the sport.“Over time we have gathered extensive evidence of inappropriate behaviour, including misogynistic comments and demeaning actions by a small group of men within the wider sport – behaviour that has no place in our future,” the letter stated.“Additionally, we have observed representatives of the sport publicly berating and belittling women, perpetuating a culture of disrespect and inequality.”In response to the letter an RFL spokesperson said: “We have whistleblowing procedures and confidentiality is part of that process.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His return to the RFL board was pushed by several Super League clubs led by Leigh and Leeds, disillusioned with the existing RFL leadership over a number of issues, particularly the declining value of the TV contract with Sky Sports and their handling of thefinancial crisis at Salford Red Devils.Before this month’s board changes the RFL wrote to the clubs warning that Wood’s proposed return could have “catastrophic financial consequences” as it would lead to “multiple breaches” of Sport England’s governance code, due to a perceived lack of independence as a result of his position at Bradford.A new interim board was therefore appointed by the RFL last week to ensure compliance with the code, with Wood, Sutton and the finance director, Rob Graham, becoming executive directors alongside five independent non-executive directors. The new board will meet for the first time on 1 April.The Guardian has learned, however, that rugby league’s Australian powerbrokers are distinctly unimpressed with the RFL’s board changes.This is a pivotal moment for the sport given the NRL is seriously considering buying a stake in Super League after thesuccessful Las Vegas roadshowthis month involving four NRL clubs, plus Wigan and Warrington. Significantly, the latter clubs abstained from a Super League vote to appoint Wood to lead the strategic review.“Super League are trying to attract investment, but they now seem more interested in fighting among themselves,” an NRL source said. “This will not help. We have built strong relationships with the RFL and Super League recently, and that has now been jeopardised at the worst possible time.”There is also an international dimension the English game’s civil war. As RFL chair Johnson had a seat on the IRL board, which runs the international game, but sources at the IRL have indicated he may not be replaced.Explore more on these topicsRFLRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

The format mirrors England’s domestic Disability Premier League in bringing together the existing Physical Disability (PD), Learning Disability (LD) and Deaf teams to play as one group.Sonny Baker: ‘I want to be the guy where people are coming out of the bar to watch you bowl’Read moreBut players are concerned the move will reduce opportunities for disabled cricketers at the elite level, and will favour the most able among them. Two deaf players have already withdrawn themselves from selection, after the change was announced to all players in December with, they say, no consultation.Liam Thomas, who was wicketkeeper for the England PD team until his retirement in January, said he was concerned about the changes. Although he added that there was excitement among some players about the chance to play an international match at Lord’s this summer as part of the pan-disability series as well as a double-header with the England Women’s team which will be screened live on Sky Sports.“It is a great opportunity. And in theory, it works,” Thomas said. “TheECBwill have one cost, one tour fee, one set of expenses, one set of coaching staff – it ticks all the right boxes. But when you start breaking it down and finding out people’s concerns, you get down to the nitty-gritty.“How are they going to communicate? How is each impairment going to be impacted? If you’ve only got five PD spots in the England team, how can you grow physical disability cricket and grow our pool of players? It’s limiting opportunities.”Communication between deaf and hearing players is a big issue. While the ECB is introducing sign language training during squad weekends, one England Deaf cricketer claimed this would have little impact. “It reduces BSL [British Sign Language], a rich language, into a tick-box exercise. You wouldn’t say, ‘a French player has joined us but it’s OK because we’ve all learned how to saybonjour’,” he said.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Liam Thomas batting during a Vitality IT20 Physical Disability Tri-Series match.Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty Images“Deaf cricket enables us all to play our best cricket, because it removes all of the deafness out of it. Pan-disability cricket highlights it, makes it a difference.“We’ve hammered home so many different accessibility problems with the DPL, and the ECB haven’t done anything about it.”The player in question has opted out of the India series.While there are rules in place to prevent teams in the DPL from being selected entirely from one disability group, one figure close to the national setup told the Guardian that there were concerns among the coaching staff that players from the deaf and learning disability groups would be sidelined in the India series.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Deaf cricket is thriving internationally, and it’s the ECB that is falling behind once again.”An ECB spokesperson said: “We’re saddened to hear of this player’s experiences in the Disability Premier League. We spoke to the player in question after last summer to try and understand how better the disability programme could ensure deaf players felt included in mixed disability cricket groups, and this summer we’ve introduced 17 hours of inclusion training across all impairment groups, mandatory for all players.“Bringing together cricketers from different impairment groups is hugely exciting, but it is not without challenges and we are always seeking to ensure that every individual within the set-up feels included, supported and able to thrive. This summer we are trialling mixed disability international cricket because we believe it creates a product that will bring more players and more fans into disability cricket.”Explore more on these topicsECBCricketDisability and sportSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now 28, the native Vermonter shone at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut then became a mainstay of the US women’s sevens team thatwon spectacular bronzeat the Olympic Games in Paris last year.As one of the most-followed athletes in all world sports, post-Paris successes included a Sports Illustrated photoshoot, an endorsement (of Kamala Harris) in the US election, and a second-placed finish on Dancing with the Stars, ABC’s hit reality show.Juggling such commitments with an ambition to play in the 15-a-side World Cupin England in August, Maher signed a short-term deal with Bristol that ended withdefeatby Gloucester-Hartpury in the PWR semi-final. Such has been Maher’s impact, the Daily Telegraph last weekdubbedher “Rugby’s biggest star since Jonah Lomu”, the giant New Zealand wing who vied with Nelson Mandela to be the face of the 1995 World Cup in South Africa anddied in 2015.“At times I feel like I’m being wrung dry, because rugby is trying to get as much out of me as possible,” Maher told the Telegraph, while accepting “personalised boots encrusted with rhinestones” at Adidas headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany. “I love it, but … sometimes I get tired. I’m like, ‘Man, we got to have more faces of rugby.’“… People have been calling me the ‘superstar of rugby’. I love that, I think that’s awesome, but we need to have more superstars coming up because we want people to come to the games. To be the face of a sport that is a historically male sport is also really cool, and helping it to grow in the women’s sphere.”Back on US soil, Maher has launched a podcast, presented with her sisters Olivia and Adrianna and calledHouse of Maher. This week’s episode featured discussions of how Ilona lost her virginity, her thoughts on body positivity and the challenges of pursuing a World Cup place while meeting the demands of celebrity.“It’s a weird battle I have to deal with,” Maher said. “It’s either play rugby or do things outside that would make me so much more money … if I could I would just play rugby … you have to do it for passion. It is hard. I’m putting my body on the line for something that is giving me a lot, but at times I feel like I’m giving it much more. I’m going out there everyday with the possibility of getting an injury … and I’m like, ‘Gosh why am I doing this to myself?’”Most women’s players play semi-professionally at best, in the US in WER, which played itsfirst gameslast weekend.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tickets for the games on US soilgo on sale on Friday. Another home game follows later in the summer, against Fiji in Washington DC on 19 July, as part of adouble-headerwith the US men versus England.Fukofuka said the Eagles would look to “compete for results and learn to take opportunities in key moments. This will provide a strong platform for the Rugby World Cup by allowing us to implement our game model, develop combinations and create an environment where we have the ability to change the game, on and off the field.”Explore more on these topicsIlona MaherWomen's rugby unionUSA women's rugby union teamRugby unionUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He has been linked to the opening at Villanova.Florida (33-4) advances to play Saturday against the winner of Thursday’s late game at Chase Center between third-seeded Texas Tech.The Gators, in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2017 and seeking the program’s first Final Four berth since 2014, committed 13 of their 17 turnovers in the first half but took better care of the ball over the final 20 minutes. Florida already eliminated two-time defending NCAA champions UConn in the second round and are 10-1 in regional semifinals.Alabama 113, BYU 88Alabama broke the 35-year-old March Madness record for three-pointers with 25 and Mark Sears scored 30 of his 34 points on 3s, a relentless long-range spree that ushered the second-seeded Crimson Tide past BYU 113-88 on Thursday night in an NCAA Tournament East Region semifinal.Alabama reached the Elite Eight in consecutive years for the first time in program history.The Crimson Tide made 25 of 51 three-point attempts to break the record of 21 set by Loyola Marymount in 1990. Sears, a first-team All-America guard, hit the record-breaking 22nd 3 late in the game to make it 97-66. He received a standing ovation from the Alabama fans when he checked out with 10 3s and more than four minutes left to play.Sears and the Crimson Tide (28-8) showed they are no March fluke under coach Nate Oats. Riding a wave of threes, Alabama set itself up for a date against either Duke for a shot at the Final Four.Richie Saunders scored 25 points to lead BYU (26-10), who haven’t played in a regional final since 1981.Duke 100, Arizona 93Duke stud Cooper Flagg put on a skills clinic and overcame an onslaught from Arizona and Caleb Love, finishing with 30 points, six rebounds, seven assists and three blocks Thursday night in an NCAA Tournament victory that pulled the Blue Devils within one win of the Final Four.​Flagg, long over the balky ankle that sidelined him earlier this month, did enough to prevent Love, a thorn in Duke’s side for five years, from ruining another Blue Devils season.Love finished with 35 points, one short of his career high, including a streak of 12 straight for his Wildcats (24-13) during a ferocious second-half run that cut a 19-point deficit to as little as five with 1:56 left.Explore more on these topicsNCAA Tournament 2025NCAA TournamentCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsBasketballShareReuse this content"

Organizers have dubbed it Tesla Takedown’s Global Day of Action, the latest and largest in a series of demonstrations that began shortly after Donald Trump was inaugurated. Organizers say the rallies will take place in front of more than 200 Tesla locations worldwide, including nearly 50 in California alone.The protesters’ goal is to send a message to the Trump administration that they’re against what the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, is doing with the US federal government – laying off thousands of workers, cutting department budgets,giving fascist salutesand getting rid of entire agencies.“Nobody voted for this, and nobody voted for Elon,” said Vickie Mueller Olvera, who has been organizing Tesla Takedown protests in the Bay Area. “He’s an unelected super-billionaire and he’s a thug.”Tesla Takedown describes itself as a decentralized grassroots movement that will “protest Tesla for as long as Elon Musk continues to shred public services”.The group sayson its organizing pagethat Musk is “destroying our democracy using the fortune he built at Tesla” and so, in turn, they are “taking action at Tesla”. Local organizers are planning their own demonstrations rather than coordinating with one national group.Doge cuts allow Musk to cash in with SpaceX and Starlink contracts, ex-workers warnRead moreGoing after Musk’s bottom lineOlvera said that demonstrators were asking people to do three things: don’t buy a Tesla, sell off Tesla stock and join the Tesla Takedown protest movement.Musk did not respond to a request for comment. On X, the social media platform he owns, he hassaidthat the work he is doing for the federal government heading the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) is “literally improving government efficiency, like the name says”.As Musk has made his mark on the federal government and Tesla Takedown protests have grown, his car company’s financial performance has suffered. Since Trump’s inauguration, Tesla’s stock has plummeted more than 35%,sales have nosedivedand theresale value for used Teslasappears to have hit an all-time low. Musk’s own net worthhas fallen by 25%since then, about $100bn. Some Tesla owners have saidthey sold their carsafter Musk gave a speech on inauguration day that included two Nazi-style salutes.Earlier this month, Trump and Muskshowcased Tesla vehicleson the driveway of the White House. The president touted the electric cars, staging a photo op inside a red Tesla sedan where he exclaimed, “Wow … everything’s computer,” and declared he would buy one. The two also condemned the anti-Tesla protests, and Trump said he would designate any violence against showrooms as domestic terrorism.Jonathan V Last, the editor for the Bulwark, a politically conservative and anti-Trump website, has credited much of Tesla’s decline to the takedown protests.“I would go so far as to say the Tesla takedown protests have been one of the most consequential protest movements in the shortest amount of time ever,” Last said during a Bulwark podcast that aired this week. “They helped to obliterate one-third of Elon Musk’s net worth, in like 100 days. And when you attack his money stack, you attack his power.”The protest movement growsTesla Takedown protests started popping up in towns and cities across the US in mid-February. On social media, people posted photos of small gatherings in front of Tesla showrooms with demonstrators holding signs that depicted Musk as a Nazi and said things like “Diabolical Oligarchs Gaslighting Everyone” and “No Swastikars”, a new nickname for Teslas.Olvera said that’s around the time she heard about a protest happening near her in the Bay Area, so she checked it out. She stood around with the other demonstrators in front of a showroom, holding her anti-Musk sign and joking around, and then something unexpected happened.“People would drive by, you know, just passersby,” Olvera said. “And some of them just stopped and joined in.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Olvera, who now organizes demonstrations, said that Tesla owners started joining the protests as they gained momentum and put bumper stickers on their cars saying “I bought this before Elon went crazy.” At one point, she said, even the owner of a Cybertruck – the massive boxy metallic trucks that have become synonymous with Musk – joined the protest.“I see Elon Musk as hijacking our government, and he’s just dismantling everything that we hold dear,” Olvera said. “Everything that people have fought long and hard for, like social security, Medicare and Medicaid and our beautiful national parks … it just feels like the rug is getting pulled out from under us.”Anti-Tesla sentiment– and protests– go globalThe same pattern has taken shape across the US. Cities like New York and Chicago now seeseveral hundred people joiningin the weekly Tesla Takedown protests. On social media, the Bluesky account for Tesla Takedown has gained nearly 25,000 followers in just a matter of weeks. And one of the group’s top promoters, Alex Winter, an activist and the actor who played Bill in Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure, has amassed nearly 200,000 followers on Bluesky with his daily posts of anti-Musk protests.Tesla Takedown organizers have been careful to distance themselves from the violent vandalism that has also been carried out against Tesla showrooms. Dozens of Tesla facilities have beenattacked in the middle of the nightwith molotov cocktails, gunshots or graffiti saying things like “Fuck Elon” and “Tesla is Fascist.”On Monday,the FBI launched a taskforceto go after the alleged vandals, calling them “domestic terrorists”, which Trump, Musk and the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, have also called them. The FBI director, Kash Patel,posted on X: “This is domestic terrorism. Those responsible will be pursued, caught, and brought to justice.” On Wednesday, police arrested a suspect in a high-profileattack against a Tesla showroom in Las Vegasthat involved molotov cocktails. The suspect was charged with 15 counts.Tesla Takedown organizers also condemn the vandalism. “We are a non-violent grassroots protest movement,” the group says. “We oppose violence and destruction of property. Peaceful protest on public property is not domestic terrorism.”For Saturday, Tesla Takedown organizers say they expect to see the biggest turnout yet, with 213 planned protests from Waterville, Maine, to Honolulu, Hawaii – that includes 32 international locations in countries such as Australia, Finland and Germany.“LFG!” the groupposted to Bluesky. “Let’s send these techno-fascists, broligarchs and old fashioned Nazis a message loud and clear.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyElon MuskTeslanewsShareReuse this content"

After months of extensive news coverage and efforts to woo over local leaders, California Forever changed track:withdrawing a ballot measurethat would have fast-tracked the plans and instead seeking approval through standard county processes.This month California Forever found itself back in the spotlight for a new proposal, and one that has been greeted far more warmly – using the land it owns for the creation of a shipbuilding hub. TheTrump administrationhas reportedly drafted anexecutive orderto revitalize the shipbuilding industry in the US.The company, which now owns more than 65,000 acres in Solano county, said in a statement that Solano “is uniquely positioned to answer the call for rebuilding our nation’s naval power” and that it could “drive economic revitalization” across the region.“We are very early in the process, and are working with elected officials and local communities to explore how we can best use these assets to support American Sailors and stimulate economic growth in our cities, county, and broader region,” the company said in a statement.View image in fullscreenAn artist rendering provided by California Forever shows a Main Street of a proposed new city in Solano county, California.Photograph: APSolano county, located about 60 miles (97km) fromSan Francisco, is home to nearly 450,000 people and has a history of shipbuilding. It was the site of the first US navy base on the Pacific Ocean, which operated for more than 140 years. Today the largest employer in the region is the Travis air force base – the country’s busiest – which has more than 10,000 personnel.California Forever began buying up land in the county in secret, years before going public with their plans for anew city. They promoted the effort as a solution to California’s housing crisis and said the new city – with itsutopian visionof green infrastructure and walkable neighborhoods – would bring extensive new job opportunities to the region and pledged that the project would not impose any financial obligations or taxes on residents outside the community. But they quickly encountered intense pushback.A local chapter of the Sierra Club described the company’s efforts as a “hostile takeover”. Last year, they withdrew the measure from the ballot and agreed to an environmental report and development agreement on the project.Meanwhile, last year as Joe Biden expressed interest in bringing shipbuilding back to the US, the company was in touch with local officials expressing interest in pursuing such an opportunity on the west coast.Thenlast weekEdwin Okamura, the mayor of the Solano county town of Rio Vista, announced that he had met with California Forever representatives, retired military leaders and other officials in the county to discuss the matter, as well as a proposed site near the small riverside settlement of Collinsville.John Carli, the mayor of Vacaville, said that he also visited the area and met with retired military officials who said the site was one of the most ideal locations in the US and described a shipbuilding operation there as a “one-of-a-kind opportunity”. That site,CaliforniaForever said in its statement, has more than 1,400 acres of land that was proactively zoned for “maritime industrial uses”. It would be used a manufacturing and assembling location rather than a port, Carli said.The effort is still in its early stages, officials have said, pending the executive order.But so far, officials in the region have expressed enthusiasm about efforts to expand the maritime industry. Alma Hernandez, the mayor of Suisun City about 30 miles north-west of Collinsville, said in a statement that the city backs an expansion.‘This hasn’t been done before’: can tech elites build their own city – and win over the skeptics?Read more“Suisun City stands in support of a regional effort to invite the US government and leading defense contractors to invest in Solano county’s future,” Hernandez said. “Our region has a proud history of shipbuilding – it is part of our identity. We are eager to contribute in every way possible to ensure maritime success in our region.”The benefits would extend far beyond the shipyard, Carli said, pointing to the more than $2.7bn in economic impacts the air force base has in the region. And a maritime industrial base would be a benefit to the air force base, he said.With the history of shipbuilding in the region and the role it plays in US defense, it makes sense to have this kind of project in the region, said state assembly member Lori Wilson, and it would bring significant opportunities. If it were to move ahead, Wilson expects the shipyard could become the largest employer in the county.Wilson said she had heard from many constituents about the project, most of whom were supportive. Some have expressed concern about the environmental impacts of the maritime industry and the role of California Forever, given the level of distrust that exists with the organization. The lawmaker has herself been skeptical of the company.“That’s something as a legislative representative for this area I’m mindful of, but it’s not something I can address. It’s up to them to build trust.”Still, even those who did not support plans for a new city are interested in this project, Wilson said. “Folks are really excited about this opportunity and [the potential] for shipbuilding to come back to Solano county. There is a groundswell of support for this project and I’m really excited to do my part to bring this to fruition.”Carli expects the community will look beyond the landowners. “I’m confident residents will recognize and support this project if the opportunity would present itself here locally,” Carli said. “It merits thoughtful discussion with the community to understand this is different than a proposed city.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaSilicon ValleyUrbanisationWest CoastSan FranciscofeaturesShareReuse this content"

You’re likely to keep a vacuum cleaner for years, relying heavily on its ability to suck up dust, crumbs, mud, pet hair and any other dry spillages or sheddings that end up on your floor. Choosing the right model can be the difference between an effective cleaner that’s a delight to pull out of the cupboard and a dud that you dread having to unblock, detangle and clean after every use.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In this review, I took 10 of the leading cordless vacuum cleaners from a range of manufacturers and at various prices and inflicted the same cleaning tests on each one. That takes all the guesswork out of picking your next cleaner: I can tell you exactly which ones picked up the most mess.At a glanceBest cordless vacuum cleaner overall:Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251£369.91 at John LewisBest budget cordless vacuum cleaner:Vax HomePro Pet-Design£317 at AmazonBestcordless vacuum for deep cleaning:Dyson Gen5detect£649 at John LewisBest cordless vacuum for clean emptying:Henry Quick Pro£399 at AmazonBest handheld cordless vacuum cleanerDyson Car+Boat£199 at AOWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing technology and home products for more than 30 years. In the past few years, I’ve been a freelance writer specialising in testing vacuum cleaners. During that time I’ve tested more vacuum cleaners of various shapes, sizes and types than I’d care to count, from handheld helpers to heavy-duty dirt-shifters.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach vacuum was put to the test against flour, cat litter pellets and pet hair.Photograph: Andy ShawMost cordless vacuum cleaners are designed to work on carpet and hard floors, so I tested them all on both. To do this I weighed out spillages of flour, recycled wood cat litter pellets and pet hair. Flour and cat litter are easy enough to come by, but my dog doesn’t shed enough hair to test this many vacuums. So I’m also the proud owner of a box of sweepings from a friendly (but slightly bemused) local dog groomer.I gave each vacuum cleaner a chance to pick up as much of the spillages as possible, with a single push-forward and pull-backwards motion, and weighed the collection bins before and after.Most vacuums will collect more if given more chances to go over a mess, particularly from a different angle, but I wanted relatively tough tests that would truly differentiate one vacuum from another, so I allowed only a single sweep.I also tested the batteries by seeing how long it took them to run down from a full charge – at full suction and in each one’s most economical setting. I performed these tests with the floor head attached, where possible.Lastly, I tested the suction using a pressure gauge. While strong suction is useful, the cleaning tests were more important because other factors play a big part in the overall cleaning prowess. For example, a well-designed floor head can make a moderate sucker as good a cleaner as a more powerful model with an inferior brush or roller.All the machines I tested are being sent back to their manufacturers or donated to the British Heart Foundation.The best cordless vacuums in 2025View image in fullscreenThe lineup of test subjects.Photograph: Andy ShawBest overall cordless vacuum cleaner:Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw£369.91 at John Lewis£549.99 at CurrysIf there’s one thing that makes cordless vacuum cleaners a pain, it’s the emptying: taking it to the bin and jettisoning the debris after vacuuming. And, if your family is anything like mine, you may have to do it before you clean too because someone else didn’t bother to empty it. That won’t be the case with this Shark vacuum, though: it empties itself. It’s also very good at cleaning.Why we love itThe Shark IP3251 comes with a base station that operates as a stand and charging dock. When you rest the cordless vacuum cleaner on it, it springs into life, opening the base of the vacuum’s collection bin and sucking its contents into a larger container, leaving the cordless stick empty and ready for next time. The secondary bin has a volume of two litres, so can take a few empties of the 0.7-litre stick.That would all be pointless if the device itself wasn’t up to snuff, but it’s an excellent cleaner. Its floor head has a fluffy roller for hard floors and a brush bar for carpet, and it works well on both surfaces, performing a literal clean sweep in my tests.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty got to work on the flour, pet hair and cat litter.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …I found it worked better if I held it lower while vacuuming on some carpets, with fins on the base otherwise catching when I pulled it back. That may make it better for shorter than taller people.Weight:3.71kgMax suction power (measured):28kPaBattery life (measured):43minsDust capacity:0.7lAdditional filters supplied?noBest budget cordless vacuum cleaner:Vax HomePro Pet-DesignView image in fullscreen£320 at Argos£317 at AmazonThe Vax HomePro Pet-Design is good value for money, sitting at the lower end of the price spectrum but still coming with a good selection of tools for handheld use. It also performed well in all the tests.Why we love itIt’s comfortable to hold and use, and simple to operate, with just two large buttons – one to switch it on and the other to boost the power. Battery life is displayed by a light-up ring and lasted a decent 34 minutes in our rundown test.Emptying it is straightforward, too, with a button to open the collection bin, while a pump action lifts dirt off the filter, so you don’t have to poke your hands in. It’s one of the few cordless stick vacuums that can support itself when standing up, so there’s no need to find somewhere to lie it down between cleaning jobs.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Vax HomePro Pet-Design took to the floor to suck up the flour, cat litter and pet hair.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …the floor head is a basic single-brush bar, which is unsophisticated when compared with the alternatives you get on Shark and Dyson models. Still, for the price, it’s ultimately forgivable.Weight:3.5kgMax suction power (measured):19kPaBattery life (measured):34minsDust capacity:0.7lAdditional filters supplied?noBestcordless vacuum for deep cleaning:Dyson Gen5detectView image in fullscreen£649 at John Lewis£649.99 at DysonLet’s not beat about the bush: this top-of-the-range Dyson is the most expensive vacuum cleaner here. It’s also the best, making short work of all my tests. If it’s any recommendation, it’s the vacuum cleaner I used to clean up any residual mess when I’d finished testing the other models.Why we love itAs with Shark, Dyson provides a soft roller for hard floors and a brush bar for carpets. However, it does this with two separate detachable floor heads, rather than rolling both into one. That means you have to switch heads each time you change surface, but it also means that they’re adept at their assigned roles.The hard-floor head has a green light that illuminates the dust on the floor as you clean. Not only can you see where you need to clean but also you can witness what a super job the roller does of vacuuming everything up. The carpet-floor head has an anti-tangle mechanism that combs it free of long hair as it rotates.A dusting brush and crevice tool are inside the extension wand, so you don’t have to seek them out when converting to handheld mode. It also comes with a mini motorised tool that’s perfect for lifting pet hair from upholstery or just cleaning the stairs.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Dyson Gen5detect tackled the flour, cat litter and pet hair.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …its screen is useful to indicate battery life but it also insists on counting how many particles of various sizes it’s collected – a feature no one asked for.Weight:3.5kgMax suction power (measured):31kPaBattery life (measured):56minsDust capacity:0.77lAdditional filters supplied?noBest cordless vacuum for clean emptying:Henry Quick ProView image in fullscreen£399 at Currys£399 at AmazonMost cordless sticks create a dust cloud when you deposit the contents of their collection bins into your dustbin. The Henry Quick Pro is the only cordless vacuum we’ve reviewed here that doesn’t do that because of its disposable dirt-capturing bags.Why we love itWe can’t emphasise this enough – it’s frustrating to vacuum the floor only to have the dust billowing out of your bin and back into the air when you empty it. With the Henry Quick Pro, you push a lever on the top and the base opens, jettisoning the bag of collected rubbish out of the bottom. It leaves no mess and has the added benefit of no filters to clean.In my tests, the Quick Pro performed decently enough, other than on hard floors with the cat litter, which it pushed ahead instead of sucking up. That job would be better tackled by removing the extension wand and using the device with a handheld attachment. It comes with a comprehensive selection of accessories, including a motorised mini head for stairs and upholstery, a flexible hose and a useful handle extension for taller users.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Henry Quick Pro tackled the flour and pet hair but left some of the cat litter behind.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …the bags have a plastic top that holds them in place inside the collection bin. Henry manufacturer Numatic claims to offset the carbon cost, but it would be better environmentally if it didn’t use any plastic at all. They also cost £1.30 per 1-litre bag.Weight:3.2kgMax suction power (measured):10.75kPaBattery life (measured):1hr 11minsDust capacity:1lAdditionalbags supplied?yes, six pods (bags)Best handheld cordless vacuum cleaner:Dyson Car+BoatView image in fullscreen£199 at AO£249.99 at John LewisDyson doesn’t manufacture a vacuum purely for handheld use, instead opting to repackage an existing cordless stick without the extension wand. The result is a handheld device so powerful that you may wish you could also use it on the floor.Why we love itThe Dyson Car+Boat is a cunning repackage of theDyson V8. That model is now the bottom of the range of Dyson’s regular cordless stick cleaners, but it makes for a handheld unit that performs above and beyond expectations.It comes with three key attachments: a mini motorised tool for upholstery and stairs; a crevice tool for gaps; and a combination dusting brush and funnel. It’s a powerful combo that cleaned up my test messes with aplomb. I had to use the funnel rather than the motorised tool to collect cat litter, though, because there’s no way this smaller device wouldn’t just push them ahead.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Dyson Car+Boat devoured the detritus on the mat.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …you can stillbuy the V8, with the extension tube and attachments, for a similar price. It also comes with Dyson’s old mini-motorised tool. Newer models come with a better-designed tool, which has a tapering roller that doesn’t trap longer hairs. It would have been a nice addition to this repackage.Weight:1.9kgMax suction power (measured):21kPaBattery life (measured):38minsDust capacity:0.54lAdditional filters supplied?noskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The collection bin is in the base – you lift it out by its classy leather strap and can tip the debris straight into the bin.I particularly liked that it has edge sweepers on its front corners – a concept borrowed from robot vacuums. These flick debris out from the very edges of skirtings and kickboards into the path of the suction. It’s an area in which few other vacuums are particularly effective.View image in fullscreenThe Gtech AirRam 3 goes to battle, and almost wins, with pet hair, cat litter and flour.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …although it was brilliant with cat litter, it didn’t fare well with my pet-hair or flour tests, leaving behind dirt when I lifted the collection bin from the floor head.Weight:3.8kg;max suction power (measured):not measured;battery life (measured):25mins;dust capacity:0.8l;additional filters supplied?noGtech AirFox PlatinumView image in fullscreen£199.99 at Lakeland£189.05 at AmazonBest for:light weight and light useA constant source of annoyance with cordless vacuum cleaners is that you have to find somewhere to lean them when you want to put them down. The AirFox is light and well-balanced enough to stand on its own, so you can leave it in the middle of the room while you do some dusting, and it won’t fall to the floor.The trigger needs to be held down to keep the vacuum running and while there is a trigger lock to keep it in place, it’s fiddly to use. It cleaned well in my tests, though, only really struggling with the cat litter, which seemed to get stuck in the floor head.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Gtech AirFox Platinum took to the mat.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …I found it uncomfortable to hold for extended periods because the back extends out over the handle, getting in the way of my wrist.Weight:2.9kg;max suction power (measured):31kPa;battery life (measured):1hr 10mins;dust capacity:0.4l;additional filters supplied?noMiele Duoflex HX1 Total CareView image in fullscreen£499 at John Lewis£499 at MieleBest for:simple operationDespite being a high-end brand in most categories of domestic appliances, the Miele Duoflex HX1 sits in the middle of this gathering in terms of price. That’s largely thanks to the lack of additional features you get when compared with the likes of Shark and Dyson. It performed well in my cleaning tests but generally proved better on carpets than on hard floors.It operates in either floor or handheld mode. The floor head is basic, with a simple brush bar and no anti-tangle features. It comes with three handheld attachments – a crevice tool, a basic upholstery nozzle and a dusting brush.View image in fullscreenHow it started v how it’s going with the Miele Duoflex HX1 Total Care.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …emptying relies on gravity alone, so you end up having to poke your fingers into the collection bin to clear it out. Most disappointing was the battery, which didn’t last long with the floor head attached, even on the weakest suction setting.Weight:3.1kg;max suction power (measured):12.5kPa;battery life (measured):13mins;dust capacity:0.3l;additional filters supplied?noBosch Unlimited 10 BCS1051GBView image in fullscreen£499 at AO£499 from John LewisBest for:super-long battery lifeWith the Unlimited 10, Bosch has gone all in on the bling. It has a very flashy screen, which informs you visually when you’re changing floor surfaces, and lights up in a different colour depending on what power setting you’ve got the suction on. It’s useful, but possibly not useful enough to justify its higher-than-average cost.The overall build quality is excellent, though. I loved the spring-loaded filter clearing lever on the back, which means you can empty the collection bin in a smooth single-push motion rather than the banging and poking you have to do with most other vacuums. This lever can also compact the rubbish as you clean to reduce how often it needs emptying. The Unlimited 10 also had the best battery, which made the unit heavy but lasted an astonishing hour and a half in its Eco setting.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) with the hair, litter and flour and how the Bosch Unlimited 10 vacuumed them up on the right.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …it’s a bit expensive without there being enough of a cleaning benefit to justify it.Weight:3.8kg;max suction power (measured):13kPa;battery life (measured):1hr 34mins;dust capacity:0.4l;additional filters supplied?noBeldray Airgility Pet Plus+View image in fullscreen£92.99 at Currys£92.99 at AmazonBest for:lowest priceIf most of the other reviews left you thinking that you were going to have to take out a second mortgage to get a new cordless vacuum cleaner, the sub-£100 price tag of the Beldray Airgility Pet Plus+ should be a breath of fresh air. It’s light and petite but has small attachments, too, which aren’t large enough to pick up larger particles. It doesn’t collect dirt as well as the best vacuum cleaners here, but for a fraction of the price it does a reasonable job.The biggest problem was cat litter, which was sucking OK from the floor but caused a blockage after only a tiny amount had entered the collection bin. It was surprisingly proficient at flour on hard floors but failed to agitate my test carpet enough to replicate that success. It also left a bit of pet hair behind during testing, either on the floor or stuck to the rollers.View image in fullscreenBefore the Beldray Airgility Pet Plus+ got to work (left) and how well it picked up the mess (right).Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t perform as well as more expensive rivals, though it does still impress for the price.Weight:2.2kg;max suction power (measured):9.25kPa;battery life (measured):41mins;dust capacity:1.2l;additional filters supplied?yes, oneWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenThe Dyson Car+Boat makes short work of mess.Photograph: Andy ShawWhy choose a cordless vacuum cleanerCordless vacuum cleaners are vastly more convenient than corded models. There’s no cable to unwind and no need to find a power socket – you just take the vacuum to the mess and get started.The downside is that they run on battery power. The batteries can last anywhere between an hour or so on light settings and down to a few minutes on full blast. They should last long enough to get around an average-size housein one go, but larger spaces might need a mid-clean charge, which can take a few hours (or an expensive extra battery).What should you look for in a cordless vacuum cleaner?All cordless vacuum cleaners will have a good go at your carpeted areas, but they work on hard floors, too. The best hard-floor models tend to come with a fluffy roller, which will be better at picking up dust from smooth surfaces, as well as a standard brush bar.One particularly good thing about cordless vacuums is that they tend to break down into handheld devices if you remove the extension wand. Check it comes with the attachments you require. If you have stairs you may like to look for a mini motorised tool, which is a bit like a miniature version of a regular floor head, ideal for vacuuming smaller areas, such as stairs and upholstery.Do cordless vacuums have good filtration systems?Yes, cordless vacuums quote high levels of filtration, with some claiming to trap even the tiniest of particles, such as pollen. However, emptying cordless vacuums that don’t use bags can create a messy dust cloud, so these may not be the models for you if you’re allergic to dirty particles. Filters also need regular cleaning, which is something you won’t be used to if you’re moving away from a vacuuming system that uses disposable bags.Andy Shaw is a freelance consumer journalist and technology addict.

I am weak-willed, however, and click through to thestory in the Timesto test the principle of “my enemy’s enemy is my friend”. Musk is a real villain and Clarkson is just a motormouth, but I suspect the latter – for reasons of basic functionality and the sort of flippant humour with which Musk seems ill-equipped to cope – is capable of getting the better of the world’s richest man, should these latest remarks of Clarkson’s come to his attention.Certainly, Clarkson has upset Musk before, exciting a libel action out of him in 2011 for comments Clarkson made about Tesla on Top Gear. A judge ruled against Musk then, a fact Clarkson is only too happy to remind him about now. In his Sunday Times column, Clarkson referred to the “pan-global decision to uncrowdfund Tesla”, and took a victory lap around news of Teslas being set on fire and vandalised the world over. “I’d love to remind all you Tesla drivers that I warned you 17 years ago that no good would come of your buying choice,” he wrote in his customary low-key style. “But you didn’t listen.”Musk, as we know, is apoplectic about the hatred being directed towards Tesla right now, as is Donald Trump. Defending his buddy last week, the US president threatened, nonsensically, to send any “sick terrorist thugs” caught vandalising Teslas to “the prisons of El Salvador”. Clarkson, meanwhile, strove to point out that Musk, once popular on the left for promoting green vehicles, is now targeted by exactly the kind of people Clarkson hates, forcing him to a conclusion I fully support: that my enemy’s enemy is still kind of a jerk. There’s quite enough dislike to go round.View image in fullscreen‘Can we somehow sell the spring statement as “cheeky”?’Photograph: Malcolm Park/Alamy Live NewsTuesdayIt’s a hard video to watch: two RAF engineers caught on CCTV kicking poor old Paddington while he sits blamelessly on a bench in Berkshire. The violence escalates to such a degree that by the end of the assault, there’s nothing of the bear statue left but a hollow, metal shell. I guess at least it speaks to the fitness of the British armed forces.The incident happened at 2am on a drunken night out this month, and on Tuesday the pair wereordered by a judge to pay £2,725 and do community service. It was the judge’s emotional remarks about the target of their vandalism, however, that made one realise not all criminal damage is equal. The two men had, according to Judge Goozee, attacked “a beloved cultural icon”, that represents “kindness, tolerance and promotes integration and acceptance in our society”. On the night in question, he said, they had behaved in a way that was “the antithesis of everything Paddington stands for”.Which rather makes one hope that the next time someone in those parts rips the wing mirror off a Tesla or otherwise puts the boot into “everything it stands for”, they find themselves appearing before this same, symbolism-minded judge.WednesdayThe discourse around the Netflix showAdolescencecontinues to rage and after receiving blanket praise for two weeks, some dissent is starting to show. All the usual caveats first: extraordinary television, brilliant performances, breathtaking vision. Adolescence is smartly and interestingly done, although it remains the case that if every girl who was called an ugly bitch online killed the boy or man who said it, there’d be no men left to make the TV show.The presence of Brad Pitt as an executive producer, meanwhile, rings slight alarm bells. I’m not sure any of us needs the origins of misogyny explained, even tangentially, by a man whose kids havedroppedhis surname and whose ex-wife hasallegedthat he abused her. Pitt does, however, belong to what he has called a “really cool men’s group”, so I’m guessing that his “remarkably hands-on” involvement with the show might have brought to the project valuable insights into the self-victimising process.ThursdayOn the Americans in London social media feeds, people are sharing tips for getting in and out of the US without being cuffed and dragged to a detention centre in Louisiana. “If you plan to go, get a burner phone,” writes one frequent traveller which, blimey, I mean, I guess. Lots of people have popped up to report flying recently through Newark or Miami without incident, but the anxiety is enough to have changed the experience. Flight bookings between Canada and the US are down 70% and US tourist operators are braced for a worldwide downturn.We’re flying to the US in May and, even as citizens, I’m nervous. Six years ago, while still on a green card, I got the “step this way” nod at JFK and was escorted to the exceedingly grim Congratulations, You Have Problems With Your Paperwork side room, where a woman relieved me of my phone and shouted at me and everyone else in the room to sit down and be quiet. For travellers to the US it seems a sensible precaution to have a lawyer’s number at the ready.View image in fullscreen‘Tell me again how you’d rather have a president than this comfy old scene.’Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty ImagesFridayI haven’t had to sleep with the hall light on since the Blair Witch Project came out in 1999 – oh man, that was a bad one because my flatmate was away that weekend and after seeing the film, I felt the dank presence of something watching me from the corner of my room. This week a babysitter in Kansas tried to vanquish a child’s fear of monsters under the bed by showing them there was nothing there. Unfortunately, in this case a 27-year old man called Martin Villalobos Jr was hiding under the bed. After a scuffle that knocked over the child, he wasarrested and charged with aggravated batteryand child endangerment. A mere externalisation of what, at the moment, we know to be true: the monsters are real.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDigested weekJeremy ClarksonBrad PittNetflixAdolescencecommentShareReuse this content"

The answer, according to developer Rebellion, is that it would be considerably more picturesque and feature loads of pasties. Aping the nuclear catastrophe fiction of series such asFalloutandStalker, Atomfall offers a mildly diverting scientific whodunit. But it struggles to muster the same clear identity of the games that inspired it.Using the 1957 Windscale fire as its launchpad, Atomfall thrusts you into a postwar Britain where that accident was dramatically worse, prompting the government to send in the army before walling off a large portion of the Lake District, sealing everybody inside. Your character, an archetypal video game amnesiac, awakes inside the exclusion zone several years later. To escape, they must unravel the mystery behind what caused the disaster, who is responsible and how to fix it.This mystery, and how it unfolds, are by far the most interesting parts of Atomfall. The story reframes conventional quests as “leads”, where points of interest are revealed by collecting documents such as letters and military reports, and speaking to the surviving locals in the zone. At the heart of the enigma is a vast underground research facility, which you must reactivate by unlocking its entrances and locating atomic batteries to power its various sectors, ultimately unlocking the heart of Windscale and the dark secret kept inside.View image in fullscreenWicker Man-esque … Atomfall.Photograph: RebellionIt’s a tale that offers plenty of intrigue. The characters that assist you on your journey, including soldiers, scientists and a publican, have their own motivations for doing so, which you’ll only uncover by cross-referencing them with other players in Atomfall’s unspoken game of zones. These will often relate to diversions you’ll find along the way, such as infiltrating a castle occupied by Wicker Man-style druids to retrieve a special medicine and solving a quintessentially British murder in a church.Unpicking these threads is fun, and the tale benefits from a tighter focus and better pacing than most open-world adventures. Unfortunately, the accompanying game mechanics feel as if they turn up more from obligation than enthusiasm. Combat lets you choose between guns that are serviceable but unremarkable, and melee fighting that will make you appreciate every rusty firearm you collect. There is a rudimentary crafting system you’ll mostly use to make bandages and the occasional molotov cocktail. A stealth system exists in theory, but perhaps fittingly I never saw it function in any meaningful fashion. Enemies can spot you from half the map away and seem telepathically connected to nearby allies, which makes sneaking around awkward and unrewarding.It probably doesn’t help that it’s always a bright sunny day in Atomfall’s exclusion zone, which would be unusual for any part of the UK, let alone the Lake District. On the whole, it could make better use of its Cumbrian setting. Although Atomfall’s four maps are lavish and fun to explore, including craggy valleys filled with shells of dry-stone buildings, and the most meticulously recreated English village sinceEverybody’s Gone to the Rapture, the world is not especially atmospheric.Moreover, the enemy factions, druids and crazed marauders clad in cricket gear, feel like vague attempts to anglicise the kooky gangs of Fallout. Where are the feral ramblers, the roving bands of literati fighting over whether Wordsworth or Coleridge was the better poet? Why are pasties so abundant, while Kendal mint cake and Grasmere gingerbread are absent? This may seem flippant, but given we have recently seen such a brilliant lampoon of northern life inThank Goodness You’re Here!, Atomfall’s own depiction of the north, and indeed Britain in general, feels superficial and haphazard, a jumbled assemblage of cultural touchstones.To use another example, one of Atomfall’s key inspirations is Stalker, a series whose strength lies in how it is so specifically, uncompromisingly Ukrainian. Stalker and its sequels are completely unafraid to be weird, bold, challenging and bleak, to wholly envelop the player in its nation’s radioactive trauma. The UK simply doesn’t share that trauma in the same way, so Rebellion’s “what if” scenario can only ever be a shadow of Chornobyl.Atomfall is out now, £45Explore more on these topicsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Don’t see the point. I don’t reread books either, and I rarely rewatch movies or TV shows. There’s too much new, bigger and better stuff coming out every day, and too little time to consume it. However, I made an exception with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Because the original was so special.It came along towards the end of my ZX Spectrum playing days. I was at university and was previously only interested in a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle if it came in a tall glass and was at happy hour prices in the Mandela Bar. But the game hooked me one summer back home and became the hardest video game that I ever completed. And that’s what worried me when I started the rerelease on the PS4 that comes as part of the TMNT Cowabunga Collection. (Playstation Plus Essentials March)It was the first time I’d thrown a controller at a wall since I stopped playing FifaI worried that my gaming brain had got lazy playing modern games, where you are spoiled by power-ups vomiting up all over the place and collision detection so forgiving it could be a priest, and as a result that this golden gaming memory would be tarnished.I was right!The collision detection is atManic Miner/Mega Man levels of unforgiving, but through trial and error I rediscovered things that make the game easier. The level structures are soft so you can kill an enemy from above or below platforms and even through walls, which brings into play the Turtles different weapon ranges. I remember also that you can “hot swap” the Turtles. This means using Donatello with his long pole for … everything, switching to Michelangelo with his nunchucks then Leonardo with his swords when Donatello’s energy gets low and finally using Raphael with his puny twin sai as a last resort. Sai are tiny metal daggers that resemble whatever cutlery it was that Elon Musk balanced on his fingers at Mar-a-Lago. Only more useless. To kill an enemy with Raphael in this game you have to get close enough to smell what toppings they had on their pizza.View image in fullscreenIndecipherable … Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection.Photograph: KonamiI hate-played this for two hours, death after death – it was the first time I’d thrown a controller at a wall since I stopped playing Fifa.Night one ends, as it did for so many of us back in the day, with that bloody underwater level where you have to defuse bombs under a dam within a time limit so unforgiving it reminds me of A-level exams. You cannot get through that level without hitting multiple radioactive weeds. I can’t believe I completed it back in the day, and worry it may have been one of those 90s things I imagined, like that time I said hi to Sarah Michelle Gellar at Comic-Con and was sure she smiled back at me.Horrible clunky gameplay like this serves no purpose in 2025.Or does it?I persevered on day two. I remembered the way to get through that damned dam level is to crash through every enemy and hot swap the turtles when the energy gets low. (And by “remembered” I mean “searched Reddit”.)Most importantly I discovered that there is a flipping rewind button in this rerelease! You can go back 30 seconds every time you fail a pixel perfect jump! I wish I read gaming manuals, but I am a man in his 50s. I no more read instructions than I ask for directions when I am lost.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

April saying: “It’s OK the dam is safe – let’s go home.”Buoyed by this I beat the next couple of levels over the next couple of days. It’s hard, even with the rewind button, but I recalibrate my whole gaming attitude. I can’t charge through levels like you can with games today, for this was the era when you literally had to inch forward, then wait, see what enemies appear, learn their patterns, then move. You have to slow down your whole way of playing. And that isn’t a bad thing. In 2025, life moves at 10bn miles an hour. I wake up three times a night checking who is about to invade who.With my heart and mind reopened I re-notice the greatness of this game. The scroll and boomerang weapons are immense, I would put them up there with the BFG from Doom, the Golden Gun from Goldeneye and the Holy Hand Grenade in Worms in terms of sheer fun.I even learn to love the indecipherable nature of the blocky graphics. The Mutant Toad looked recognisable, as were Shredder and his Foot Soldiers. So were the Cheeky Space Monkeys, until I discovered they were actually Giant Fleas. Mostly the enemies are like an 8-bit Rorschach test, their identity the results of projections from my subconsciousness. So that might be a feral butterfly I am trying to kill, but it may also be my feelings of male inadequacy.I am so glad I didn’t give up on this game. Because we never did as kids. You had one game a month. You played it. You kept at it. We are gaming dilettantes now, flitting from one subscription service to another, sometimes not even getting past the list of games to actually play one.I am still only halfway through. But I will soldier on through every hard-earned inch. And it will be utterly cowabunga.Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesPlayStationcommentShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday evening, Rumeysa Ozturk exited her apartment building and walked on to the street in Somerville,Massachusetts– a city outside Boston – into the fading daylight. Ozturk, a Turkish-born PhD student at Tufts University who studies children’s media and childhood development, was on her way to an iftar dinner with friends, planning to break her Ramadan fast.In a videotaken from a surveillance camera, she wears a pink hijab and a long white puffer coat against the New England cold. The first man, not uniformed but wearing plain clothes, as all the agents are, approaches her as if asking for directions. But he quickly closes in and grabs her by the wrists she has raised defensively toward her face.She screams as another man appears behind her, pulling a badge out from under his shirt and snatching away her phone. Soon six people are around her in a tight circle; she has no way to escape. They handcuff her and hustle her into an unmarked van. Attorneys for Ozturk did not know where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the US homeland security department that has become Trump’s anti-immigrant secret police, had taken the 30-year-old woman for almost 24 hours.The spirit of the Confederacy is alive and well in Trump’s America | Lloyd GreenRead moreIn that time, a judge ordered Ice to keep Ozturk, who is on an F-1 academic visa, in Massachusetts. But eventually, her lawyers learned that their client had been moved, as many Ice hostages are,to a detention camp in southern Louisiana, more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) from where she was abducted.In the video, before she is forced into the van, Ozturk looks terrified, confused. She may well have thought she was being robbed by street thugs; she did not seem to understand, at first, that she was being kidnapped by the state. She tries to plead with her attackers. “Can I just call the cops?”she asks. “We are the police,” one of the men responds. Ozturk remains imprisoned; she has been charged with no crime. In the video of her arrest, a neighborcan be heard nearby, asking: “Is this a kidnapping?”The answer is yes. Ozturk is one of a growing number university students who have been targeted, issued arrest warrants, or summarily kidnapped off the streets by Ice agents. She joins the ranks of includeMahmoud Khalil, the Syrian-born Palestinian former graduate student and green card holder from Columbia University;Alireza Doroudi, an Iranian-born mechanical engineering doctoral student at the University of Alabama;Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Columbia undergraduate who was born in South Korea but has long been a green card holder after immigrating to the United States with her parents at the age of seven; andMomodou Taal, a dual British and Gambian citizen who is studying for a graduate degree at Cornell University and has gone into hiding after receiving a summons from Ice to turn himself in for deportation proceedings.Many of these students had some connection – however tenuous – toanti-genocide protests on campusesover the past year and a half. Taal and Khalil, in different capacities, were leaders of protests for Palestinian rights at their respective universities. Chung attended one or two demonstrations at Columbia. Ozturk co-authored an op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper that cited credible allegations that Israel was violating international human rights law in Gaza and called on the university president to take a stronger stance against the genocide. In a statement regarding her arrest, a DHS spokespersonsaid: “Investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas.” They meant the op-ed.The state department claims that some of these students have had their visas or permanent resident status rescinded – in a video of the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, taken by his pregnant wife, agents proclaim that his student visa has been revoked, but when they are informed that he has a green card, they say: “We’re revoking that too.” This unilateral revocation of green card protections, without notice or due process, is illegal. But that is not the point – theTrump administrationclearly thinks of immigrants as a population with no rights that they need respect.Rather, the point is that Trump administration’s promise tocrack down on student protestsagainst Israel’s genocide in Gaza has the effect of articulating a new speech code for immigrants: no one who is not a United States citizen is entitled to the first amendment right to say that Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza, or that the lives of Palestinians are not disposable by virtue of their race.It is up to those us who do have citizenship to speak the truth that the Trump administration is willing to kidnap people for saying: genocide is wrong, Israel is committing it against Palestinians in Gaza, and Palestinians, like all people, deserve not only the food and medicine that Israel iswithholding from them, and not only an end to Israel’s relentless and largely indiscriminate bombing, but they deserve freedom, dignity and self-determination. This has become an unspeakable truth in Trump’s America. Soon, there will be other things we are not allowed to say, either. We owe it to one another to speak these urgent truths plainly, loudly and often – while we still can.Donald Trump is moving fast and breaking things, but that may result in a better US | Simon JenkinsRead moreHere is another truth: that the US’s treatment of these immigrants should shame us. It was once a cliche to say that the US was a nation of immigrants, that they represented the best of our country. It is not a cliche anymore. For most of my life as an American, it has been a singular source of pride and gratitude that mine was a country that so many people wanted to come to – that people traveled from all over the world to pursue their talent, their ambition and their hopefulness here, and that this was the place that nurtured and rewarded them.It may sound vulgar to speak of this lost pride after Ozturk’s kidnapping – all that sentimentality did nothing, after all, to protect her, and may in the end have always been self-serving and false. But as we grapple with what America is becoming – or revealing itself to be – underDonald Trump, I think we can mourn not only the lost delusions of the past but the lost potential of the future.Ozturk – a student of early childhood education, and someone brave enough to take a great personal risk in standing up for what she thought was right – seems like a person the US would be lucky to have. Instead we are punishing her, terrorizing her, kidnapping her and throwing her away. She deserves better, and so do all of our immigrants – hopeful, struggling people who mistook this for a place where they could thrive. Who, in the future, will continue to think of the US as a place where immigrants can make a difference, can prosper? Who will share their gifts with us now?Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS immigrationIsrael-Gaza warProtestUS universitiesGazaDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

We don’t know how many were shot last year either. Or the year before that. These most basic numbers should inform ourgun violence preventionefforts. But they don’t exist.This is the void of information that is created and persists when critical research is suppressed.For those struggling to keep up with our erratic news cycle, what we saw unfold in February at the National Institutes of Health – with communication blackouts, funding freezes and cuts that will obstructlife-saving research efforts– may feel inconsequential. But make no mistake: the peril hanging over our country’s research efforts remains, and we in the gun violence research community are bracing ourselves for a dangerous situation we know all too well.Our field has already experienced thedevastating consequences of defundingand censorship. The story of how we got here begins in the 1990s.Buoyed by the success of a public health approach in curbing traffic fatalities, researchers were hopeful that the same approach – track the problem, identify and test solutions, share findings and implement what works – could be used to prevent gun violence. The researchers got to work, and that work advanced rapidly. But some of the findings that emerged – in particular, that owning a gunincreased one’s risk of being murderedin one’s home – angered the powerful gun lobby.The late congressman Jay Dickey, who served as the National Rifle Association’s point person in Congress, took up the cause, introducing a provision into an omnibus bill that called for no federal funds to be used “to advocate or promote gun control”. TheDickey Amendment, passed in 1996, did not ban gun violence research outright, but research dollars within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were reallocated, and the search for solutions was reduced to a trickle.Sixteen years later, days after theAurora theatre mass shooting, Dickey co-authored anop-edreversing his stance. In it, he urgedmorescientific research, not less, and stated the truly “senseless” part of gun violence “is to decry these deaths as senseless when the tools exist to understand causes and to prevent these deadly effects”.Six months later – and one month afterSandy Hook– then president Barack Obamadirectedthe CDC to “conduct or sponsor research into the causes of gun violence and the ways to prevent it”.But even with the public outcry that followed these mass killings, even with Dickey’s reversal, even with the president’s directive, the pause in research continued.In 2018, on the heels of yet another high-profile mass shooting – this one at ahigh school in Parkland, Florida– then president Donald Trump signeda billclarifying that the Dickey Amendment did not actually prohibit gun violence research.But it wasn’t until 2021 that these policy changes would lead to the first dedicated federal funding for gun violence research in 25 years. By this time, we lacked the most fundamental tools to support gun violence research: expertise, mentorship, basic data, surveillance and the infrastructure to implement that critical public health approach to address and prevent gun violence.The year the funding returned, 2021, was also the deadliest on record for gun violence in the US:48,830lives lost to guns over the span of just 12 months. As trauma surgeons in Philadelphia, we witnessed this heartbreaking moment in our country’s history firsthand. We were bombarded by the dying and the desperate and the so many who were harmed by this disease of gun violence – a disease our government had, for 25 years, not deemed consequential enough to cure.Because the CDC tracks gun deaths but not the total number of people with non-fatal firearm injuries each year, we don’t know exactly how many people were shot during that 25-year funding pause. But we do know that hundreds of thousands of lives were forever altered or lost. And the research community could not ask why, could not ask how, could not find the answers we so desperately needed then and so desperately need now.The suffering of our patients motivates us to do research to prevent gun violence – and the suffering we witnessed during the pandemic-related surge of gun violence very nearly brought us to our knees. We want research to stop our patients from being shot. We want research to stop them from dying.The moment we find ourselves in today is especially painful because with renewed research efforts over the last few years, we had finally begun to untangle the root causes of gun violence and identify and test solutions. We had also been making progress with gun violence prevention policy nationally.White House removes advisory defining gun violence as a public health issueRead moreThree years ago, with bipartisan support, Congress passed the first majorfederal legislationaddressing gun violence prevention in decades. Two years ago, we saw thecreation ofthe White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which implemented an all-of-government approach to tackling gun violence. And last year brought the landmarkUS surgeon general’s advisory, which deemed gun violence a public health crisisthat demands attention.What’s more, we’ve seen the rate of gun violencedecreasing. Here in Philadelphia, the total number of shooting victims over the last year isdown about a thirdfrom the same point just before the pandemic.We had so much reason for hope, until January, when the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention wasshuttered. Then in February, there werebroad attacks on scientific research.

That’s a dangerous moveFri 28 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 28 Mar 2025 10.45 EDTShareTwice rejected by American voters in favor of Donald Trump, the Democratic party now faces its most severe crisis of identity in four decades. Nowhere is the party’s search for relevance in Trump’s America more desperate than in its embrace of cryptocurrency, a sector whose existence depends upon its ability to circumvent the financial regulatory state the Democrats spent a century constructing. How else to explain the Democratic representative Ritchie Torres – whose South Bronx district is the poorest in the United States – joining forces with the Republican Tom Emmer to champion cryptocurrency through theirnewly formedcongressional Crypto caucus.Congressional Republicans have always been uniform in their support for cryptocurrency: in May 2024, just three Republican House members voted against a bill to significantly relax regulations on digital tokens. But since 2016, the cryptocurrency industry has madesteady inroadsinto the Democratic party. That convergence, if it continues, will represent a return to the pre-New Deal financial politics that the party spent a century rejecting.Musk calls social security a ‘Ponzi scheme’. The real con is what Trump’s peddling | Robert ReichRead moreThroughout American history, the politics of money and financial risk have been central to party coalitions. Not since the election of 1896, however, have the Democrats been the party of deflationary, restrictive “hard money”. As the historians Anton Jäger and Noam Maggorexplain, the de-facto fusion of the Populist party with the Democratic party transformed it into a vehicle for those who saw money not as a neutral store of value, but as a political instrument that could serve developmental ends – in this case, directing investment to credit-starved regions of the country.William Jennings Bryan’s defeat drove the party to moderate its more radical monetary positions. But notwithstanding the occasional inconsistencies,Democratsgenerally maintained the anti-deflationary stance established in 1896. Thirty years later, the Great Depression provided Franklin D Roosevelt with the mandate and the crisis necessary to complete this transformation: the United States abandoned the gold standard in 1933.“Consumer protection” in its contemporary form only truly entered the American political lexicon in the 1960s, but this period established the contours of America’s politics of financial risk. The Banking Act of 1933 (often referred to as Glass-Steagall) separated commercial and investment banking to protect ordinary depositors from speculative excesses. The Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934 imposed disclosure requirements on financial markets and established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Most critically, the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) ended the era of devastating bank runs by insuring deposits.Collectively, these measures represented a fundamentally new relationship between citizens, banks and financial risk: the state would actively shape financial markets rather than simply enforcing contracts within them.The post-war era saw the Democratic party further articulate that approach to “market-making”. The Employment Act of 1946 declared it the government’s responsibility to maintain “maximum employment”, while the Federal Reserve, treasury, SEC and FDIC enforced financial stability through interest rate caps, capital controls and heavy regulation of financial institutions. While occasionally inefficient, these policies contributed to remarkable stability. As the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff havedocumented, the period from 1945 to 1971 saw virtually no banking crises in advanced economies.The Clinton administration’s financial deregulation – culminating in the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 and the deregulation of derivatives in 2000 – represented a significant retreat from these principles, and ended in the catastrophe of 2008. But, if only to offset the mounting risk they allowed the private sector to assume, the Clinton administration frequently sought toexpandthe FDIC’s responsibilities.Pro-crypto Democrats, from Torres to the disgraced New York City mayorEric Adams, argue that cryptocurrency aligns with progressive principles. “Blockchain technology can liberate the lowest income communities from the high fees of the traditional financial system,” Torressaidat an industry-organized summit last year. Kamala Harris herselfappealedto cryptocurrency as an opportunity for Black men. But cryptocurrency, at its core, subverts the tools for economic management Democrats have championed for decades.The FDIC was created precisely because uninsured deposits catalyzed routine bank runs; cryptocurrency exchanges offer no comparable protection. The Federal Reserve’s sovereignty over the American monetary base enables it to expand the money supply during downturns to maintain employment; Bitcoin’s fixed supply explicitly rejects this responsibility. The SEC was established because unregulated securities markets harmed ordinary investors; cryptocurrency’s decentralization enables exchanges likeUniswapto operate outside its protective frameworks.The industry’s “political investments” – to borrow the political scientist Thomas Ferguson’s terminology – are an undeniably defining force in American politics. By some counts,nearly halfof all corporate campaign contributions in 2024 came from the crypto sector. But despite Kamala Harris’s substantial concessions to the industry, the top three crypto PACsleaned redby a margin of nearly 2:1. Harris’s promises to the industry were never enough to outweigh the Trump campaign’sproposal, running since late July, to enshrine crypto as a “permanent national asset” through a national bitcoin “stockpile”.Modest deregulation is simply not what crypto is in the political game for. It requires nothing less than the seizure of the American state. And until Democrats can outmatch Trump’s handouts to the sector, crypto will stay with the Republican party.Volatility is the basic roadblock to crypto’s further adoption. It is simply too risky for most people. No amount of regulatory tweaks will change thatfundamental affliction: as long as cryptocurrencies are predominantly held as investments rather thanused for transactions, their prices will remain highly sensitive to investor demand fluctuations. And the absence of traditional stabilization mechanisms, like central banks or reserve assets, contributes to the high volatility of crypto tokens. Put simply: if crypto is to grow, it’ll need both state backstopping and displacement of the traditional banking system altogether.Trump has set about doing exactly this. His administration’s recently established “strategic bitcoin reserve” is, in effect, a state backstop for cryptocurrency. But the Trump administration’s designs extend far beyond “de-risking” crypto: their goal, as the political economist Martijn Koningsobserves, appears to be the destabilization of the traditional banking system itself.At the behest of Elon Musk’s s0-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – itself named after Dogecoin, Musk’s cryptocurrency of choice – the Trump administration’s “deferred resignation” packages and layoffs have alreadyreducedthe FDIC’s workforce by 10%. And Trump issued anexecutive orderin mid-February requiring that the formerly independent agency submit to White House oversight.The Trump team hasfloatedreplacing thealready enervatedFDIC with a gutted insurance scheme housed in the treasury, merging it with the office of the comptroller of the currency, or simply defanging it through mass layoffs and employee transfers. In either case, tighter executive control over banks’ balance sheets will render the financial system’s solvency contingent upon whether a particular bank is favored or disfavored by the president. It’s easy to imagine a resulting loss of confidence in the traditional banking system – an outcome that crypto advocates believe would work to their advantage.If the Democrats wish to outcompete the Republican party for crypto dollars, then, they’ll need to offer the “industry” much more than deregulation. They’ll have to become active participants in engineering a return to the pre-New Deal politics of money and financial risk – the very positions against which the modern Democratic party defined itself. That would be a capitulation unprecedented even in the Democratic party’s long history of betraying the American working class.Alex Bronzini-Vender is a writer living in New YorkExplore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesOpinionDemocratsUS politicsBitcoincommentShareReuse this content"

As the week has worn on, this has increasingly become the mood of today’s supposedly super-fun tourist trip to Greenland by the second lady of the United States, Usha Vance, and her husband, the vice-president, JD Vance. Who, come to think of it, does actually look like the Cabbage Patch Gerard Butler.Anyway: Greenland. Like I say, the trip has evolved this week both in style and substance. Originally, it was announced that the second lady was going to take one of her sons, immerse herself in various local events – she’s apparently simply fascinated by Greenland’s culture – and attend the famous Avannaata Qimussersua dog sled race. No more. Now, it’s her husband instead of her son, and the Vances are only going to a military facility. This is a little bit like announcing you’re travelling to Kyoto to see the blossoms, then “recalibrating” your trip so that all you’ll actually be taking in is a tour of the storage facility where they keep the most boring documents from the signing of the 1997 climate protocol. Extremely important, no doubt – and extremely, extremely boring. Or as the White House has chosen to characterise this shift in emphasis: “The Second Lady is proud to visit the Pituffik Space Base with her husband to learn more about Arctic security and the great work of the Space Base.” It is unclear at time of writing if Pituffik has spa facilities. Presumably it’s got something of a year-round après-ski vibe.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Nuuk, Greenland, 28 March 2025.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, the Vance kid now has to stay at home and go to school, instead of skipping it to enjoy a taxpayer-funded trip to a country his dad and friends are openly trying to annex. Still, the good news is that Mike Waltz should still be going. Yes! The second lady was in fact always slated to go on her little tourist jaunt accompanied by the national security adviser to the US president – and there’s nothing weird about that. Personally, I never minibreak without one. And it goes without saying that the travelling party will be joined in spirit by whichever journalists/Russian assets/assorted randos that Mike has added to the groupchat “Greenland Annexation Brunch With The Girls”.Alas, it seems that the sheer obnoxiousness of the Vances’ trailed visit was the thing that fatally repulsed the locals, leaving US organisers with no choice but to commute the trip down to just one secure base visit. It’s reported that advance-party administration officialswent door to doorin Greenland trying to find a local family who would be pleased to welcome Usha and her large adult son Mike Waltz into their humble dwelling – presumably in order that they could say something like: “Wow, what a beautiful humble home you have. Be a real shame if anything happened to it …”Strangely, no such family was forthcoming. It’s almost as if people in Greenland have the internet, and are able to read or watch the constant and intensifying statements on their country’s potential annexation by the covetous US president, Donald Trump. “It’s an island … that we need,” observed Trump with chilling mildness earlier this week. “And we’re going to have to have it.” Further matter-of-fact justifications have been repeatedly forthcoming. “We need greater national security purposes [sic],”ran another. “I’ve been told that for a long time, long before I even ran [for president]. People really don’t even know that Denmark has any legal right to it, but if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security.” Spoken with all the kindly rationale of the school bully explaining you should give up your lunch money because he needs it.View image in fullscreenThe Pituffik space base that will be visited by JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance.Photograph: Thomas Traasdahl/APMeanwhile, a series of proxies are emerging to push America’s case – or, in the case of Vladimir Putin, to not argue with it in a way that is tantamount to cheerleading. “In short, America’s plans in relation to Greenland are serious,”the Russian president observedthis week. “These plans have deep historical roots. And it’s clear that the US will continue to systematically pursue its geo-strategic, military-political and economic interests in the Аrctic.” On Friday morning, Stephen Moore – a former Trump economic adviser-turned-Heritage Foundation wingnut – explained cheerfully to the BBC that the Greenlanders were “the people who would benefit the most from this … let’s call it a sale, or acquisition.” Let’s not, but go on. “They could, overnight, turn into millionaires.” This somehow reminds me of that old statistic suggesting that instead of going to an expensive war to protect them, the British government could instead have just made every Falkland Islander a millionaire to soften the unwanted blow of having been taken over by Argentina. After all, what else do people want in life, except for money?“There could be trillions of dollars’ worth of minerals and oil and gas and other types of … precious minerals that could be of value to the United States,” speculated Moore, adding, almost by way of an afterthought about the Greenlanders, that there’s “essentially a treasure chest right below their feet”. Mm. The trouble with the nakedly rapacious hawks of Trumpworld putting it that way, of course, is that it’s only a very short hop to seeing the Greenland people as the obstacle. If only they, and their feet, could just be dug through, then the treasure chest could be rightfully – or wrongfully – claimed.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionJD VanceUS foreign policyUS politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

From Google DeepMind, andfirst reportedin 2020, it uses artificial intelligence to figure out a protein’s 3D structure. The technology has already been used to solve fundamental questions in biology, awarded the Nobel prize (in chemistry – to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper) and revolutionised drug discovery. Like most AI, it’s only getting better – and just getting started.A protein’s structure gives us clues about its function, and helps us design new drugs. AlphaFold, which wastrainedon a huge database of experimentally solved structures called the Protein Data Bank, predicts a protein’s structure based on its amino acid sequence.In the past, the first step would be to produce a vast amount of protein – using litres of a bacterium, or a virus. You’dprayfor the protein to assemble into a crystal lattice (notoriously difficult), and then fire high-energy X-rays at it. This is called X-ray crystallography, and it could take years. Now, AlphaFold can do it in minutes (and a hell of a lot more cheaply, too).When AlphaFold competed at a protein structure-solvingcompetitionin 2020, it was so good that some accused the AlphaFold team of cheating. At its first appearance, AlphaFold became the state of the art. Now, there are approximately 250,000,000 protein structures in the AlphaFold database, which has been used by almost 2 million people from 190 countries – many more people than can do X-ray crystallography!I did my PhD on cancer biology. I would have loved to solve the structure of the protein I worked on. Maybe I could have even used it to make a new drug. Now, I can go to theAlphaFold serverand produce a structure in five minutes that would have consumed my whole PhD.Dr Pauline Lascaux, a molecular and structural biologist at the University of Oxford, said that AlphaFold was central to herlatest study, which discovered a new way that cells repair DNA, and that more than 90% of the studies she reviews are citing it.View image in fullscreen‘The technology has already been used to solve fundamental questions in biology, awarded the Nobel Prize, and revolutionised drug discovery.’Illustration: EMBL-EBI/AFP/Getty ImagesSo what does drug discovery with AlphaFold look like? In thisrecent Science study, researchers used AlphaFold to predict the structure of the serotonin receptor, which controls mood. Throughin silicotesting (on computers) they tested which of 1.6bn (!) molecules could bind the AlphaFold structure. What they found was a series of molecules that bound much more tightly than drugs generated via the conventional – experimental – approach, which could be new drugs for mood disorders.AlphaFold has only been around since 2020, but its impact has been meteoric. Here are the top three discoveries enabled by AlphaFold so far:Solving adecades-old problem: the structure of the nuclear pore complex, one of the biggest structures in the cell. This complex is the guardian of entry to the nucleus, which holds the cell’s DNA. It’s implicated in cancer, ageing and neurodegeneration – and now we know what it looks like at the atomic level.Finding a new liver cancer drug. In a lab (not in patients), the drug, whichtargetsthe cancer proteinCDK20, prevented liver cancer growth.Helping to design a “molecular syringe”, which delivers atherapeutic protein payloadinto human cells.There are companies built on AlphaFold, too. If AlphaFold is solving the lock, thenAlphaProteoprovides the key. AlphaProteo uses AlphaFold’s structures to design molecules that can bind to and modulate other proteins. This has been used to generate molecules that have never been made before – to target Covid-19, cancer and autoimmunity.Also from DeepMind,AlphaMissensetackles the problem of missense mutations – minor changes to genes, with uncertain functional impact. Despite their prevalence, we only know whether about 2% of these changes are pathogenic. AlphaMissense models the structure of the mutations using AlphaFold: if the protein structure changes, it’s probably pathogenic. This could transform the diagnosis and treatment of rare genetic diseases.We don’t know yet whether drugs designed using AlphaFold will pass successfully through clinical trials, and none have been tested in humans yet – only time will tell.In the future, AlphaFold could enable new medicines to be discovered by individuals, could find drugs for undruggable targets, and could unlock the secrets of molecular life. (Just the other day, AlphaFoldhelped to solvethe structure of the sperm-egg bridge that forms during fertilisation.)If the first generation of drug discovery was the nature generation, which gave us aspirin (from willow tree bark), and the second was the biotech generation, which gave us Ozempic, then we’ve now moved to the third generation: the AI generation.Samuel Hume is a fellow at The Foulkes Foundation and pursuing PhD in the University of Oxford’s department of oncology"

Energy Transfer sued Greenpeace for alleged damages it claimed derived from the historic Indigenous-led Standing Rock protests in 2016 against theDakota Access pipeline. Our presence in court was essential given that the company was able to shroud the trial in secrecy. There was no court reporter and there still is no public transcript or recording of the proceedings.The North Dakota ruling against Greenpeace is a threat to free speech | Sushma Raman and Anthony RomeroRead moreWhat we observed was shocking.Greenpeacelost, not because it did something wrong, but because it was denied a fair trial.The legendary US human rights attorney Marty Garbus, a member of our team who has practiced law for more than six decades and who represented Nelson Mandela and Václav Havel, said it was the most unfair trial he had ever witnessed. This is precisely why many of us on the monitoring team believe there is a good chance Greenpeace will not pay the first dollar of the judgment and might actually recoup significant damages from Energy Transfer in a separate case in Europe. That case, currently being heard in Dutch courts, would entitle Greenpeace to compensation based on a finding that theNorth Dakotacase is an illegitimate attempt to squelch free speech.Many legal observers and first amendment scholars regard the North Dakota case as a Slapp harassment lawsuit. Slapps – strategic lawsuits against public participation – are designed not to resolve legitimate legal claims but to use courts to intimidate, silence and even bankrupt adversaries. By their very nature, they violate the constitution because they trespass on the first amendment right to speech. Allowing these cases to proceed almost always saddles the target with backbreaking legal expenses that can silence even the most resilient leaders and organizations.This clearly was Energy Transfer’s plan, but the case was never just about Greenpeace. It was about using the organization as a proxy to attack the Standing Rock Sioux’s autonomy, leadership and sovereignty, as well as the broader climate justice movement, which is trying mightily to transition our country to a clean energy economy. The protests and the climate movement’s goals are a direct threat to Energy Transfer’s business model.That might explain why Kelcy Warren, the founder and CEO of Energy Transfer, said the main purpose of the lawsuit against Greenpeace was to“send a message”rather than to collect money. A major Trump supporter and the mastermind of the lawsuit, Warren once said activists“should be removed from the gene pool”. After he made a large contribution toDonald Trump’s inaugural committee in 2017, theTrump administrationquicklyapproveda key easement for the North Dakota pipeline that had been denied by Barack Obama.The Greenpeace case had all the telltale signs of an illegitimate Slapp – so much so that it was originallythrown outof federal court in 2019. In that case, Energy Transfer openly claimed Greenpeace had engaged in a racketeering conspiracy and “terrorism” by speaking out against the pipeline and by conducting training in non-violent direct action at the site. The company quicklyrefiledthe case in the more friendly confines of state court. Literally every judge in the judicial district where it was filedrecusedthemselves because of conflicts of interest.Here are some of the more fundamental problems we observed that clearly violated the fair trial rights of Greenpeace:The Guardian view on Trump and reality: from promoting alternative facts to erasing truths | EditorialRead moreThe jury – the most sacred due process protection available to a defendant – was patently biased in favor of the company. Seven of the 11 people seatedhad ties to the fossil fuel industry. Some had admitted they could not be fair, but the judge seated them anyway. There was no Native American or person of color on the jury even though issues of Indigenous rights were central to the trial.Morton county, where the trial was held and where many of the protests took place,voted75% for Trump in the last election and has extensive ties to thefossil fuelindustry. In a pre-trialsurvey, 97% of residents in the county said they could not be fair to Greenpeace. Yet the judge refused repeated requests by Greenpeace to move the case.Energy Transfer ran a major television and online advertising campaign in the county lauding itself in the weeks leading up to the trial. A newspaper called Central ND News, with articles critical of the protests, was also sent to county residents; Greenpeace believed Energy Transfer might have been responsible for it. But the court refused to allow Greenpeace to use court discovery procedures to determine how this unethical campaign to taint the jury pool happened.Adding to the absurdity, Greenpeace was blamed for the entire protest movement even though it played only a minimal role. The protestswere ledby the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, on whose ancestral land the Dakota Access pipeline was being built. In fact, only six of the 100,000 people who came to the protests were from Greenpeace – yet Energy Transfer was able to convince the jury to hold the organization responsible for every dollar of supposed damages that occurred over seven months of protests.Secrecy pervaded the proceedings. The court repeatedlyrefusedto open a live stream to the public or to create and release transcripts. A request by media organizations (including the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times) to access the live stream was denied. Thousands of key documents were sealed and thus hidden from public scrutiny.The judge, James Gion, made evidentiary decisions that gutted Greenpeace’s ability to mount a defense. For example, a major expert report showed that the pipeline had leaked roughly 1m gallons of drilling fluids into drinking water sources used by millions of people. Greenpeace lawyers needed the document to debunk the argument that the pipeline was safe, but the judge refused to let the organization use it.The 35-page verdict form was confusing and the results seemed to prove the jury was in fact confused. It appears the exorbitant damages number was calculated by pulling numbers out of thin air – including millions for public relations expenses, private security costs, which were being paid anyway, and refinancing costs due to various banks withdrawing from the project once they learned about the protests. (Lobbying banks is also constitutionally protected advocacy.)The inability of Judge Gion to manage the case such that Greenpeace’s fair trial rights were respected was evident. It was almost excruciating to watch. It felt more like a choreographed show than an adversarial proceeding. Greenpeace was consistently – and, in our opinion, falsely – portrayed by the Energy Transfer lawyer Trey Cox as a criminal enterprise that exploited Indigenous peoples for its own gain. He used words such as “mafia” and “coded language” to describe the group’s operations. (Cox works for thesame law firm, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, that Chevron used to orchestrate my 993-day detention after I helped Amazon communities win the $10bn Ecuador pollution case.)The verdict represents more than a financial blow against Greenpeace. It has huge and very troubling implications for free speech across the nation. The result threatens the rights of religious groups and political organizations. It implicates the rights of churches and charities. If the theory of the case stands, pretty much anyone in the United States can face ruin for exercising their constitutional right to speak on an issue of public importance – including adherents of conservative causes. It’s a corporate playbook that started with Chevron’s legal attacks on me and the Amazon communities in 2009. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher markets the playbook to its corporate clients.The case also highlights the Trump administration’s broader attack on progressive activism. From proposed legislation that would allow the treasury department to unilaterally revoke the non-profit status of organizations deemed “terrorism-supporting”to the FBI’s reported plans tocriminally prosecuteclimate groups, the goal is clear: suppress dissent. Greenpeace is in the crosshairs because its brand is global and its success in fighting polluters over the last several decades is outstanding.Donald Trump’s ‘war on woke’ is fast becoming a war on science. That’s incredibly dangerous | Christina PagelRead moreThis is why it is critical for Greenpeace and its allies to lean into the verdict and issue a call to action to the entire environmental movement and broader civil society organizations. Greenpeace is without question the world’s largest environmental activist group, with chapters in 25 countries. It gave birth to the non-Indigenous part of the modern environmental movement in the early 1970s and captured the imagination of the world by engaging in spectacular and creative actions to save whales in the north Pacific and to stop nuclear testing. Greenpeace needs to be protected in this critical moment.There is more than a glimmer of hope. A hearing is scheduled for July in Amsterdam in the Greenpeace lawsuit against Energy Transfer. If Greenpeace prevails onappealin North Dakota and wins in Europe, it might be Energy Transfer paying substantial sums to Greenpeace rather than the other way around.There are realistic scenarios where Greenpeace emerges from this experience stronger than ever. The key is to keep grinding and calling out this abuse loudly and publicly. The world will respond.Steven Donziger is a human rights and environmental lawyer.

Our research affirms thatresistanceisaliveandwell.Many underestimate resistance to the currentRepublicanadministration because they view resistance through a narrow lens. The2017 Women’s Marchin particular – immediate in its response, massive in its scope and size – may inform collective imaginations about what the beginning of a resistance movement should look like during Trump 2.0.In fact,our researchshows that street protests today are far more numerous and frequent than skeptics might suggest. Although it is true that the reconfiguredPeople’s March of 2025– held on 18 January – saw lower turnout than the 2017 Women’s March, that date also saw the most protests in a single day for over a year. And since 22 January, we’ve seen more than twice as many street protests than took place during the same period eight years ago.In February 2025 alone, we have already tallied more than 2,085 protests, which included major protests in support of federal workers, LGBTQ+ rights, immigrant rights, Palestinian self-determination, Ukraine anddemonstrations against TeslaandDonald Trump’s agenda more generally. This is compared with 937 protests in the United States in February 2017, which included major protests against the so-called Muslim ban along with other pro-immigrant and pro-choice protests.Donald Trump is moving fast and breaking things, but that may result in a better US | Simon JenkinsRead moreCoordinated days of protest such as March Fourth for Democracy (4 March), Stand Up for Science (7 March), rallies in recognition of International Women’s Day (8 March) and protests demanding the release of the Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil suggest little likelihood of these actions slowing down. These are all occurring in the background of atidal wave of lawsuitschallenging theTrump administration’s early moves.Historically, street protest and legal challenges are common avenues for popular opposition to governments, but economic noncooperation – such as strikes, boycotts and buycotts – is what often gets the goods. Individual participation is deliberately obscure, and targeted companies may have little interest in releasing internal data. Only the aggregate impacts are measurable – and in the case ofTesla,Targetandother companies, the impacts so far have beenmeasurable indeed.Consider the protests againstTeslain response toElon Muskfiring federal workers and blocking federal funding. The multifacetedcampaignhas a quite specific goal: punish Tesla, Musk’s signature company. In addition to protests at Tesla showrooms and charging stations, people have also sold their Teslas. Others have called on mutual funds to divest from Tesla stock. The stock price has dropped significantly in the last month, perhaps in part due to Musk’s Doge work.This shift toward noncooperation over large-scale protests may be strategically wise. In 2017, many who attended Women’s Marches remained deeply engaged in civic activity, funneling into groups and coalitions like Indivisible, Swing Left, Run for Something, Fight Back Table and the like. People who aligned with Indivisible and groups like it were almost certainlyresponsiblefor saving the Affordable Care Act in 2017, largely through pressure on elected members of Congress. The Maga faction had not yet consolidated control of the GOP, and within a year the “blue wave” flipped the House during the 2018 midterms. Under such conditions, protests and political pressure made a lot of strategic sense.Those groups and others still remain active, but today’s political terrain may call for a more muscular movement strategy. The Maga faction controls the Republican party and enforces strict discipline among its members throughfearand the threat of a well-funded Republican primaryopponentin the next election. The supreme court majority is solidly on the right. Elected Republican officials areabandoningtown halls anddiscouragingconstituents from calling their offices. Street protests endure but are increasingly surveilled and high risk, as Khalil’s detention suggests. Uncertainty about whether the Trump administration will ignore the first amendment and weaponize the government to persecute political oppositionists looms large.In the face of such changes, the public’s most powerful options are often withholding labor power and purchasing power. Calling in sick from work or school, refusing to buy and stay-at-home demonstrations are notoriously difficult to police. Last month, an inestimable number of people participated in such actions to highlight aDay Without Immigrants. The prominence of billionaires in the administration and populist anger toward them make this type of approach even more viable in today’s climate.Indeed, the diversification of resistance methods puts the United States on a similar trajectory to many democracy movements of the past. In anti-authoritarian movements of the 20th century, economic noncooperation – more so than protest alone – was the coordinated activity that split elites and made way for democratic breakthroughs. In apartheidSouth Africa, it was the enormous economic pressure – through boycotts of white-owned businesses, general strikes, divestments and capital flight – that brought the white supremacist National party to heel and elevated reformers who were willing to do business with Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress.In communistPoland, it was the ability of trade unionists to credibly call for general strikes (and credibly call off such strikes) that gave the Solidarity movement the leverage to negotiate a peaceful democratic transition. Mahatma Gandhi’s noncooperation campaigns inIndiamade the colony ungovernable by British colonial authorities.And when the Nazis invaded and occupiedDenmarkin the 1940s, noncooperation was near-total. No one remembered how to run the railroad. Teachers had to leave school early to tend to their gardens. Factory workers slowed down or stopped production altogether. Danes obscured the identities of their Jewish neighbors, gave them temporary haven and secured their passage through fishing boats to neutral territory, saving thousands of lives.Similarly, in Czechoslovakia, six days after the Soviet invasion in 1968, the newspaper Večerní Praha published “10 commandments”, writing: “When a Soviet soldier comes to you, YOU: 1. Don’t know 2. Don’t care 3. Don’t tell 4. Don’t have 5. Don’t know how to 6. Don’t give 7. Can’t do 8. Don’t sell 9. Don’t show 10. Do nothing.”These oppositional habits of thinking and practice, nurtured over two decades through underground popular schools, art, literature and outlawed news sources, ultimately paved the way for the Velvet Revolution.Indeed, the United States has its ownstoried historyof resisting authoritarianism through noncooperation. Pro-independence colonists living under the British crown organized campaigns to refuse to buy or consume British goods; refuse to abide by laws requiring colonists to export raw materials to Britain; refuse to serve on juries under crown-appointed judges; and develop alternative institutions including the Continental Congress itself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

These took place in combination with marches and demonstrations that were powerful and dramatic displays of the moral power of the movement and legal action that demanded the government abide by its own constitution.That Americansseem to be rediscoveringthe art, science and potency of noncooperation – combined with a robust protest capacity and legal action – shows that resistance against Trump’s agenda in America is not only alive and well. It is savvy, diversifying and probably just getting started.Whats giving me hopeWhat’s giving me hope is watching ordinary people turn out at town halls, community meetings, rallies, protests, experimenting with economic noncooperation like consumer boycotts, and organizing their communities for rapid response and mutual aid. Countless people are speaking out about unconstitutional moves by the government, and in support of those who have been personally affected by them. There is growing pressure on civic institutions to take a stand as well. So long as a critical mass of people remain willing to speak up, speak out and organize their communities to protect one another, there is hope for an even better future in this country.This article was originally published onWaging NonviolenceErica Chenowethis a political scientist at Harvard Kennedy School and co-director of the Crowd Counting Consortium.

Of course this can be partly explained by colder European winters, but for those of us living in the chillier southern parts of Australia this seems like a missed opportunity.In Australia, most homes are built with single glazed windows creating a thermal weak spot – up to87% of heat is increased through thin windows in summer and 40% lost in winter. About40% of Australian household energy use is for heating and cooling, so double glazing can significantly bring down energy bills while reducing noise levels.The purpose of double glazing is to create an insulating layer of gas trapped between two (or more) layers of thick glass (known as insulating glass units or IGU’s), thereby increasing sound and comfort levels while reducing energy demand inside your home.But like many things, double glazing doesn’t come cheap. Navigating the myriad of options on the market can be overwhelming. Here is where to start.Consider the different optionsLiving in a century-old art deco apartment in Melbourne’s bayside, my partner and I found ourselves shivering through chilly Melbourne winters and paying increasingly high power bills to warm the apartment using electric heaters.View image in fullscreen‘My partner and I found ourselves shivering through chilly Melbourne winters.’Photograph: Stefan Postles/AAPSo we started researching the options out there for double glazing and soon realised it was way more complicated than we’d thought. The first thing to recommend is get at least three quotes. The prices will vary significantly according to the type of double glazing you choose.“Consumers often think that all double glazing is the same, however this is not the case,” says Clinton Skeoch, the executive director and chief executive of the Australian Glass and Window Association.“For those in climates that tend to be hotter, you may want to have more solar control or tint to help keep the heat out. If you are in a climate where it tends to be cooler, you will likely be looking for admitting in as much solar radiation as possible and keeping it in your house by changing what surface the glass coatings are on.”Factor in other costsThe quotes we received for five windows varied between $5,000 for detachable double-glazed window add-ons that are attached with magnets to the existing windows to $20,000 for a complete window rebuild. We decided the cheaper detachable option wouldn’t work for us as we don’t have space to store the windows when we want to let fresh air into the apartment, especially in summer time.In the end we settled for a mid-price option that placed the new double-glazed windows inside the existing window frames and cost just over $10,000. But that’s when things became even more complicated.As our building has a heritage overlay, our body corporate informed us we’d need council approval to get double glazing done as it would affect the outside appearance of the building.View image in fullscreen‘Double glazing doesn’t come cheap. Navigating the myriad of options on the market can be overwhelming.’Photograph: Paul Glendell/AlamyOur local council charged just over $300 for this approval (you need to provide them with all the work details from the double glazing company) but we managed to convince our building’s body corporate to cover this cost, so it’s certainly worth asking. Once that council approval came through the work commenced after a few months delay (double-glazing companies often have long waiting lists).Work on making the rest of your house more efficientDouble glazing has been a great addition to our century-old apartment.We immediately noticed significantly reduced street sounds coming in and we’re looking forward to a more livable temperature in winter. But it’s important to be aware that the windows are only part of the solution.Tim Forcey, author ofMy Efficient Electric Home handbook,says double-glazing is a great addition but only part of improving a home’s overall efficiency.“Don’t expect new windows to solve all your problems,” he says. “Double glazing can have multiple benefits including noise reduction, less moisture condensation inside in winter, they are more secure and generally thermally better.”Clinton Skeoch agrees, noting that double glazed windows will perform better in a home that has wall and roof insulation in place.“Ultimately by maximising the performance of a house’s thermal envelope homeowners are investing in a product that works to improve energy efficiency, reduce heating and cooling costs and comfort regardless of if the sun is shining.”Explore more on these topicsEnergyChange by degreesEnergy efficiencyShareReuse this content"

All around me, particularly in the aftermath of the US election, I hear panic that a Peter Dutton-led government will be our equivalent here.This sentiment fails to have an impact on me. It assumes, for example, that the government has a moral high ground. In my book, that’s simply not the case. The ALP, just like the Coalition, continuously relied on dogwhistle tactics to hold on to their power and ensure an increasingly disengaged electorate even turns up to cast a vote for them and grab their democracy sausages.The ALP have been disappointing when it came to a vision for Indigenous rights beyond holding the referendum and the massive loss of lives in Gaza. They have been lacklustre on the environment, discriminatory on refugee rights and middling on health.A Dutton-led government may threaten public health more, and fuel public ignorance more, but will it really be that different? When I think of federal politics over the last two decades, evidence suggests no. Indeed, it’s been currently so bad that John Howard has emerged as one of the few charismatic leaders who actually did shift the country, even if, in my estimation, he took it all in completely the wrong direction.As an election looms, will Australians remember Labor for one rate cut or the 12 hikes before that?Read moreMy only wish for this election is that democracy and better constituent representation, rather than power-holding and party room dynamics, drives our existing system more regardless of who forms government. The only way that is going to happen is with a robust crossbench and power-sharing agreements between major and minor parties, along with independents, promoting legislative negotiation and cooperation. The two-party system needs to be broken and voters’ voices need to be heard.Celeste Liddle is a 46-year-old Arrernte woman living in Melbourne/Naarm.

It was disappointing that the government chose not to increase jobseeker in the recent budget. Australia is a wealthy country and there’s no reason for poverty to exist.We’ve watched inflation drive up prices of everyday living expenses like food and electricity, which has impacted those in poverty the most. We were struggling before but now it’s harder again.Increasing payments is the fastest, most direct way to give relief to people doing it tough and will impact their ability to eat, access shelter, pay rent and receive medical care. I know for myself that raising payments to the poverty line would mean I could afford good healthy food and improve my mental and physical health so I could then work.Poverty and disability has become my main barrier to employment. The government can’t cure my disability but they can cure my poverty and that of many others. More than 3.3 million people have been left behind by previous governments.I will be voting for independents or parties that support this policy. It’s time we built a more equitable future for not only us but future generations.Melissa Fisher is an artist and anti-poverty activist who relies on jobseeker.

This is not a standalone issue – it interplays with and compounds several other issues.Climate change is a cost-of-living problem, with climate disaster and extreme weather events driving up prices of food, fuel, power and housing. By lowering supply across the board, extreme weather events driven by climate change will compound inflation and add to the strains on our hip pockets across the country.Climate change is also an intergenerational inequality issue, because we know climate disasters will continue to increase in frequency and severity, leaving my generation and generations to come to bear the brunt in a way generations before us have never had to. Although there is widespread knowledge that climate change will disproportionately affect the young people of today and tomorrow, there is no legislation that specifically safeguards the health and wellbeing of these generations in the face of climate change.I will be voting for any party that commits to legislating a “duty of care” to current and future generations in the face of climate change and addressing this intergenerational burden.Anjali Sharma was the lead litigant in Sharma v Environment Minister, the landmark court case against the then federal environment minister Sussan Ley.

But whoever our representatives will be after the election, they must address the Trumpian dystopia we’re witnessing and offer a clear vision for an independent Australia.Appeasement will never work; better to make new friends fast. Can Anthony Albanese channel his inner Curtin and look to Europe, Asia and South America “free from any pangs as to our traditional links and kinship” with the US?The ALP should build a coalition with the teals and the Greens and offer them some portfolios.

It begins when a centrist party crushes hope in democracy. When Keir Starmer’s governmenttakes a chainsawto people’s aspirations for a fairer, greener, kinder country, he cuts off not just faith in the Labour party butfaith in politics itself. The almost inevitable result, as countries from the US to the Netherlands, Argentina to Austria, Italy to Sweden show, is to let the far right in.So what’s the game? Why adopt policies that could scarcely be better calculated to prevent your re-election? Why stick tooutdated fiscal ruleswhen projections suggest they’llmake almost everyone worse off, especially those in poverty? Why impose devastating attacks on wellbeing, such assustaining the two-child benefit cap,freezing local housing allowanceandcutting disability benefits?Why pursue austerity when the country voted so decisively to end it? Whycut and cutwhenyears of experience showthis willundermine the government’sprimary (and ill-advised) goal, economic growth?Whytaunt,insult and abusea crucial part of your political base: people who care about life on Earth?

Why reject a wealth tax, when a 2% levy on assets of over £10mcould raise £24bn a year? Why not adopt the measuresproposed by Patriotic Millionaires, generating £60bn a year? Or thosesuggested by political economist Richard Murphy, worth £90bn in tax revenue? Why abandon plans totax non-doms properly? Why not demand an end to the Bank of England’sdestructive quantitative tightening?Why bury policies that might help restore democracy, such as proportional representation? Why introducenew political funding ruleswithout actually addressing the capture of politics by the rich?It’s straight from the Trump playbook: Labour is tearing up the machinery of government | George MonbiotRead moreWhy adoptReform’s messages, Reform’s branding andReform’s cruelty, to compete over who can most brutally beat up asylum seekers? Anabundance of evidenceshows that when centre-left parties take radical-right positions, theylose more voters on the leftthan they gain on the right. Adopting far-right messaginghelps far-right parties win.These policies might seem incomprehensible. But there’s a thread running through them. They allarise from the same doctrine: neoliberalism. This ideology, which has dominated the UK since 1979, demands austerity, the privatisation and shrinkage of public services, curtailment of protest and trade unions, deregulation and tax reductions for the rich. Justified as a means of creating an enterprise society, it has instead delivereda new age of rent, as powerful people monopolise crucial assets, from water to housing to social media. It leaves a government with few options but to scapegoat asylum seekers and other vulnerable groups for the problems it fails to address.Neoliberalism has become an orthodoxy from which parties depart at their peril, exposing themselves to fierce attacks by the media and the Tufton Street junktanksit endlessly platforms. But how did it become so hegemonic that it has turned Labour almost into the opposite of what it once was? It’s hard to understand until you grasp that the purpose of neoliberalism is to break down resistance to capital. This in turn requires a better understanding of capitalism.Capitalism is constantly confused with commerce. While the two systems are often entangled, capitalism can exist without commerce and commerce without capitalism. Commerce goes back thousands of years. Capitalism is adistinct economic systemthat arose roughly 600 years ago, founded on colonial looting. It operates on a dynamic, constantly evolving frontier, pushing ever further into our lives, on which both state and powerful private interests use their laws, backed by the threat of violence, to turn shared resources into exclusive property, transforming natural wealth, labour and money into commodities that can be accumulated. You can see what it looks like, when released from democratic constraint, in Donald Trump’s America.For 150 years, capitalism has sought to undermine or crush its direct antagonist: democracy. It found a highly successful means in fascism, which was bankrolled in the early 20thcentury by some of the richest people and corporations in Europe and Japan. But in 1945, that solution ran into certain minor difficulties.Just in time, an alternative arrived. Neoliberalism was first formalised in two books published in 1944, The Road to Serfdom by Friedrich Hayek and Bureaucracy by Ludwig von Mises. Both authors opposed fascism, but their ideas were just as useful to capital.By 1947, some of the richest people on Earth were pouring money into it. They soon built an international network of “thinktanks”, academic departments, tame government advisers, editors and journalists. They refined and amplified the messaging until it began to sound like common sense, hammered home so often that Margaret Thatcher was able to proclaim “there is no alternative”.Neoliberalism is highly effective at destroying democratic hope. As hope evaporates, the far right sweeps into the political void, enabling capital to invest once more in its earlier solution. Neoliberalism, in other words, paves the road to fascism and serfdom.As the damage to human wellbeing and the living world mounts, parties once on the left, such as UKLabour, the US Democrats and Australian Labor, urgently need to recover their courage. I feel there’s great potential in building a new “politics of belonging”, in which political power and control of local resources are returned to communities.A large part of politics can be understood as a search for belonging, a fundamental human need. Even fascists seek community and belonging, albeit a version where everyone looks the same, wears the same uniform and chants the same slogans. Steering people away from fascism requires an answer to this need, an answer that can be found in vibrant inclusive neighbourhoods,strengthened by participatory democracyand community ownership of key local assets. A wealth of experience from other nations and other ages shows that disempowerment sets us apart, while shared, equal decision-makingbrings us together.I hate to give up on this government, so soon after it has taken office, but defending people from injustice and destitution, keeping out the far right, reviving communities and renewing democracy requires a mindset that seems a thousand miles away. Where we look for resistance and vision, we find a craven appeasement of capital. Labour promised change.

I was a pretty traumatised, messed-up kid. I had a lot of anger, mostly towards the people closest to me, but because I couldn’t do anything about that I just went around with a lot of rage that I had no way of getting rid of.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian Design/Speed Media/Shutterstock/Getty ImagesA family member had a hatred of ‘“Asians’” because of the second world war. My grandfather also hated “Asians”, and said things like “make sure you lock your doors” and “you can’t trust them”. This was when the Australian senator and One Nation leader,Pauline Hanson, was out there saying a lot of “anti-Asian” stuff.Around that time I had a medical problem and the medication I was put on gave me a lot of anger. With all this mixed together, I thought: “It must be the Asians that are causing the problems.” Suddenly I wasn’t this quiet kid any more. I started to pick fights with anyone who looked at me wrong.I was a loner and started finding other people who were loners too, and we started to form little groups. They were mostly nerdy guys or people with traumatic backgrounds like me who wanted to get their anger out.There was a lot of sexual abuse and domestic abuse survivors in the group. I remember one of the guys saying he had been raped by his dad, who fed him drugs every night to make him forget it. We were a bunch of guys with nowhere to go and no way of getting the support we needed. We found a common enemy to release our anger towards – at a time when there was a lot of racism in the community directed at “Asian gangs”. It got worse and worse, until eventually, when I was 15, guys in the group were talking about doing a full-on attack.Looking back now, I can see how it happened. But at the time we were just so filled with rage that “these people” were coming into our town, and we were being told by the community that “they’re the problem”, so they became the target of our anger. Within about six months it went from mirroring things that were being said in the community to “we should get weapons and start killing people”.It was only when I reconnected with an old friend from primary school that I realised I wanted to get out of the group. He took me to places in the city that I had never been to. I started seeing different cultures for the first time – it really took me out of that white bubble.I tried to get the other guys to drop the hatred, tried getting them into jobs and getting them away from hanging out with the group and involved in different activities. They had never been to the city. A year or so later, it eventually dissolved.Fifteen years later, after leaving the military, I heard the Australian MPAnne Alyon the radio. At the time she was a counterterrorism expert at a university and she was doing a call-out for people who had backgrounds in extremism so they could try to understand Islamic State. I called her up, and she said: “When can you come to Perth?” I flew there on Monday. After that, the New South Wales police gave me my first case.At that time, there was no disengagement programme in Australia. No one understood how to do it. Anne said: “Why don’t you set one up?” I said, yeah, I’ll jump in. And so Exit Australia came into being. The main thing I have learned from my own experience is to ask what directed this person towards anger in the first place? And then work on that.Terror time bomb: the race to defuse Australia’s far-right threatRead moreMost people drop the ideology pretty quickly once they get the support they need. They belong to these groups because they’re getting something from them. You have to become the surrogate of that support so they don’t need the group any more. One of my biggest “success stories” was a guy who was planning a mass murder, who I helped access the services he needed. There have been people who were hellbent on conspiracy theories, wanting to do things like attack the government. I have helped them reconnect with their families and they have changed their minds. I have seen people with Nazi tattoos in jail start getting the support they need, and then when I say, “Why don’t we get rid of these tattoos?”, they say “sure”.My biggest concern today is that younger people are getting involved in these groups. They are oblivious to the ways in which predators can condition and recruit them online. I’ve even had kids come up to me after a talk and say: “I now realise I’m being recruited.” A lot of the groups now are using masculinity and being “gym fit” as a way to get kids to join up. It’s always us v them with some new twist. For me, it was the “Asians” who were against us; pre-Covid, it was the “Muslims” trying to take over; during Covid, it was the “elites” controlling the government; and now it’s the “elites” and “multiculturalism” trying to “eradicate” whites.The lesson I would give people trying to disengage others is to build a rapport with them and identify the underlying cause of their anger. It’s also important to remember that not everyone has the same tools of resilience to help themselves. The worst thing you can do is to fight back against the ideology and all the terrible things a person has said. Try to find the underlying problems – and build support around that.Matthew Quinn is the founder and CEO of Exit Australia, which looks at disengaging violent extremists.

HahahahaRhiannon Lucy CosslettNew guidelines are well intentioned, but as parents of babies know, finding time to look after yourself is impossibleFri 28 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 28 Mar 2025 07.54 EDTShareOne of the many things you don’t realise until you have a newborn is just how much people congratulate you simply for leaving the house. “Well done for getting out and about,” they say, with the cheerful camaraderie of People Who Know. Going outside may sound like a low benchmark, but during those early weeks summoning the energy to put on clothes, pack a bag, and then using that narrow window between sleeping, feeding, pooing and screaming to cross the threshold into the world can feel like the grand sum total of all human endeavour. Screw the frescoes of the Scrovegni chapel: Mama made it to Budgens.Which explains my reaction when I read that new guidelinespublished in the British Journal of Sports Medicinesay that new mothers should be strongly encouraged to do at least two hours of moderate to vigorous exercise a week, in addition to “daily pelvic floor muscle training”, and further that they should develop a “healthy sleep hygiene routine”, avoid screen time and “maintain a dark, cool, quiet environment before bed”.Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.Where to start with this? Maybe with the phrase “strongly encouraged”, as though new mothers don’t get enough of that. In the absence of proper, structural support, strong encouragement is all society has. Take an anonymous call I received a few days after we were discharged from the hospital, still reeling from a complicated birth (when people ask what kind it was, I say: “I think maybe … all of them?”) I picked up the phone. “Hello?” I said, tentatively. I was in the bathroom at the time, observing the carnage of my life and body with the sort of stoned detachment that comes with zero sleep and opioid withdrawal. “HELLO. ARE YOU EXERCISING YOUR PELVIC FLOOR?” a woman bellowed down the line. “Who is this?” I said. “I AM CALLING FROM THE WHITTINGTON HOSPITAL. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE DOING YOUR KEGELS. OK, BYE.”In France, pelvic floor rehabilitation is a cornerstone of postnatal care, with the government providing physio sessions. Here, a midwife with a list of numbers and a robust phone manner yells at you about your ruined vagina. I still think fondly of her. But I think if she had also told me to do two hours of exercise and develop a healthy sleep routine as well, I’d have “strongly encouraged” her to do something else with her phone.Look, I am not saying the advice isn’t important. As the professionals who have written this paper say, the postpartum period puts women at risk of all kinds of health problems, and is “a unique and critical window of opportunity to identify people at high risk for future chronic disease and to implement early interventions to improve lifelong health”. Of course it’s beneficial to become mobile as soon as possible after the birth, and to get as much sleep as you are physically able. New mothers know this. But they also know that achieving basic tasks, often in the absence of much support, can feel nigh-on impossible. Had I tried to develop their description of a healthy bedtime routine, I’d have basically been consigned to a dark room while my son did cluster feeding (and cluster pooing) for five hours. Is it any wonder I opted for binge-eating flapjacks in front of back-to-back Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy?When postpartum, in order to carve out time for exercise and sleep, you need a support system around you. You need visits from health professionals, an engaged partner who doesn’t go back to work after a mere two weeks, and your family around you (the paper acknowledges this, too). I was lucky enough to have this, and I still found it hard to find a moment for myself, so I can only imagine how hard it must be if you’re less supported. I expect these guidelines will just become another thing that many new mothers feel they are failing at, and the NCT agrees, saying that parents may find the pressure “overwhelming”.I’ve just been reading Becky Barnicoat’s brilliant and hilariousCry When the Baby Cries, a graphic memoir which vividly evokes those feverish, feral, fluid-soaked months after giving birth (she is an advocate, by the way, of achieving absolutely nothing as a survival tactic). There’s a part in the book where she goes for her postpartum doctor visit, six weeks after an emergency C-section, and he shames her for not doing exercise: “Most women like to get their bodies back as quickly as possible.” The following image, of her pushing the pram home with tears streaming down her face, viscerally captures the impact that a few unkind words can have on you at this time of deep vulnerability.Too many of us have had moments like these, when someone could have been kind, but wasn’t. When it comes to guidelines for new mums, far less thought seems to be put into the manner of delivery. Sometimes “advice” is delivered so cruelly that it stays with you for years afterwards. There are many things I wish for postpartum women: better healthcare, better support (like in the Netherlands), better paternity leave, often, sadly, better husbands. But most of all, I wish people were a bit nicer to them.What’s workingMy son has been enjoying the new trampoline his dad gave him for his third birthday, especially to a soundtrack of disco music. It confirms my belief that, when parenting feels tricky, a “vibe shift” can work wonders. I was feeling emotional and exhausted yesterday, but watching him bounce, grinning, to Le Freak, somehow made everything feel OK again.What’s notSeveral good friends are dealing with toddlers who run off, sometimes towards traffic. Reins are largely frowned upon by this generation of parents (one friend even received judgmental comments for using them in the vicinity of actual lions while at a safari park), but it got me thinking how they did perform quite an important safety function. Is it time to rehabilitate them, or at least be a bit more understanding of one another?Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingRepublic of ParenthoodFamilySleepHealth & wellbeingFitnesscommentShareReuse this content"

There are short-term electoral gains to be won, but risks in the long termFri 28 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 28 Mar 2025 09.12 EDTShareFor more than eight months now, since shortly after Labour won power, more and more people have been outraged by the government’s moves to the right. Starting with its decision to keep the Conservatives’ crueltwo-child benefit caplast July, the government has regularly given these critics reasons to feel shocked, betrayed or just disappointed.Fromdeportation videostoKeir Starmer’s declarationthat “I like and respect” Donald Trump, from repeated public sector cuts to the chancellor Rachel Reeves’s talk of “tearing downregulatory barriers” in this week’s spring statement, Labour has often behaved as if the boundaries between its supposedly centre-left politics and the politics of the right or even the far right have simply melted away.Even for the millions who have faithfully votedLabourfor decades, despite all the party’s flaws, compromises and defeats, Starmer’s premiership is turning out to be extremely, perhaps uniquely, difficult to believe in. The scale of his majority threatens to be matched by the scale of disillusionment.But are left-leaning Britons right to be so thoroughly disenchanted? Is this Labour government really that different from previous ones? And if so, exactly what kind of government is it?The last question is quite difficult to answer. In part, this is because the government has been so poor at explaining its overall purpose, despite many different attempts to do so, such as the spring statement’s promise of “an active government” that is “leaner and more agile”. Compared with the last time the party was in power, when New Labour consistently and effectively promoted its plan to modernise Britain, Starmer’s administration both explains itself too much and not enough.Why Downing Street has not hired or promoted better communicators by now is a mystery as baffling as what Starmer actually believes in. In 2020, according to Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund’s book on his leadership,Get In, Starmer told colleagues: “I don’t have any ideology at all. There’s no such thing as Starmerism and there never will be. I will make decisions one after the other.” Elected to parliament relatively late in life, and by his own admission more of a problem-solver than an original thinker or compelling speaker, Starmer is an incomplete politician, governing in an era of constant crises and public alienation, when even a more multi-dimensional prime minister would struggle.View image in fullscreenHarold Wilson in 1966.Photograph: Douglas Miller/Getty ImagesYet the hard-to-define quality of his government is also down to something else. Confusingly mixed in with all its rightwing policies are still a scattering of leftwing and green ones: improvingworkers’ rights, imposingVAT on private schools,nationalising railcompanies,removing the inheritance tax loopholefor farmers andpromoting clean energymore seriously than any previous British government. Most of these measures are on a smaller scale than their equivalents proposalsunder Jeremy Corbyn. But they remain more egalitarian, class-conscious and restrictive of capitalism than the policies of Tony Blair or Gordon Brown.In the latest issue of the centre-left journal Renewal, the historian Nick Garland, who wrote speeches for Reeves when she was shadow chancellor, sums up the Starmer government as “plain old Labour” – by which he means it is part of the pre-Blair tradition of Labour governments consciously building on each other, to make concrete, cumulative improvements to many lives.Garland’s argument is convincing, up to a point. While Starmer resists comparing himself to past prime ministers, as part of his effort to elude political definition, he does occasionally express admiration forHarold Wilson, the often derided but effective Labour social reformer of the 1960s and 1970s. And like postwar Labour politicians, Garland continues, the current cabinet “believes in the capacity of the state … partnered with the more dynamic elements of the private sector, to reverse economic decline and remedy Britain’s social ills”. Under Starmer, he concludes, Labour is getting back to what it does best: overseeing unspectacular but unifying national change.Rachel Reeves swears this is not a return to austerity. What matters is that it feels like one | Gaby HinsliffRead moreYet one problem with this interpretation is that it largely ignores Starmerism’s nasty side. His party’s relentlesspurges of leftwingersand contrasting reverence for reactionary voters are starkly different from Labour under Wilson, who treated the party as a broad church and promoted social liberalism.Another huge difference is in how the current government deals with financial pressures. Previous Labour premiers faced them, too, and sometimes imposed austerity policies, but the pain was spread much more evenly between the privileged and the disadvantaged. Under Wilson, there was briefly a combined income and investment tax rate of 98% for the highest earners. By contrast, Reeves and Starmer seem to have accepted the self-serving argument from big business and its many media champions that increasing taxes on the rich is both impractical and undesirable – even though many voters and many analysts of the long boom in elite wealth, such as Thomas Piketty, strongly disagree.So, rather than a revival of postwar social democracy, Starmer’s government feels more like an attempt to create a new political hybrid: part leftwing, part rightwing, intended to appeal to a much more fragmented, politically fickle, less generous country. This toughened-up Labour party prioritises “working people” over the poor, the arms industry and the City of London over the wider economy, and traditional patriotism over more nuanced expressions of British identity. Rather than confront rightwing populism, the government tries to co-opt some of its arguments, for example about the danger of “open borders”. More and more of Labour’s current policies seem designed to appeal to actual or potential Reform voters.Will this new political model work? Recent attempts by the centre-left to toughen up have failed in other countries, such as Germany and the US. So far, the signs are not promising for Labour, either, judging by the polls and its performance in government. Starmer’s confident periods as opposition leader, when he promised stable government, no scandals, an end to “sticking-plaster politics” and a politics that “treads more lightly on people’s lives”, seem a long time ago.These are still early days. By the next election, which may not be for four years, his austere, ambiguous government might have done just enough through its more patient policies to beat a divided opposition. Victory over the toxic politics of Reform and the current Tories would still be worth celebrating. But its price might be a Labour party that longterm supporters hardly recognise. And without them, it will become harder and harder to win again.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerRachel ReevesTax and spendingcommentShareReuse this content"

In my 50 years living in Istanbul, I have not seen as many so-called security measures on the streets as I have over the past few days.Taksim’s metro station and many of the city’s other busiest stations have been closed. The regional government has restricted car and intercity bus access to Istanbul. The police are checking incoming vehicles, and anyone suspected of travelling to the city to protest is turned away. Here and all over the country, televisions are permanently switched on so people can follow thelatest distressing political developments. For the past week, the Istanbul governor’s office has banned public protests and political demonstrations – rights enshrined in the constitution. Yet spontaneous unauthorised protests and clashes with the police have continued unabated, even though internet access has been restricted in an attempt to prevent gatherings. The police use teargas ruthlessly and have arrested countless people.Ekrem İmamoğlu: jailed rival to Turkish president who could emerge strongerRead moreWe wonder how such outrageous things could happen in a country that is a member of Nato and angling for EU membership. While the world is preoccupied with Donald Trump, with the wars between Palestine and Israel, Ukraine and Russia, what little remains of Turkish democracy nowfights for its life.The jailing of the president’s chief rival, a politician capable of gaining mass support, brings Erdoğan’s strong-fisted, autocratic rule to a level we have not seen before. İmamoğlu’s arrest came a mere few days before Turkey’s main opposition party was expected to formally nominate him as its presidential candidate during a primary. People for or against the government now largely agree on one thing: Erdoğan sees İmamoğlu as a political threat and wants to get rid of him.İmamoğlu has won more votes than Erdoğan’s own party, the Justice and Development party, in Istanbul’s last three mayoral elections. When İmamoğlu defeated the party’s candidate in the April 2019 election, Erdoğanhad the result annulled,citing technical irregularities. The elections were repeated two months later. İmamoğlu won again. Even more, he increased his margin. At the next round of local elections in 2024, after five years in office, İmamoğlu once again defeated Erdoğan’s party candidate and was elected mayor of Istanbul for the third time. İmamoğlu’s electoral track record and his growing popularity have made him the main opposition candidate who could successfully challenge Erdoğan at the next presidential election.The flip side to all this is that Erdoğan seems to be using the same playbook on his opponent as the one used on him 27 years ago. In 1998, Erdoğan was Istanbul’s elected mayor and a popular figure. The secular and military establishment deemed his brand of political Islam dangerous. He was alsoimprisoned and charged(in his case it was for inciting religious hatred after reciting a political poem at a rally). Erdoğan was removed as mayor and spent four months in prison.But his imprisonment and his defiant refusal to collaborate with the establishment and bow down to the repressive demands of the army helped further raise his political profile. As some commentators have pointed out, the jailing of İmamoğlu, who has denied the charges and is also promising not “to bow down”, might actually have the same unintended outcome. It could very well be helping to make the mayorall the more popular.View image in fullscreenPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan attends his party’s group meeting at the Turkish Grand National Assembly, Ankara, on Wednesday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesYet the situation isn’t quite the same. İmamoğlu is facing a deliberate and determined attempt to remove him from the running. The day before police were dispatched to İmamoğlu’s house, the pro-Erdoğan press and the Erdoğan-appointed rector of the University of Istanbul declaredİmamoğlu’s college degree invalid, citing alleged irregularities in his transfer from a private university. Since only university graduates are allowed to run for president in Turkey, this would disqualify İmamoğlu, who has said he planned to challenge the decision. The accusations of corruption and terrorism followed.The labelling of political opponents as terrorists is a tendency the Erdoğan government acquired after thefailed military coupof 2016, when a faction of the Turkish armed forces tried to take over. In 2019, when the Austrian author Peter Handke, who had been criticised for backing the late Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, was awarded the Nobel prize in literature, Erdoğan sternly opposed the decision. Caught unprepared and without a teleprompter, he declared that they gave the same prize to “aterrorist from Turkey!”, in apparent reference to my Nobel win in 2006. I had been due to fly back from New York to Istanbul that day, and I was just about to cancel my return when the president’s spokesperson announced that it wasn’t me the president had been referring to.A court steered by Erdoğan has now jailed İmamoğlu under corruption charges, but it did not press “terror” charges. Such a charge would have allowed President Erdoğan to install his preferred candidate in the role of mayor of Istanbul – a position his party has failed to win for three consecutive elections – and thus, some fear, he would be able to redirect some of the city’s endless stream of tax income into publicity and propaganda activities for his own party.‘It’s disinformation’: Turkish state TV avoids any coverage of mass street protestsRead moreIn jailing İmamoğlu, Erdoğan doesn’t just sideline a more popular political rival – he also seeks to get his hands back on a wealth of resources he hasn’t been able to touch for seven years. Should he succeed, the next presidential election will feature only Erdoğan and his candidates’ faces plastered over the city’s walls and illuminated municipal billboards.This is not a surprise for anybody who’s following Turkish politics closely. For the past decade, Turkey hasn’t been a real democracy – merely an electoral democracy, one where you can vote for your preferred candidate but have no freedom of speech or thought. Indeed, the Turkish state has strived to coerce its people into uniformity. Nobody is even talking aboutthe many journalistsand civil servants who have been arbitrarily jailed over the past few days, either in an attempt to add heft and credibility to the corruption charges against İmamoğlu or on the assumption that no one will pay attention with everything else going on.Now, with the arrest of the country’s most popular politician – the candidate who would have won a majority of votes at the next round of national elections – even this limited form of democracy is coming to an end. This is unacceptable and distressing, and that’s why more and more people arejoining the latest protests. For the time being, no one can foresee what will happen next.Orhan Pamuk is a writer and winner the 2006 Nobel prize in literatureDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In reality it means more emissions – and more profits for industryTim BuckleyThe opposition leader’s new national gas plan aims at increasing domestic gas production. But in reality that just means more subsidies for gas companiesGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastThu 27 Mar 2025 20.22 EDTLast modified on Fri 28 Mar 2025 00.50 EDTSharePeter Dutton’s newnational gas plansounds good in theory: force gas companies to supply more gas for domestic consumption, thereby reducing domestic gas prices by about 30%.But the reality is likely to be very different.Dutton is keen to ramp up domestic production. In practice this would mean billions in new taxpayer subsidies to fund new gas infrastructure, new pipelines, new gas storage and new gas power plants. This would take years and years to approve, build and develop, locking in fossil gas use for many decades to come.The multinational gas companies would be allowed to continue to feast at Australian energy users’ expense. More subsidies. More gas production and more carbon emissions. More profits for the long term!Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailDutton’s plan was unveiled as part of his budget reply speech on Thursday, in which he promised lower power prices under theCoalition.The centrepiece of the policy is to decouple the domestic gas price from international prices by forcing current exporters to direct 10-20% more gas into the domestic market. “This is all about ensuring Australian gas is for Australians.”Currently, 300 to 350 petajoules (PJ) of fossil gas supplies domestic use in eastern Australia every year. Meanwhile the multinational gas industry exports 1,500-1,600PJ annually, or 84% of total production. Currently all of this is sold at export price parity, meaning we pay as much or more as users in Japan pay for our gas. Under the change, Dutton says domestic gas supply will increase by 50 to 100 PJ. Sounds solid in principle.Battleground: the seats where the 2025 Australian federal election will be won and lostRead moreDutton claims: “This will drive down new wholesale domestic gas prices from over $14 per gigajoule to under $10 per gigajoule.” But Climate Energy Finance notes that for 50 years prior to 2015, the domestic east Australian gas price was just $3-4/PJ. Everything changed in 2015 when the gas companies contrived a domestic “shortage” by permanentlyincreasingproduction by 300% by opening up six LNG export trains concurrently in Gladstone, Queensland.Lowering the price 30-40% permanently to “just” $10/PJ to enable us to use our Australian public gas resources to supply our domestic needs first would be a good outcome. IF it could be delivered.But the reality will likely be very different.There is zero likelihood in our view that the Coalition will somehow find the political will to effectively regulate the multinational gas industry that is profiting at our collective ongoing expense. The industry is a major donor to both major parties, particularly the Coalition.Winning the election outright looks tough for Labor and the Coalition – their first goal is not to lose itRead moreDespite Dutton’s assurances, there are no new gas fields imminent, or even remotely ready to go. So when he says, “The only way to drive down power prices quickly is to ramp-up domestic gas production”, and effectively create a domestic gas reservation, thereby creating a buyer’s market for local fossil gas, I have some doubts. Opening up the massive stranded Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory will lock in a massive new gas reservoir of what will be really expensive gas exceptionally remote to Australian consumers.And there of course will be a massive quid pro quo.Dutton used his budget reply speech to reveal he would commit $1bn of taxpayer money to subsidise more gas pipelines and more storage capacity. And he will open up the Capacity Investment Scheme to subsidise more new gas power plants.General Electric has said there is amassive global shortage of gas turbinesand that anyone wanting one will have to wait till 2030. Last time I checked, 2030 is very different to “by the end of 2025”.With all this talk of gas, one has to wonder: what happened to the opposition’s nuclear plan?Tim Buckley is the director of ClimateEnergyFinance, a public interest thinktankExplore more on these topicsPeter DuttonOpinionCoalitionEnergyAustralian politicsAustralian election 2025commentShareReuse this content"

At least 144 people are reported to have been killed – a death toll that is certain to rise – while a state of emergency was declared in the Thai capital, Bangkok. There, eight people are confirmed to have died while dozens of construction workers are feared trapped after the high-risebuilding that they were working on collapsed. Further aftershocks are expected and will make the work of rescuers and those delivering humanitarian assistance in both countries harder.The earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.7, is the most severe to hit the region since 1956, which means buildings areunlikely to have been designedwith this threat in mind. The disaster could not have come at a worse time for Myanmar’s people, with more than 18 million already either displaced or facing hunger, according to theUN.In Rakhine state, 2 million people are at risk from famine, with the junta accused of inflicting “collective punishment” on them. An estimated 6.7 million children live in earthquake-affected areas, including the country’s second-biggest city, Mandalay, which is 17km from the epicentre. As this was a Friday, during Ramadan, many people are thought to have been crushed as busy mosques fell down.Four years after themilitary seized controlin a coup, fighting between the army and rebel groups, many of which support a parallel national unity government formed from remnants of the deposed National League for Democracy, make the election promised by the junta an alarming prospect. Last year an investigation by the BBC estimated that resistance groups, known as the People’s Defence Force, were in charge of 42% of the country’s landmass, with just 21% under the junta’s control. Elections held in such circumstances, partly at the urging of China, will not relieve the population’s hardships and there are fears of an intensification of the country’s civil war.The earthquake is another huge setback, just six months after many villages were destroyed and at least 226 people were killed in floods and mudslides caused byTyphoon Yagi. Now, as then, Myanmar’s isolated military rulers have requested international help. With Amnesty and others warning of the impact of US aid cuts on relief efforts, the EU and other countries must do all they can do ensure that life-saving food and medical supplies are delivered, along with the secure access being demanded by human rights organisations.An assurance from Zin Mar Aung, the top diplomat of the national unity rebels, that the People’s Defence Force will provide aid in the areas it governs was welcome. But efforts to coordinate support and channel resources will be fraught with difficulty. CentralMyanmar, including Mandalay, is run by the junta, meaning international aid efforts can be delivered there with its cooperation.To find out what is going on elsewhere, and get aid to less accessible areas, the UN and international donors will have to work with the local administrations that govern them. The junta cannot be allowed to control the flow of aid. By doing so, it could use the disaster to intensify its hold on power and the suffering of its opponents among the people of Myanmar.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You always hear about TV shows being absolutely heartbreaking but this is one of the first to actually leave me wanting to cry, but not knowing how. Shows always try to capture what teenagers are like, but they never get it as accurately asAdolescencehas. I could relate to some of the scenes, but Jamie and Eddie Miller really had an impact on me. Their struggles with anger are ones I’ve witnessed from people I’ve known. It was triggering because it was so accurate. I have a son who I adore and you never know what a child’s future is going to be like. You want the best for them. To raise them to succeed and be great, kind people. I don’t know how I’d feel if he did something like Jamie [did].Danielle, 20, Oxfordshire‘Society is constantly belittling and putting down young men’The larger issue is society constantly belittling and putting down young men (particularly young white men). Yes,Andrew Tateand ideas which degrade women are obviously bad, and young men do get exposed to it all sometimes. But they have been conditioned to feel guilty for who they are and this causes a crisis of identity, which can lead some men to embrace the extreme ideas of someone like Tate.Men don’t want to be told they are “toxic”. By constantly putting men down, society is driving young men to be influenced by people such as Tate, as they see no approval from anywhere in their life.Justin, 22, self-employed, Melbourne‘Not being on social media until senior year of high school was the best decision’‘Seeing the real-life effects of social media was chilling”’ … Calden.Photograph: Calden/Guardian CommunityIt was chilling to see a real-life look into the effects of social media and cyberbullying on my generation and the next. My parents didn’t give me an iPhone until 8th grade (when children are about 13 years old) and I didn’t get social media until senior year of high school (about 17 years old) – that was the best decision they ever made. I was bullied as a kid and I can only imagine the impact it would’ve had on me if I had been on social media at the same time.Calden, 21, student, Boston, Massachusetts‘I couldn’t take it seriously after the emoji conversation’The technical achievement and harrowing performances should be applauded, but at times I felt I could really tell that this programme was not written in consultation with the age group of the main character. The emoji conversation in episode two totally ruined my immersion in the show, and I found the rest of the programme difficult to take as seriously. Yes, young people do use emojis to communicate in code (as do adults!), but I have not come across a single person, internet result or Urban Dictionary post explaining that the “100” and “kidney bean” emojis might have a nefarious double meaning.Anna, 25, student, London‘It was a wake-up call to oblivious parents and teachers’View image in fullscreen‘It painted a harrowing reality’ … Anika.Photograph: Anika/Guardian CommunityI thinkAdolescencepainted the harrowing reality of today’s online world. I see people idolising Andrew Tate, spewing misogynistic rhetoric, and passing it off as a joke. The idea of victimising young boys, the “incels”, takes away their agency and pins the blame on “choosey” females. Even in my old school, the guys would comment on girls’ bodies, their intellect, and shame them, laugh at them and belittle them. The worst part was that they never realised the wrongness of their actions. But I don’t hate them. I grew up with these people; they are good people, but I pity them. They are young teens like us girls, and I hate that they have been subjected to such nonsense under the guise of truth. I think the show was a wake-up call to oblivious parents and teachers, and I hope it paves the way for real change. *Anika, 18, student,midwestern US‘I could have been radicalised by Jamie’I’ve been out of school for years now, but the issue is still the same. I nearly became an incel. I was a prime candidate: chubby, sensitive, a learning disability and the child of a particularly ugly divorce I was old enough to process. I could have been radicalised by Jamie. I recognised some of my old classmates in the show – all of them diagnosed with serious mental health issues, all of them medicated and with appropriate levels of care. It’s been heartening to see the incel issue finally be acknowledged by the government; the glaring omission of discussion around Jamie’s quite clear emotional and mental disorders, however, is extremely concerning. I worry that by blaming the violence exclusively on inceldom we risk reducing the violence to just another “culture war” topic, a political football to make arguments with.*Dan, 27, Kent‘Young people need to feel seen – they need us to acknowledge their pain’View image in fullscreen‘We shouldn’t shame this behaviour – we should understand it’ … Olivia.Photograph: Olivia/Guardian CommunityAfter watching the show, I found myself reflecting on what the character, Jamie, really needed. It became clear that his pain wasn’t about being the most attractive or popular – it was about not feeling enough, not feeling seen. Young people don’t always need an adult to tell them what is wrong with social media or what to be afraid of. They already know that. What they need is for us to acknowledge the pain they’re carrying, whether it’s from a friend betraying them, or from the crushing feeling that no one is paying attention to them. They need to know that their feelings are valid, and that it’s OK to hurt. We shouldn’t shame the behaviour that comes from these feelings; we should understand it, and work with it.Olivia, 21, works for a youth organisation,Bentleigh, Melbourne‘I’ve seen it first-hand – my ex-boyfriend got into Andrew Tate’I’ve seen it first-hand with boys falling down this pipeline, unfortunately – it’s scary how much someone can change because of it. I remember noticing it with my ex-boyfriend. We were both 16 at the time, and he and his friends started getting into Andrew Tate and spouting really toxic views. Within a few weeks we had broken up because he had started losing basic respect for me, while his friends started speaking about women as simply a hole and not much more. Around the same time, a friend of mine was getting death threats after she rejected a boy (who was known to be in the incel community at the time). Luckily, nothing ever came of it, but I remember her not bothering to go to our teachers since she thought they wouldn’t do anything, as he was perceived as a “good, misunderstood kid”.*Lydia, 19, sales assistant, Essex‘The lack of voice or perspective from the victims seemed a strange omission’View image in fullscreen‘The pressure on girls from misogyny should have been investigated’ … Joseph.Photograph: Joseph/Guardian CommunityThere is no question that the camerawork was technically very impressive, as was the acting. However, I was quite surprised that there wasn’t more criticism of the absence of Katie, Jamie’s victim, or her family, and with little depth given to her best friend who is only briefly seen. While the pressures on young men are obviously important to investigate, as is the pressure on women and girls from the resultant misogyny – and the lack of any voice or perspective from the victims seemed a strange omission.Joseph, student, Shropshire‘Unfortunately entirely accurate’Absolutely stunning and unfortunately entirely accurate. Kids are young but they’re the oldest they’ve ever been. And they’re consuming content aimed even older. In that gap is where insecurity, self-loathing and anticipation can really grow. Not to mention a whirlwind of hormones.*Jennifer, 23, works in marketing, Sydney‘It didn’t live up to the hype’View image in fullscreen‘The whodunnit tone felt confused to me’ … Rosie.Photograph: Rosie/Guardian CommunityI didn’t think Adolescence lived up to the hype. Episodes one and three were great, but episode two was awful and I didn’t finish the last one. The tone felt confused – even though the writers said that the show is not meant to be a whodunnit, episode two was still framed as one as it revolved around the search for the murder weapon. For this reason, it didn’t work at all for me. I think the show would have been much better if the tone was more consistent, and Jamie’s misogyny and how it led to violence had been explored further.Rosie, 21, student, Glasgow‘I’m just so scared of this social environment we’re in’I think it’s one of the most important shows for this age and generation. I thought it was really well done in actually exploring the harmful realities of social media and our online presence – and not in a “social media bad” kind of way. I have a younger brother who goes to an all-boys school and I’m constantly checking on what he talks about, what his friends do and what he’s looking at online. I even point out explicitly when it’s misogynistic or inappropriate because I’m just so scared of this social environment that we’re in. *Katie, 18, Sydney*Names have been changedIn the UK, the charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393 andChildlineon 0800 1111.

John was 16, Paul 14. Paul came to see John play with his skiffle group, the Quarry Men, at a village fete. Introduced afterwards, they almost immediately formed a connection that went beyond the bounds of normal male friendship.Lennon and McCartney were not sexual partners, as far as we know. But in every other sense, their relationship was a romance: intoxicating, tender and bittersweet. Passionate male friendships like this are rare, but not unique, and a remarkable number of them have changed the world, transforming our ideas about music, art, poetry and human nature. John and Paul were, without knowing it, part of an extraordinary lineage.After impressing John with his guitar-playing and his ability to remember all the words to a song, Paul accepted John’s invitation to join the Quarry Men. The pair began sharing the front of the stage; this was no longer just John’s group. They were fascinated by each other. Paul admired John’s coruscating wit and teddy boy swagger. John admired Paul’s musical abilities and pop star good looks. They made each other laugh more than anyone else they knew.View image in fullscreenWith a little help from my friend … John and Paul’s post-Quarry Men band the Silver Beetles in 1960.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesThey made for an odd couple: John spiky, full of bravado, prone to anger; Paul more temperate and socially subtle. But each thought the other the most brilliant person they knew and they shared a fierce ambition. On weekday afternoons, they would bunk off from school (for Paul) and college (for John) and go to one of their houses to play songs.Anyone who has shown someone their own creative ideas knows how terrifying it can be. Since they were writing in the idiom of pop, these were songs about feelings – desire, yearning, jealousy. Through music, John and Paul became vulnerable to each other. They allowed the other a glimpse of their soul.Friends remarked on how John and Paul seemed to be able to read each other’s mindsThe friendship was deepened by shared pain. Paul’s mother, Mary, died from cancer eight months before he met John. About a year afterwards, John’s mother, Julia, died after she was hit by a car. Later, McCartney said that while they didn’t talk much about losing their mothers, just knowing the other had been through the same thing brought them closer. It also reinforced a sense of being different from their peers – different and special.As their group, now with different members and a new name, conquered the world, the two remained tight. Friends remarked on how they seemed to be able to read each other’s minds and finish each other’s sentences.Their chemistry was inherently volatile. John liked to dominate any group he was in, Paul hated to be pushed around, both were strong-willed. John, whose childhood was marked by abandonment and uncertainty, felt increasingly insecure about the most meaningful relationship in his life. He became more reliant on drugs and found it hard to keep pace with Paul’s relentless productivity.View image in fullscreenAll you need is love … Yoko Ono, John Lennon and Paul McCartney in 1968.Photograph: Roy Cummings/THA/ShutterstockAs the 60s went on, they began to argue more. The partnership sparked as it splintered; that their tensions were creatively productive is evidenced by the remarkable evolution of the Beatles’ music. But when John and Paul got together with the loves of their lives –Linda Eastman, for Paul,Yoko Ono, for John – they found it hard to sustain their closeness. Finding themselves on opposite sides of an argument over the Beatles’ business affairs, they fell out bitterly.Both were disoriented and depressed by the rupture. But even when John recorded a vicious song about his former partner, entitled How Do You Sleep?, their relationship never felt exhausted. During the 70s, they exchanged messages of reconciliation and affection in songs, and gingerly re-established relations in person. While they found it hard to recapture the easy intimacy of their younger days, they never stopped being enthralled by each other.I don’t think we have ever quite understood the depth, significance or strangeness of this friendship. The two of them are talked about as mates, “brothers”, rivals and enemies. Yet to my mind they don’t fit into any of these prefabricated categories, which perhaps helps to explain why they were able to envisage new possibilities for music. This was an intense, platonic friendship between two men: loving, torrid, explosively creative. Friendships such as this have made a mark on cultural history several times. They seem more likely to be formed in the crucible of an artistic or intellectual revolution. It’s as if the intensity of the personal bond creates a kind of protected space where radical new ideas can incubate.View image in fullscreenGot to get you into my life … Paul and John in 1964.Photograph: William Vanderson/Getty ImagesWilliam WordsworthandSamuel Taylor Coleridgemet in 1795 when both in their early 20s (Wordsworth was two years older). They bonded over disappointment with the French Revolution and a love of hikes in the English countryside. Temperamentally, they were very different: Coleridge voluble, excitable, a brilliant talker, deeply insecure and prone to depression; Wordsworth more even-keeled, reserved and methodical. But they shared a vaulting ambition to remake the world through poetry.Wordsworth’s steadiness helped ground Coleridge; Coleridge’s enthusiasm energised Wordsworth. They critiqued each other’s work and planned poems. Out of this friendship came Wordsworth’s Lyrical Ballads, Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and a whole new movement in poetry. Over time, Wordsworth grew frustrated with Coleridge’s inability to complete projects and increasing dependence on opium. Coleridge felt judged and constrained by Wordsworth’s more disciplined approach, both to life and to poetry.They fell out badly after Coleridge found out that Wordsworth had criticised his character to their friend Thomas De Quincey. While they reconciled somewhat in later years, they never regained their former intimacy. By the 1830s, they could meet cordially, but the bright flame of their early friendship was gone. Coleridge never really got over the rupture, continuing to process it in his writing until his death in 1834.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But perhaps the closest analogy to John and Paul comes not from the arts but the social sciences. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky met in 1969 at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, forming the most productive partnership in the history of psychology (a story told in Michael Lewis’s book The Undoing Project). Their work revolutionised multiple fields, from economics to medicine, challenging fundamental assumptions about human rationality and decision making.They were very different: Kahneman self-doubting, pessimistic and quiet; Tversky confident and quick-witted. But their communion transcended these differences in personality. They would shut themselves away for hours before emerging with groundbreaking insights into decision making and judgment, often without being able to remember who had contributed what.View image in fullscreenThis boy … Paul and John in 1963.Photograph: Val Wilmer/Redferns/Getty ImagesTheir enthusiasm for their ideas couldn’t be separated from their enthusiasm for each other. This was a romance, a mutual absorption. “Their relationship was more intense than a marriage” said Barbara Tversky, Amos’s wife. “Just to be with [Amos],” Kahneman told Lewis. “I never felt that way with anyone else, really. You are in love and things. But I wasrapt.”The partnership became strained after they moved to North America to work for different universities, putting physical distance between them. Professional acclaim generated competitive tensions, and they had terrible rows over the phone. The friendship endured until Tversky’s death in 1996, but it was frayed.The Beatles’ singles – ranked!Read moreThere are several examples of intense male friendship in ancient texts. In Homer’s Iliad, Achilles and Patroclus have a bond so profound that when Patroclus dies Achilles is driven to inconsolable grief and murderous rage. In the Bible, the souls of Jonathan and David are said to be “knit together”. When Jonathan dies, David laments: “Your love to me was more wonderful than the love of women.”There is a strain of sadness to all these stories. Society finds it hard to categorise passionate male friendships, and the difficulty can be shared by the friends themselves. In Plato’s Symposium, Aristophanes describes how a pair of friends can be “lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy” yet unable to “explain what they desire of one another. For the intense yearning which each of them has towards the other does not appear to be the desire of sexual intercourse, but of something else, which the soul of either evidently desires but cannot identify.”Era-defining partnerships such as John and Paul’s exist in the space our culture struggles to name, neither friends nor lovers. Yet in that nameless space, new worlds are born.John & Paul: A Love Story in Songsby Ian Leslie is published by Faber.Explore more on these topicsBooksThe BeatlesJohn LennonPaul McCartneyextractsShareReuse this content"

As the devastating result hits the screen, the actor relives an extraordinary experienceFri 28 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTShare‘I’ve done any and all number of sexual situations in my 30-year career,” saysMichelle Williams, all matter-of-fact and puckishly charming. “But I’ve never masturbated on film before … and I was nervous. It’s much easier to portray mutual desire than just the desire for oneself. But God, whenLiz[Meriwether] wrote those scenes – when Molly’s alone in the hotel and by the end she’s masturbating to anything, masturbating to a fish in a bowl! – I thought: ‘Oh Liz. You’ve really done it.’”In Williams’s new show, Dying for Sex, she spends one entire episode masturbating – a staggeringly unusual thing for a woman to do on screen. Dying for Sex has a very simple premise, so grab-you-by-the-throat tragic that you’d almost take against it. Except it’s based on a true story, which wasmade into a podcast. Molly is 42, and in remission from a bout of cancer that has robbed her of the marital sex life that wasn’t all that anyway, when she gets the news that the cancer has come back, and is terminal. A palliative care nurse – brilliantly played by Esco Jouley – asks her about a bucket list. Her initial resistance gives way to the realisation that she’s never had an orgasm with another person, and that’s all she wants. So she leaves her husband to spend the rest of her short life chasing tail.I was astonished to find myself crying within 13 minutes. Williams tells me exactly the same thing happened to her when she listened to the podcast: “And I’m not a crier. Things don’t get to me. I’m thick-skinned, I’m experienced, I’m savvy. It takes a lot to break through that.” It’s a very straight-down-the-line description, and the opposite of how she looks, which is much younger than 44, wide-eyed, elfin. In so many of her roles, Williams enlivens a kind of protectiveness, which she then undercuts in some way – inDawson’s Creekit was with party-girl antics; inBrokeback Mountain, her Oscar-nominated turn, her vulnerability is both manipulative and tragic, as she ventriloquises the homophobia of her society; in Dying for Sex, everything is laced with bone-deep wit. “As soon as I had that reaction to the podcast, I thought: ‘Well, I’m sunk. Whatever this thing is, I’ve already emotionally signed on.’”View image in fullscreenClimactic scene … Michelle Williams as Molly in Dying for Sex.Photograph: Sarah Shatz/FXIt is an exquisitely affecting performance, but that’s not what’s radical about the show. First, it’s all the sex, “and we made this pre-All Fours. That book hadn’t come out yet. The world hadn’t been split wide open.” She’s talking about Miranda July’s semi (massively)autobiographical novel, which people call the first great menopause novel when it is actually (in my view) much more about female sexual appetite. In July’s telling, that appetite is immense and terrifying, can and will destroy anything in its path, particularly if what’s in its path is “marriage”. Anyway, Dying for Sex came first, and also kicks off with the protagonist leaving her partner. From there, Molly’s journey is as explosive as an Exocet missile. She discovers her inner dominatrix with a neighbour (played byRob Delaney) who doesn’t use the rubbish chute correctly, and gets there via a same-sex experiment with submission.But this is TV that’s also like Grand Theft Auto for cliches, casually shooting down norms and taboos like they’re defenceless passersby. The central female friendship is much more than a bit of sisterly support; Molly effectively swaps her husband for her best friend, Nikki (Jenny Slate), a charismatic, chaotic actor who already has amazing sex all the time. Jungians call this relationship the golden shadow – the friend who’s similar but excels you in some way you deeply value. The real-life Nikki Boyer worked with them on set, signing off the show’s embellishments – and it’s a gorgeous depiction of “that person [who] knows you in a wordless way, there’s no explaining, you’re not trying to woo, you’re not trying to impress”, but not idealised. Nikki is, as the abandoned husband Steve (Jay Duplass) constantly points out, the last person you want around when you’re having palliative chemotherapy. She can’t even reliably find her purse in her own handbag.Desire is a “portal” for Molly, says Williams, “and maybe that’s what moved us so much about it, is that she chose to see it as an opportunity – to gather something together and take it and imbibe it, own it, before she was divested of everything. She’s saying, I’m committing to this journey, and the only thing I’m taking with me is you, my best friend. I’m going to pursue my own pleasure in the midst of this illness, which is going to ultimately take my life and cause me a lot of pain. I’m going to continue to seek pleasure in this body, which is capable of both those things.”View image in fullscreenBed fellows … Jenny Slate as Nikki (left) with Williams in Dying for Sex.Photograph: Sarah Shatz/FXThen there’s the menopause, which Molly has chemically induced as part of her treatment plan (and says, plaintively, “I thought the one good thing about dying was that I wouldn’t have to go through the menopause”). It’s still high jeopardy, playing a woman experiencing menopause – like playing a grandmother, actors cross a Rubicon where they no longer get cast in younger roles. Williams shrugs the risk off, as if to indicate that she doesn’t worry about things like that. Much less so now, but omertà around talking about menopause at all was so strong until recently that a woman in her 40s might, as Williams describes, “never have had this conversation. Nobody had ever mentioned to me that this was in my future. Not my mother, not my grandmother, not a doctor.”The real Molly loved to take pictures of herself in hospital, says Williams. “She liked to buy beautiful lingerie, it made her feel great, and she would take beautiful photos of herself, hide her scars, send these selfies out, and communicate with strangers. When she was no longer able to have bodily encounters, she was still sexting from her hospital bed.”Another stunningly mould-breaking thing about Dying for Sex is that there’s a huge amount of affection and acceptance and delight between Molly and the people she sleeps with. It’s not because they’re in love – nobody’s trying to turn this into a romcom – it’s simply what’s liable to happen when people desire each other and are open about what they want. On the podcast, after Molly dies, Nikki speaks to some of her lovers and, Williams says, one of them responds: “‘She made me feel so seen, and like I was OK – like the things that I desired, there was no shame or judgment about them.’ I think there’s some connection there, between what illness does to her body, and what desire does to a body. Because bodies have a mind of their own. They do things without us wanting them to. They get sick without us wanting them to. They secrete things without us wanting them to. And desire can also work like that.”From certain angles, the cancer – as real and inexorable and based-on-true-events as it is – functions as a shortcut to utopia. “Could you live like this if you didn’t have a terminal diagnosis? Wouldn’t that be wonderful?” says Williams. At one point, she’s in an Uber with a guy, on their way to have sex, when it all gets too much for him and he prematurely ejaculates. “It isn’t making fun of him, it isn’t ‘How lame, what a disappointment’, it’s thrilling and exhilarating, just to radically accept people as they are.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If there’s a central theme, it’s sexual abuse. That’s why sexual fulfilment has eluded Molly to that point – she was abused by one of her mother’s boyfriends when she was seven: “She was split off from herself because of the abuse she experienced when she was a child. She still grew up, but a part of herself is frozen in time at that age – she’s in amber. I think that’s what she sets out to do, even though she doesn’t know that’s what she’s doing – the sexual journey is trying to repair the original wound while she still has time.”When she signed up for Dying for Sex more than three years ago, Williams discovered she was pregnant with her third child, her second with producer Thomas Kail (the father of her oldest daughter is Heath Ledger). “We toyed with the idea of using CG and painting out my stomach, but decided it would just be completely preposterous to do these scenes with a giant belly between me and my co-stars.” They had to wait, but that was fine because she really doesn’t work all that much, she says – this is the first thing she’s done since The Fabelmans, Steven Spielberg’s movie memoir. That looks like great confidence – the conviction to wait for something good, the courage to say no – but she bats that off. “No, it’s just having small children. I want to stay home with them.”I ask quickly about one of her other great roles: her 2014 Broadway turn as Sally Bowles in Cabaret – the musical about nightclub performers in 1930s Berlin as Nazism is on the rise. It felt as if that role really belonged to her, but “everybody feels like that”, she says. “Judi Dench used to say: ‘Oh, Sally Bowles? My part?’” It’s such a fantastic part, the tough-but-fragile, private-but-public siren, and no two actors ever play it the same way, and Williams brought a gaucheness and uncertainty that was truer to Christopher Isherwood’s book than the Liza Minnelli film. It must have been fun to do a production before there was so much actual fascism in the air, right? “I hope that a time comes when it loses its context,” she says, heavily. “I wish Cabaret didn’t feel so modern. I can’t wait for it to feel dusty.”Mmm, same. But such consolation to the turmoil of the world as ordinary life, sex and death can offer, Dying for Sex has in spades. One of the things that’s rarely said about dying, or the menopause for that matter, is that it might not be characterised by sadness or brain fog but by sexual voraciousness. “This is what the real Molly was facing – how is she going to use her body sexually when it’s failing her in so many ways? But she figures it out. Esther Perel [the psychotherapist] talks about sex as an antidote to death. What could make you feel more alive? I think a lot about that … If you want to continue to explore sexually through menopause, you need to become creative. If you want to explore sexually through illness, you need to become creative.”Dying for Sex is on Disney+ from4 AprilExplore more on these topicsTelevisionMichelle WilliamsDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Either you can slink off embarrassed and wait however long it takes for the furore to die down, or you can make an entire album about it.You probably don’t need to be told which option Smith took.The first plays of his new album Based on a True Story have started to air, and it’s starting to look like an awful lot of it is about the moment when he interrupted the Academy Awards to approachChris Rock, slap him, return to his seat and scream at Chris Rock, before winning an Oscar later and giving the most deranged speech in the history of the awards.According to Variety, the first track on the album – entitled Int Barbershop – Day – immediately addresses the slap. After the first words spoken on the album announce that “Will Smith is cancelled,” voices trade lines such as “Who the fuck Will Smith think he is?” and “I ain’t never going to forgive him for that shit he did.” Then Smith starts rapping, with lines like, “I heard he won the Oscar but he had to give it back / And you know they only made him do that shit because he’s Black,” and “Him and Jada both crazy girl, what you talkin’ bout ?/ You better keep his wife’s name out of your mouth.”The second song, You Lookin’ for Me? continues to elaborate on the subject, with the line, “Took a lot, I’m back on top / Y’all gon’ have to get acclimated / Won’t stop, my shit still hot / Even though I won’t get nominated.”What a lot of information to try to parse. On the one hand, Smith has every right to address what happened three years ago, it would almost be weird if he didn’t. To see him release another album of lightweight hip-hop that blankly refused to acknowledge that the slap ever happened would be baffling. It would be like, well, watching himdancing to Gettin’ Jiggy Wit Itat the Vanity Fair party hours after exploding his career in front of millions of people.On the other hand, would it be too much to ask for a little factual accuracy? While Smith did win an Oscar for King Richard on Slap Night, he was never actually asked to return it, although he was penalised in other ways. But then again, “I heard he won the Oscar but was subsequently banned from attending any events connected to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for a decade / Plus he voluntarily resigned his Academy membership andlater released a statementwhere he described himself as ‘deeply remorseful’ for letting everybody down on what should have been their big night” – probably lacks the syntax to become a memorable hip-hop track.Still, hopefully this draws a definitive line underneath the incident. After all, it took Rock a year to meaningfully comment on the slap, which he did during a blisteringly angry tirade at the end of his live Netflix special Selective Outrage, in which he reframed Smith’s loss of control as a reaction to Jada Pinkett Smith’s decision to publicly discuss the messy ins and outs of their marriage. And now Smith has had his turn, by admitting in song that he is unlikely to receive an Oscar nomination for his role in Bad Boys: Ride Or Die.Is that as good as a thorough, clear-eyed explanation of what still seems like a moment of dangerous instability? No. Is the acknowledgment particularly satisfying? No. Does it let Smith off the hook? Also no. But at least it’s something.All the parties have now had their say. And this means we can all detach ourselves from the slap and let it be what it is; the second weirdest thing to happen during theOscars, after Rob Lowe singing Proud Mary with Snow White. Finally, we can start the important work of taking the slap out of our mouths.Explore more on these topicsWill SmithOscarsChris RockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The winner of the Nobel prize for literature in 1920 is described by the London Review Bookshop as “a disturbing and darkly humorous masterpiece of existential fiction”, leaving many questioning if it mirrors Lochlan’s own deepening identity crisis.View image in fullscreenParker Posey’s character’s choice of F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Beautiful and the Damned is apt.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOMeanwhile, his mother, Victoria, played byParker Posey, has been reading F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Beautiful and the Damned.

They arewidely used by the popstar Taylor Swift, with her fans deciphering everything from lyrics to jewellery.The White Lotus creator, Mike White, has long been a fan of the technique. In the second series, for example, thetesta dimorobusts warn of a lover’s doomed fate, while a floral dress from the 1972 film The Godfather foreshadows the fate of Jennifer Coolidge’s Tanya. The characters’ holiday reads have played a key part in previous series. Jack Edwards, a social media influencer who describes himself as “the internet’s librarian” says that BookTok – a corner of TikTok devoted to reading – particularly enjoys discovering them. “It feels quite rewarding. I like that Mike White wants us to slow down and linger, giving us time to theorise and delve into the mise en scène.”View image in fullscreenSurrounded by Narcissists, the book choice of Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), is more on the nose than other reading choices.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOIn the new series, Chelsea (played by Aimee Lou Wood) is seen leafing through a book of poems by Rumi – the 13th-century Persian poet whose works explore love and spiritual reflection – as she lounges by the pool of a luxury hotel in Thailand’s Koh Samui. It’s fitting for a star-sign obsessed 24-year-old who believes her shady 50-year-old boyfriend, Rick (Walton Goggins), who is visibly irritated by her presence, is her “soulmate”.Meanwhile, the dynamic of the three female friends on a group holiday is writ large in their reading choices.Laurie (Carrie Coon) is reading Emma Straub’s Modern Lovers, a novel about a trio of friends grappling with ageing; the TV star Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) has brought along Barbra Streisand’s 992-page memoir to read by the pool; and perhaps most revealingly, the newly outed Trump voter Kate (Leslie Bibb) just scrolls on her phone. Other choices such as Belinda’s (Natasha Rothwell) book, Surrounded by Narcissists, are a little more on the nose.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The film industry is such a roiling combination of wealth, jealousy, fear and obliviousness that, when the right person decides to send it up, the results can be spectacular. Look at Sunset Boulevard,Barton Fink– or evenBowfinger– and you’ll see work that knows when to go for the jugular to inflict maximum damage.On the other hand, Hollywood satires can all too readily fall into the cliches they’re deliberately trying to send up. They’re romanticised. There are too many chummy cameos. They lose their nerve. Look atCharlie Day’s film Fool’s Paradise, or 1997’s An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn (a movie about the name used when a film is so bad the director wants to remove his name from the credits, which was in turn so bad that the real-life director removed his name from the credits). Or, you know, Entourage.The Studio review – Seth Rogen’s Hollywood satire is fast, furious and beautifully funRead moreApple TV+’s new comedy The Studio is full of the stuff that makes Hollywood satires bad. Every single famous person you can think of has a knowing, winking cameo. Every frame of every episode drips with so much money that you often find yourself drifting away from the plot to wonder how much some of the set-ups must have cost. Also, it’s made by Apple, for crying out loud. A tech company making a satire of a legacy medium that it wants to at best disrupt and at worst consume whole is an objectively queasy thing to do.Yet, despite all this, there are times during The Studio where you’ll be convinced it is one of the best things you’ll ever watch. Despite its conceptual flaws, it is breathlessly intelligent. When it picks the right targets, its takedown of Hollywood is as whip-smart and surgical as anything you’ve seen. It’s Entourage if Entourage was made by adults, in other words.View image in fullscreenAn industry in freefall … Olivia Wilde and Seth Rogen in The Studio.Photograph: APThe first episode is the best demonstration of this. In long, unbroken scenes we see Seth Rogen’s spineless studio executive flounder as his integrity repeatedly loses battles with his ambition. He wants to make intelligent films with visionary directors, but his boss (played by Bryan Cranston in full-blown 1970s porn star mode) will only promote him if he promises to make an official Kool-Aid film. He accepts, then ties himself in knots trying to figure out how to make an Oscar-winning movie about a talking jug of juice. He bullshits, delegates and begs with increasing terror as he tries to keep everyone happy, and yet the episode ends with a genuine Hollywood legend in tears.When it gets it right, The Studio is astonishing. Rogen, who created the show with his longtime creative partner Evan Goldberg, feels as if he’s using the show as a punchbag for all the frustrations he has encountered in his career. And that’s an awful lot of frustrations. You may remember the2014 Sony hack, where North Korea leaked an entire trove of Sony Entertainment’s emails, screenplays, salary details and future plans as revenge for Rogen’s film about the assassination of Kim Jong-un. Sony head Amy Pascal stepped down as a result, and I’ll eat my hat if Catherine O’Hara’s character in The Studio isn’t wholly based on her.The Studio: Seth Rogen’s triumph of a Hollywood satire is absolutely stuffed with career-best actingRead moreAnother thing that The Studio has working in its favour is the timing of it. Hollywood really does face an existential threat at the moment. Theatrical viewing still hasn’t recovered since Covid, films that would have been stone-cold blockbusters a decade ago are flopping for no reason, and film as a medium is losing eyeballs to everything from YouTube to TikTok. Although it doesn’t linger on this as much as its trailer suggests, a thick seam of The Studio is given over to depicting an industry in freefall. There’s a real panic in the air, and one of the show’s greatest strengths is how keenly it captures that panic.Which isn’t to say that it’s perfect. When the momentum of the pilot starts to slow, it can become creaky in places. One episode, a grinding noir pastiche about the death of film stock, of all things, felt genuinely interminable. But nevertheless, The Studio gets much more right than it gets wrong. If Hollywood really is dying, there’s a very good chance that future generations will use this as an artefact to learn exactly what killed it.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionFilm industryApple TV+Seth RogenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ingram wore a white ballgown. “We were all just teenagers,” she says of her debutante cohort. “It was fun for us, and we made a whole lot of new friends.”Ingram had just left school. She was born in the country town of Cowra in central-west New South Wales, but like many Aboriginal people made the trek to Redfern, seeking employment opportunities among the kinship of extended family. “You’d get out at Redfern station and go to the Empress hotel – because that was the only pub that would allow Aboriginal people in – and say, ‘I’m looking for my cousin’,” she laughs.“Usually, landlords wouldn’t rent to Aboriginal people, so the ones lucky enough to rent would take all their cousins in. That’s why the houses were so full.”View image in fullscreenNorma Ingram, pictured at the Belvoir St theatre rehearsal rooms.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianThe deb ball was set up by theFoundation for Aboriginal Affairs, which held dances at Redfern Town Hall and concerts each week at its cultural centre in George Street. On Sunday nights an Aboriginal band,the Silva Linings, performed, and anyone else with musical talent was allowed on stage. Ingram and three friends – Marjorie, Bertie and Jimmy – would jump into the spotlight and “go-go dance” to entertain the throng.Nakkiah Lui and Miranda Tapsell on 'tearing down another statue': the debutante ballRead moreIngram’s granddaughter, Gumbaynggirr/Wiradjuri playwright and actor Dalara Williams, recalls listening to her nan and aunties share tales of dancing and laughter. “Even in the world of segregation, they found time to dress up and go to dances in places theywereallowed to go in,” she says. In the face of racism, “they still found joy connecting and holding on to each other”.Their stories inspired Williams’s playBig Girls Don’t Cry, making its premiere at Belvoir St theatre in April, about three young Redfern women (one of whom, Cheryl, she will play) who seek their own joy at a deb ball in 1966.Williams understands the power of joy as resistance. Born in 1989, she grew up on The Block – a historic site of activism in Redfern – “raised and surrounded by single Black women”, with her younger sister Jacinda. She attended the childcare centre Murawina (meaning “black woman”), which her grandmother helped set up in the early 1970s – the same era in which Redfern became home to Australia’s first Aboriginal-owned and controlled legal and medical services, and the trailblazingNational Black Theatre.View image in fullscreen‘How do we pour love into each other, to keep going?’… Dalara Williams.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianWilliams, like her nan, still lives in Redfern. Looking back across her life there she recalls police brutality and the unrest following thedeath of teenager Thomas “TJ” Hickeyin 2004, and laments the ongoing gentrification pushing Indigenous people out of the area – which she calls “the second coming of colonisation”. In the face of this, Aboriginal people are “really good” at finding joy, she says.“If we kept pouring hatred or frustration and anger towards a group of people that don’t want us, we would be burnt out,” says Williams. “And so how do we pour love into each other, to keep going?”Seated next to her nan at Belvoir’s rehearsal space and listening to her talk about her experiences as a young woman in Redfern, Williams admits to mourning the loss of the weekly inner-Sydney Indigenous socials of the 1960s. “Where are those spaces now, those gathering places for Indigenous people to mingle and mix?” she asks. “There needs to be spaces for dancing and gathering that kind of energy, rather than just sitting around a pub. That engagement needs to be intergenerational, across Elders and teenagers, and not just an annual festival or event.”Williams’s most joyful childhood memories include her mum inviting cousins and their babies over to their house on The Block for nights of painting at the kitchen table, listening to music.View image in fullscreenWilliams hopes her new play will fill a gap in ‘sisterhood stories’.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianMany old terraces have since been torn down at The Block, but Redfern Park, site of prime ministerPaul Keating’s 1992 speechacknowledging the damage done by colonisation, remains a gathering ground for Aboriginal joy and protest, including in the lead-up to the 2023 referendum for anIndigenous voice to parliament.On adjoining hallowed ground, in 2013, Williams’ mother Lisa was elected the first female president of the Redfern All Blacks rugby league team, and Williams has “great memories of how much a gathering ground” the oval was during Sunday football.Williams studied in Redfern, too: at Eora Tafe, founded in 1984 (as the Eora Centre for the Visual and Performing Arts) by playwright Robert Merritt, author of The Cake Man, the first full-length play by an Indigenous Australian to be professionally produced. It was there that Williams met fellow actor-turned-playwright Megan Wilding, for whom she wrote the role of Queenie, one of the three young women at the centre of Big Girls Don’t Cry.Having also studied Aboriginal theatre at Waapa in Perth and acting at Nida in Sydney, Williams hopes her new play will fill a gap in “sisterhood stories” and stories about “the blackness I know, only taught in the city”.She cannot see herself leaving Redfern – at least not permanently. “Aboriginal people have not disappeared; you can walk down Redfern Street and still connect with Aboriginal people there,” she emphasises.“I really think people don’t understand how special Redfern is to the Aboriginal community here. It’s not just another suburb. The roots run deep.”Big Girls Don’t Cryruns 5-27 April at Belvoir St theatre, Sydney.Explore more on these topicsAustralian theatreIndigenous AustraliansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The names kept coming with metronomic regularity: Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Anthony Mackie (Captain America), Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Letitia Wright (Black Panther), Simu Liu (Shang-Chi) – each new label slapped on to the backrest by some unseen intern just off camera. This was internet performance art as corporate spectacle.Five solid hours of vacant upholstery, culminating in Robert Downey Jr, who will play Doctor Doom in the new film, appearing just long enough to gesture for silence, as if warning the universe never to speak again of the utter boredom of what they had just witnessed. The sheer, glacially paced anticlimax of it all was so profound it almost achieved a state of absurdist nirvana.If we did learn anything from this hyper-extended cinematic seance, it was that the studio hasn’t yet decided whether Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch or Brie Larson’s CaptainMarvelwill be taking a bow in the first new Avengers film in six years, but has inexplicably decided to bring back almost the entire main cast of the 2000s X-Men movies, including Patrick Stewart’s Professor X, Ian McKellen’s Magneto, James Marsden’s Cyclops, Kelsey Grammer’s Beast and even Rebecca Romijn’s take on Mystique. Moreover we’re also getting Channing Tatum’s Gambit, despite the latter only ever having starred in imaginary films conjured by hastily written press releases buried deep within the pages of Variety (bar that weird bit in Deadpool & Wolverine).Whether these inter-studio interlopers – the X-Men used to be part of 20th Century Fox’s superhero pantheon before Disney bought it – will end up as more than glorified cameos remains to be seen. Either way, it’s certainly a strange mix of seen-it-all-before and not-quite-sure-who-these-people-are. The Fantastic Four (Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Joseph Quinn) will also be taking part, as will the entire cast of Thunderbolts (Sebastian Stan, Florence Pugh, Wyatt Russell, David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen and Lewis Pullman), despite the fact that we’ve not yet seen either of these films.By the time the Russo brothers actually get this thing into cinemas in 2026, we’ll have a much better idea of whether this sprawling nostalgia-bait mashup is a masterstroke or the cinematic equivalent of throwing darts at a board covered in headshots. In the meantime, Marvel is floundering around in the dark, like a drunken octopus trying to put on a sweater.View image in fullscreenClimatic masterstroke … (from left) Brie Larson, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans in Avengers: Endgame.Photograph: Marvel Studios\\Disney/AllstarThe bright side is that the Russos, despite doing nothing of note since Endgame, have been here before. We’re about to find out whether their remarkable Avengers double header was a cosmic fluke fuelled largely by the immaculately planned movies that preceded it, or whether they’ve genuinely cracked the code for making three-hour character pile-ups that somehow feel like tightly choreographed cinematic symphonies.Perhaps this intensely wearisome live stream thing was, after all, just a cunning ruse to bore us all into extreme tedium before the real spectacle begins. Maybe, just maybe, Doomsday will be the greatest multiversal orgy of shameless nostalgia since No Way Home. And if it’s not looking that way yet, all Marvel needs to do is bring back Lou Ferrigno’s shirtless, green Hulk and Mickey Rourke’s Ivan Vanko and we’ll probably all forget we ever doubted them.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekMarvelSuperhero moviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You have to be relatively healthy to do that. If she had gone, she would have gone months before she would have died here.”Rantzen, alongtime supporter of assisted dying, was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer in 2023. She was thought to have just weeks to live, but last year started using a “wonder drug” that helped her survive against the odds.When asked if her mother was “still improving”, Wilcox said: “I really wish that was true, but I don’t think that’s the case any more.”View image in fullscreenRebecca Wilcox, Rantzen’s daughter.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianNews of Rantzen’s deteriorating health comes in the same week that theassisted dying bill was pushed backuntil 2029, creating a delay that supportive MPs fear could mean the change of law is never realised.In November last year, the television personality told MPs “my time is running out”, but the issue was one “the public care desperately about”,and said it might not be debated by MPs for another decade if the legislation did not pass.Responding to the bill’s delay, Wilcox said: “I just wish that people understood that all the assisted dying bill is, is choice for people that want it.“All it is, is giving you peace of mind and that peace of mind, I cannot tell you how powerful that would be right now for my mum.”She said she had watched her mother suffer “trauma” over the uncertainty of her deteriorating health.“The fact that she doesn’t know how her death is going to happen, how the pain is going to progress, the exhaustion, the fatigue, what symptoms are going to come in,” she said.“She is a person who has fought her whole life for other people, and she has no control now. Why can’t we give people like my mum with a terminal diagnosis, with no other choice, some choice as to when and how and where they die?”Earlier this week Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP piloting the assisted dying bill through parliament, proposed the delay, meaning the initial timeline of two years for implementing the law will now stretch to four.The delay marks the latest major change to the assisted dying proposals, which have proven contentious in the Commons and beyond.A spokesperson for Leadbeater said she “hopes and believes the service can be delivered more quickly”, but that the changes made to the bill since last autumn meant it would “inevitably take longer to implement”.On Tuesday, the Isle of Man’s parliament approved a bill to legalise assisted dying, making it the first place in the British Isles to introduce the change.Explore more on these topicsEsther RantzenAssisted dyingCancernewsShareReuse this content"

Now he has criticised a statement issued by the Academy to its members on Wednesday, in which it appeared to defend its silence.The statement, signed by the Academy chief executive, Bill Kramer, and president Janet Yang, did not refer to the attack or mention Ballal or his documentary.‘It was revenge for our movie’: Oscar winner says soldiers helped settlers attack him in West BankRead more“The Academy condemns harming or suppressing artists for their work or their viewpoints,” the statement read. “We are living in a time of profound change, marked by conflict and uncertainty – across the globe, in the US and within our own industry. Understandably, we are often asked to speak on behalf of the Academy in response to social, political and economic events. In these instances, it is important to note that the Academy represents close to 11,000 global members with many unique viewpoints.”Posting a screenshot of the full statement on Xon Thursday, Abraham criticised the Academy for failing to name Ballal.“After our criticism, the Academy’s leaders sent out this email to members explaining their silence on Hamdan’s assault: they need to respect ‘unique viewpoints’,” he wrote.Abraham compared it to a “rightfully strong” statement made by the Academy in 2011 when the organisation condemned the arrest of six Iranian filmmakers by the Iranian government, including the detention of director Jafar Panahi.The Academy did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.Ballal, one of the documentary’s four directors – all from Israel and Palestine – was released from Israeli detention on Tuesday.Hetold the Guardianthat he “thought I was going to die” when Israeli soldiers had aided the settlers who attacked him on Monday outside his home in the village of Susya, in the Masafer Yatta area of the West Bank.Hamdan Ballal: Oscar-winning Palestinian director released from Israeli detentionRead moreBallal told the Guardian he was beaten while in detention.“It was a revenge for our movie,” he said. “I heard the voices of the soldiers, they were laughing about me … I heard [the word] ‘Oscar’.”No Other Land won the Oscar for best documentary less than a month ago, at a ceremony in Los Angeles.Earlier this week Basel Adra, another of No Other Land’s directors, told the Guardian he thought the film’s international recognition might havespurred escalating settler violence in Susya.“Palestinians in the village have been under physical attack by settlers almost daily. The settlers’ violence is increasing here. Maybe it’s a revenge for the movie and the Oscar,” he said.Explore more on these topicsFilmOscarsWest BankIsraelPalestinian territoriesDocumentary filmsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Abracadabra! There’s barely a trad circus trick missed in this one-woman puppet show, first seen in 2022, with its red and gold trimmings, accordions a-go-go and Tardis-like top hat. That vintage vibe, perfectly suiting the atmospheric Little Angel, includes the performing animals introduced by George the ringmaster (Lizzie Wort, who co-wrote and devised with director Miranda Pitcher).We behold lions, tigers and monkeys that George says – a little too nostalgically – once did stunts with the show. They have been replaced by jumping fleas and playful mice although this reformed spectacle with pet-friendlier tricks rather queers its pitch by then including bunnies who apparently ride bikes. The big finale is a canine spin on aSavitsky Cats-style routine.Aimed at children aged two to five, it’s a jaunty, 45-minute whirl boosted by some lively rhymes, Wort’s warm approach (matched by Sherry Coenen’s lighting) and a bouncy score from Julian Butler. Neither this circus’s hazy backstory nor the trifling plot pull you in: it’s about the carousel of acts, most featuring attractive puppets designed by Lyndie Wright (including a cheery clown) and some involving participation from the audience. Wort does particularly well with one young volunteer who appears to have second thoughts when in the spotlight.View image in fullscreenWarm welcome … Lizzie Wort in Little Angel Theatre’s Miniature Travelling Circus.Photograph: Ellie KurttzThe attention to detail impresses: a ruffing dog wearing a ruff, the sparkly eyed Miss Scratchy Cat with a luxuriously fluffed-up tail, a stamped addressed envelope handed to an audience member with a flea in their hair, for them to return the insect at their leisure. Some of the designs are too teeny to fully appreciate, at least from my row, but there is a marvellous big top that pops up inside a book, designed by Vicki Fullick, and a carefully strung thread of mini-bunting. Pitcher’s set and costume design have a bygone charm and, while it lacks a real wow moment, this whimsical show has plenty of nice touches.At theLittle Angel theatre, London, until 19 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreCircusPuppetryLittle Angel theatreMagicChildren's theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

A genre swerve on the collab front, but all the while, Cunningham stays true to their own path as a creator of very formal, understated dance that invariably piques your curiosity.In Crow, Samson is installed behind a mixing desk on the vast Sadler’s Wells East stage, playing bubbling electronics, fizzy sounds and pulsating bass. Cunningham and dancer Harry Alexander meanwhile are dressed in long boots and short dresses, warming up with a strut. Crow is inspired by queer American composers Pauline Oliveros and Julius Eastman and a particular (undocumented) performance of theirs from the 1970s. Cunningham takes the idea of outsiders and marginalisation, and compares it to birds living in hostile urban spaces. At one stage the three performers gather and turn an inquisitive and accusatory stare on the audience; it is very much like being eyeballed by a gang of crows.With their mastery of the body’s geometry, their skill for the precision control of exacting choreography, Cunningham and Alexander are two of the most zen-like, brilliant dancers. You can see them watching each other, sometimes mirroring, sometimes chasing an idea round the stage. There’s bemusement and seriousness, rigour and play, details like the slide of a toe along the ground in sync with two falling quavers in the score that gives the effect of a question mark, or a raised eyebrow. It’s an avant-garde delight.Pigeons features five dancers and is set to Eastman’s 1980 piece Gay Guerilla, the sound of several pianos layering up the same chord. It’s music that expands and shifts while staying on the spot. The dancers, however, are always moving, in unison, canon or counterpoint; they cluster and part, like pigeons do, performing their very particular footwork, motoring on by their own logic. It’s mildly hypnotic. Cunningham was a longtime dancer with the legendary Merce Cunningham (no relation) and you can’t help but spot the link with Merce’s BeachBirds, performed last week as part of the Dance Reflections festival, just shifted into Jules’ own world, own time.AtSadler’s Wells East, London, until 28 March.

It is a visceral, immersive, often skull-splittingly loud film; real-time action with a found-footage aesthetic, featuring opaque technical dialogue and eerily ice-cold quiet moments seen from the aerial reconnaissance computer screen, with murmuring detached voices audible.Warfare really does show the punishing boredom of a soldier’s life. But it is weirdly obtuse and self-congratulatory, the shock of its ending softened by some bizarrely misjudged material over the closing credits, showing pictures of the actors next to their real-life counterparts and even showing home-movie type footage of these soldiers now beamingly hugging the stars. It’s as if Garland and Mendoza finally felt the need to pull out to reveal the bigger picture, and found only a reality TV show.In 2006, an American unit with two Iraqi scouts is moved under cover of darkness into a residential area of Ramadi province, ruthlessly taking over two apartments and ordering the terrified civilian occupants to stay in a bedroom and keep quiet; they knock a discreet hole in the wall and set up a sniper-surveillance position from which to give cover for a ground-troop operation. The team includes Ray himself (D’Pharoah Woon-A-Tai), commanding officer Erik (Will Poulter), sniper Elliott (Cosmo Jarvis), MacDonald (Michael Gandolfini) and Sam (Joseph Quinn). While Elliott does nothing but gaze through his gun-sight, minutes and hours of tense silence drag by as the men, with muscular professionalism, stay at a level of hyper-alertness. One drags his fingertip across a dusty surface, looks at it, looks up, drops his hand, thinks about something else. There is no old-school stuff about the guys in a quiet moment looking up at the stars and talking to each other about what they’re going to do when the war is over.But when Elliott has to lay his sniper rifle down for a moment and stretch his legs, a less experienced and less competent guy has to take over and fails to take out a jihadi with a weapon across the street. The insurgents are close by and the unit is in danger; they lose air cover, the tank that was supposed to be taking them away is blown up and there is carnage. One man even slips on the fragment of a severed leg in the road scrambling back into the apartment building after the aborted evacuation.In some ways, Warfare is like the rash of war-on-terror pictures that appeared 20 years ago, such asKathryn Bigelow’s The Hurt LockerorNick Broomfield’s Battle for Haditha, or indeedBrian De Palma’s interesting, underrated film Redacted. But Warfare doesn’t have the anti-war reflex and is almost fierce in its indifference to political or historical context, the resource that should be more readily available two decades on. There is almost no conventional narrative progression: Erik gets rattled and has to cede command to someone else, but it makes no real difference to the dramatic shape, the white-noise blizzard of chaos. Similarly, the two Iraqi scouts become scared when they realise that they are to be the first out of the door for the planned evacuation, but there is no real tribal division between them and the Americans. Periodically the men will radio for a “show of force” to keep the jihadis at bay: a fighter plane whooshing terrifyingly low along the street leaving behind an eardrum-pulverised silence which scours the screen of thought.And those civilians? They have an odd role to play in those weird photos over the final credits. Some of the real-world soldiers have their faces blanked out, presumably due to ongoing security considerations. But the film also shows a picture of an Iraqi family, evidently the occupants of the house, with their faces blanked out as well. Because … Garland and Mendoza tried to locate these people and ask for their memories too? And were unable to find them? Maybe. But they just remain blank – and irrelevant. The movie is its own show of force in some ways, surely accurate in showing what the soldiers did, moment by moment, though blandly unaware of a point or a meaning beyond the horror.Warfare is out on 11 April in the US, 17 April in Australia and 18 April in the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsWar filmsIraqAlex GarlandWill PoulterUS militaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Staged in the Italianate surrounds of Shoreditch town hall, Tales of Apollo and Hercules was full of astute cross-references from one work to the other.Guthrie and choreographer Valentino Zucchetti have wedded Handel’s 1710 Italian cantata Apollo e Dafne with the 1751 English oratorio The Choice of Hercules to create a nifty two-act opera-ballet, that singularly French baroque concoction that never really took off in England. Witty, at times slyly knowing, it juxtaposes the myth of Apollo’s rapacious pursuit of the nymph Daphne with a tug of war for the moral wellbeing of the boy Hercules. Five soloists, a clarion-voiced chorus of 15, six sinuous dancers from New English Ballet Theatre, a pair of black-clad puppeteers and the exuberant period forces of La Nuova Musica under David Bates did the rest.Staged in front of a half-draped classical landscape, Apollo e Dafne was reimagined through the lens of 1960s office politics. Apollo, the heroically rich-toned Dan D’Souza, was a swaggering Don Draper with his predatory eye on Lauren Lodge-Campbell’s sweet-toned Dafne. The music, full of catchy arias that Handel would recycle later in his career, was crisply finessed by Bates, with solo musicians popping up all around the space adding to the immersive effect.View image in fullscreenTales of Apollo and Hercules at Shoreditch town hall.Photograph: Craig FullerFrancisco Rodriguez-Weil’s elegant-yet-simple designs wrapped the dancers in glittering grey unitards that turned magical shades of green or blue under Emma Chapman’s subtle lighting. Flitting round and about the singers, they brought to life a cornucopia of images, from the writhing python slain by Apollo to a rainy street scene with twirling umbrellas that morphed into carriage wheels. Zucchetti’s bustling, sunny choreography channelled classical ballet and Hollywood musicals with a subtle nod here and there to the baroque.The Choice of Hercules added a childlike puppet into the mix, a torso with head and arms which, thanks to the “invisible” ministrations of Tabitha Bingham, Ellie Peacock and countertenor James Hall, conveyed curiosity, fear and even astonishment. The dancers here were more postural, less a vital part of the narrative, but never less than watchable.Musically, it was a grander, statelier affair, Bates rising incisively to the occasion and with celebratory trumpets and horns generating some extra oomph. Dramatically, however, it was a bit of a one-trick pony, a tussle back and forth for the puppet’s attention between artful, flighty Pleasure (nimble soprano Madison Nonoa) and stony-faced, moralising Virtue (velvety mezzo Bethany Horak-Hallett). Either way, the laurels went to the supple, burgundy-toned Hall, whose generous alto nailed the show’s big hit, Yet Can I Hear That Dulcet Lay.Tales of Apollo and Hercules is atShoreditch town hall, London, as part of the London Handel festival, until 29 MarchExplore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

The episodes ofAlfred HitchcockPresents were half-hour nuggets from his chilling imagination – cautionary tales of adultery, crime and comeuppance, bookended by his own wry commentaries.The series gripped American and British audiences alike with its killer twists. If only that were the case with this musical homage composed by Steven Lutvak, with a book by Jay Dyer.Directed by John Doyle, it plays out in a TV studio, complete with giant spotlights and a blockish period camera, roving across a monochrome set, co-designed by Doyle and David L Arsenault, which at least looks the part.But the master of suspense is missing – and so is the suspense. There is no commentary, only Hitchcock’s signature “Good evening” set to song, before a melange of stories reprise numerous episodes, including Lamb to the Slaughter, in which a police officer’s wife (Scarlett Strallen) kills her husband after he says he is divorcing her, and The Woman Who Wanted to Live, about the seduction of a runaway prisoner who holds a character (Jade Oswald) at gunpoint.View image in fullscreenToo brief for intrigue to build … Sally Ann Triplett.Photograph: Manuel HarlanThere are so many more scenarios thrown in, such as a daughter controlled by her overbearing mother and gay lovers plotting a random murder. The focus does not stay on any of them for long but switches from one story to the next so quickly you lose the thread at times. They are too brief for intrigue to build. Not even the strong singing of Nicola Hughes,who plays a disgruntled lover, or Sally Ann Triplett, as a wild-haired babysitter, can save this production from confusion and cliche.It looks as if Hitchcock’s stories have been put in a blender and are swirling around on stage. These morsels do not amount to much, the twists lack punch and the songs try hard to introduce some psychology but are fairly bland although there is one belter at the end, What Everybody Wants.It is hard to understand what this musical seeks to do. A jumbled medley of too many of Hitchcock’s episodes, it does not have the impact of any one. “What makes a story work?” the cast sing at the beginning. Not this.AtTheatre Royal Bathuntil 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsTheatre Royal BathAlfred HitchcockreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the first story, a boy is abducted from his family to work for Isis. Tests on sharia law penalties are easy – the answer is usually “death” – but the work is hard: “[he] picked up the commander’s head, put it in an empty flour bag”. Meanwhile, a woman becomes an Islamic State bride after closing her pharmacy down (“she could no longer tolerate Islamic State people interfering in her work and asking for Viagra”). In another story, a refugee goes to a city in an unspecified “North”, where anger boils over after two refugees rape a girl. “I found a Facebook page called ‘Refugees Welcome in Sololand’, with just 34 followers.” In the third, a young dreamer is tasked with running an email account so the local religious leader/militia commander can communicate with his “female admirers”. Blasim’sprevious collectionwasaward-winning: this one should be, too.View image in fullscreenOn the ClockbyClaire Baglin,translated by Jordan Stump(Daunt, £9.99)French writer Claire Baglin’s autofictional debut takes its inspiration from her own experiences of the workplace. The narrator gets a job at a fast-food restaurant. It’s a world of paradox: an entry-level gig requires a competitive interview process (“He’s expecting me to talk about the honour of joining a team”); the work is both stressful and dull, with customer demands well above her pay grade. “No no that’s not a piece of fingernail in your salad, it’s the end of your wooden fork.” Scenes of her time there alternate with memories of a working-class childhood: her father’s exhaustion after his factory shift work; the family apartment where the walls are so thin they can hear their neighbour’s parrot saying “Sarkozy sucks”; her shame after visiting a friend’s posh house. The message, of social immobility, is stark but delivered with energy and charm; and there is some room for hope. At work, “I dream that someone’s whispering in my ear it’s time, you can go now.”View image in fullscreenNothing Grows By MoonlightbyTorborg Nedreaas,translated by Bibbi Lee(Penguin Classics, £12.99)Life “hooks you like a claw every time you think you’re safe”, declares the protagonist of this novel, first published in Norway in 1947. “Well, now the claw has come to stay.” She’s a woman in love with an older man. When he invites her home she’s “dizzy with craziness”; when he rejects her, “my lips and cheeks turned cold and then the rest of me, little by little”. She becomes enraged by the way women suffer: her sister’s loveless marriage; her mother’s compliance with her own discontent. An operatic intensity builds until even her one joy – hearing Bach played in a church – can’t stop disaster, and the story powers through to a conclusion that’s both hard to read and impossible to look away from. Poets, the woman says, only tell “part of the truth. They keep quiet about the rest or nobody would buy their work.” There’s no such holding back in this breathtakingly powerful book.View image in fullscreenDeath Takes MebyCristina Rivera Garza,translated by Sarah Booker and Robin Myers(Bloomsbury, £16.99)In an unnamed city, four men have been found murdered and mutilated. Police are baffled – “Who’d want a penis?” – but the presence of poetry extracts left beside the bodies leads them to call in Cristina Rivera Garza, a literary professor and the author of this book. So this is not a traditional whodunnit: it switches viewpoints, takes in the art of Marina Abramović and the work of Argentinian poet Alejandra Pizarnik. Rivera Garza, whowon a Pulitzer prize last yearfor her memoir of femicide in Mexico, plays with form, blending fiction with an essay complete with footnotes, satirising media coverage, incorporating comments on the publication of the book we’re reading, and generally having fun. Her exuberance is contagious. “Reading shouldn’t be so complicated,” says one character. “A matter of turning the page.” Of course, it’s both.Explore more on these topicsBooksTranslated fiction roundupreviewsShareReuse this content"

The 1992 title poem – which recently enjoyed a second life on TikTok, with users showing off their fruit-based tattoos – finds the author buying a large orange, sharing it with two friends and concluding: “I love you. I’m glad I exist.” After the Lunch is about falling in love on Waterloo Bridge while “high on the charm and the drink”, while Being Boring hails the virtues of a drama-free life (“No news is good news, and long may it last”).Cope is the reader, her delivery gently understated and frequently deadpan. In Loss, she reflects on the end of a relationship in which the woman “went through hell. His absence wasn’t a problem, but the corkscrew had gone as well.” Sometimes she breaks from the narration to share the context of a poem. She describes attending a conference in America where one evening she found herself the only woman at a table of men, inspiring the poem Men Talking: “If you’re with several blokes, it’s anecdotes and jokes. If you were to die / Of boredom, there and then / They’d notice by and by, if you were to die. // But it could take a while.”Contemplating her twilight years in The End, Cope thanks “my glasses, hearing aids, dental implant, walking stick, inhalers, statins and carefully rationed painkillers. I am glad to be alive as I walk the last mile or two through the valley of the shadow.”Available via Faber & Faber, 47 minFurther listeningThe Leopard inMy HouseMark Steel, Penguin Audio, 6hr 36minsThe comedian reads his memoir detailing his cancer diagnosis, which he compares to having a dangerous animal locked in a room in one’s home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Recently (1987)As with a lot of her 60s peers,Joan Baezseemed slightly out of place in the 80s. She only released two studio albums that decade but came out swinging on Recently. It’s a steely rebuttal of her ex-husband’s memoir, which was downbeat about both their marriage and 60s radicalism: “You could say we failed … but I prefer remembering the way we were.”19. Gulf Winds (1976)Most of the Gulf Winds album leaned towards commerciality and a sound that would now be called yacht rock, but the 10-minute title track is something else: Baez alone with her guitar, singing a potent, moving reflection upon her childhood, her Mexican heritage, her father’s idealism and her parents’ divorce.View image in fullscreenBaez on stage at the Rainbow theatre in London, 1980.Photograph: David Redfern/Redferns18. Fishing (1997)The sound of Fishing is standard-issue late-90s post-grunge US rock, but it’s a melodically powerful song: moreover, the barely contained fury with which Baez sings folk singer Richard Shindell’s sharp lyrics – about an undocumented Latin American migrant facing a US immigration officer – is quite something to behold.17. Barbara Allen (1961)A perfect early example of whatLangston Hughescalled Baez’s “transmutation into self”: her ability to impose her own character on to traditional material. Samuel Pepys wrote of singing Barbara Allen on New Year’s Eve 1665; it seems unlikely his version was as spellbinding as the one Baez recorded.16. The President Sang Amazing Grace (2018)There’s something depressing about the fact that Baez’s final album returned her to the territory of 1964’s Birmingham Sunday, about the 16th Street Baptist church bombing: 44 years on, another protest song about another racist atrocity in a Black church, this time the 2015 Charleston shootings. Written by Zoe Mulford, it’s an incredible song; Baez’s reading lends it a stately dignity and power.15. Children and All That Jazz (1975)A departure for Baez, possibly influenced by Joni Mitchell. Children and All That Jazz is, as its title suggests, a witty, charming meditation on motherhood (“go to bed now – it’s quarter to nine, I’m tired”) recorded with jazz pianist Hampton Hawes. The latter’s solo is fantastic, as is Baez’s dramatic, triple-tracked vocal.14. North (1967)Amid the Joan album’s covers of Lennon and McCartney, Tim Hardin and Jacques Brel, North stood out: it featured an early co-writing credit for Baez and a lovely, heart-rending melody. Peter Schickele’s arrangement, meanwhile, is perfect: subtle, sympathetic, amping up the melancholy by way of strings and – very occasionally – glockenspiel.View image in fullscreenSerenading hippies and tourists at the corner of Haight and Ashbury in San Francisco, 1967.Photograph: AP13. There But for Fortune (1964)Baez’s name is most closely associated with that ofBob Dylan, but she also recorded the definitive version of Dylan’s friend and rival Phil Ochs’ most celebrated song, turning it into a UK Top 10 hit in the process. It’s a beautiful performance that amplifies the lyric’s empathy for societal outcasts, and the anti-war message of its final verse.12. The Altar Boy and the Thief (1977)On which Baez, who came out as bisexual in 1973, offers a piano-backed and beautifully drawn portrait of two strangers meeting in a gay bar, which gradually turns into a rallying call. It was released in the year that American singer Anita Bryant began a virulent and widely publicised anti-gay campaign called Save Our Children.11. Silver Dagger (1960)In a sense, Baez’s take on Silver Dagger is bowdlerised – other versions feature the lovers reacting to parental disapproval with a suicide pact – but no matter. The opening track of her eponymous debut album revealed listeners were in the presence of someone special, her guitar-picking intricate but urgent, her voice pure but affecting.10. Prison Trilogy (Billy Rose) (1972)Both the previous year’s Attica Prison uprising and her husband David Harris’s imprisonment for refusing the Vietnam draft seem to hang over Prison Trilogy. It presses Nashville musicians into a pedal steel-decorated song, with a lovely tune that nevertheless carries an uncompromising message: “Help us raze the prisons to the ground.”9. We Shall Overcome (1963)A ubiquitous protest song of the 60s and beyond, yet Baez’s version is arguably the most iconic: partly because she sang it during the 1963 march on Washington, but mostly because it perfectly balances tenderness and steely determination. She later called the song “trite”, but she sounds like she believes every word.View image in fullscreenThe live versions of Baez recorded in the 70s are well worth hunting down.Photograph: Paul Liebhardt/Corbis/Getty Images8. Sweet Sir Galahad (1970)Apparently the first song Baez wrote alone, Sweet Sir Galahad sweetly details her widowed sister’s romance with music producer Milan Melvin, setting the story of their courtship to the kind of melody that sounds as though it’s always existed. Performing it at Woodstock, she called it “mediocre”. It definitely isn’t.7. The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down (1971)Baez’s 1971 recording of the Band’s American civil war epic was her biggest hit, but you’ll need to root through bootleg recordings of Bob Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Tour to hear her best versions: far beefier-sounding than the studio version, amped up by the raw power of Dylan’s backing band.6. Farewell Angelina (1965)The psychology behind some of Baez’s Dylan covers can give you pause – Farewell Angelina could be about her, or Dylan’s departure from the folk scene, or both. She sang it at the Newport folk festival at which he “went electric”, and the result is sad magic: her voice cuts through to the song’s emotional core.View image in fullscreenBaez and Bob Dylan in London, 1965.Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty Images5. Dida (1975)In 2008, Joni Mitchell claimed she and Baez were frenemies – “she would have broken my leg if she could” – but you wouldn’t have known from this duet: their voices swoop around each other, the effect as warm as the sunlit room Baez stands in on the cover of Diamonds and Rust.4. Love Is Just a Four Letter Word (1968)Baez performed many Dylan songs, but Love Is Just a Four Letter Word is definitively hers: Dylan has never recorded or played the song live. Lyrically and melodically, it’s fantastic, clearly a product of his songwriting zenith: if the sitar on the studio recording proves a period detail too far, there’s a great 1976 live version.3. Birmingham Sunday (1964)Written by Baez’s brother-in-law Richard Fariña, about the Ku Klux Klan church bombing that also inspired John Coltrane’s Alabama, Baez’s performance is more lamentation than protest. It’s a masterclass in the power of restraint, as if she has taken the line about singing “so softly it’ll do no one wrong” to heart.2. Love Song to a Stranger (1972)Come From the Shadows was a political album – it featured a song admonishing Dylan for his lack of engagement – but it also contained one of Baez’s most beautiful love songs, about the restorative powers of a one-night stand. Or as she puts it: “Passionate strangers who rescue each other from a lifetime of cares.”1. Diamonds and Rust (1975)It’s one of the great ironies of Baez’s career: she is too often unfairly presented in pop history as merely an adjunct to Dylan’s rise, yet the song you would present as incontrovertible proof of her greatness as a writer is about … Dylan. But for all its scattering of historical details, Diamonds and Rust could be about anyone: its cocktail of tender nostalgia, weariness (“here comes your ghost again”) and simmering anger provoked by encountering an old flame with whom things ended badly is perfectly fixed, universally applicable and delivers an emotional gut punch.Explore more on these topicsRankedJoan BaezFolk musicPop and rockBob DylanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But when a young woman’s body is found in his beach shack, the bewildered detective is compelled to stay put and clear his name.

It barely lets up from there, as our cop hero pursues a drug lord while trying to protect Brigitte Lin’s witness. There is some slapstick content (cakes do feature), but this is a more serious affair than Chan’s subsequent screen persona would suggest. The climactic fight sequence in a shopping centre is a riot of smashed glass and battered bodies, with one stunt so impressive we see it three times.Simon WardellExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He also stars as David, a Jewish American who joins his extrovert cousin Benji (Oscar winner Kieran Culkin) in Poland for a tour of sites associated with the genocide – funded by their beloved late grandmother. The men’s fluctuating relationship is a source of quick-witted humour but also great drama. Benji’s scattershot attempts to honour the traumatic events, alongside the more repressed David’s reluctance to open up to his once-close relative, give the film an emotional pull that’s both historical and personal.Wednesday 2 April, Disney+Con MumView image in fullscreenCatfished? … Graham Hornigold in Con Mum.Photograph: NetflixThere are plenty of true-crime documentaries out there about people duped into giving away money through catfishing and the like. But what if the grifter is your own mother? Nick Green’s truly gobsmacking film tells the story of pastry chef Graham Hornigold, who was contacted in 2020 by the mum he never knew. Dionne turned out to be a very wealthy entrepreneur – but she only had six months to live, so Graham grabbed at the chance of a parental relationship, however brief. There are many, many twists in this tale of love, manipulation and devastating consequences.Out now, NetflixBabesView image in fullscreenGloriously fnny … Ilana Glazer and Michelle Buteau in Babes.Photograph: Universal/SkyPair Broad City’s writer-star Ilana Glazer and the creator ofBetter Things, Pamela Adlon, and you can guarantee an unabashed, gloriouslyfunny storyabout women’s lives.

Like much of the broadcaster’s early content, it’s sparky, politically edged fare, following two young women – jobless Elaine (Alexandra Pigg) and chicken factory worker/force of nature Teresa (Margi Clarke, sister of the film’s writer Frank) – on a night out in the city. They meet two Russian sailors, and while Teresa gets off with Alfred Molina’s Sergei, Elaine falls heavily for Peter (Peter Firth).

The response of Molly Kochan was striking: when she was told her cancer was incurable, she left her husband for a voyage of sexual discovery. After all, the couple had stopped having sex anyway because of her chemotherapy (“You said my bald head made you think about my dad”). Based on a podcast about the final stages of Molly’s life, this comedy drama starringMichelle Williamsis beautifully realised – a story about sex, love, friendship and grasping life’s intensity. It’s full of human warmth and complexity and, crucially, is very funny … which is probably the only way such a story could be told.Disney+, from Friday 4 AprilThe BondsmanView image in fullscreenDemon slayer … Kevin Bacon as Hub Halloran and Beth Grant as Kitty Halloran in The Bondsman.Photograph: Prime VideoHub Halloran (Kevin Bacon) is dead. So when he returns to work, people are surprised to see him. Furthermore, he’s doing the same job – he’s still a bounty hunter but he has been brought back to life by the devil to hunt demons who have escaped from damnation. It’s a bizarre premise and Bacon spends plenty of time looking appropriately nonplussed. To add an extra layer of strangeness to an already eccentric scenario, Halloran has a side hustle as a country singer. Is selling his soul to Satan a ticket to musical success? Let a daft battle between good and evil commence.Prime Video, from Thursday 3 AprilBordertownView image in fullscreenTo Moscow with love … Ville Virtanen in Bordertown.Photograph: Channel 4A Finnish crime drama in which detective Kari Sorjonen is charged with investigating a series of violent crimes on the border between Finland and Russia.

And, as is the seemingly inevitable way with such shows, Sorjonen has a somewhat troubled personal history to contend with too. There are undeniable echoes of the Danish/Swedish drama The Bridge in the premise but Russia’s recent expansionist urges give the show extra piquancy.Channel 4, out nowThe Lady’s CompanionView image in fullscreenLooking for love … (from left) Itzíar Manero as Adela, Nadia de Santiago as Elena and Paula Usero as Josefina in The Lady’s Companion.Photograph: Manuel Fernández Valdes/NetflixSet in the 1880s, this series is a lively Spanish spin on the hardy perennial period drama. It’s a comedy of manners centring on Elena Bianda (Nadia de Santiago). She regards herself as the city’s finest chaperone – a professional matchmaker whose job is to find appropriate suitors for Madrid’s eligible young women. It’s a world of opulent country piles, flamboyant eveningwear and lavish banqueting, and Elena is in her element. Until she takes a fancy to one of the gentlemen herself, of course.

Such as: can you really turn Korean kimchi into crisp fritters, in much the same way as the French make beignets with courgette flowers? Or can pork terrine, the centrepiece of any trad Frenchpique-nique, be served with a Koreanssamjang, or fermented soybeans and hot pepper? Some people may say: “Heck, no”, but Cálong’s chef/owner Joo Young Won would disagree.Won was head chef at Michelin-starredGalvin at Windowsfor seven years, where he served reassuringly expensive French classics to a moneyed, West End audience who appreciated the tablecloths, prompt service and 28th-floor views of London. Here at Cálong, however, he’s bringing those Euro-dining techniques and flexing them with Korean influences in a pretty but mainly practical room. Cálong, which is very much an independent restaurant, has clearly passed the sniff test with Stokey’s feisty anti-gentrification crowd, who love to gather outside aGail’sor a Nando’s and wield their Down With This Sort of Thingbanners. Then again, it’s hard to take offence at something that’s so wilfully niche as a man serving French-style pressed brawn withbossammooli, orhwangtae(dried pollock) croquettes with tartare sauce. This is not a Korean restaurant, but neither is itnota Korean restaurant. It is a melange, an experiment, a delicious, Korean-flecked hotch-potch.View image in fullscreenCálong’s ‘very good, crisp, thickly battered take’ on Korean fried chicken comes with sweet chilli and peanut.And, yes, kimchi can be turned into fritters, by the way. I know because I’ve eaten a large plate of them, and dipped them into a pleasingly fiery chilli mayo. To a less able cook, kimchi might prove a bit damp to batter and fry – after all, it’s like trying to do the same to coleslaw – but with Won’s ingenuity, these are just the right mix of funky, crisp and sating. At an earlier Cálong pop-up, he made kimchi risotto.Those dried pollock croquettes are also adorable: Alaskan pollock, frozen and dried in winter, which turns it a deep yellow (orhwang) shade, are mixed with fluffy potato, then breadcrumbed, fried and perched on a blob of tart, vibrant tartare. And, although there is nothing remotely groundbreaking about fried chicken with sweet chilli and peanut – fried chicken being fried chicken and all that – this was certainly a very good, crisp, thickly battered take.We lunched at Cálong on a Friday, half-expecting to be the only guests, because that’s the thing with semi-fancy neighbourhood restaurants: who on Earth uses them for lunch? Yet, by mid-service, every one of the dozen or so tables was full. Ladies lunching, gangs of friends, at least two dates. Then again, that’s the thing about gentrification: suddenly you’ve got folk who, at the drop of a hat, fancy a lunchtime onglet with mustard onions and greens for £26 with somesot bapfor a further £12 on the side. Sot bap, or Korean claypot rice, is slightly sticky and very fragrant, and at Cálong that day Won made it with earthy mushrooms and brown butter. It’s possibly not £12-worth of exciting, but we live in the land of the pricey side dish these days; a more humble side of winter leaves with pear in a soy vinaigrette was £6.View image in fullscreenCálong’s ‘incredibly good’ spicy seafoodjjamppongwith aïoli.We ordered that onglet, and it was nothing short of fantastic. Griddled to a copper brown outside and medium-rare within, it came flanked by some crunchy brassica leaves. Also incredibly good was seafoodjjamppongwith aïoli, which was a bit like a spicy bouillabaisse and resplendent with langoustine, mussels and squid, and a vibrant orange, garlicky emulsion with enough bite to make your forehead sweat.There’s an awful lot to like about Cálong; it’s a cool, calm, confident restaurant, staffed by a youngish crew who are clearly not industry veterans, but who certainly know the menu backwards. Those hints of Korea among all the Frenchness may be subtle and sometimes almost moot – for example, the stracciatella with butter beans, AKA a bowl of cheesy beans, had only the merest hint ofdoenjangpaste. But there’s still plenty enough spark, light, fire and crunch here to intrigue even Korean food enthusiasts.View image in fullscreen‘Genuinely delicious’: Cálong’s blood orange chocolate crémeux with roasted tea ice-cream.We finished with a blood orange chocolate crémeux, which was served sundae-style with layers of blood orange and a slightly bitter ice-cream made from roasted tea. Like so much else here, it seemed a strange idea that sounded as if it might just work, though at the same time perhaps wouldn’t, but in Won’s hands it turned out to be genuinely delicious. Cálong may not have panoramic views of the metropolis, but you can eat for half the price of Galvin and have a wander through Clissold Park and see the goat on the way home afterwards. In many ways, that’s just as good.Cálong35 Stoke Newington Church Street, London N16, 020-3561 4798. Open lunch Fri-Sun, noon-2.30pm (Sun 3.30pm); dinner Weds-Sat, 6.30-10.30pm.

It’s traditionally made from rice fermented withnuruk, a Korean grain-based starter but, due to staple food shortages, sweet potato and tapioca were later introduced to strengthen the alcohol.“Soju was a rather muddled and indistinct drink compared with its competitors,” says Marie Cheong-Thong, ofThe Larder at 36, who was recommended to me as a brilliantly knowledgable soju expert. “Shochu from Japan was cleaner, smoother and gave you fewer headaches, whereas China’s baijiu, with an ABV up to 53%, could ‘hit the spot’ cheaper and faster.”Soju is commonly drunk neat, well-chilled and straight from a shot glass; the bottle is also commonly shared – you pour for others using both hands and, according to tradition, you never pour your own.But, as ever, new ways to enjoy the drink are being introduced to meet new trends in drinking. “Korean drinks brands are very innovative,” Cheong-Thong explains. “In the past few years, new product lines have slipped in: fruit infusions [which are especially popular], lower ABVs, fun labels targeting younger generations. By creating a single-serving flavoured drink, they’ve changed the soju game.”This so-called “green bottle soju” is the most widely available in and around the UK, and you can get it atSainsbury’s,Tescoand, now, Lidl. The most prevalent brand over here, and by quite some way, isJinro, Korea’s biggest-selling soju. And judging by that distiller’s presence at various music festivals over the past couple of summers, it’s definitely trying to tap into that younger audience Cheong-Thong refers to. At such events, the soju is usually served as a half-bottle, and in a paper cup, then topped up with ice. It makes sense, too, not least with the rise of alcopops and the small-format boom (these days, it sometimes feels as ifeverythingis being put in a can or bottle).Soju is also being mixed into cocktails (Câvin Bethnal Green, east London, for example, mixes peach soju into a gimlet, while gin, sweet vermouth and berry soju are combined at Bristol’sBokman); I’m told that adding it to beer (somaek) is particularly delicious, too.That said, I’d love to see similar attention paid to more artisan, premium, smaller-production sojus, particularly on the part of boutique drinks retailers.
