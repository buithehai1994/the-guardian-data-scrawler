Cardinal lives in a town in British Columbia with strong counter-cultural roots. “The community that I live in, home birth is something a lot of women prioritise,” she explains.Then Cardinal stumbled across a podcast from the Free Birth Society (FBS). One episode in particular, she says, made an impact: “Unpacking Ultrasound With Yolande Clark.” In it, the Canadian ex-doula Yolande Norris-Clark falsely links ultrasounds to autism and ADHD andstates that“ultrasound damages and modifies and destroys cells”.View image in fullscreenYolande Norris-Clark in an episode of The Complete Guide to Freebirth.Photograph: FBSNorris-Clark, who was born in Vancouver, is arguably the most famous freebirth influencer in the world. She is also a key figure in FBS, a US company run by her business partner and fellow ex-doula Emilee Saldaya.FBS, which promotes an extreme version of free birth in which women abandon any form of prenatal care and give birth without doctors or midwives present, is estimated to have generated more than $13m in revenues since 2018. Arecent Guardian investigationidentified 48 cases of late-term stillbirths or neonatal deaths or other forms of serious harm involving mothers or birth attendants who appear to be linked to FBS.The intellectual heft behind FBS, Norris-Clark shaped the organisation’s radical position on birth, while Saldaya, its founder, runs the business. Most women find FBS through its Instagram account, which has 132,000 followers, or podcast, which has been downloaded 5m times.But Norris-Clark is a significant social media influencer in her own right, pioneering a radical version of free birth that concerns even pro-freebirth advocates.View image in fullscreenEmma Cardinal: ‘You can’t just post about the good side of free birth. What happens when it goes very wrong?’Photograph: Annika FaithAfter listening to the podcast about ultrasounds, Cardinal was alarmed. “I was petrified of miscarriage and stillbirth,” she says, explaining that her younger brother was stillborn. “There’s not a chance I’m risking that.” Cardinal came to believe ultrasounds “aren’t super safe for the baby”.At that stage, Cardinal had not yet decided to freebirth. She phoned a local midwifery practice and explained that she wanted a home birth, but did not want to have any ultrasounds during her pregnancy. But the receptionist, Cardinal recalls, said that if she wanted to give birth with them, ultrasounds were non-negotiable. Cardinal thought about it, and decided she was not comfortable proceeding.Instead, after listening to about 100 episodes of the FBS podcast, Cardinal decided to freebirth. In one journal entry, she wrote: “I know it in my bones that freebirthing is my safest and most liberated option.” She purchased FBS’s popular video course, “The Complete Guide to Freebirth”.Cardinal’s son Floyd was stillborn in March 2024. During labour Cardinal saw meconium in her waters, a possible sign of distress, but dismissed it because “I was told by FBS that meconium is totally normal”. She stayed home for three days, because “I remember hearing Emilee Saldaya’s voice in my head [from the podcasts], saying: ‘I wouldn’t be concerned for the first three days.’”After Floyd died, Cardinal was hospitalised with sepsis and placed in an induced coma. She has had a number of surgeries to repair the damage from his birth, and had to wear an ostomy bag for a time. “I didn’t think that could even be a reality that could happen after birth,” she says. “I almost had to have a hysterectomy.”View image in fullscreenEmma Cardinal in hospital after her first ostomy surgery, nine months after the stillbirth of Floyd.Photograph: Annika FaithLooking back, Cardinal believes that much of the information she received from FBS was “incomplete, biased, one-sided and kind of dogmatic”. This includes the information she received on ultrasounds,which are not harmfulto unborn babies when used appropriately. She adds: “You can’t just post about the good side of free birth. What happens when it goes very wrong?”Norris-Clark has not responded to repeated requests for comment about the Guardian’s investigation, which is told throughThe Birth Keepers podcast series. She has previously defended her partnership with Saldaya, saying FBS is “the most ethical kind of business you can run”. Critics of FBS, she has said, fail to understand the commitment to women taking “radical responsibility” for their births. And she has said it is unfair to hold her responsible for the choices of a mother who consumes her content.Howeverthe spotlight on tragedies involving mothersaround the world who consumed FBS content is posing a crisis for the business.Saldaya has also not provided a substantive response to requests for comment, but told the Guardian in one email that “some of these allegations are false or defamatory”. She has previously responded to criticism by saying she does not care if women freebirth, but wants them to have the choice. In recent comments to her followers, she described the Guardian’s reporting as “propaganda” based on “lies”, and suggested her work, words and character had been misrepresented by “twisted, dark attacks”.View image in fullscreenEmilee Saldaya pictured in a screengrab of the Free Birth Society website.Composite: FBSCardinal is not the only Canadian woman to lose their child after an FBS-influenced free birth. AlthoughCanadahas universal healthcare, it is a sparsely populated country, with large “midwifery deserts”. Alternative communities can be sceptical of licensed professionals. As in other parts of the world, FBS messaging often resonates with women who have had traumatic experiences of maternity services or unnecessary medical interventions.The Covid pandemic also eroded many women’s trust in the medical establishment.Not all of the women who want to avoid licensed providers are ready to freebirth. Some turn to unlicensed attendants, believing they offer their best chance to avoid hospital for their birth. Canada has a community of unlicensed birth attendants, in part due to the historic status of midwifery in the nation. Unlike other countries with strong cultures of midwifery, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, Canada has lagged behind other developed nations when it comes to recognising midwifery. Midwives and their clients can sometimes encounter scepticism, or even hostility, from healthcare professionals.It is in this context that women turn to unlicensed attendants, some of whom, while unregulated, are skilled and experienced underground midwives. But others – such as those who enrolled only in a brief online FBS course – have limited or no experience of births, and no adequate skills for managing potential emergencies.‘I actually don’t believe gravity is true’The most popular of FBS’s schools, the Radical Birthkeeper School, has trained 850 “authentic midwives” from more than 30 countries. On its three-month Zoom course, only about half the content deals with birth, and the rest focuses on self-development and business skills. There are at least 22 FBS-accredited birth keepers in Canada, according to an online directory seen by the Guardian.FBS advises its radical birth keepers – or RBKs – to get out in the world and begin attending births. “The very best way to learn how to do midwifery is by doing midwifery,” Saldaya told her RBK students in 2025. Many have since set up their own businesses supporting women during their free births.Alexandra Smith, 29, a life coach who hired an FBS-trained RBK for her birth, is from Vancouver Island. “It’s a different way of thinking out here. People prefer to be off grid,” Smith explains. “It’s a holistic space, with lots of hippies, everyone is about free birth and Waldorf education.” Norris-Clark, she adds, is “very popular where I live”.She says women in her area see Norris-Clark as the “founding mother” of free birth, who has “brought a solution to systemic problems” in Canada.During her pregnancy, Smith says, she listened to the FBS podcast regularly, sometimes multiple episodes a day, and that she found Norris-Clark particularly captivating. Were it not for FBS, she says, she would have had a home birth with a midwife.View image in fullscreenAlexandra Smith with a painting of her son Aksel.Photograph: Odessa RaeMany of the women who follow Norris-Clark on social media, seeking advice in their pregnancies, are unaware of her more extreme views, which she sometimes revealed to FBS students. “I actually don’t believe that gravity is true,” she told FBS students in 2024, adding: “Maybe that just makes me crazy and that’s totally OK.” In another class, she told students they could cut a baby’s umbilical cord with an “old rusty fork”. “I don’t believe in germ theory,” she said, “I don’t believe in contagion,” adding: “But even if contagion were real … there would be a pretty much 0% chance of anything happening.”Such radical beliefs are not part of FBS’s slick advertising and promotional materials. Smith says she believed, based on FBS marketing, that RBKs were “trained, unregistered midwives”. “I feel like I was falsely advertised to,” she says.(Others have made similar complaints about FBS. Earlier this year a lawyer for FBS responded to a consumer protection complaint filed in North Carolina alleging a course was mis-sold by stating that the company had always been transparent that it was offering “personal development and sovereign-birth related education” rather than certified midwifery training.)The RBK who Smith hired to attend her during her free birth was in her mid-20s. In a video testimonial she filmed for the RBK school, which had been available online until recently, she said the school “wasn’t your typical school in that it provides hard facts, information, data, and all of that stuff. It was different in that what I gained from the experience was this deep trust in birth, the deep sense of knowing that birth unfolds beautifully if we just step out of the way.”When it came to the birth, Smith alleges her RBK was woefully underprepared and “like a deer in headlights”. The RBK, Smith says, missed signs her labour was unfolding abnormally. When Smith’s son Aksel was born on 7 May 2023, his umbilical cord was white, and he was floppy and unresponsive. The RBK, she says, did not attempt to resuscitate the baby, and Smith had to tell her to call 911. Aksel was rushed to hospital, and diagnosed with severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy due to oxygen deprivation caused by a placental abruption at his birth. The RBK has not responded to requests for comment.Legal cases and public warningsAs unlicensed attendants, including those trained by FBS, proliferate across Canada, the authorities are seeking to clamp down on the practice.On Vancouver Island, Canada’s most famous unlicensed birth attendant, Gloria Lemay, 78, is awaiting trial for manslaughter after a girl died 10 days after her birth, which Lemay attended, in January 2024. It is her latest legal battle in a near five-decade long career.In 1986, Lemay wasconvicted of criminal negligencecausing death after a baby was born dead at a birth she attended, although she was later acquitted, with the supreme court upholding a lower court’s judgment that a child that is not yet born cannot beconsidered a person. Four years later, after a baby boy died of an infection three days after a birth attended by Lemay, she was fined $1,000 for refusing to answer questions at the inquest. In 2002, Lemaywas foundin contempt of an order prohibiting her from acting as a midwife. She was arrested in relation to the most recent case in January 2025. A case management conference is scheduled for January 2026. Lemay declined to comment on her upcoming trial, but it is understood she plans to contest the charges and plead not guilty.View image in fullscreenGloria Lemay trained Yolande Norris-Clark as a doula.Photograph: FacebookNorris-Clark always credits Lemay with inspiring her lifelong passion for birth. Lemay attended Norris-Clark’s first two births, and trained her as a doula. However those familiar with both women’s careers say Norris-Clark’s views on birth are more extreme than those of her one-time mentor.Lemay remains a highly divisive figure. Viewed by some in the medical establishment as a dangerous charlatan, she is equally beloved by many in the birth world, who regard her as a folk hero comparable to the legendary US midwife Ina May Gaskin. The Birth Care Alliance, a campaign to counter what it says is the “systemic overreach into birth sovereignty and midwifery”, is fundraising for her defence. (So too is Norris-Clark, who has described Lemay’s trial as “the attempted martyrdom of a cherished elder”.)Lemay’s supporters say she wished to retire years ago, but was repeatedly asked to attend births by women who wanted to give birth outside the system. They say she is highly skilled, supports medical transfer when necessary, and has attended thousands of births in her career, of which only very few ended in tragedy. To her detractors, Lemay is a thorn in the side of the medical establishment, and the authorities have repeatedly targeted her.But Canadian health authorities are also warning about less famous, and considerably less skilled, attendants, some of whom are FBS-affiliated.In 2023 the British Columbia College of Nurses and Midwives put out an advisory notice warning the public about the RBK hired by Smith, saying she was not entitled to practise as a midwife, and that she could be offering midwifery services without being permitted to do so. (The Guardian has seen no evidence that she continued to attend births after Smith’s in May 2023.)The following year, a different FBS-linked birth attendant was banned from hospitals across Alberta unless she was seeking medical care for herself or her family. The woman, who marketed herself as a “traditional midwife”, had been a member of the FBS membership community and appeared as a guest on its podcast. A number of complaints were filed against her by concerned staff at two Calgary hospitals after she was linked to two stillbirths in 2021. (Her lawyer told the Guardian that her birth services have been limited to non-medical support.)Smith’s son Aksel spent five weeks in hospital before being discharged in June 2023. Deprived of oxygen during birth, he had severe disabilities and was fed through a tube. Smith was his full-time carer. “You’re just trying to wrap your head around what happened,” she recalls of that time, “and my mental state was: how do we find a cure, how do we fix this?”She goes on: “It’s very lonely having a medically complex child in a holistic community. When things go awry, it’s like it’s your fault.”Aksel lived for six and a half months, before he died. “In my grief,” says Smith, “it’s hard to think about how things could have been different.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaThe birth keepersChildbirthPregnancyWomenMidwiferyWomen's healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has spoken toSteven Gallant, who was on day release from prison when he used a chair to help bring down the attacker,Usman Khan, who had killed two people. “He said he reacted on instinct, whereas I was thinking about every action and consequence of it,” Frost said.When the London Bridge attack unfolded inside the hall on 29 November 2019, Frost said chaos and confusion took hold. “There was screaming, noise, no one knew what was going on and I imagine it would have been the same on Bondi Beach.”View image in fullscreenDarryn Frost: ‘I can still remember the flecks of dust in the air.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianRunning towards danger, he insisted, was not a natural impulse. “I don’t think it comes naturally to anyone. I sawSaskia[Jones, who was killed by the attacker] fall to the stairs, and she was very clearly severely injured. So the next thought in my mind was: ‘I need to prevent that from happening to anyone else’.”He said what followed felt unreal: “It’s crazy, but this was all happening in split seconds. It really is like the Superman or Spider-Man movies, or the Matrix, where time literally slows down for you.”He said his senses narrowed to a single point: the attacker. “I had tunnel vision,” he recalled. “My hearing switched off to everything around me except for the perpetrator in front of me. It’s a really strange thing. Sirens, alarms were going off, I couldn’t even hear that. All I could hear was what he was saying and anything that he did, my hearing just became super fine-tuned.“My vision went tunnel vision just on to him so anything in the periphery I couldn’t see at all, and what I could see was super-high detail like an 8K TV. I can still remember the flecks of dust in the air.”A neuroscientist, Dr Daniel Glaser, said humans, like all mammals, exhibit a natural “fight or flight” response to threat or surprise, but it does not dictate the course of action they choose.“It prepares your muscles, and to some extent your brain, for action, but the action that you take depends on a bunch of other things,” he said.“How you perceive what’s happening changes what you’ll do, and your perceptions are driven by prejudice and expectations. Your sense of what’s happening depends on what you expect to be happening and how you read different situations.“You shouldn’t necessarily think about it as a choice. There’s very good evidence to say that lots of things in the brain which determine your behaviour happen before you’re aware of them.”He said the kind of bravery that caused people to run towards danger while others were running away was guided not by “instinct”, but by life experiences and any training they may have had.Earlier this week,Dan Barr, a former soldier, was hailed as a hero for jumping into the car of Paul Doyle, who drove into crowds of pedestrians at the Liverpool FC parade.View image in fullscreenDan Barr.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAProf Craig Jackson, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society, who has a specialist interest in gun violence and mass killings, said there was no “profile” of the kind of person who would “have a go”.“It’s just as likely to be an angry mum in defence mode as it could be a fit, healthy rugby-playing male,” said the professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University. “That’s reassuring because that means that attackers, either lone wolves or terrorists, they’re never quite sure who’s going to be the hero who could challenge them.”During the London Bridge attack in 2017Roy Larner, 56, a football fan, was stabbed in his hands, chest and head as he tried to fight off three knife-wielding terrorists with his fists.“Fuck you, I’m Millwall,” he shouted after Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba burst into the Black and Blue steakhouse.View image in fullscreenRoy Larner pictured around 2017.Photograph: Facebook“They’d come in and kicked the door open, and that’s when the three of them started stabbing me. I started fighting back with them, but it gave that 20 or 30 people a chance to get out in front of me. It nearly cost me my life,” he recalled.“I was fighting for my life. Punching and punching and punching. [I was stabbed] eight times and slashed in the head as well. They were slicing me, stabbing me. I broke my ribs when I went back into the table. But luckily – my arm’s a bit weak still – but nothing major. It’s only the trauma side of it that really hurt me.”Larner, who was hailed the “Lion of London Bridge”, said he made a split-second decision to intervene.“You should run. [But] you can be an idiot and take three on,” he said. “There was an older bloke with us, about 78, and I think that was the reason why I stood there. But obviously it gave other people a chance to get out as well.”Larner, who lives in Peckham, south London, was not formally recognised for his bravery and didnot receive compensationfor his injuries. He said it was because he had convictions, including for racially aggravated common assault.Despite this, he said he would not hesitate to intervene again. “I’ve never had any boxing training or anything like that. [But] I’ve done something good. Whether that makes up for the bad things I’ve done, who knows?”Explore more on these topicsPsychologyBondi beach terror attackLondon Bridge terror attack 2019London Bridge attack 2017NeurosciencefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.With white-wired headphones endorsed by celebrities including Lily-Rose Depp, Paul Mescal, Bella Hadid and Apple Martin, a growing number of people are breaking away from wireless listening.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For inspiration, there is the Instagram account@wireditgirls, or a Balenciaga campaignfeaturing the model Mona Tougaard reclining bed, wired headphones in place.Daniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at British Vogue, is familiar with the trend. “[It says] ‘I’m very effortless. I’m very nonchalant,” he says. “It’s become a real styleable accessory.”But in a culture where the forward march of technology is often treated as compulsory, wired headphones represent more than aesthetics. “It’s an analogue way of opting out – of both tech but also life,” says Rodgers. “They’re visible in a way that AirPods aren’t. There is a sense of ‘do not disturb’.”View image in fullscreenRetro tech is making a comeback, with some users of wired headphones embracing tangles as part of the charm.Photograph: Tara Moore/Getty ImagesThat symbolism is on full display on the cover of New York magazine’slatest issue, which features celebrities riding the subway: Debbie Harry with the Geese frontman Cameron Winter, Ben Stiller with the Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns and Macaulay Culkin with the SubwayTakes presenter Kareem Rahma. The real story, however, is not the star power but the shared accessory in each image: wired headphones.The pictures were taken by Hannah La Follette Ryan, the Brooklyn-based photographer behind the Instagram account@SubwayTakes, which documents New Yorkers on public transport. She says: “I see the revival as an extension of digital fatigue. Who wants another glitchy expensive gadget to charge?”Price is clearly part of the appeal of wired headphones – Apple’s EarPods cost £17 compared with £99 for AirPods – but nostalgia is also a factor.“We’re seeing retro tech come back,” says Tom Morgan-Freelander, the deputy editor of the technology magazine Stuff. “And as part of that, brands are starting to bring back wired headphones.”He says some younger consumers are switching to wired for sound quality, which is typically better with cables. “Bluetooth became the norm, and there was an acceptance that, for wireless convenience, you’re going to lose a bit of quality,” he adds.Then there is the issue of tangles. While wireless headphones are stored neatly in a case, wired varieties are often found in a knot at the bottom of a bag.View image in fullscreenDespite the revival of wired headphones, Bluetooth models continue to outsell them.Photograph: Blend Images/AlamyLa Follette Ryan suggests this is part of the appeal. “The tangle is inevitable,” she says. “Think of a headphone knot as a more user-friendly Rubik’s Cube. Relish the opportunity to slow down and solve a little puzzle.”If wired headphones have become the choice of the fashion-conscious despite these inconveniences, that could change soon. AirPods remain the bestseller at Currys but the retailer reports sales ofBeats Solo 4over-ear headphones have risen by 193% since last year.Morgan-Freelander also points to the £20FiiO Snowsky Wind, a design that looks like the earphones worn with a Sony Walkman in the 1980s.Rodgers still believes wired headphones have the edge. “Even though we are constantly being [sold upgrades], there’s a sort of disengagement [with wired headphones], which is always really hot, right?” he says. “You never want to look like you’re too into anything.”La Follette Ryan, however, thinks there is room for every option. “I just bought a Discman and Sony headphones,” she says, “but I will always keep my wired headphones for sharing an earbud with a friend.”Explore more on these topicsAccessoriesHeadphonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Split into four distinct movements and sung in 13 languages, Lux is a head-spinning, classical music-adjacent opus exploring feminine mystique, religious transcendence and corporal transformation, often via the prism of various female saints. The dissolution of a relationship – grounded and laid bare onLily Allen’s West End Girl, 2025’s other dissection of heartbreak – is shot heavenwards here, buffeted by the constant presence of the London Symphony Orchestra and the input of Pulitzer prize-winning composer Caroline Shaw among a scroll-sized list of collaborators. Its audacity alone makes the efforts of Rosalía’s pop peers look pretty laughable.The fact that Lux manages to transcend scholarly chin-stroking and dry Wiki deep dives is near miraculous, and the credit is solely Rosalía’s. While this isn’t her first album to alchemise the past and present – see 2018’sEl Mal Quererand its heady flamenco-R&B hybrid – the stakes are far higher on Lux, and the balancing act more pronounced. What elevates her fourth album, outside its multilayered melodies, rich compositions and engrained drama, is the playfulness at its heart. Like Björk during her 90s peak, there’s a sense of wonderment to Rosalía’s voice that sweeps you up into its tornado. Even when she’s tearing your heart in two, as on La Yugular’s blossoming balladry, or the ascension to heaven on the closing Magnolias, you want to be right there with her.The best example of this exuberance comes towards the end of Italian piano ballad Mio Cristo Piange Diamanti. Inspired by Saint Clare of Assisi, it luxuriates in its string-drenched whirlpool of sadness for more than four minutes. Suddenly, however, everything falls away and we hearRosalíagiggle “that’s gonna be the energy” before a comically OTT string crescendo thuds like a cartoon anvil. The song then segues quickly into batshit single Berghain, which gallops over the horizon on a gale of Vivaldi-esque strings, an imposing German choir and a cameo from Björk playing agony aunt.Rosalía: Berghain – videoThat you never quite know – or want to know – where you are with Lux is part of a charm that burrows deeper the more you listen. Nearly every song ends somewhere completely different to where it started. Reliquia explores the trappings and transience of fame over a featherlight symphony before disintegrating entirely into an electronic cacophony. On Porcelana, which tracks closest to2022’s sweaty Motomamiand its trap-adjacent pop collage, things starts off moody, Rosalía prowling around sinister drum fills and chopped-up male vocals, before fluttering flamenco handclaps are joined by an angelic choir to smooth out the song’s jagged edges.‘It’s impossible not to have contradictions in a contradictory world’: Catalan pop visionary Rosalía on critics, crisis and being ‘hot for God’Read moreAnother of Lux’s balancing acts is one between experimentation and accessibility. It’s no coincidence that Lux has become Rosalía’s first album to break the Top 5 in both the UK and the US: at its heart is a suite of undeniable pop songs. Divinize, the only song featuring Rosalía singing in English, is built around a chorus that feels as if it’s collecting more and more nagging hooks as it spins skywards. It’s a feat repeated by La Yugular, which expands and constricts as it weaves together layered melodies like a tapestry. The waltz-like La Perla seduces with its jaunty, Disney-adjacent musical drama and chant-along chorus, while lyrically it aligns itself with the pop culture-shifting honesty of West End Girl as it eviscerates (in Spanish) an “emotional terrorist” of an ex whose only “masterpiece is his bra collection”. Throughout, Rosalía sings with a painted-on smile, like Cinderella hiding a knife: “Gold medal in being a motherfucker / You’ve got the podium of disappointment.”Lux is pop on a maximalist scale, a hungry reach for capital-A Art in the face of impending AI blankness. It eschews solipsism in favour of glorious transcendence, creating an OTT drama that controls the parameters of its own ridiculousness. It’s a deep well of hidden treasure that takes time to fully mine but never feels like hard work. While some of 2025’s big pop albums felt like feasting on scraps, Lux is a banquet where the characters around the table, some tipsy on holy wine, flit from conversations about historical saints to the galvanising feeling of soul-shattering sadness, to shared gossip about useless men. It’s a modern-day musical from pop’s most restlessly creative practitioner.Explore more on these topicsRosalíaBest music of 2025Pop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These are my top 10 lists for best film, director, actor and supporting actor, actress and supporting actress, directorial debut, cinematographer, screenplay and film most likely to be overlooked by the boomer mainstream media (or MSM).As we look back over the last 12 months, there can be no doubt of the villain of 2025:Tilly Norwood, the female AI star. Launched in October, she is a smilingly bland and really very convincing non-human being who will work uncomplainingly and cheaply without ever storming off to her trailer. Like everyone else, I deplored the horrible simulation and opined that she is part of the AI-isation of movies that has been happening for some time now – without AI.The AI ‘actor’ Tilly Norwood is a symptom of blandified film culture. We need a return to reality | Peter BradshawRead moreYet the thing is, we can complain all we like. Critics and journalists can behave as if our droll or commonsensical putdowns will somehow shame the industry into ignoring AI. But as one producer patiently pointed out to me, it is not that there is no discernible gap between AI fakery and the real thing. If you look carefully then, yes, sure, fine, you can see the tiny gap. But the point is the vast cost gap. The difference in price between generating AI and shooting reality is becoming difficult to ignore. The resolution of the writers’ strike was supposed to have provided for guardrail restrictions on AI. But AI is still coming.Elsewhere, in the Homo sapiens world of film-making, many of the big-hitting auteurs have given us some wonderful work, and some have grievously let us down. Iranian film-maker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d’Or this year for his drama-thrillerIt Was Just an Accident, which took aim at the climate of fear in which the Iranian government operates. At Venice, veteran indie director Jim Jarmusch got the Golden Lion for his ensemble drama anthologyFather Mother Sister Brother, which elegantly explored the notion of narrative. The Gaza horror has been addressed with some fierce Palestinian-themed movies such as Kaouther Ben Hania’s angryThe Voice of Hind Rajab.But others have tried everyone’s patience and presumed outrageously on fan loyalty. The estimable Noah Baumbach and the similarly estimable George Clooney laid a massive egg with their self-regarding sentimentalJay Kelly, a kind of preening lap-of-honour which outstayed its welcome from the moment the house lights dimmed. Almost as bad was Luca Guadagnino’sAfter the Hunt, a muddled, incoherent and dodgily acted #MeToo drama.But alongside them there were tremendously exciting sorties from Kelly Reichardt, Paul Thomas Anderson, Josh Safdie, Kathryn Bigelow, Joshua Oppenheimer, Lucile Hadžihalilović and Lynne Ramsay. And Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible swan song was a terrific thrill ride. It goes to show that despite the chattering class alarmism on the subject, the cinema (compared to opera or theatre or Premier League football) is still a fantastically competitive, low-cost experience, and we should do our best to keep it alive.So here are my lists, and readers are of course invited to vote on what they think is best and point out omissions.Best filmOne Battle After AnotherYoung MothersThe Ice TowerLittle Trouble GirlsMarty SupremeThe EndDead of WinterNickel BoysA Real PainThe BrutalistView image in fullscreenHit man … Timothée Chalamet plays a ping-pong player in Marty Supreme.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyBest directorPaul Thomas Anderson for One Battle After AnotherKathryn Bigelow forA House of DynamiteKelly Reichardt forThe MastermindJesse Eisenberg for A Real PainRaMell Ross for Nickel BoysMike Leigh forHard TruthsDea Kulumbegashvili forAprilJafar Panahi for It Was Just an AccidentLynne Ramsay for Die My LoveBrendan Canty forChristyBest actressJennifer Lawrence forDie My LoveRadhika Apte forSister MidnightShahana Goswami forSantoshFiona Shaw forPark AvenueandHot MilkTeyana Taylor for One Battle After AnotherEmma Thompson forDead of WinterEmma Stone forBugoniaCynthia Erivo forWicked: For GoodMarion Cotillard forThe Ice TowerSally Hawkins forBring Her BackView image in fullscreenDead-eyed … Emma Stone in Bugonia.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyBest actorEthan Hawke forBlue MoonEthan Herisse for Nickel BoysBrandon Wilson for Nickel BoysTom Cruise forMission: Impossible – The Final ReckoningKieran Culkin for A Real PainTimothée Chalamet forA Complete Unknownand Marty SupremeRalph Fiennes forThe ReturnandThe ChoralJosh O’Connor for The Mastermind andWake Up Dead ManRobert Aramayo forI SwearandPalestine 36Cillian Murphy forSteveBest supporting actressAunjanue Ellis-Taylor for Nickel BoysElle Fanning for A Complete Unknown andPredator: BadlandsGeeta Agrawal Sharma for SantoshMina Svajger forLittle Trouble GirlsJudy Greer for Dead of WinterEmily Blunt forThe Smashing MachineLexi Venter forDon’t Let’s Go to the Dogs TonightMia Threapleton forThe Phoenician SchemeChase Infiniti for One Battle After AnotherFala Chen forBallad of a Small PlayerBest supporting actorGuy Pearce forThe BrutalistJoe Pesci forDay of the FightHugh Grant forBridget Jones: Mad About the BoyPaul Rudd forFriendshipSaša Tabaković forLittle Trouble GirlsJesse Plemons for BugoniaRussell Crowe forNurembergBenicio del Toro for One Battle After Another and The Phoenician SchemeDelroy Lindo forSinnersWilliam H Macy for Train DreamsView image in fullscreenWittily cast … Russell Crowe as Hermann Göring Nuremberg.Photograph: Kata Vermes/APBest cinematographyLol Crawley for The BrutalistDavid J Thompson forWarfareHélène Louvart forMotel DestinoJames Friend for Ballad of a Small PlayerDan Laustsen forFrankensteinRobbie Ryan for BugoniaAutumn Durald Arkapaw forThe Last ShowgirlAdolpho Veloso for Train DreamsJonathan Ricquebourg for The Ice TowerBruno Delbonnel for The Phoenician SchemeBest documentaryHung Up on a Dream: The Zombies DocumentaryPepeBlue Road: The Edna O’Brien StoryI Am Martin ParrErnest Cole: Lost and FoundOcean: With David AttenboroughA New Kind of WildernessGrenfell: Uncovered2000 Meters to AndriivkaColossal WreckBest screenplayAlan Bennett forThe ChoralPaul Andrew Williams forDragonflyEmbeth Davidtz for Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs TonightSteven Soderbergh forBlack BagNicholas Jacobson-Larson and Dalton Leeb for Dead of WinterPaul Thomas Anderson for One Battle After AnotherKelly Reichardt for The MastermindJustin Piasecki forRelayWilliam Gillies forHallow RoadAndrew DeYoung forFriendshipView image in fullscreenRelatable … Emma Thompson in Dead of Winter.Photograph: Lorcano film festivalBest debutLaura Carreira forOn FallingKaran Kandhari for Sister MidnightLeonardo Van Dijl forJulie Keeps QuietNadia Fall forBridesSaulė Bliuvaitė forToxicJulien Colonna forThe KingdomHarris Dickinson forUrchinEmbeth Davidtz for Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs TonightNadia Latif forThe Man in My BasementHarry Lighton forPillionMost likely to be overlooked by the boomer MSMGazerExplore more on these topicsFilmBest films of 2025Awards and prizesJafar PanahiDrama filmsDocumentary filmsWorld cinemaAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They were part of a long-awaitedrelease of documentsfrom Donald Trump’s justice department, which has been slammed for being only a partial release and heavily redacted.But one document, called EFTA00004179, consists of a formal FBI evidence cover sheet and 13 pages of handwritten investigative notes from an interview conducted on 2 May 2019. The interview subject is redacted, as is some of the content.Still, themes emerge; recruitment of girls, sexual encounters under the guise of “massages” and Epstein’s specific preferences regarding age and race.“Friends of [redacted] friends. Big Brazilian group. Desperate time,” the witness said, according to the notes. “Running out of girls.” The notes ostensibly refer to Epstein by the initials “JE”.Photos from the first batch of the Jeffrey Epstein filesRead moreA “dark-skinned Dominican” was brought in during this “desperate time” but “JE didn’t want Spanish or dark girl”, the notes read. The initials of the person who brought the underage girls to Epstein are redacted in the document. This person told Epstein that they had been “bringing young girls” to Epstein, but Epstein complained that “yea but not dark”.The witness said she was unsure whether Epstein had paid the procurer for the “service”, but that he had paid the girl.The notes then refer to a bathroom and “boobs and vaginas near bathtub … he got in shower and told her can’t just bring girls he doesn’t like. … told her keep looking for girls”.“At one point [redacted] witnessed him asking for ID to girl,’” the notes state, “wanted make sure under 18 b/c he wasn’t believing them b/c [redacted] messed up by bringing more older girls.”The notes contain the witness’s descriptions of sexual encounters, like Epstein making “crazy noises” and touching victims “roughly”.The document contains photographs of girls described in the notes as from 14 to 17 years old, around town and in bikinis on the beach. The notes reference New York locations: the “41st St Apartment” in Manhattan, locations in Rochester and Brighton Beach, New York, and a high school prom.The identity of the witness is not clear. The notes jibe with Epstein’s known interest in Brazilian children.US legislators say justice department is violating law by not releasing all Epstein filesRead moreMarina Lacerda, a Brazilian immigrant identified as “Minor-Victim 1” in the federal indictment, was a central witness who spoke publicly for the first time in September. She detailed her abuse by Epstein from the age of 14 and said she saw Donald Trump with Epstein more than once, though Trump has denied knowing of any of Epstein’s criminal actions.Her testimony ultimately resulted in Epstein’s indictment. Epstein later killed himself in a New York jail cell in 2019.Jean-Luc Brunel, who founded a modeling agency with Epstein’s support, wasarrestedin 2022 by French authorities on suspicion of trafficking and raping underage girls. Brunel was accused of supplying more than 1,000 girls and young women for Epstein to have sex with.In April 2019, Brunelvisitedan agency in Brazil that his company had worked with in the past to find new models to bring over to the US, according to a source who saw him in Brasilia.

The partial release drew swift rebukes from Capitol Hill and threats of legal action.Speaking in aninterviewon Fox News on Friday morning, the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said: “I expect we’re going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms, photographs and other materials associated with all of the investigations into Mr Epstein”.However, he said that he expected that Friday’s release would not include the full set of the Epstein files held by the Department of Justice.“I expect that we’re going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today several hundred thousand and then over the next couple weeks, I expect several hundred thousand more,” Blanche said. “There’s a lot of eyes looking at these and we want to make sure that when we do produce the materials we are producing, that we are protecting every single victim.”Photos from the first batch of the Jeffrey Epstein filesRead moreBlanche’s comments drew sharp rebuke from Capitol Hill, where top legislators threatened legal action “in the face of this violation of federal law”.The delay in releasing all the files appears to go against the language of theEpstein Files Transparency Act, which was passed by Congress and signed into law by Donald Trump on 19 November.Representatives Robert Garcia and Jamie Raskin, top Democrats on the House oversight committee, released astatementon Friday afternoon that said: “We are now examining all legal options in the face of this violation of federal law. The survivors of this nightmare deserve justice, the co-conspirators must be held accountable, and the American people deserve complete transparency from DoJ.”The law mandates the release of all of the department’s documents related to the investigation and prosecution of Epstein within 30 days of the date the law was enacted, with exceptions to only withhold files that contact certain information such as personal information of victims and materials that would impede an ongoing investigation or national security.Following Blanche’s remarks, Thomas Massie, the Republican representative who has spearheaded the effort in Congress to release the files alongside Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, posted an image of the text of the lawon X.In the post, Massie highlighted the phrase “not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this act” as well as the word “all” in the sentence that reads: “Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall, subject to subsection (b), make publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice”.Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, also released a statement in response to Blanche’s comments.“The law Congress passed and President Trump signed was clear as can be theTrump administrationhad 30 days to release ALL the Epstein files, not just some,” Schumer said. “Failing to do so is breaking the law. This just shows the Department of Justice, Donald Trump, and Pam Bondi are hellbent on hiding the truth.“Senate Democrats are working closely with attorneys for the victims ofJeffrey Epsteinand with outside legal experts to assess what documents are being withheld and what is being covered up by Pam Bondi,” he added. “We will not stop until the whole truth comes out.”Democrats release new Epstein photos ahead of DoJ transparency deadlineRead moreJennifer Freeman, special counsel at Marsh Law Firm represents the Epstein survivor Maria Farmer in her suit against the federal government. Freeman said in a statement: “I am pleased to hear that the Department of Justice is being careful to protect survivors. Yet I am very disappointed that the department will today release only about half of their materials, particularly because this release has been amply anticipated for a very long time.“Regardless, I look forward to finally seeing what I hope are the complete files of the survivors, including my client, Maria Farmer, who has been waiting for her records for nearly 30 years, since 1996 when she first reported Epstein and Maxwell’s child sex abuse, sex trafficking, and child pornography crimes to the FBI,” she said. “Had the FBI done their job, nearly 1,000 victims could have been spared, and 30 years of trauma avoided.”On social media, Ryan Goodman, a legal scholar and a law professor at New York University, echoed the sentiment,writing: “This is a violation of the Epstein Files Transparency Act.”Victoria Bekiempiscontributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

He was speaking during his annual call-in show with the nation, a carefully choreographed event that has become a fixture of Russia’s political calendar.0:41Ukraine launches drone attack on Russian oil tanker in Mediterranean – videoThe marathon broadcast, which lasted more than four hours, allows journalists and hand-picked members of the public to put questions directly to the president, projecting an image of openness while the agenda remains tightly controlled.A source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said Friday’s attack was a “new, unprecedented special operation”. However, they did not give further details of the attack, including how the SBU deployed a drone in the Mediterranean, from where it was launched, or which countries the drones could have flown over.The source said the cargo ship was empty at the time and no environmental threat resulted from the operation. The Ukrainian official did not say how the drones reached the ship, but said the operation involved “multi-stage” measures.They claimed the tanker, identified as the Qendil, had “sustained critical damage and cannot be used for its intended purpose”. The tanker was being used to circumvent western sanctions and fund Russia’s war chest, they claimed, making it “an absolutely legitimate target”.“The enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop, and will strike them anywhere in the world, wherever they may be,” the source added.The British maritime risk-management group, Vanguard, said: “This development reflects a stark expansion of Ukraine’s use of uncrewed aerial systems against maritime assets associated with Russia’s sanctioned oil export network.”Speaking to the online outlet Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian official justified the strike. “This tanker was used to circumvent sanctions and earn money that was used for the war against Ukraine. Therefore, from the point of view of international law and the laws and customs of war, this is an absolutely legitimate target for the SBU. The enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop and will beat him anywhere in the world, wherever he is.”According to Vessel Finder, the tankerwas last in port in Suez, Egypt, on 16 December and was off the coast of Libya when it turned back.Kyiv has claimed similar hits on Russia-linked tankers off Turkey’s Black Sea coast, after two empty oil tankers were hit by explosions.The Ukrainian attacks follow increasingly aggressive efforts by a number of countries against shadow fleet activities.This month, US forces boarded a sanctions-hit shadow tanker off Venezuela, and the Trump administration hasannounced a blockade of other shadow tankers in the countryas part of Donald Trump’s apparent efforts to force regime change.European countries have also boosted efforts against shadow tankers operating in their waters amid mounting concern over the security and environmental threat posed by the ageing vessels, which often travel without automatic identification systems to avoid being tracked.During the press conference Putin struck to his familiar hard-line on the war in Ukraine, reiterating the Kremlin’s determination to continue fighting until all of its conditions are met.The Russian leader insisted that Moscow had no plans to invade Europe, before adding that there would be no new “special military operations” provided Russia was treated with respect and “not deceived”. Putin also called the use of frozen Russian central bank assets to finance Ukraine’s reconstruction “robbery” and said Moscow would pursue legal challenges, adding that it would “find a suitable jurisdiction” for any cases.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

She replaces Christina McAnea, who has held the role since 2021 and has been close to Starmer’s government.In contrast, Egan, a social worker with decades of union experience, is a leftwinger who was expelled from Labour in 2022 after the party said she had shared articles on social media from Socialist Appeal, an organisation banned by Labour.In her article, Egan suggested a Labour leadership contest was likely in 2026 and warned against the party backing Streeting.“We will call time on our union’s inexcusable habit of propping up politicians who act against our interests, undermine our fundamental values and make our lives worse,” she said.“Like colleagues across the movement, I have in recent weeks been appalled by Wes Streeting’s attacks on resident doctors and their union. It is simply unacceptable for a Labour politician to describe striking workers as ‘morally reprehensible’.”Egan said she would engage open-mindedly with Streeting, but added: “Given the likelihood of a Labour leadership election in 2026, it’s important for me to be clear: swapping Starmer out for Streeting or anyone else from the right wing of the party would be no solution to the gigantic challenges facing the country. What’s needed is a radical change in approach based on the Labour movement’s core values.”The general secretary elect also indicated she would run the union in a different way, saying: “Some at the top of our movement have contributed to its decline by creating cultures where workers, ordinary members, are consistently disregarded by their own organisations.”In response to Egan’s criticism, Streeting’s spokesperson said: “Wes is aUnisonmember delivering with, and for, Unison members – from introducing the first ever fair pay agreements for care workers to ending the use of subcos [wholly-owned subsidiaries] for outsourcing staff and undermining their pay and conditions.“Wes has never closed the door on resident doctors or the BMA after the 28.9% pay rise he awarded them, and he won’t be doing that now. To act as though the strikes would have no impact on patients or other NHS staff would have been dishonest and irresponsible itself.”Egan’s comments suggest Unison may in future take an approach closer to Unite, led by Sharon Graham, which has been pressing Labour to stay closer to leftwing values.Egan said in her article: “It should be clear that putting members first doesn’t mean relegating or turning away from politics. That would be an abdication of responsibility. But it does mean bringing Unison’s support for the destructive right wing of the Labour party to an end.”The change at the top of Unison leaves Starmer facing concerted pressure on the left from key trade unions on top of the challenge from Zack Polanski’s Green party and Your Party, co-founded by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana.At the same time, Labour recently struck a compromise to water down its employment rights bill, whichpassed through the Lordsthis week, after pressure from the right and business groups. The government agreed for workers to qualify for protection against unfair dismissal after six months, instead of the current two years, despite day-one rights being aLabourmanifesto pledge. Unions agreed to this climbdown alongside the lifting of the compensation cap for unfair dismissal.The TUC has praised the bill for banning exploitative zero-hours contracts, bringing in sick pay for all, expanding parental and bereavement leave, repealing Tory anti-union laws, ensuring union access to workplaces, and establishing a social care fair pay agreement.But it emerged on Friday that Labour Together, a group that helped support Starmer’s leadership, had circulated a discussion paper that suggested scrapping many of the regulations in the recently passed bill to help boost the economy, while floating a new system of employment insurance alongside easier hiring and firing.A Labour Together spokesperson said: “Labour Together totally supports this week’s Employment Rights Act. This paper was a provocation for private discussion about how to build a political economy centred on technological change and innovation.“It looks beyond current policy, exploring ideas for spreading innovation and investment outside the south-east and how to support workers through technological change with a bigger welfare state rather than regulation alone. But given the welfare state we inherited from the Conservatives, that is far away. The Employment Rights Act is the best way to give workers much more security now.”Explore more on these topicsUnisonTrade unionsLabourKeir StarmerWes StreetingnewsShareReuse this content"

Three other US soldiers were also wounded in the attack.There are currently 1,000 US troops in Syria, posted with the mission to prevent the resurgence of IS in the region.Defense secretary Pete Hegseth suggested attacks against IS would continue.“This is not the beginning of a war – it is a declaration of vengeance,” Hegsethsaid on social media. “The United States of America, under President Trump’s leadership, will never hesitate and never relent to defend our people.”Hegseth added: “Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue.” He offered no other details about the strikes.The Americans killed last weekend were the first US casualties in the country since the fall of the dictator Bashar al-Assad last year. They were supporting counter-terrorism operations against the Islamic State when they were attacked by a lone gunman, per officials in both countries.On Thursday, Trump signed a law repealing a final batch of crippling economic sanctions on Syria, which were imposed to punish Assad for human rights abuses during the country’s civil war. After Assad was ousted in a December 2024, advocates pushed to have the sanctions lifted.Explore more on these topicsUS militarySyriaUS politicsTrump administrationUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

He said transforming young people’s prospects could do that.But he said that without substantive action, the UK was at risk of abandoning a whole generation to a life on benefits and could push them away from mainstream parties towards rightwing populism.After launching his review of why a quarter of 16- to 24-year-olds are not in education, employment or training earlier this week, Milburn said they faced a “perfect storm” in the youth labour market after the Covid crisis, with systemic failures and policy neglect in education and welfare over decades.“You write off a generation, you write off the country’s future,” he said. “You’ve got this sort of downward escalator: we’re plunging young people into a lifetime on benefits, rather than creating an upward escalator, with opportunities for people to learn and to earn.”The former cabinet minister is not shying away from recommending radical reform of the system in his final report, due in the summer. He said he was prepared to look at pressure on employers and the steep rise in mental health claims.Before the budget, Treasury insiders were among those who were concerned about the increase in youth rates of the minimum wage, amid fears they could be priced out of entry-level jobs.“We’ve got to look very carefully at exactly that,” Milburn said. “We’ve got to make sure that in a fragile youth labour market, and it’s been fragile for very many years, that public policy is providing the right incentives for employers to employ more young people, rather than less.”Asked whether he thought businesses had been squeezed too much by the government, which put up national insurance at the last budget, he added: “I hear that being said. I’m going to examine the evidence, and we will reach a conclusion.”Milburn also wants to address sensitive issues around the mental health of young people, citing it as a reason for a sharp rise in sickness benefits in recent years.“We’ve got to be careful that just because you’ve got anxiety or depression, that automatically puts you on to the downward escalator into the world of benefits,” he said.“We’re at real risk in the debate that’s taking place sometimes, of a new currency developing which says that work is bad for people’s mental health, whereas the opposite of that is true, which is good work in particular, is extremely good for people’s mental health.“When I talk about these uncomfortable truths that the review is going to have to confront, you know, this is one of them.”The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has ordered a clinical review of the diagnosis of mental health conditions in England, which will inform Milburn’s review.However, the Labour veteran said 16- to 24-year-olds were a “generation under duress”. They faced a different world from their predecessors, who had a “social transaction” with the state that no longer existed.“It’s very easy to play the blame game ... but we’ve got a job to act as custodians, to make sure that young people have got the right opportunities in front of them,” he added, saying that the government and business needed to step up.They had a responsibility, in particular, to prepare younger generations for “tomorrow’s potential tsunami” – the advance of technology – which could send further shockwaves through the youth labour market.“You can’t simply say, King Canute-like, we’re going to resist the forward march of technology. That’s not possible. What we have got to do is equip people to be able to adapt, be agile enough, to have enough resilience, to be able to succeed in that labour market,” he said.With Labour losing support among younger voters, many of them disillusioned by a political system they feel is entrenching generational inequality, Milburn said young people were deserting the mainstream parties.“If young people start feeling society isn’t interested in me, to this question of how they’re thinking of potentially voting in future, then there’s an obvious quid pro quo,” he said, suggesting that they could turn to Reform UK instead.“That should be something that people would want to avoid, particularly people who are concerned about progressive politics. It’s pretty obvious that that social contract is being broken”.Milburn, who is close to Streeting – regarded as a potential successor to Starmer if he stands down – urged the government to be more optimistic about what it could deliver. “The centre-left of politics only wins when it creates a sense of possibility about the future,” he said.“So my very strong advice would be generate hope for the future. This [review] is about saying the future can be better than the present and better than the past. It is about making sure that we’re investing in the future generation. The biggest deficit in the country is the shortage of hope.”Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, is planning to proposefurther welfare reformnext year, after the government abandoned a significant part of its bill in June under pressure from Labour MPs.Milburn, whose review is reporting to McFadden, said the government had “self-evidently” got its attempts to win MPs round on welfare badly wrong. “Framing welfare reform as a cost-out measure wasn’t a sensible approach to take, and it produced the inevitable result,” he said.“If you want to reduce welfare bills, the only way of doing that is to provide more opportunities for people to learn and to earn first.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyLabourYoung peopleWelfarenewsShareReuse this content"

We had been awaiting the plans to implement a previous 100% figure and this decision leaves disabled people feeling betrayed and excluded, and questioning the government’s commitment to disability equality,” he said.“Requiring 100% of all new-build homes to be built to improved accessibility standards, with 10% to wheelchair user standards, would have been the right thing to do, creating a level playing field for developers and sending a strong signal that our housing stock must change to meet the needs of our older and disabled citizens.“The government’s failure of resolve and watered down proposal leaves a bitter taste, raising questions about whose interests are being served.”Millie Brown, deputy director for homes at the Centre for Ageing Better, said the 40% target was an “important step in the right direction”, although she acknowledged it was a “step back” from the Conservative government’s previous plans.“Of course, the announcement could have gone further,” she said. “We would hope that local authorities are encouraged to view 40% as the minimum to achieve and exceed.”The government’sproposed changes to the planning systemsay that 40% of new homes should meet the M4(2) standard, but that councils should “set requirements for M4(2) that meet or exceed their locally assessed need for this housing”.This category of home accessibility requires step-free access, wider doors and entrance-level toilets to make them adaptable for people with limited mobility and older people.Homes built to the M4(3) standard must be fully accessible for full-time wheelchair users, with ample turning spaces and accessible bathrooms and kitchens.Many local authorities set their own targets on this – since 2015, in London the standard has been 90% of homes at M4(2) and 10% at M4(3).But rates fluctuate sharply across the country – analysis by the Centre for Ageing Better found that people living in the East Midlands or north-east of England were six times less likely to be living in a fully accessible home compared with people living in London.Just 13% of homes in England were fully accessible, the research found.The housing secretary, Steve Reed, said the changes to the planning system were part of his plan to “get Britain building” and that “we owe it to the people of this country to do everything within our power to build the homes they deserve”.Mark Gale, policy manager at the disability charity Sense, said he wanted the government reconsider the accessibility targets.“We’re disappointed to hear the government is cutting back on accessibility targets for new homes,” he said. “Inaccessible housing can be a huge barrier to independence for disabled people with complex needs. Sadly, there is often far too little suitable housing stock available, meaning some people have no choice but to live in homes that don’t meet their needs.”The Ministry ofHousing, Communities and Local Government has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsDisabilityHousingPlanning policyEnglandOlder peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

Most people in Gaza live in tents or other substandard accommodation asIsraeldestroyed much of the housing and civilian infrastructure during its two-year war.Israel has partly eased restrictions on the entry of aid since an October ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, but delivery was still limited and inconsistent, the UN said.“No areas are classified in famine,” said the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) initiative, used by the UN to monitor food crises. The IPCfirst declared a famine in parts of Gaza in Augustafter Israeli restrictions of food aid into the territory led to mass starvation, with at least 450 people starving to death, according to the Gaza ministry of health.More than 9,000 children in Gaza treated for acute malnutrition in October, UN saysRead moreThe monitor said that despite the end of the famine classification, the situation in Gaza still remained dire, with “the entire Gaza Strip classified in emergency”. According to the IPC’s five-phase classification system, the emergency stage is just a step below famine and occurs when households have “very high acute malnutrition and excess mortality” due to lack of food.Before the ceasefire, Israel maintained a severe blockade on the entry of aid into Gaza,described as“systematic obstruction by Israel” by the UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, Tom Fletcher, in August.After the US-mediated ceasefire took effect in October, Israel began to allow more aid from the UN and its partners to enter.“Following the ceasefire … the latest IPC analysis indicates notable improvements in food security and nutrition compared to the August 2025 analysis, which detected famine,” the IPC said.Aid workers have said that the deal remains fragile, however, with Israel carrying out near-daily strikes in the territory and both sides trading accusations of ceasefire violations.About 1.6 million people were expected to face “crisis” levels of hunger in the next four months, the IPC said, warning that if the ceasefire broke down, the strip could slip back into famine.Israel has vehemently denied the accusations that there is famine in Gaza and that it is restricting the entry of aid. Israel’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, said in a post on X on Friday that in the face of “overwhelming and unequivocal evidence, even the IPC had to admit that there is no famine in Gaza”.Cogat, the Israeli body in charge of humanitarian affairs in Gaza, said the IPC report “portrays a distorted, biased, and unfounded picture of the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip”.The humanitarian community and the UN have widely acknowledged famine in Gaza, and the IPC is considered the global authority on food crises.Oxfam said hunger in Gaza remained at an “appalling” level and accused Israel of blocking humanitarian groups from bringing aid into the territory. “Oxfam alone has $2.5m worth of aid including 4,000 food parcels, sitting in warehouses just across the border. Israeli authorities refuse it all,” Nicolas Vercken, the campaigns and advocacy director at Oxfam France, said in a statement.Hundreds of thousands of people are still enduring torrential rains and the cold in frayed tents. Pictures of flooded encampments at the start of winter have circulated on social media. The threat of disease outbreaks remains high as hygiene conditions are subpar in the crowded tent settlements.On Wednesday, a 29-day-old baby died of hypothermia, according to Gaza’s ministry of health. “Children are losing their lives because they lack the most basic items for survival,” said Bilal Abu Saada, the nursing team supervisor at Nasser hospital, which received the baby before it died.The ceasefire remains fragile, with negotiators still unable to bridge the differences necessary to move to the second phase of the deal – meant to lead to a permanent peace.The US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is due to meet senior Qatari, Egyptian and Turkish officials in Miami on Friday to discuss how to move to the second part of the ceasefire deal, Israeli media reported.Under the second phase, Israel is supposed to withdraw from the 53% of Gaza it still controls, while a transitional authority will replace Hamas as the governing power, and an international stabilisation force is to be deployed in the territory.The Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, warned on Thursday that delays in moving to the second phase of the deal, as well as ceasefire violations, “endanger the entire process”.Explore more on these topicsGazaUnited NationsPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Every country in the world reserves the same option. We just simply have more power than some of them.”The recentseizure of a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuelahas led to a full-scale upheaval in the “dark fleet” that ferried oil from the heavily sanctioned country, according to industry data shared with the Guardian, in a move that experts have said will cut significant revenues to Maduro’s government.Of more than 30 sanctioned tankers that operate in Venezuelan waters, many are now sheltering in the Indian Ocean in order to avoid interdiction. An analysis of their tracking data provided by Windward AI, a maritime data company, “reveals a significant shift in maritime activity, with vessels rerouting to the Indian Ocean to evade US naval forces”.Of 59 “high-risk vessels”, however, “many are trapped in the blockade zone or engaging in location manipulation,” the report said.Asked at a news conference on Friday whether the United States was planning regime change, Rubio said: “It is clear that the current status quo with the Venezuelan regime is intolerable for the United States,” he said. “So, yes, our goal is to change that dynamic.”Experts say that blockade makes a direct US attempt to unseat Maduro more likely as the Venezuelan regime is slowly starved of oil revenues from sales to China.US wargames played out scenarios for Maduro’s fall. None of them ended well for VenezuelaRead more“The blockade of these sanctioned vessels provides an additional source of leverage for the United States,” said Jason Marczak, vice-president and senior director at the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, in a recent analysis.“By cutting off a significant part of the regime’s income, the United States gains an additional chip to put on the table in discussions on ending Maduro’s dictatorship in Venezuela. This move elevates the Caribbean campaign from a counter-drug operation to one that is also cutting off the financial lifelines to Maduro, who the United States has designated as the leader of[putative drug trafficking organisation] the Cartel de los Soles.”Trump refused to say whether ousting Maduro was the ultimate goal in his military offensive, which has been escalating for four months, with about 15,000 troops positioned at Venezuela’s doorstep and attacks on vessels that have already killed more than 100 people in the Caribbean and the Pacific.But Susie Wiles, his chief of staff, said in an interview published in Vanity Fair this week that Trump “wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries uncle”, undermining the administration’s claims that law enforcement was the key goal of the US military buildup.During his news conference, Rubio confirmed that the US was trying to put pressure on Maduro through the campaign of strikes against boats that the US has said were carrying drugs.“He knows exactly what I want … He knows better than anybody,” said Trump, who added that there would be additional seizures of oil tankers, such as the Skipper last week, which was carrying about 2m barrels of heavy Venezuelan crude and was reportedly bound for China.Maduro called the seizure an act of “piracy”, and his regime, without providing details, this weekaccused the government of Trinidad and Tobago of taking part in it, on the same day the Caribbean country announced it would allow the US military access to its airports in the coming weeks following the recent installation of a radar system.Inside the White House, several top Trump aides have enthusiastically thrown their support behind more direct action in Venezuela. They include his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, who the Washington Post reported had initially pushed for an anti-drug campaign in Mexico before backing the Venezuela strikes, as well as Rubio, whose parents are Cuban immigrants, and has been a consistent critic of the Venezuelan regime for decades.“The national interest of the United States, specifically when it comes to Venezuela, is as follows,” he said. “We have a regime that’s illegitimate, that cooperates with Iran, that cooperates with Hezbollah, that cooperates with narco-trafficking and narco-terrorist organisations.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyVenezuelaAmericasTrump administrationMarco RubioDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

A couple on their way home from midnight mass were also attacked in the early hours of Christmas Day 2024 in London’s West End.View image in fullscreenAiden Chapman.Photograph: Family/PAThe jury was told of desperate scenes, terror and heroism as one man shielded his partner from being struck by the car with his own body.Four other people were seriously injured, with the rampage ending only when Gilheaney, who drove at more than 100mph to elude police, crashed his car.Gilheaney, who is British, was found guilty of Chapman’s murder, one count of wounding with intent, two counts of attempted murder, and one count of causing grievous bodily harm, after a trial at the Old Bailey.His car struck Marcelo Basbus-Garcia after reversing into him at high speed, and he also drove at Miguel Waihrich while he was tending to his injured partner, Basbus-Garcia. Waihrich told jurors he had made eye contact with Gilheaney as he drove at them a second time, while Basbus-Garcia was unconscious and “covered in blood”.Waihrich said: “I remember his eyes and the position of his hands on the wheel, I remember his face and me crying for him to stop, and he didn’t stop.”The couple had been to midnight mass in Piccadilly and were on Great Windmill Street when they saw Gilheaney shouting, naked from the waist up, in the middle of the road. Gilheaney got in his car and drove off, then returned and headed towards the couple.Waihrich told the court: “It was very high speed, the way he reversed. It was so fast every person in that street was in panic – we started to run.”People ran for their lives as Basbus-Garcia was knocked to the ground. He told the Old Bailey: “The car came after me – but it would be fair to say that he [Gilheaney] was after everybody in that street. The last thing I remember was being hit by the car. The last thing I remember, actually, is being terrified.”Waihrich ran over to his partner, who was bleeding and unconscious, and saw the car returning. He told the court: “He [Gilheaney] stopped and looked at me. He is coming in my direction, I try to make signs, gesture and say: ‘Stop it, please.’ The car doesn’t stop and accelerated towards us, and I decided to protect Marcelo’s head with my body as a shield. I’m just counting the seconds before the final attack.”The prosecutor, Crispin Aylett KC, said the attack on Waihrich and Basbus-Garcia was “clearly a homophobic attack”. Afterwards, Gilheaney ploughed into Chapman and his friend Tyrone Itorho as they crossed Shaftesbury Avenue.Anthony Gilheaney.Photograph: Metropolitan police serviceChapmandied in hospital on New Year’s Eve, having been thrown into the air after being struck by the car. Doctors described the brain injuries he suffered as “unsurvivable”.Chapman’s parents said: “Words cannot describe the pain and anguish Anthony Gilheaney has caused us by his evil actions. No amount of justice or prison time will ever be enough to compensate for our loss.“Gilheaney has taken the best part of us. He has left us with a dark void in our lives that can never be filled. He took our only son from us. Something we will never get over. Something we will never forgive.”Minutes before the rampage, Gilheaney, who had been drinking heavily, shouted racial abuse at an Asian man before driving into him, then getting out of his car and attacking him.He also crashed into a taxi, then mounted the pavement where a family pushing a child in a pushchair had to run to get out of the way. Three people escaped by pinning themselves against a wall.A witness described Gilheaney as “ping-ponging from side to side along the street” in between using his car as a weapon.His blood alcohol when tested several hours later was more than one and a half times the legal limit and he is estimated to have hit people at more than 30mph. He had been drinking in Bar Rumba, leaving at about 12.40am on Christmas morning. A witness said Gilheaney was “very angry, his whole body was tensed and primed”.His Mercedes had alcohol bottles, including vodka, strewn on the floor, as well as mixer cans.Between March 2012 and 2023 Gilheaney accumulated six convictions for dangerous driving and had been disqualified twice, including at the time of the attacks.DCI Wayne Jolley, of the Metropolitan police, said: “Gilheaney got behind the wheel of his car in a drunken rage, determined to inflict as much damage as possible. He targeted innocent people, who were out celebrating Christmas Day and killed 25-year-old Aiden Chapman.“He has refused to acknowledge the seriousness of his offences, making every attempt to portray himself as a troubled victim. I commend the jury for seeing through this act.”Gilheaney, from Harlow, Essex, had denied murder. He faces a mandatory life sentence and the judge will decide on 30 January the minimum term he must serve before release can be considered.Explore more on these topicsCrimeLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In the water, it feels strong and loving.But back on land, acrossSydneyand the rest of Australia, that unity is taut and fragile. Undercurrents of political division, of a politicisation of a community’s grief, of a fraying social cohesion, are breaking through the surface.The water helps to forget. But some things cannot be undone.Fifteen innocents were shot dead here in minutes by high-powered rifles allegedly carried by the father and son, Sajid and Naveed Akram. Sajid was shot dead. Naveed was shot too, but survived. From hospital,he has been charged with dozens of offences, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder.View image in fullscreenThe park footbridge at Bondi, a scene of violence less than a week ago, has reopened.Photograph: Steve Markham/APThe footbridge from where the gunmen fired has been reopened. On the wall, someone has sketched a menorah in chalk. There is a bee drawn too,in remembrance of the youngest victim, 10-year-old Matilda.But the bridge that was once the passage of thousands of innocent visits to the beach each day will be forever marked now. A stain that cannot be erased, a memory that cannot be forgotten.The park too: the site of Hanukah events for years, the place of kids’ birthday parties and work barbecues and scratch games of cricket, where exhausted City to Surf runners sprawl on the grass after the finish of Sydney’s classic 14km run and van-life nomads hang their washing.Bondi has long been the spiritual home of Sydney’s Jews. Now it will be a place of remembrance and grief | Michael VisontayRead moreA city on high alertThe attack was recorded on dozens of phone and dashboard cameras. The calm cruelty of the shooters, firing round after pitiless round into a defenceless crowd of men, women and children lighting candles in celebration of their faith.At one point one can be seen to halt firing at the Hanukah celebration, turning back towards the road.He appears to gesture at people off-camera to wave them away but he does not raise his weapon. He does not fire.He turns around, and starts firing again.Dozens of Jewish voices have said an attack of this sort, aimed specifically at Jews, in the heart of a Jewish community, wasentirely predictable, if not inevitable.0:47Hundreds return to waters of Bondi Beach in paddle-out tribute to victims of mass shooting – videoAustralia has seen asurge in antisemitic attackssince 2023 – including an arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue – some domestic in origin, some allegedlyorchestrated by organised crime, others allegedlyengineered from Iran.For many outside Australia’s Jewish community, these were seen as isolated events, the vile work of a deranged fringe, of outliers and the alienated.But for those within the community, this was very different: this was a coordinated series of assaults on their very being, overlaid with dark historical memories.There was ashrinking space to be Jewishin this country.As those attacks roiled the country, Eli Schlanger, assistant rabbi of theBondiChabad, urged his congregation: “In the fight against antisemitism the way forward is to be more Jewish, act more Jewish, and appear more Jewish.”Schlanger organised the Hanukah by the Sea event on Sunday night.His was the first body to be identified.His youngest child is three months old.Mass killings are exceedingly rare in Australia. The Bondi attacks have drawn immediate comparison withthe Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania in 1996, in which 35 people were killed.But this attack is different, and it has taken place in a different Australia, a place more divided, more politically tribalised, less able to find consensus and common ground.View image in fullscreenA poster of 10-year-old Matilda, the youngest victim of the Bondi Beach shooting. She was buried on Thursday.Photograph: David Gray/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the aftermath of Port Arthur, the conservative prime minister, John Howard, had broad political support for sweeping gun control reforms, including bans on semi-automatic and automatic weapons, and a government-funded compulsory buyback that took 650,000 firearms off the streets.Australia’s current prime minister, Anthony Albanese, hasannounced a similar measure, but faces a different political climate. Even before the first funeral, he was being directly, personally blamed for the attack.“Your government did nothing to stop the spread of antisemitism in Australia,”the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said.“You let the disease spread and the result is the horrific attacks on Jews we saw today.”The conservative former treasurerJosh Frydenberg – currently out of parliament but considered a future prime ministerial candidate – said: “Our prime minister … has allowed Australia to be radicalised on his watch.“It is time for him to accept personal responsibility for the death of 15 innocent people, including a 10-year-old child.”Sydney remains on high alert. In the south-west of the city on Thursday night,seven men were dramatically arrested– cable-tied on the side of the road – on suspicion they were driving to Bondi with an intent to commit a “violent act”. They were later released pending further investigations.On Friday, police were called tothe funeral of two Bondi victims – Boris and Sofia Gurman– over reports, ultimately false, that a man was carrying a weapon.And on the same day the NSW premierproposed sweeping anti-protest laws, including a power to effectively ban all protests where the government believes they could “add to community disharmony … a combustible situation”.View image in fullscreenFloral tributes at Bondi, where vigils have taken place daily since Sunday’s attack.Photograph: James D Morgan/Getty ImagesBefore the gun reform announcement Albanese’s plans has been criticised as an “attempted diversion” by none other than Howard himself, defying overwhelming expert opinion that, once a global gold standard,Australia’s gun laws have loosened and fractured.Sajid Akram held a licence for six high-powered rifles. His son had come to the attention of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisationas long as six years ago, according to police, because of “associations” with known preachers of Islamist extremism.On Sunday, Sajid Akram packed four of his six rifles in a car and drove with them to Bondi. Until he opened fire on innocents he had not broken any laws.‘An Aussie hero’Amid the fierce debate around antisemitism, social cohesion and political unity, it appeared symbolic that the principal resistor of an attack on a Jewish festival wasan Arabic-speaking, Syrian-born Muslim.As the gunmen fired into the crowd, Ahmed al-Ahmed, unarmed but unhesitating, risked his life to save the lives of others unknown to him.Phone camera footage shows him lunging at the elder Akram and wrestling his rifle from him. Ahmed menaces the disarmed Akram with his own weapon, forcing the shooter backwards. But he does not shoot, instead, he lays the firearm gently against a tree.1:52Prime minister meets the ‘Australian hero’ Ahmed al-Ahmed in hospital – videoAhmed’s actions represent an image Australia has clung to, has celebrated, of the diverse, multicultural country it aspires to be.“Ahmed al-Ahmed represents the best of our country,” the prime minister said of the father of two, newly a citizen of his adopted homeland.At Ahmed’s modest tobacconists by a suburban train station, friends have laid flowers bearing messages: “thank you”, “we love you”.One reads “you are an Aussie hero”. A sign taped to his door says, “we are so very proud of you”.The footage of Ahmed’s intervention made a stark contrast set against the savage violence.‘We are all human beings first’: Jews and Muslims embrace at vigils for those killed in Bondi beach terror attackRead moreAs he walked towards the gunfire, he turned to his cousin. “I’m going to die,” he said. “Please see my family and tell them that I went down to save people’s lives.”Ahmed did not die.

They are “basically all relatives, close friends or big givers [donors]”, said one EU diplomat, who asked not to be named. “That’s always been the US tradition, but it’s never been quite this blatant. These are like Maga disciples.”Others have been blunter. “The craziness of these nominations reflects a total contempt for human dignity, custom, and the law. Only whim matters,” said a former French envoy to the US, Gérard Araud, after one pick was announced.Political appointees – often a euphemism for big supporters and donors – are a longstanding feature of US diplomacy and the least that can be said of the current crop, the last of whom arrived in October and November, is they are no exception.Many are multimillionaires, some billionaires. Together, they have poured tens of millions of dollars into the Maga coffers. Nearly all have sung the president’s praises long and loud. Almost none have any kind of diplomatic experience at all.Trump’sUS security strategy, published in December, claims Europe faces imminent cultural collapse as migration turns parts of it “majority non-European” while the EU “undermines sovereignty”, censors free speech and “suppresses political opposition”.View image in fullscreenCharles Kushner, right, joins Donald Trump and other members of the Kushner-Trump family on the White House’s South Lawn in Washington in June.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesAmong those charged with persuading the old continent to change course is Charles Kushner, 71, a real-estate magnate with an estimated net worth of $3.2bn (£2.4bn). He is also the father of Jared Kushner, the husband of Trump’s daughter Ivanka.In 2005, Kushnerpère, the US ambassador to Paris since May,pleaded guiltyto 16 counts of tax evasion, making false statements and witness tampering (notably hiring a sex worker to seduce his brother-in-law, who was testifying against him).Kushner spent 14 months in prison before being pardoned by Trump in 2020. Three years later he expressed his gratitude by donating $1m to Trump’s Make America Great Again Inc Super Pac.Tasked chiefly with lobbying Paris to relax French and EU regulations disliked by the US,Kushner instead made headlineswith an open letter to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, criticising a lack of official action to tackle the “dramatic rise of antisemitism in France”.More recently, days after Washington promised backing for “patriotic parties” as part of its effort to “make Europe great again”, theambassador received Marine Le Penand Jordan Bardella of France’s far-right National Rally (RN) for consultations.“He’s here to do a job, and from Washington’s standpoint he’s doing it pretty well,” a source at the Quai d’Orsay, France’s foreign ministry, said of Kushner. “He’s close to Trump. They go back a long way. He’s not going to be questioning his remit.”View image in fullscreenAndrew Puzder has defended the US security strategy, saying non-EU immigration was leading to ‘a decline in cultural values’ in Europe.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesOther Trump loyalists dispatched to Europe include Andrew Puzder as the US ambassador to the EU. A former chief executive of the company that franchises the fast-food chains Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr, Puzderthis month defendedthe new US security strategy.Non-EU immigration was leading to “a decline in cultural values”, he said, adding that the US did not want see Europe lose its identity. “How much of their sovereignty did [EU member states] give up to be part of an economic union?” Puzder asked.View image in fullscreenStacey Feinberg, pictured in 2014, recently called Donald Trump ‘the greatest US president since George Washington’.Photograph: Tonya Wise/Invision/APThe US ambassador to Luxembourg is Stacey Feinberg, an entrepreneur, investor, Republican donor, Broadway producer, heiress and good friend of the late far-right activist Charlie Kirk.She recently calledTrump “the greatest US president since George Washington”.Tilman Fertitta has been Washington’s man in Rome since the summer.

The ambassador’s 117-metre (384ft) megayacht, complete with two helipads and two pools, waslaunched this month.A more recent arrival is Ken Howery, a co-founder of PayPal, who faces the particularly delicate challenge of convincing Denmark that, in Trump’s words, “US ownership and control” of the former Danish colony of Greenland is “an absolute necessity”.AfterDonald Trump Jr’s visit to Nuuk in a Trump-branded plane last winter, then another, by the US vice-president, JD Vance, to an American military base, an allegedUS influence campaignon the island led Denmark tosummonthe US charge d’affaires in August.View image in fullscreenEarly Danish impressions of the new US ambassador to Denmark, Ken Howery, seem cautiously optimistic.Photograph: Mads Claus Rasmussen/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty ImagesHowery, who arrived in Copenhagen at the end of October, has since embarked on a non-stop charm offensive, with social media footage showing him telling embassy staff he had loved the Danish capital since he first visited as a 20-year-old backpacker.Early impressions in Copenhagen seem cautiously optimistic, despite the aggressive tone of Trump’s new security strategy. “The shared impression is that he [Howery] is a nice fellow, calm, not like other people in the Maga community,” said a source.But the source added that Howery would still have to do what his boss said. And the US ambassador has wasted little time, visiting Nuuk in December for an annual meeting. “Ambassador Howery is already looking forward to next year,” the embassy said afterwards.An even more recent Washington dispatch is the new US ambassador to Greece, the erstwhile Fox News host and former Trump Jr fiancee Kimberly Guilfoyle, who arrived in Athens amid much glitz and diplomatic glamour in November.View image in fullscreenWhile Kimberly Guilfoyle’s direct connection to Donald Trump’s inner circle may be useful, her actions have alarmed some in Athens.Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images“You will enjoy this journey,” she said at a welcoming party organised by a friend, the Greek pop star Konstantinos Argyros. “I will not disappoint the US. I will not disappoint Greece,” Guilfoyle added.Since then, invites have streamed in – up to 300 a day, one diplomat confided. Would-be suitors may perhaps be enthused by Guilfoyle’s joke that while she is in Athens she may also “work on getting a new husband”. (She was previously married to Gavin Newsom, now the governor of California, and the businessman Eric Villency.)A former minister told the Guardian he had been astounded to see male MPs tripping over themselves to shake Guilfoyle’s hand when she made her first visit to the Greek parliament. “It was, frankly, embarrassing,” they said.But while Guilfoyle’s direct connection to Trump’s inner circle may be useful, her actions have alarmed some. The new ambassador has not shied from crossing diplomatic red lines. Barely a month into the job, the fierce Trump loyalist openly raised concerns over the “unfortunate” extent of China’s influence in Athens’ port of Piraeus.“She is shrewd, but also very blunt and as undiplomatic as Trump,” a businessman who has watched Guilfoyle in action said. “Her approach is very transactional.”The US president’s good relations with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, have also created concern that Guilfoyle’s enthusiasm could extend to rapprochement with Turkey, a prospect raised publicly by Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Ankara.“We wouldn’t be surprised if there was a ‘hot incident’ in the Aegean allowing the two ambassadors to step in and ‘fix’ relations between two squabbling Nato members,” said a source. “It sounds crazy – but doesn’t Trump want the Nobel peace prize?”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationEuropeEuropean UnionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gone is the early morning scramble to get through to a harassed GP receptionist for help. Patients now contact theirdoctor’s AIto explain their ailments. It quickly cross-checks the information against the patient’s medical history and provides a pre-diagnosis, putting the human GP in a position to decide what to do next.In face-to-face consultations an AI may listen in the background, weigh the facts of the patient’s case against thousands of medical studies, propose a course of drugs based on the full depth of the latest medical research, which the human doctor could never fully digest. It provides a second opinion for the doctor, who can assess its proposals before deciding how to act.The public may not be wholly averse to this change. Thirty-eight per cent of people favour using AI to speed up triage in the NHS although 52% prefer humans, citing trust and wanting personal interaction, polling by Ipsos in October 2025 found.Medical screening becomes highly sophisticated and perhaps a little invasive. Doctors could be sent details of your diet and vital statistics tracked by wearable devices. Smart toilets may even analyse your bowel movements. Medicines could be produced exactly tailored to your body and its needs.If it all works, diseases are spotted quicker and medicines are more accurately prescribed, but the combination of one AI and one human medic creates a new tension. The best doctors become those most adept at interpreting the outputs of the AIs. Medical schools change their teachings to focus more on managing AI medics, and politicians wrestle with how to overhaul medical regulation and ethics.The future of AIThe rivals racing to create super-intelligence.

Solicitors preparing for trial have learned to delegate the legwork of unearthing case law and planning arguments to an AI, which proposes the best approach for a barrister to take in court. The current problems of AIs making up case law, as happened at least 95 times in July and August,accordingto trackers, have been ironed out. The new, more robust artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems compress days of work into hours, leaving the human solicitor only to check the AI’s brief to the human barrister.Next, amid a courts backlog, pressure grows to largely replace barristers too. An experiment is launched allowing adversarial AIs to argue cases in front of a human judge and jury. The results prove compelling. Cases are concluded at a fraction of the cost to the taxpayer and much faster. But numerous miscarriages of justice soon emerge. Campaigners for people wrongly imprisoned begin to demand greater transparency about the inner workings and biases of the AI lawyers.Having unleashed AGI, governments and companies have to constantly surveil the autonomous systems, employing people to sit at banks of screens, shutting down dangerous behaviour, dispatching good AIs to hunt down bad AIs.The morning routineView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianView image in fullscreenAGI Comics—HF-edits Morning-2Illustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianGlasses, wake me up at 7amView image in fullscreenAGI Comics—HF-edits Morning-3Illustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianView image in fullscreenAGI Comics—HF-edits Morning-4Illustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianWAIT! … Were there any eggs in the fridge?!View image in fullscreenAGI Comics—HF-edits Morning-5Illustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianHe’s asleep now, I can’t ask him.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianHe’s clumsy when he hasn’t eaten his breakfast eggs.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianWhat if he drops me? Replaces me?! There’s a new set of glasses out tomorrow!!!Wearable AI devices, such as glasses, watches and rings, have become ubiquitous. They function as extra senses, spotting things in our environment that we miss, like a lack of eggs in the fridge, or recording our interactions to remind us later of things we forget. But then they also start to do things for us – and maybe even worry about not doing a good enough job.“First principle is, you have a bunch of these AI agents that do things for you,” says David Shrier, professor of practice, AI and innovation at Imperial Business School. “These will be specially programmed AIs that have different areas of expertise and are customised – adapted to you and your specific needs. So they learn … what you want and they go and do it for you.”You might start your day with the help of an information agent. “It goes out, it curates the articles and when you wake up in the morning and as you are brushing your teeth, it’s reading out to you summaries and interpretation of the news. It can provide some deeper understanding for you.”This second-guessing based on deep algorithmic familiarity extends to your breakfast. If you have been wearing augmented reality glasses, the AI will have noticed when you opened the fridge that you’ve run out of eggs. When you go downstairs at 7am your phone lights up to say an Amazon drone has delivered you some eggs.Shrier adds that all of this requires consent, meaning “you know what you are allowing the AI to understand and know about you, and you get to easily opt out if you don’t want your data shared.”AI on the farmView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianOld MacdonaldView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The Guardianhad a farmView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianAI-AI-OA farmer’s rounds, checking on the health of livestock, crops, feed supplies and machinery – which can take from dawn to dusk – become far less onerous. With cameras and sensors rigged to trees, barns, fence posts and itinerant robots, every farm delivers a torrent of data to help increase productivity and animal welfare. Already, in 2025, an AI model is under development to detect early infections in cows by tracking subtle shifts in their social behaviour. A herd in Somerset is being filmed around the clock to train a model to predict if an animal is in the early stages of mastitis, which affects milk production and is an animal welfare problem. A decade later and with data harnessed from millions of farms around the world, AGI advises not only what to plant and when, but how to build stronger ecosystems, and improve soil health. AGI-powered robots could stalk the fields rooting out weeds and reducing the need for herbicides.Less work, more playView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The Guardian… and this was called an office …View image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianFilled with people and chairs and phones and desks and carpet and water coolers and paperView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianThis was a board meeting.Yeah, they look bored!Sports clubs, live entertainment venues and travel agents boom as AGI transforms work, helping millions of white-collar workers whisk through their tasks leaving time for a new life of leisure – at least that is one theory.In the early years of AGI only a few people are made fully redundant by full automation, and most stay in work. For a while people retain the same 40-hour working week and simply get more work done.At work, AI could act like a “buddy” or a coach in meetings, says Shrier. It might advise you to go easy on another attender because they look a little stressed.“During your meeting you’re getting this sort of coaching and augmentation that makes you better at interacting.” As the chat ends, the AI sends you a list of next steps to take following this meeting – and slots it into your project plan. As you get to your desk, your professional AI assistant is bringing you the documents and spreadsheets you need to deliver.AI-augmented economies could grow sharply. But soon people realise they can afford to work less.The 15-hour week, which the economist John Maynard Keynes in 1930 predicted would happen by 2030, becomes a reality. Leisure becomes less about rest and orientates towards creative activities, human-to-human socialising and time caring for children or elderly family members, academics havesuggested.“If you believe the premise that humans are social animals, they’re going to have to do something,” the US sports and entertainment mogul Ari Emanuelsaidin October as he announced new investments in live entertainment. “They can’t just sit at home, so they’ll go to music, they’ll go to sports and they’ll go to my live events.”But the shift to more spare time also creates a new problem: mass boredom. A generation conditioned for the nine to five and which had derived satisfaction from now-automated tasks such as populating spreadsheets or writing reports, struggles to adjust. Some people take to the new leisure like happy retirees and report increased wellbeing, but others struggle with mental health problems."

Both film and man changed my lifeI had watched the coming-of-age weepie over and over growing up so it was an overwhelming experience to sit down with its creator and see it again. It was a magical day and he was just as warm-hearted as his movieJamie GrahamFri 19 Dec 2025 09.44 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 11.53 ESTShareRob Reiner beams as he greets me. “You’ve seen Stand By Me 100 times?” he asks. I nod sheepishly. “Then you probably know it better than I do.” It’s August 2006, 20 years after Reiner’s coming-of-age weepie was first released, and I’m sitting in his office at Castle Rock Entertainment, the LA-based production company he co-launched in 1987. On the walls hang posters of Reiner’s beloved movies – This Is Spinal Tap, When Harry Met Sally, The Princess Bride, Misery, A Few Good Men – but our attention is fixed on a modest TV as Stand By Me begins.I’m here in Beverly Hills to write an anniversary article for a film magazine, but it’s also a pinch-me moment. As a teen, I’d watched Stand By Me on loop, identifying with the four protagonists – fragile, wannabe-writer Gordie (Wil Wheaton), tough-but-sensitive Chris (River Phoenix), wildcard joker Teddy (Corey Feldman) and put-upon Vern (Jerry O’Connell) – as they share their grief, insecurities and mistrust of adults.OK, I never hiked up miles of railway track to eyeball a dead body, but my friends were everything to me, plugging the ragged hole left by my parents’ divorce. Like Gordie, I felt lost at home, and like Chris, I was looked down upon because, in my village in the 80s, families did not break up. But my closest circle of pals made everything all right. Together we watched Stand By Me, and like the kids in the film, we never stopped with the banter but could also, when needed, put an arm around each other’s shoulders.View image in fullscreen‘Stand by Me means more to me than any of my other films’ … Rob Reiner with River Phoenix on the set of Stand By Me.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyWe start to watch the film. “Gordie feels so disconnected,” says Reiner as the slight, doe-eyed boy endures a conversation with his father. “It’s a theme that runs through the whole film. It’s all about him feeling that his father doesn’t love him.” Reiner turned the thought personal as he spoke of his own father, Carl Reiner. “He was a big force. I felt that he didn’t see me.”For the younger Reiner, who had previously played Meathead in sitcom All in the Family and directed comedy features This Is Spinal Tap and The Sure Thing, Stand By Me was a conscious move to escape his father’s shadow. Though peppered with one-liners and ripe with adventure, it was the bassline of melancholy that runs through Stephen King’s source novella, The Body, that vibrated through Reiner’s core. Like Gordie, Reiner was 12 years old in 1959, when the action takes place, and he too was “the invisible boy” at home. “Stand by Me means more to me than any of my other films,” he murmured.As we watch, a curious thing happens. Our running commentary begins to dry up, and we have to repeatedly force ourselves to begin speaking again. Partly it’s because we’re pulled into the movie we’ve both seen so many times before, but also it’s down to the personal memories stirred.“It makes me look back at my own childhood with nostalgia,” says Reiner, and he seems relieved to snap back to speaking about production on the film: shooting for 60 sun-soaked days in Oregon during the summer of 1985; running workshops for his young leads; taking the boys river rafting to encourage genuine bonds of friendship.View image in fullscreen‘It makes me look back at my own childhood with nostalgia’ … Stand By Me.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamyAt the end of the film, Gordie and co have escaped junkyard dog Chopper, outrun the train on a vertiginous trestle, and plucked off some pesky, alarmingly bloated leeches after an ill-advised dip in a forest swamp. Together we watch in respectful silence as the dead kid is found and Gordie at last cries over the loss of his big brother, Denny (John Cusack). Now the boys are back in their small town of Castle Rock (yes, Reiner named his production company after it) and going their separate ways, innocence lost, friendships soon to be torn asunder.Reiner is visibly moved when Chris waves goodbye and fades out of the frame. He listens to middle-aged Gordie (Richard Dreyfuss) explain how his best friend grew up to be a lawyer and was last week stabbed for trying to calm an argument between two strangers. “We had no idea that River was going to die [of an overdose, in 1993],” he says. “When you look at the scene now, it’s really chilling.”That afternoon, we watched Stand By Me until the credits finished rolling to the tune of Ben E King’s title track, and then Reiner, who was every bit as genial as legend has it, said his own goodbyes. I think of that magical day often.The next day I put on Stand By Me again, in honour of the director who helped define my generation, and whose film nursed and shaped me. It was my 119th time watching it – but the first time I didn’t make it through the opening scene without weeping.Explore more on these topicsRob ReinerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For some bizarre reason, I knew who those characters were. Suddenly, I was half-awake and the rest came flying out of me. I wrote it all down in case I forgot. In the morning, I looked at my notes and thought: ‘This is good, actually.’”He’s not wrong. It’s a special drama that can leave a decade-long gap between series but still be welcomed back with widespread excitement. It’s testament to The Night Manager’s quality that its comeback is the first must-watch show of 2026.The2016 debut run, based on John le Carré’s 1993 novel – the first he wrote after the collapse of the Soviet Union – followed hotelier turned spy Jonathan Pine (Tom Hiddleston) as he went undercover to bring down arms dealer Richard Roper (Hugh Laurie), AKA “the worst man in the world”. Farr’s lavish adaptation became event TV, pulling in 10 million viewers and selling to 180 countries. Hiddleston, Laurie and Olivia Colman all won Golden Globes for their performances. But there was a small problem: there wasn’t another book.“I’ve been a Le Carré fan since watchingSmiley’s Peoplewith my Dad when I was 10,” says Farr. “When I was asked to adapt The Night Manager, I was scared. But I had clear ideas, like relocating it to the Arab spring, and Le Carré loved that. There was never a discussion of more. It was one-and-done. When it became a huge hit, there was appetite for a sequel. I wasn’t feeling it. People probably thought I was mad but I didn’t want to mess it up by knocking up a second one.”View image in fullscreen‘More chiselled and manly’ … Tom Hiddleston as Jonathan Pine in The Night Manager, season two.Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Ink FactoryYears later came that fateful dream. “Le Carré died in 2020 but he’d given his blessing to a second season, which was important,” says Farr. “Tom [Hiddleston] was a bit like me. Quite rightly, he didn’t want to destroy a beautiful thing by doing something less beautiful. When he came onboard, we were away.”“I’d always hoped I might return to the role,” says Hiddleston. “David’s vision made that possibility real. Ten years have passed and they haven’t been easy – in the world, in this country, for all of us. Imagine how much more complex they’ve been for those working in the security and intelligence services. To return to the character of Pine, while carrying my own experience of the last decade, was a thrilling prospect.”We meet Pine again in flashback, reuniting with former handler Angela Burr (Colman) to identify a body. In present-day London, he’s director of MI6’s covert “Night Owls” unit. “I knew Pine wouldn’t go back to ordinary life,” says Hiddleston. “The errant knight, on fire with moral fury, would need to stay in active service. Once he’d seen behind the curtain, there would be no going back.”His team specialise in nocturnal surveillance – mainly of Mayfair hotels and casinos, which provide a way into terror cells and hostile networks. He’s still a night manager, just a different type. “We’re watchers,” says his sidekick Sally (Hayley Squires). “We’re not the show.” Their work is “not the most glamorous or dramatic”, a superior says smugly. Just you wait.Pine’s past remains buried until he spots one of Roper’s former footsoldiers somewhere unexpected. Investigating off the books, the team learn he’s now a fixer for South American cartels – notably Colombian arms dealer Teddy Dos Santos (Diego Calva). Using a charitable foundation as cover for his criminality, just like Roper did, Dos Santos is following in his predecessor’s destructive footsteps.View image in fullscreen‘Working with Olivia again was a joy’ … Hiddleston with Olivia Colman in The Night Manager.Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Ink FactoryAs the past is weaponised against him, Pine begins to feel like he’s chasing ghosts. When a confidante is murdered and an operation goes tragically wrong, Pine doesn’t know whom to trust. Is there a leak in his team? Are the intelligence services illegally selling British weapons abroad? With the aid of glamorous businesswoman Roxana Bolaños (Camila Morrone), he sets out to infiltrate Dos Santos’s operation.With a reported £20m budget, the first series was a location-hopping epic. The new run, co-produced by deep-pocketed Prime Video, is equally globe-trotting. The opening two episodes alone take us to Egypt, Barcelona, Miami and Medellín. “The action builds significantly,” says Farr. “We’re more Bourne than Mission: Impossible or Bond, more human than superhero, but there are spectacular sequences in beautiful places. Basically, escapism to keep us warm on wintry Sunday nights.”Hiddleston also spends a lot of time running. Is he the new Tom Cruise? “I can’t speak for the other Tom,” he laughs. “I stand only in awe and admiration. But we spoke about Pine’s need to run as a kind of somatic catharsis. There’s a deep well of pain and trauma at the centre of him. His running clears his head, cools his heart, stills his racing mind.”View image in fullscreen‘Addicted to danger’ … Hiddleston as Jonathan Pine in The Night Manager.Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Ink FactoryHe relished reuniting with Colman. “Working with Olivia again was a joy,” he says. “A lot has happened in both our lives – she won an Oscar and has become a national treasure – but we kept in touch along the way. Le Carré described the relationship between agent and handler as so intimate, it almost feels familial.”A welcome dose of down-to-earth humour is added by Squires’s Sally, whose London street-smarts contrast with Hiddleston’s smooth Etonian charm. “I really enjoyed writing Sally,” says Farr. “She lends Britishness which it really needs. A bit of old-fashioned Le Carré.”“Me and Tom are an unusual pairing,” says Squires. “But it works. From the off, Sally senses there’s something more to Pine. When she finds out the truth, she makes a conscious decision to follow him into the field. The journey she goes on is terrifying but allows her to understand her own capabilities. I’d be useless at spying in real life. My nerves wouldn’t take it. That made it particularly fun to act.” She grins. “I underestimated the amount of running I’d have to do, though. I wish I’d been warned about that.”Series one starred Elizabeth Debicki as Roper’s girlfriend Jed. The sequel has a more kickass femme fatale in Morrone. “I love this new version of the female lead,” Morrone says. “Roxana is something fresh in espionage fiction. She’s a hustler, smarter than the men give her credit for. Constantly playing both sides but really, the only side she’s on is her own. Whenever you think she’s going to be the classic love interest or damsel in distress, she flips that on its head. She’s a real equal. She loves the game in the same way these men do. And she has a backstory which makes her a firecracker character.”The 2026 Pine is older and wiser but no less lethal. As Hiddleston puts it, “He has a few more scars on the outside and on the inside.” Farr agrees: “He’s vowed that the havoc he wreaked in people’s lives isn’t going to happen again. He’s slightly addicted to danger and totally addicted to false identities – that’s why we love spies, right? – but he’s opted to live a safe, quiet life. But for Pine, that’s a half-life. When he unleashes that suppressed side of himself, it’s explosive.”View image in fullscreen‘I’d be useless at spying in real life’ … Hayley Squires as Sally in The Night Manager season two.Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Ink Factory“We take you on a rollercoaster ride,” promises Hiddleston. “Pine puts himself in extraordinary danger. We watch him risk, sacrifice, seduce and betray to unravel the mystery. I hope audiences will be thrilled by the chase.”For Farr, the decade between series had its creative advantages. “It’s a timescale you rarely get in film or TV, which was a real gift. The past is quite distant but it haunts Pine. Tom found that fascinating. He looks different, too. More chiselled and manly. Rewatch the first series and he looks like a puppy!”Pine himself has changed but so has the world. Farr appreciated the chance to reflect 10 years of global upheaval. “This show is about arms deals and how they’re used as geopolitical leverage, sometimes in truly terrible ways. It happened with the al-Yamamah contracts [under which the UK government sold arms to Saudi Arabia], which were shameful. More recently, when it looked like Ukraine might have a peace deal, share prices of defence firms across Europe plummeted. Since Iraq, everyone is wise to the fact that war makes money for certain people. There’s an infrastructure of power which is messy and dirty. Richard Roper was the embodiment of that. Now it’s become manifest. Look at the bombs dropped on Gaza in the last two years. The other thing that’s changed is the rise of populism and the chaos that brings.”The backdrop of Colombia is accidentally timely. “It’s become more topical than we imagined. South America is now an unbelievably hot area, especially Venezuela. This show is not in any sense about Donald Trump but Le Carré would absolutely be casting a scabrous eye over how Britain and America are using certain levers of power in foreign policy.” The new setting also loops back to the source material. “The novel is actually set in Central America,” says Farr. “I shifted it to the Arab world but Roper’s lair was originally in Panama and he dealt arms to Colombian drug runners. Now we’ve come full circle.”View image in fullscreen‘We’ve come full circle’ … Tom Hollander, Elizabeth Debicki and Hugh Laurie in season one of The Night Manager, 2016.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThe first series hit headlines for Hiddleston’s bare-bottomed sex scenes with Debicki. This time, he’s torn between Calva and Morrone. “That gets very hot,” says Farr. “The intelligence world has always been a sexually fluid place. Le Carré explored it in his books, going right back to Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. I’d argue that in the first series, Pine and Roper’s relationship was slightly homoerotic. I wanted to explore the new sexual fluidity and Diego Calva was perfect for that. He has this innate openness and availability. So yes, there’s a steamy triangle going on.” Can we expect Daily Mail outrage again? Farr laughs. “If I don’t get the Daily Mail in a lather, I’ve done something wrong!”“It’s a complicated throuple,” says Morrone. “A power game in which they’re all on top at different times and all have guns pointed at each under the table.” The three actors grew so close, there’s now a Night Manager WhatsApp group. “Tom created it and it’s called Mi Amigos,” says Morrone. “It’s him, Diego and I, so your dream throuple! What gets sent around? If I told you, I’d have to kill you!”The Night Manager is on BBC One on New Year’s Day at 9.05pm and everywhere else on Prime Video on 11 January.Explore more on these topicsThe Night ManagerTelevisionTom HiddlestonOlivia ColmanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is the pleading for time bit. “If nobody gets this, nobody will be able to turn this around,” he said after last Sunday’s 3-0 Premier Leaguedefeat at Nottingham Forest. It is not a “quick fix,” he added. And nobody was about to disagree.Frank is veering towards another – the one where it is as if he wants to scream, to release the inner hurricane that he referenced in Nottingham. Is anybody seeing what he is seeing? In other words, the immense difficulties that he faces.Premier League news: Guardiola dismisses exit talk and Slot has ‘moved on’ from Salah falloutRead moreFrank does not want to make excuses for how his team have stuttered since the end of September after an encouraging start to his tenure because that would not be a good look. But he does want understanding, perspective. And so on Friday, as he looked ahead to the visit of Liverpool on Saturday night, he sought to get a few points across – in that deft and charming manner of his.The Champions League is not the Europa League. It takes a greater physical and mental toll on the players, Frank suggested, and Spurs’s involvement in the competition, which has gone well so far in terms of results and them being set fair to qualify for the knockout rounds, must be factored in. Frank said his players had lacked energy at Forest. They played their sixth Champions League game of the season at home to Slavia Prague five days previously. It is linked.Frank talked about how there were not many players in the squad who were used to performing every third or fourth day at this level and then there have been those who have barely been involved because of injury – “a few good players out with a lot of goals and assists in them,” as he put it. In other words, Dejan Kulusevski, James Maddison and Dominic Solanke.Frank had a further bugbear, the one that seems to get to them all. It involves the distance between where Spurs are or have been and where they want to go. For Frank, it has been particularly pronounced given that Ange Postecoglou bequeathed him a team that finished 17th in the league. To repeat, as Frank did, there is no quick fix.“What is the potential of Tottenham?” he asked. “That is: I would like to win trophies. And we would like to compete with the best clubs in the country and hopefully win the championship one day. That’s what all Spurs fans are dreaming about. That’s what I’m dreaming about. But how do we get that?“Reality is: we finished eighth [in 2022-23] with Champions League [participation], then we finished fifth with no European competition, then we finished 17th with the Europa League. Now we’re in the fourth season and there’s been some players through the systems and so on. That’s the reality.”It added up to a nice turn in expectation management and when you listen to Frank it is easy to nod along with him, to follow the logic. And yet another line that he uttered after the Forest match came to resonate. “No one will want to hear about this,” he said in the context of needing time and there being no magic wand. Nobody is about to disagree with that either.View image in fullscreenDominic Solanke and James Maddison, posing in May with the Europa League trophy, are currently out injured.Photograph: Michael Regan/UEFA/Getty ImagesTough job, Spurs. You must challenge for the league title with a budget that is the sixth biggest, at best, in the competition. Definitely qualify for the Champions League. And do so playing the kind of exciting, attacking football that satisfies a home crowd which pays extremely high prices and is rarely slow to voice unhappiness if bang does not follow their buck.Frank’s reasonable comments in pre-match press briefings go only so far. It is possible to wonder how much the board want to hear his thoughts on how bad the club have been for so long. But there is no doubt that the supporters want to see more from his team.It is about results because if they have been good in the Champions League, they have been erratic in the league – three wins in their past 12 games in the competition; each of the five defeats during the sequence feeling like an earthquake. It is also worth saying that beating opponents such as Copenhagen and Slavia in Europe does not buy massive credit.As big a problem for Frank has been the style of the performances, the collective identity. He has brought greater efficiency on set pieces and generally tightened things up defensively but they are not vote winners when the team can look so stodgy when trying to build through the thirds; so loose and disjointed.View image in fullscreenXavi Simon (right) battles for the ball with Elliot Anderson – defeat at the City Ground was Spurs’ sixth of the season.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/ShutterstockHe is acutely aware that his Spurs must be better in creative terms; their displays in half of their league fixtures have been anywhere between deeply frustrating and totally unacceptable. It has sparked a troubling question about the direction of travel and his future. What are Spurs evolving towards under him and is it a vision that the fans can get behind?And so to Liverpool, who have often brought out the worst in Spurs in recent years. Spurs have beaten them twice in 18 attempts – and one of those was the 1-0 Carabao Cup semi-final first leg win last season, which was rather overshadowed by the 4-0 defeat in the return. The results in the league last time out? Two defeats: 6-3 at home, 5-1 away.“We conceded a few goals in those games … it’s probably a good idea to also defend a bit,” Frank said. It would be a start but by no means an end.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Arteta will mark six years in the job against his former club Everton on Saturday night – the same opponents Arsenal faced a day after he was announced as their manager. He watched that game from the stands before officially beginning his role the next day.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreWith second-placed Manchester City facing West Ham in a 3pm kick off and trailing by two points,Arsenalcould be knocked off the top of the Premier League table for the first time since mid-October before their game begins. Arteta has 18 months on the contract extension he signed in 2024 but is aware he must deliver sooner rather than later.He said when asked whether he could imagine himself staying beyond 2027: “Yes, but it’s about today. And a lot of things have to happen in the next few months as well to earn the right. I think a manager has to earn the right to be here tomorrow. And that’s how you react, how you talk here, how you go in the dressing room, the message that you send, how much the players follow you. I always say that you need support. I said it before, from ownership and the board is great.”Arteta added: “At the end, the most important one is those players. You open that door, you confront them, you talk to them … And for six years, I’ve seen just players with a level of attention, desire to learn and give the maximum to the team. That is what it gives me in this job. Nothing else. And obviously winning a lot of football matches, that percentage-wise I think is quite high. So that’s the only way. If not, you cannot survive in this environment.”View image in fullscreenBen White is the latest absentee for Arsenal after sustaining a hamstring injury.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesDespitea dramatic late victory over Wolvesin their most recent match and presiding over a squad that has sustained more than 100 injuries since the start of last season, Arteta barely seems to have aged since taking his first senior managerial role. Ben White is the latest absentee, ruled out with a hamstring injury expected to sideline him for a few weeks.Arteta believes the “priorities and messaging” are very different to the day he arrived and is confident Arsenal are close to finally achieving their objective.“You look at the performances, all the records that we had that they were breaking in the history of the club …” he said. “We still haven’t managed to do that [win trophies]. But that tells you the level that we are in, which is a level that the Premier League has never experienced in the past. And that we want to achieve even higher goals. And if we do that, I think we are on the right path to winning.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetanewsShareReuse this content"

He has stumbled into a fight he cannot win. It did not go down well with Chelsea when Maresca lobbed a grenade into the mix by talking about not being supported enough after last Saturday’s humdrumwin against Evertonand it is hard not to read his refusal to defuse the situation since then as the stance of a man daring his bosses to act.Chelsea remain bemused by their head coach creating speculation that he has issues with the club’s hierarchy by saying that the 48 hours before the Everton game had been his worst since joining the club. Sources say the outburst even caught people close to Maresca by surprise. Confusion reigns. It does not help that Maresca has publicly and privately rejected repeated opportunities to explain the source of his discontent, leaving it open for outsiders to assume that the Italian’s issues are with Chelsea’s hierarchy.Enzo Maresca plays down Manchester City link and insists future lies with ChelseaRead moreNo wonder this was all anyone wanted to talk about before Chelsea’s trip to Newcastle on Saturday. Rumours of Manchester City identifying Maresca as a potential replacement for Pep Guardiola next summer were deliciously timed. It has been noted that Maresca’s new agent, Jorge Mendes, is close to Hugo Viana, City’s sporting director. There is speculation that the links with City have emboldened Maresca and form an attempt to gain more power at Chelsea, who have built a structure that leaves no room for a manager to call the shots.Maresca did not back down when he addressed reporters on Friday morning. Hedownplayed the links with City, where he was assistant to Guardiola during the 2022-23 season, but said it was “important to understand the reason why this news” had surfaced. Was he hinting at a leak? This is a PR battle now. Maresca is currying favour with Chelsea fans. The 45-year-old tapped the badge on his chest when the travelling support sang his name after their side’s Carabao Cup quarter-finalwin against Cardiffon Tuesday. Perhaps Maresca is playing up to the fact that a large section of the fanbase remain wary of Chelsea’s sporting directors, Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, and the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital ownership.Stewart and Winstanley give regular tactical and technical feedback to Maresca after games, no matter the result. The sense is that someone annoyed the former Leicester manager by questioning whether his substitutions cost Chelsea in theirrecent defeat by Atalanta. Chelsea remain in the dark, though. On Friday Maresca said general discussions with the sporting directors this week had not focused on the Everton press conference. He said nobody had asked to clear the air with him. Asked whether that should have happened, Maresca replied: “I don’t know. That was just a press conference after the game.”View image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca’s promise that he will still be at Chelsea next season is even harder to believe now after his recent comments.Photograph: Chelsea Football Club/Getty ImagesThat was disingenuous; it was clearly more than “just a press conference”. This was pointed out to Maresca, who was asked whether there were issues that needed to be addressed with the board. “It’s a question for them, not for me,” he said. “I said already many times that what I said, it was not an emotional reaction. It was not an emotional reaction. I said what I said. Full stop.”If only. This was Maresca all but admitting his comments were premeditated. It was an obvious provocation. His position is hardly aligned with the club’s given that Chelsea insiders had sought to downplay Maresca’s initial comments, describing them as nothing more than “an emotional response to an emotional win”. That line means nothing now. Maresca has ripped it apart and can have no complaints if it is held against him.His promise that he will still be at Chelsea next season is even harder to believe now. The plan remains to review Maresca’s position at the end of the season and it is safe to say this episode is going to count against him.Chelsea do not want drama. The five-strong recruitment team gives them stability, as does the decision to hand out long contracts to young players. The structure is set. Collaboration is encouraged and the strategy is never going to be led by the coach.Maresca knew what he was signing up for when he joined last year. Chelsea dislike him using the success of the past six months to act out. One source pointed out earlier this week that Maresca was happy to toe the line last season. A dim view is taken of his change of behaviour, and another figure adds that Chelsea have been good for Maresca. They took a chance by recruiting him from a Championship club and upping his pay. Maresca is an inexperienced coach. He is playing a dangerous game. There is no guarantee that he will walk into a better job and while Chelsea have no desire to make a mid-season managerial change their hand may be forced if the mood becomes toxic and the team’s form is affected.Maresca should change course. Chelsea have been moving in the right direction but this is a brutal, fickle business. Maresca’s contract runs until 2029 but he was noncommittal when asked how he would respond if offered a new deal. “This is a question for the club, if I deserve a new contract,” he said. It is not hard to guess the answer at the moment.Explore more on these topicsChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

They speak perfect English, hunt in packs, down industrial quantities of Amstel just like everyone else. And yet to the trained eye, to the seasoned Ally Pally veteran, there is just somethingdifferentto them. A comportment and a vibe. Perhaps the fact they speak perfect English. You can even spot a subtle distinction in the choice of fancy dress; fewer jockeys and 118 118 runners, more woodland animals and flag suits, less postmodern ironic and more Euro-kitsch. They come, mostly, in love and peace. Even so, the divide is real. Enmity? Perhaps a bit strong. Either way: don’t tell them your name, Pike.Slowly and by degrees, the Germans are coming. At first in small scattered groups and landing parties, then larger expeditions, and then finally the full-scale mass incursion. A battery of tour buses spills the latest recruits up the steps and into the Palace. Package excursions sell out months in advance. Around a quarter of all tickets for this year’s world championship have been sold in Germany, rising to as many as a third for some sessions. Why are they here? What do they want? And how did a country that has never produced a world-class player of its own get so thoroughly hooked on the darts?“I think the German public is quite similar to the British public, in terms of what entertains them,” says Philip Brzezinski, a commentator who doubles up as the master of ceremonies for the ProfessionalDartsCorporation’s European Tour. “They like good sport. They like a good night out. The audience used to be very working-class, very male, but it’s now much more universal.”His Sport1 colleague Katharina Kleinfeldt adds: “There’s kind of a niche in between Christmas and New Year. In the UK you have the Boxing Day football, but in Germany there’s not that much going on. The Bundesliga isn’t on. That’s a reason why the audience is getting bigger and bigger.” Three million viewers watched the 2025 world championshipfinal between Michael van Gerwen and Luke Littler, around the same as watched it in the UK on Sky Sports. According to figures from the German Olympic Sports Confederation, darts is the country’s fastest-growing sport.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.Jonathan Liew darts loopAbove all, the German darts revolution is a triumph of vision and incremental investment, a case study in how sporting cultures nurtured carefully over decades can explode in the space of just a few years. Until the 1970s darts barely registered in the country, beyond a smattering of expat interest driven largely by the British military presence in the country. Not until 2005 did Germany have its first entrant for the world championship.But at a lower level, something had been stirring for a while. The inception of the European Tour in 2012 was a recognition by the PDC of the need to break new frontiers, but also of the way darts had begun to take hold as a social sport in the pubs and social clubs of the old industrial west. The same year, the World Cup of Darts was relocated from Sunderland to Hamburg, and later to Frankfurt. The Premier League added Berlin to its roster in 2018. The Euro Tour now comprises 14 events, and Germany hosts seven of them. However much darts you throw at Germany, they still come back clamouring for more.View image in fullscreenGabriel Clemens reached the world championship semi-finals in 2023.Photograph: Shane Healey/ProSports/ShutterstockWhat makes this all the more remarkable is that, for all its rich grassroots talent, Germany has never really managed to produce the sort of player who can genuinely challenge for the big pots. Gabriel Clemens’s run to the world championship semi-finals in 2023 looks in hindsight like a bit of a fluke. Ricardo Pietreczko, Niko Springer and Martin Schindler have won on the Euro Tour but struggled to reproduce that form on the big stages. And frankly, this should not surprise anyone. For any promising German player, however talented, one hurdle above all stands in their way: the English crowd.Go back to the very first match of this tournament and the entrance of the unknown debutant Arno Merk was greeted by a chorus of jeers. “For a couple of years now, every time there’s a walk-on I get booed,” says Schindler. Pietreczko endured a nightmarish debut at the 2023 Grand Slam of Darts when he reacted to crowd goading during his game against Beau Greaves, losing his rag and, not long after, the match.That same year, on his way to the world championship semi-finals, Scott Williams toasted a win over Schindler by declaring that “we’ve won two world wars and one World Cup”, a comment for which he was forced to apologise. But more than any other nationality – even the Scots – Germans seem to get a uniquely hostile reaction from English crowds, part cartoon rivalry and part genuine attempt to secure a competitive edge.Because, of course, this cuts both ways. In recent years prominent English darts players have reported getting very similar treatment from German crowds, most notably during this year’s World Cup. Playing Schindler and Pietreczko in front of a partisan Frankfurt crowd, Littler and Luke Humphries were mercilessly booed during their second-round game, rattled beyond recognition in an 8-4 defeat. Littler was so miffed after being barracked at a tournament in Munich that he boycotted German events for several months.Cameron Menzies cracks in the cauldron as darts faces an uncomfortable truthRead more“Germany’s good when you’re not playing a German,” says Callan Rydz, the world No 40. “I’ve played there a few times against Germans and it can be so hostile.” And this really does make a difference: in his short career Littler has won 27 PDC titles in eight countries, from Belgium to Bahrain, Austria to New Zealand. He’s never won a thing in Germany. Not a Pro Tour, not a Euro Tour, not even a Premier League night. Should he win the World Masters in Milton Keynes next month only two majors will be missing from his CV – the European Championship and the World Cup. By no coincidence, these are the only two played in Germany.Throw in a little minor beef with Pietreczko last year (over showboat finishes) and Schindler this (over an innocuous comment in a post-match interview), and it’s worth asking: does Littler have a Germany problem? “Yeah, I mean, whatever. I don’t know,” he said when the question was put to him. “The crowds were good in Dortmund. Not really any booing going on. So maybe I might try a Euro Tour, and if they start booing me then, I won’t go.”Brzezinski plays down the idea of a full-blown rivalry, pointing out that players such as Stephen Bunting and Phil Taylor have always been very warmly received by German crowds. And perhaps there is a more performative dimension to the booing than is often appreciated, two very similar darting cultures separated by a common language. Secretly, they love us. Secretly, we need them. And sometimes the only way you can really express this symbiotic relationship is through second world war tropes and pantomime jeering. It sounds a lot like hatred. But really, it feels a lot like love.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipsDartsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

None of us will be for ever in this world but there are no discussions. What is going to happen will happen and the club has to be prepared for everything – for the players and the CEOs, except the owners.“The last three or four years every time during a certain period someone asks me that question. Sooner or later, when I’m 75 or 76, I will quit Manchester City. I understand the question when I have the end of a contract [coming] but I have 18 months left and I am so delighted, happy and excited about the development of the team and being there. That is all I can say. That question happens every single season at a certain point and I’m OK. The club and I are incredibly connected in terms of the decisions we have to take and when it’s going to happen, it’s going to happen.”Guardiola extended his stay in Manchester by signing a new contract last November when he only had seven months remaining. “I’m happy here,” Guardiola said. “I want to stay here. What can I say? When the club and myself have results, always results decide. When it is the chapter the club will choose the best one to continue this incredible period in Man City. There have been rumours for the last years, many many times. I want to stay here. At the end of the season, we’ll see.”City beat Brentford in midweek to reach the Carabao Cup semi-finals and the team is on course to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League. With City active in four competitions, Guardiola will be confident of adding to his haul of silverware. “Always I need to be challenged. Enthusiasm is for many other reasons, apart from the titles, I fight for the titles. At the end, the titles, I would say it’s done.” Guardiola said.“Of course I want to win the Premier League and the Champions League but that is not the reason why I wake up in the morning. It’s not. It’s the process, the journey. Do it better. With the trophy raised high and a parade, we’re happy. Well done Pep. Two days later, it’s ‘what’s next?’ It is the process to see the team move along.”Will Unwin2.Wolves chief Shi steps down amid strugglesThe under-fire Wolves executive chair, Jeff Shi, has stepped down from his role. The 48-year-old has come in for criticism from supporters, with the club languishing bottom of the Premier Leaguewithout a win all season.Wolves say he will remain chairman and chief executive of the Fosun Sports Group, but will have no operational duties with the club. He has been replaced for an interim period by Nathan Shi, who has been with Fosun since 2016.View image in fullscreenJeff Shi watches Wolves at Molineux this season.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersIn a statement on the club’s website, Jeff Shi said: “I took the keys to this chair with humility; today, I step aside with a heart full of gratitude. My seat may change, but my heart will still roar for this club every single game. I give my full support to the new management team and wish them every success in driving Wolves to even greater heights.”3.Slot: Liverpool have ‘moved on’ from Salah falloutArne Slot feels Liverpool have “moved on” from the Mohamed Salah controversy and hopes the player’s Africa Cup of Nations involvement takes further heat out of the situation. Salah sparked crisis at the club withan explosive interviewa fortnight ago in which he, among other things, claimed he had been made a scapegoat for a poor run of form.He was consequently dropped for a Champions League game at Inter but, after talks with the manager, returned as a substitute inlast week’s Premier League victory over Brighton. The 33-year-old is now on international duty, for potentially up to another month, with Egypt.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah came on as a substitute for Liverpool against Brighton.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PASlot said: “As I said last week, actions speak louder than words and we moved on. He was in the squad and he was the first substitution I made. But now he is at the Afcon, playing big games for himself and the country, so I think it is fair to them, and also to us because we are going to play some important games, that all the focus is for him over there and there should not be any distraction from me saying things about his time at Liverpool.“We have moved on after the Leeds interview and he played against Brighton. Now he is there, so it is fair for his country, and for him and us, to talk about Tottenham and other games.”Liverpool will give a fitness test to Dominik Szoboszlai ahead of Saturday’s trip to Spurs after the Hungarian suffered an ankle injury late in the Brighton game.PA Media4.Arteta backs Gyökeres to improve in 2026Mikel Arteta has backed Viktor Gyökeres to improve in the second half of the season but admitted Arsenal need to build on their understanding with the £64m striker. Gyökeres hasn’t scored since returning from injury againstChelsealast month and has six goals in 18 appearances. Arteta is optimistic Kai Havertz will be back from a long-term knee injury in the new year, and Gabriel Jesus has returned after 11 months and should feature against Everton on Saturday.Gyökeres is expected to retain his place having started ahead of the Brazilian and Mikel Merino inthe last-gasp win over Wolvesand Arteta believes the best is yet to come from the 27-year-old.“We bought a player with an incredible goalscoring record that had to adapt to the league,” Arsenal’s manager said. “He had no pre-season. The first few weeks were difficult because physically he wasn’t in his best state. And he’s a player that needs that, like any other player in this league almost, to perform at that level.“Then he kicked on. I think he had a really good period and got injured. And now he’s back. But I saw a lot of positive things in the last two games that he’s done. We need to continue to tweak and understand him a little bit better in certain situations. And he needs to do the same. But that’s about time. And we have full support for him.”Asked whether expected Gyökeres to go to another level in the second half of the season, Arteta said: “I think so, yes.”Ed Aarons5.Moyes claims West Ham undersold RiceDavid Moyes believes West Ham were short-changed when they sold Declan Rice to Arsenal for £105m as the England international was worth £150m. Moyes faces his former West Ham captain when the Premier League leaders visit Everton on Saturday evening.The pair remain in contact, as do Moyes and his former Everton captain Mikel Arteta, and the Scot’s view that Rice was sold cheaply in 2023 has strengthened over the course of the midfielder’s Arsenal career. Rice was the joint-most expensive British footballer of all-time when he left West Ham for £100m, plus £5m in add-ons, but his former manager believes Arsenal landed a bargain.“I genuinely meant it at the time – I thought Declan was £150m,” said Moyes. “I thought we didn’t get enough at West Ham, I really didn’t. We had offered Declan huge contracts to stay but we couldn’t get him to stay. And we knew, so the club had to do what they had to do. I think it was £105m in the end but I always thought he was £150m at that time.”Friday marked 12 months since The Friedkin Group was announced as Everton’s new owners and Moyes believes the company is satisfied with the progress made so far, although he insists there is more to be done.View image in fullscreenDavid Moyes likes what he is hearing from The Friedkin Group.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThe Everton manager explained: “I get the feeling we are in a pretty good place with them. They are happy and I think they are seeing progress around the club, around the team, obviously there’s the new stadium, so I think the pace is being set. I don’t think we are going to be a club that’s owned by a state and can keep spending so much, I think it will be done in a business way.“We are getting in a better position but there are other things. We want to try and bring our academy back to life, and things like that are going to take much longer. We are seeing how the new stadium is coming along and there are probably a few things there. The first-team squad had 12 players coming out of contract so I knew we wouldn’t be able to fix that right away.“You could say: ‘How many windows is that going to take?’ I don’t think you can put a number on it, you just have to accept that hopefully the new ownership are right behind us and are going to try and help us improve every chance we get. They’ve been pretty good.”Andy Hunter6.Bournemouth blow as Adams is ruled outBournemouth midfielder Tyler Adams has been ruled out for at least two months after sustaining a medial collateral ligament injury in Monday’s4-4 draw at Manchester United. Adams was forced off after just five minutes at Old Trafford and Andoni Iraola confirmed the extent of his injury before Saturday’s fixture against Burnley.Iraola said: “From our previous experience with MCL injuries, it is normally around two or three months. It’s a big blow because he is an important player for us. Straight away, when you see the mechanism of the injury and the action itself, we felt it could be something serious.”Bournemouth are boosted in other areas with Lewis Cook set to return after completing his three-match suspension, while Ryan Christie, who has been out since November with a knee injury, faces a late fitness test.View image in fullscreenTyler Adams injured a knee in the 4-4 draw with Manchester United.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/ShutterstockMeanwhile, Iraola insisted he is relaxed about Marcos Senesi’s future at the club after the defender’s failure to sign a new contract led to increased speculation that he is set to leave.“The most important thing is he is playing very well,” said Iraola. “Both parties still have time regarding his contract situation – there are still seven months left. There is no doubt I want him to continue here.”PA MediaExplore more on these topicsFootballThe talkPremier LeagueManchester CityWolverhampton WanderersLiverpoolArsenalBournemouthnewsShareReuse this content"

So many, in fact, that their talent spotters have grown increasingly blase. Because how on earth did someone, somewhere not spot the uncut diamond now twinkling on the far side of the world forBristolBears and Scotland?Let’s just run through the impressive menu of skills Tom Jordan will bring to today’s Big Game against Harlequins at Twickenham’s Allianz Stadium. Excellent distribution off both hands? Tick. A smart rugby brain? Tick. The ability to hit unexpectedly hard in the tackle and kick goals as well? Tick, Tick.Factor in his positional versatility, a constant thirst for improvement and a faint physical resemblance to Beauden Barrett and his value merely increases further. The more you think about it, in fact, the more bizarre it becomes that his age-group coaches could not see the serious potential standing right in front of them.The Breakdown | Storming ahead means increasingly little in era of rugby’s comeback kingsRead moreJordan has certainly been a gift from whichever rugby god they worship in the Scottish Rugby Union’s offices in Murrayfield and a poster boy for late developers everywhere. When he fetched up to play semi-pro club rugby in Ayr six years ago, he had no firm ambitions other than to see the world and play some club rugby in the UK. Now here is, at 27, fast maturing into the kind of player any side would covet.Which makes his long and winding journey to get here all the more rewarding. There was even a time when clubs in National One – the third tier of English rugby – were failing to sign him, although some of that related to the financial collapse of one of his possible destinations, Old Elthamians.Growing up on the coastal Whangaparāoa Peninsula, 25 miles north of Auckland, his local school Orewa College also did not rate among the country’s leading rugby nurseries. His father, Graeme, who ran a local garage, and his mother, Dee, a travel agent, both encouraged their middle child’s love of sport but North Harbour Under-18s was the height of his ­age-grade recognition.View image in fullscreenTom Jordan has helped Bristol stay unbeaten in the Champions Cup.Photograph: David Davies/PAA spell playing club rugby in Hamilton while studying for an accounting and finance degree at the University of Waikato, however, kept the flame burning before the chance came to head to Scotland. Having been man of the match for Ayrshire Bulls in the 2021 Super 6 final, an invitation to train with Glasgow Warriors followed and the newly arrived Franco Smith swiftly saw what others had not. “When he first came in I’d barely been in the programme but he started me in the first game of the season,” said Jordan. “Then he continued to start me. He must have seen something in me that he liked. It was massive for my development.”His star has risen steadily ever since. Even before Jordan made his debut for Scotland 13 months ago – having qualified under the extended five-year-residency regulations – Bristol’s Pat Lam was making a big money offer for “one of the most exciting talents in European rugby” after the player’s central role in Glasgow’s stirring United Rugby Championship title success in 2024.And now the goal is to win something with both Bristol and Scotland. From the Bears’ perspective there have been someencouraging signs lately. Despite some pivotal injuries they remain unbeaten in the Champions Cup and will be strong candidates for the Prem top four if they can reinforce their sweeping attacking game with a little more hard-nosed steel.Jordan, who starts at 10 opposite Marcus Smith tonight, senses that the next three games over the festive season against Quins, Newcastle and Sale Sharks will be crucial. “If we go well we’ll be in a really good position come the Six Nations break,” he said. “And the same in Europe. Harlequins will be class and it’s a massive game but hopefully we can put what we believe in into action.View image in fullscreenJordan: ‘I’m not just playing for my family but all the people who I’ve met along my journey in Scotland.’Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images“It’s up to us to drive what we’re trying to achieve. Bristol have come a long way and now we want to be winning. We talk about changing history; we can’t just do the same thing. The boys are starting to understand what we need to do to get to that point. There is a lot of hunger.”And when it really boils down to it Jordan’s belief is that commitment to the cause is what really counts, even if some would prefer their national teams to consist purely of homegrown talent. “I can see why some Scottish fans feel that way. But the way I look at it I came over to play club footy. So many of my best mates now are from Scotland; I keep in touch with them pretty much daily. It was also where my rugby career took off. Whenever I play for Scotland I’m not just playing for my family but all the people who I’ve met along my journey in Scotland.“All I can do is try and show how much I care by how hard I go and by leaving everything out there. Hopefully that’s enough for them to accept me and think: ‘OK, we’ll take him.’”His family are certainly proud of his distant exploits. “My mum came over for the All Blacks game and to see us play England at Twickenham in the Six Nations last season. She flew in and came straight to the game. I saw where she was sitting and then we scored the first try right in front of her. As Mum said: ‘It didn’t feel real. I hadn’t seen you and then you were right there.’”Scotland’s 2026 Six Nations prospects, though, are a less immediate priority than thriving in a Bristol jersey. There is always a little luck involved – “You could come over and be in a team that doesn’t want to play much rugby” – but Jordan’s game appears ideally suited to his new surroundings.Sliding doors and all that. Part of him now wonders if having to be patient for so long was actually a blessing in disguise. “I’ll always look back and feel grateful I didn’t get an early opportunity because I might not have been ready.“If I’d not been great or been out of my depth I might not have got another shot. I was pretty much 24 by the time I made my pro debut but all those years before I’d been building towards it. Coming to it later has probably just drilled into me the habit of trying to throw everything at it every day.” Finally he is where he always wanted to be, rapidly making up for lost time.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionBristolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Liverpool have been through a period of turbulence of late and their troubled manager, Arne Slot, is certainly taking no chances against Spurs. “It took us 92 minutes to score away against Brentford last season, a Thomas Frank team,” said the Liverpool manager. “They’ve added a few players and have a new manager, so I don’t think you can compare our games of last season to this season. We have added but lost a lot of players as well.”Barry Glendenninghosts our minute-by-minute coverage, withNick Amesreporting from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank has found the going tough since joining Spurs from Brentford.Photograph: Alex Morton/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockPremier League8pmEverton v Arsenal liveArsenal may have dropped from the top of the table by the time Everton roll into the Emirates.

Home for the holidays, theCarolina Panthersentertain theTampa Bay Buccaneerswith control of the NFC South on the line. Since the start of the 2021 season, the Bucs can claim ownership of the South, holding at least a share of the division lead for 73 of the 87 weeks with four consecutive division titles. The Panthers are 3-3 since the beginning of November with wins over the Rams and Packers, but last week’s 20-17 loss at New Orleans, a penalty-filled outing, was deflating. TheBuffalo Billslook to clinch a playoff berth for the seventh consecutive season when they visit theCleveland Browns. The Bills (10-4) also have an eye on first place in the AFC East after overcoming a 21-point deficit in a 35-31 victory over the New England Patriots (11-3). Buffalo have won the division in each of the last five seasons. First, the Bills need a win and either a loss by the Houston Texans (9-5) or Indianapolis Colts (8-6) in order to punch their ticket to the playoffs.Explore more on these topicsSportYour Guardian sport weekendfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Among them, my own custom of devoting the last column before Christmas to reasons to be hopeful. In recent years, amid war and bloodshed, that task has been especially challenging – and this week was no exception.It began with the news from Bondi beach, where 15 people were gunned down and dozens more injured, most of them Jews celebrating the festival of Hanukah. That came just two-and-a-half months afterthe deadly attack on Heaton Park synagoguein Manchester, on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur. To be a Jew at the end of 2025 is to fear that to gather together, whether at moments of joy or sorrow, is to take a mortal risk. That even to do relatively ordinary things together has become a matter of life and death.But Hanukah is not over, and its defining theme is finding light in the darkness. And so, in that spirit, I’ll keep up my own little tradition – and, as it happens, the massacre in Sydney is the ideal place to start. For there, in the pitch black of a murder spree fuelled by hate, were multiple points of light.The global imagination has been captured, rightly, by the heroism of Ahmed al-Ahmed, the passerby who, with no weapon of his own,tackled one of the two attackers, even wresting his gun from him. In an instant, al-Ahmed disproved the very case the gunmen were doubtless trying to make: that Muslims are somehow commanded to see Jews as their enemy, a foe to be destroyed. In an act of mind-boggling courage, he showed that the human urge to save the life of a fellow human being is more powerful.Al-Ahmed was not the only one to feel that urge. Footagehas emergedof a retired couple, Boris and Sofia Gurman, both in their 60s, making a similar move, tussling with one of the gunmen and grabbing his rifle. For a moment Boris seemed to succeed, wrestling the man to the ground. But the attacker apparently had another gun, and he used that to shoot Boris and Sofia dead.Meanwhile, 14-year-old Chaya Dadongave up the place of shelter she hadfound – hiding under a bench as the bullets flew – to heed the plea of a mother desperate to save her children. Chaya came out from her spot under the bench and lay her own body on top of the little ones, shielding them from the gunfire until, a few moments later, she herself was shot in the leg.In each case, and during a moment of absolute terror, these people demonstrated immediate, instinctive and unfathomable courage. If there is a reason for hope this year, this might just be it: that courage is to be found, even in the bleakest places.So it’s easy, when following thediplomatic twists and turns, to forget that the people of Ukraine have been enduring persistent Russian bombardment for nearly four straight years. Just to keep living, as deadly drones circle overhead, requires a bravery those of us who live in a country that last came under attack 80 years ago can scarcely imagine.Or think of the people of El Fasher, the Sudanese city where huge piles of bodies areheaped on the streets, from where more than 150,000 residents are missing, feared dead – with as many as 60,000 believed to have been killed in three weeks. Humanitarian observers say El Fasher now looks “like a slaughterhouse”, even as the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces are hard at work destroying the evidence of the massacre they committed. Think of the strength it must take to keep going, day after day, in Sudan, where this latest round of bloodletting has gone on since April 2023 but which has known brutal conflict for decades.The same is true of the Palestinians of Gaza, many of whom have spent the past two months returning to homes utterly destroyed by an Israeli bombardment that went on for two years, after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel of October 2023. Just to endure, to put one foot in front of the other amid so much grief, with as many as 70,000 killed and whole neighbourhoods obliterated, is an act of bravery.Imagine, then, the courage of those who have not only withstood the Israeli onslaught, but have dared to protest against their Hamas masters. According toan Amnesty International report in May, hundreds if not thousands of Palestinians demonstrated against Hamas rule, only to face “interrogations and beatings by Hamas-run security forces”. After the Hamas-Israel ceasefire and partial Israeli withdrawal in October, the punishment became more severe: footage emerged of Hamasstaging public executionsin a Gaza City square. And yet, there are still Palestinians in Gaza who dare stand up and say no.I think of someone I have got to know these last two years. On 7 October 2023, Sharone Lifschitz learned that her parents had been seized from their kibbutz, Nir Oz. Her mother, Yocheved, then 85, was held hostage until she was released 16 days later, famously parting from her Hamas captors witha handshake and the word “shalom”: peace. In February of this year, Sharone received confirmation that her father, Oded, had been killed.Throughout, Sharone campaigned for the return of the Israeli hostages – but she also campaigned, tirelessly, for an end to the war. You would find her outside Downing Street, standing among those Israelis holding photographs of Palestinian children killed by Israeli airstrikes. Her family has been stricken by terror conducted in the name of the Palestinians; but she has never stopped demanding justice and statehood for the Palestinians, even when that puts her at odds with many of her fellow Israelis. She is brave.And I think of those not confronted by war, but who nevertheless find the strength to face down the mighty. It could be the Indiana Republicanswho dared defy Donald Trumpby refusing to go along witha gerrymandering schemethat would have handed him a partisan advantage. Or the Scottish couple, Ros and Mark Dowey, now taking on one of the world’s most powerful corporations,suing Metafor the alleged wrongful death of their 16-year-old son, Murray, who took his own life after falling prey to a “sextortion” gang on Instagram. The Doweys know what they’re up against. But they are determined that a seemingly all-powerful body finally be held to account.This week and last, I saw what that kind of courage looks like. I sat in on several sessions of the public inquiry into undercover policing, watching as one of the women deceived into a long-term relationship with a man who turned out to be a cop told her story – and as that former police officerwriggled and wormed his waythrough his own testimony, repeatedly confronted with the hard, documented evidence of his deception. Full disclosure: the woman, known as “Alison”, is an old friend of mine. Even so, I was awed all over again by the courage she and the other women have shown for decades in refusing to be cowed by the Metropolitan police, insisting instead on hunting down the truth and demanding that a police force that countenanced this sex by deception – which the women involved regard as rape by the state – explain itself.For much of the past three years, I have been immersed in the story of a handful of anti-Nazi Germans who dared resist the tyranny of the Third Reich, several of them paying for their defiance with their lives. I’ve told their story in a book, The Traitors Circle. Many readers, daunted by the jaw-dropping bravery of those long-ago men and women, have assumed such courage exists only in the past. But that’s wrong. It lives on now, all around us. It’s there if we look for it – lighting up the dark.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist and the author ofThe Traitors Circle: the Rebels Against the Nazis and the Spy Who Betrayed ThemDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The destructive right wing of the Labour party should know that this is a new eraFri 19 Dec 2025 14.00 ESTShareIstarted my working life as a low-paid children’s residential care worker supporting vulnerable children, and I am still a registered social worker today. I discovered the labour movement through the powerful women who mentored me and showed me that working-class people will only win the dignity we deserve if we join together in our workplaces.On Wednesday,I was electedgeneral secretary of Britain’s biggest union, Unison. Trade unions are meant to be vehicles for workers to collectively organise, represent and lead ourselves, so my election should be an unremarkable event.Yet I will be the firstordinary memberto lead my union in its history. This represents a huge opening for the democratic renewal of the labour movement. The fact that my election is so unprecedented tells its own tale.It is the blows inflicted upon us by Thatcherite politicians and employers over the decades that explain the enduring weakness of trade unions – clear to see in our industrial impotence and stubbornly low member engagement.But some at the top of our movement have contributed to its decline, too, by creating cultures where workers, ordinary members, are consistently disregarded by their own organisations. Defending our class interests, the core work of unions, has been an afterthought, at best. Careers and cosy Westminster clubs have come first.Not any more. That’s the one simple reason I was elected by such a decisive margin to lead Unison: members want our union to put our people first.Ordinary members are taking control. With my clear mandate, I will work relentlessly to implement the industrial, political and organisational changes necessary to turn our union into the incredible, member-led force it should be. That’s the hopeful project we need the whole union to unite around.Industrially, I am putting all the employers we bargain with – from Reform UK-run local councils to Wes Streeting’s Department of Health and Social Care – on notice: Unison will be fighting without hesitation to win for members. Our size and resources are without parallel among trade unions in this country. From this point on, those great assets will be geared towards transforming the lives of public-sector workers.That begins with building on and properly scaling up the “organising to win”strategy introducedin 2021, after a motion by ordinary members at Unison’s conference. This was a member initiative, from the grassroots. Now I will work for it to be fully supported and resourced at the centre.I will, on top of this, strive to reverse Unison’s industrial underachievement. We are thebiggest and best-resourcedunion in the country; there’s no reason for us not to be among the most industrially formidable.This will include a wide-ranging strategic review of taking strike action across the labour movement, leading to our adoption of the best methods to win. I will also launch a new strike-ready conference, convening workplace reps from across Unison to forge new organising approaches in the fight for better pay.Politically, with ordinary Unison members giving a clear mandate for change, our union will defend the interests of the working class as a whole without apology and without exception. I am in no doubt – that requires being unbowed in our support for thePalestinian people’sfreedom struggle, and proud of our internationalism and opposition to war. I am also clear that Unison on my watch will not sit idly by while this Labour government allows imprisoned Palestine Solidarity Campaign activists tostarvewhile protesting for their basic rights. Keir Starmer must act now.View image in fullscreenHealthcare assistants picket in Middlesbrough, in March 2024.Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty ImagesSo it should be clear that putting members first doesn’t mean relegating or turning away from politics. That would be an abdication of responsibility. But it does mean bringing Unison’s support for the destructive right wing of theLabourparty to an end.We will call time on our union’s inexcusable habit of propping up politicians who act against our interests, undermine our fundamental values and make our lives worse. Like colleagues across the movement, I have, in recent weeks, been appalled by Streeting’sattacks on resident doctorsand their union. It is simply unacceptable for a Labour politician to describe striking workers as “morally reprehensible”.I will, of course, engage open-mindedly with the health secretary as I would with any other employer or government minister. But given the likelihood of a Labourleadership election in 2026, it’s important for me to be clear: swapping Starmer out for Streeting or anyone else from the right wing of the party would be no solution to the gigantic challenges facing the country. What’s needed is a radical change in approach based on the labour movement’s core values.My victory is no individual matter. It is a collective triumph for ordinary Unison members who have voted to take charge of their own union at long last. Public sector workers keep this country running. We are disrespected, overworked and underpaid. That must change. It will change. With everyone from members to branch reps and our union’s staff pulling together, Unison under my leadership will make sure of it.Andrea Egan is the general secretary-elect of UnisonExplore more on these topicsTrade unionsOpinionIndustrial actionLabourKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

Often they are more trouble than they are worthFri 19 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 10.49 ESTShareNigel Farage is storing up trouble by welcomingyet another tranche of Conservative defectors to Reform UK’s ranks. I should know. When I was chief whip, nothing united a party quite as much as a defection. Old enemies call a truce from their daily hostilities to turn all the available ire on the traitor in their midst. Ask Shaun Woodward, the former Conservative MP for Witneywho legged it to Labour in 1999while making all sorts of rather grand demands in the process. He was blackballed by his original party for such a flagrant act of opportunism, and hated by his new family as someone never to be entirely trusted.I remember the shock and anger when entering the chamber in April 2024to see Dan Poulter seated uncomfortably behind Keir Starmerfor PMQs. Not only had we had no warning, but as he had barely even attended parliament in anyone’s recent memory, we weren’t quite sure whether Labour would know who he was. Only weeks later, Dover diehard Natalie Elphickepulled the same stuntand also promptly disappeared from view. How she could have left friends and whips a few hours earlier with the impression that she was voting with the government that day, I am not quite sure.It seems that such niceties matter little to the “defector community”, any more than loyalty to the party, volunteers, voters and supporters who gave them such a privileged position in the first place. Why should Reform expect any better?It was those two “left-field” defections that caused us the jitters over in No 10. Were there more? We had heard rumours, but there were always rumours. To be safe, we ran a check on every single colleague, ranking them green, amber or red and sending in the charm police for anyone in the most dangerous category. Losing two colleagues was annoying; lose three and it might start looking careless. Although the date of the election was at that stage still undecided, we all knew that if anyone else went, any plan would go with them.Looking at the names of those who have made the journey to Reform is also revealing.When we suspended the whip from Lee Anderson, he was at pains to assure me that he was going nowhere, and we therefore planned a session within days to map out an elegant return. But something happened over that weekend, and he was gone.Andrea Jenkyns,Jake Berry,Nadine Dorries,Sarah Atherton,Maria Caulfield: all have trodden the same path, all humming to the same old tune that “the Conservatives no longer represent my values blah blah”. This is despite most of them signing up to, and even voting for, the very immigration policies put forward by their hero, Boris Johnson, that they now suddenly find so indigestible. Then,Danny Krugerjoined the list as the first sitting Tory MP to defect, completing the least surprising collection of the disgruntled it would be possible to find. And recently it’s been the turn of the little-knownMalcolm Offordfrom the House of Lords and former MPBen Bradley, who had to make a hefty charity donationafter defaming Jeremy Corbyn.Can defectors be identified before the act? That’s not easy, but there is a common link, a symptom that might be hard to pick up without a political stethoscope. First, this is a group of people who have always found it hard, impossible even, to operate as a collegiate force. They were loners, the sort of people neighbours describe as “keeping themselves to themselves” hours after discovering that they have committed some misdeed. Some of them, Kruger being one, are driven by such an unbreakable ideological vision that they cannot fully grasp that politics is a numbers game and is annoyingly reliant on consensus and compromise. Second, they often think there will be payback; they may even have been promised it. Perhaps a key seat at the next election, a place on the list for the Senedd elections next May, a mayoral nomination or even a peerage.View image in fullscreenReform UK’s Richard Tice with Lee Anderson, who defected from the Conservatives in March 2024.Photograph: Carl Court/Getty ImagesOne thing is certain: these defections are acts of opportunism and therein lies the trouble for Farage. Usually, defectors want something. If they don’t get it, they will react in much the same way as they did when we turned down their similar demands. There will be a petulant outburst, often timed somewhat vindictively to cause the greatest embarrassment for the people whose trust and support they had hitherto relied upon.The recent flurry of defecting councillors and former MPs is a case in point. Each and every one of them owes their well-funded existence to the Conservative party, and its financial and volunteer resources, not to mention voters. If they must defect, couldn’t they at least do it with a bit of class, and retreat quietly into the background after a brief but considered message? Or better still, trigger a byelection, just to make sure that voters are as enthusiastic about their new brand as they were one that actually got them elected?As ever, there are some honourable historical exceptions. Churchill was elected a Conservative but within a few years joined the Liberals on the back of his opposition to a bill to reduce the flow of Jewish migrants fleeing the Russian empire, only to return to the Conservatives about 20 years later. In the more recent political earthquake of 1981, four heavyweight Labour MPs (David Owen, Shirley Williams, William Rodgers and Roy Jenkins) formed the “gang of four” to start the Social Democratic Party (SDP)in protest againstMichael Foot.Kemi Badenoch would be wise to stick to her guns, encouraging other wobblers to step away now. As for the rest of us, it pays to see these moments for what they really are.Simon Hart was government chief whip from 2022 to 2024, and is author ofUngovernableExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionConservativesNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

Imagine the school it is in has only one loo, no canteen, gets freezing cold in winter – oh, and the playground is full of gravestones.If this sounds to you like the perfect setting to teach the country’s most vulnerable children, then you’re going to loveReform UK’s new Send policy, which involves cutting the bill for taxiing children to far-flung special schools by repurposing nearby “empty churches” (a term that in itself may surprise vicars) as schools on weekdays. But if you have actually met any children, and therefore suspect this idea isn’t going to fly, then read on to find out why Reform looks more beatable at the end of what has undeniably been itsbreakthrough yearthan it did at the beginning.This time last year, I was booking my place at a new year Reform rally that turned out to be a short, sharp lesson in just how fast old norms and taboos were collapsing on the right. Yet in retrospect, the most surprising thing about the young men I interviewed that night was how ordinary they were: no different, really, to all the ambitious young Tory turks I’ve met, except for the palpable sense that the energy on the right was elsewhere now. They did not seem unrecoverable, at least not to a Conservative party that could be bothered actually talking to them.It’s fair to say that optimism has wavered a few times over the past year, which has taken me from interviewing teenage Nigel Farage fans at one end of the spectrum to making a BBC Radio 4 documentary about the far less widely examined surge in young women voting Green (which airs this Sunday night, thanks for asking) at the other. But looking back now on all those months of often bleak conversations – not only with pollsters or politicians, but also around kitchen tables, in academic seminars, over pizza after-hours in thinktank basements, with close observers of Donald Trump’s victory in the US, and plenty more places besides – the one clear theme that emerges is that in Reform’s undoubted strengths lies its weakness. Its astonishingly speedy growth disguises what now look like shallow roots; its success, meanwhile, has brought a level of scrutiny for which it simply isn’t ready.A year and a half ago, Reform could get away with promising a “patriotic curriculum” and a ban on anychildren changing their pronouns, and calling that an education policy. But now it’s running 10 English councils actually responsible for Send provision, suddenly the saloon-bar wisdom is wearing thin. Reform’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, was forced to preface the launch of his empty churches plan by apologising for an earlier suggestion that the Send crisis was down to families “abusing the system”, which understandably enraged some of those parents. It’s just one example of something that is starting to trouble Reform: a party built on Farage’s genius for knowing what a small but noisy minority were thinking seems to be struggling to replicate that trick at scale, now its base has expanded tomore than a quarterof the electorate. For the first time, meanwhile, Reform voters are getting the chance to compare what their new councillors promised – including council tax cuts – with what they’re actually getting, which for many looks likely to be the opposite.The trouble with power is that it’s exposing, both politically and personally; the half-baked ideas, the work that never happened, the secrets and the buried scandals all emerge under pressure. Though the most obviously troubling of these has been the steady stream of former classmates coming forward to accuse Farage of racist and antisemitic remarks as a schoolboy (for the record, he denies directly targeting anyone), it’s the jailing of the former Welsh Reform leader Nathan Gillfor taking Russian bribesthat may yet cast the longest shadow over the coming year. The government’s commissioning of a long-overdueinquiry into foreign interferencein British elections suggests a new alertness not just to the national security risks, but to the need to hold some political feet to the fire.The most basic question any prospective ruling party must be able to answer is: which side are you on, exactly? Do you choose your own country every time, over foreign actors – in Moscow or even in Washington DC – seeking to destabilise it for their own ends? Do you care about sovereignty when it really matters – when the head of MI6 isopenly describing the countryas suspended between war and peace, say – or just when it’s a convenient excuse for bashing Brussels?The conversation that has kept me awake more than any other this year was a private one, illustrating just how much the possibility of Nato being at war within five years (roughly the time it might take Russia to re-arm and recover from its invasion of Ukraine) is now taken for granted in defence circles. Well, now that submarine is surfacing in increasinglyominous public warningsabout the need to build resilience, delivered almost certainly not by coincidence just as Ukraine’s future rests once again in Trump’s careless hands – and a difficult defence spending review isbeing finalisedin Downing Street. If I were Keir Starmer, I might consider repurposingGordon Brown’s warningfrom 2008, when the vultures were circling his premiership, that this doesn’t feel like the time for a novice.And if this sounds like tricky territory forLabourto fight on, perhaps the most overriding lesson of the year is to stop thinking of Reform simply as Labour’s problem to solve.A year of number-crunching by pollsters confirms what was mostly just a hunch 12 months ago: that the Reform soufflé has been swelled mostly by deserting Tory voters, not Labour ones, and that it almost certainly won’t collapse until the Tory party recovers enough to come and get their people back. Paradoxically, the left should almost certainly take heart from the fact that Kemi Badenoch seems to befinding her feet a bit, thanks in part to a smarter backroom operation.But if the idea of a Tory resurgence doesn’t entirely make your heart sing with Christmas joy, consider this: there have been signs in recent weeks of the government finally getting the message that endlessly aping Reform is not the answer to its prayers, and that trying to recoup some of the goodwill needlessly squandered to its left will ultimately reap more rewards. It’s been a long, grim year of learning lessons the hard way. Better that, however, than never learning them at all.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FarageLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Yes, the polls look bad – but these days they reflect little more than voters’ passing whimsFri 19 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 12.44 ESTShareMerry Christmas, Sir Keir, and a happy new year. Or as they say in Downing Street these days, make merry for tomorrow you may die. At your drinks for lobby correspondents last week there was reportedly one topic alone. How long had you to go: months, weeks, hours?We all know bad news sells. Political reporters cannot handle prime ministers sleeping soundly at night. But the terminal gloom around Keir Starmer’s position is absurd. Not a morning passes without rivals being declared, and not an evening without the BBC’s Chris Mason dragged from his supper to stand in the cold. He just frowns and forecasts Armageddon.Starmer is variously described as theleast popular, most rebelled against, most loathed prime minister of all time. Asked for a prediction, the Westminster lobby grasps the most stinging nettle it can find. It currently rates Starmer as finished. It did the same to Margaret Thatcher after two years in 1981.First the polls. A recentin-depth study of themin the Economist was gripping. It showed that when a party’s share falls below 30%, predicting the outcome of first-past-the-post in any constituency is near worthless. In lobby terms, you can use it to back any story you want to write. Atlast year’s general election, the surging Reform party got 14% of the total vote but won just five MPs; the Liberal Democrats got 12% and 72 MPs.The Economist’s own pollhad Reform winning “between 112 and 373 seats” and Labour winning “between 36 and 295 seats”. This is no use to anyone. Put another way, Starmer needs only to recover seven points to make Labour the largest party in parliament again. Meanwhile, an MRP poll leaked last month had Kemi Badenochwinning just 14 seats.The fact is that when five parties all have between 15 and 30% of the poll, as is roughly the case at present, first-past-the-post makes any election a lottery. As for the leaders, when party affinities are no longer tied to ideology or class loyalty, “popularity” can swing wildly. It goes with charisma or the last appearance on television.I find it hard to “loathe” or “hate” Starmer. Not knowing him personally, I find his decisions inept – but he seems likable and harmless. He sounded most plausible onMichael Berkeley’s Private Passionson Radio 3 in October. He admitted he became prime minister having not made the grade in music college on the flute. I keep seeing him as a failed flautist.Labour is in Downing Street by the wildest of flukes. In 2024, Starmer actually won half a million fewer votes than his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, did in 2019. It also won a smaller share of the poll, 34%, than the Tories and Reform combined at 38%. Last year the British electorate turned right, not left.In other words, Labour’s record majority had nothing to do with democracy. It was first-past-the-post at its wildest. With five parties looking like contenders next time, and a hung parliament most likely, you might as well roll a dice as to who gets to Downing Street.Starmer’s performance as prime minister has not been outstanding, but it’s hardly been disastrous. His devotion to his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has alienated employers,farmers, publicans, landlords, planners and the countryside. He has got little thanks for hisoutrageous generosityto HS2,housebuildersand the green energy lobby. But these are hardly hanging offences.In fact, in two important policy areas, Starmer has been in the right. He has restrained public borrowing, which should give him room for manoeuvre down the line. According to the IMF, next year the UK will be thesecond strongest growing economyin the G7 after the US, and that is worth a real boast. The prime minister has also started down the vital route to reversing the Brexit disaster, most recently inreopening the Erasmus student exchange. That is also good news. Otherwise his foreign policy may be measured only in air miles – but overseas nowadays is mostly about show. He has deftly handled the warmongering of the defence spending lobby.This has simply not been a Liz Truss/Boris Johnson disaster binge. Starmer has made bad appointments and has a ropey Downing Street machine; but if backbenchers are restive, Starmer has enough of them to get by. He performs confidently with Badenoch in the weekly pantomime at the dispatch box.The idea that Angela Rayner or Wes Streeting or even Andy Burnham is massing armies of eager supporters at Starmer’s door is ridiculous. There is no obvious leader of the party yet identified as superior to Starmer. I cannot believe Labour really wants to fall on its sword.The next election is utterly impossible to call. The polls are useless predictors, as will be next May’s local elections. They will be a sign of passing whim, not of who the voter most wants as prime minister. Starmer may not be exciting, but that is hardly new in Downing Street. He has time – and in politics, time is power. He should take a leaf out of Thatcher’s book. Just stay there. Just survive. I predict he will.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

This week, the UK announced it is rejoining theErasmus+ youth exchangeprogramme. This will open the door beyond the many young people who attend university – its remit includes FE students, apprentices, and youth and school groups. A whoop of excitementgreeted the announcement, with opportunities for those involved in education, training, culture and sport, and a commitment to maximise take-up by disadvantaged young people. Widening experience, encouraging adventure: Erasmus+ may help cure Britain’s monolingual handicap and the catastrophic decline in language courses. Last year in the UK, less than3% of A-levelswere in languages.This all eludes Europhobes such as Andrew Neil,who postedon X that “extra taxes now being inflicted on working people will be used to finance some ‘study’ in Barcelona for gap-year yahs from affluent families”.Our expensive experiment with isolation from Europe is unwinding. Forget Labour’s embarrassingly futile slogan of “make Brexit work”, its insistence on “red lines” and fear of doing anything that might reignite Brexit passions. Now it is accelerating from tiptoe to trot towards Europe. Last month,Keir Starmer wrote: “We must confront the reality that the botched Brexit deal significantly hurt our economy.” Listen to other ministers’ language.Rachel Reeves: “The cuts to capital spending and Brexit have had a bigger impact on our economy than was even projected back then.” Wes Streeting said Labour should undo “the economic damage done by Brexit”, whileDavid Lammy refused seven timesin one interview to rule out reversing a Brexit that had “badly damaged our economy”. This is the new mood music, as Liberal Democrats and Greens eat Labour’s pro-European lunch, withtwice as many Labour votersconsidering fleeing to them as to Reform UK.The Europhobe response to rejoining Erasmus has been as demented as you would expect. The Mailwent for the Turksagain (Turkey is an associate member of the programme), with the headline “Thousands of Turkish students could come to UK” – a reprise ofreferendum-era scare storiesabout Turkey joining the EU.The Tories and Reform hope Labour is falling into their trap on Europe, reawakening deep Brexit “betrayal” passions. But they sound out of step: the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, says: “Labour continue to betray Brexit … dragging Britain back under the control of Brussels.” YouGovfinds65% support for rejoining Erasmus with only 12% opposed. Even back in 2020, as the Brexit axe fell, 61%wanted to stayin Erasmus.The Tories and their media attack the £570m cost of Erasmus. But if they bandy around numbers they have to answer for the whole cost of Brexit. The National Bureau of Economic Research finds that the UK’s GDP is between6% and 8% smallerthan it could have been. The House of Commons library estimates that leaving the EU is costing the Treasury up to£90bn a yearin lost tax revenue. Here’s how. Unless lorries are backed up outside Dover, the unseen blockages and deterrents to trade usually go unnoticed, yet an estimated 16,400 companieshave abandoned EU trade.Here’s an example of the obstacles, reportedin Farmers Weekly. Four refrigerated lorries carrying £650,000 worth of Scottish lamb to Europe were stopped at Calais; the meat was rejected by French inspectors despite being stamped as fit for consumption by the UK’s Food Standards Agency. Worse still, the lorries were not allowed to return, either. “They hold all the power. We’re completely helpless,” said West Scottish Lamb. As the meat neared its viable time limit, they said that standoff was “crippling our business”, adding: “The UK government has effectively handed the French authorities the power to control our goods.” Yes, that’s what the disastrous Brexit deal did. They can reject our exports, now we have given up any say. It was sorted last week, at the last minute. Though not accepted into the EU, the meat was finally allowed to return to the UK, after whatFarmers Weekly sayswas a three-week standoff.I spoke to the National Sheep Association’s Phil Stocker, who said: “In the last six months there have been more problems. Our standards have become misaligned. They change some rules and we aren’t told.” This matters as more than a third of lamb is exported, and 95% of thatgoes to the EU. “We urgently need that trade agreement on food,” he adds. Thegovernment’s responseis that it is negotiating anSPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) agreementthat will boost trade and remove border checks. Stocker says he’s optimistic it may get done within 18 months, cutting red-tape costs. This example, he says, shows how Brexit makes costs rise and GDP contributions fall.No doubt when that SPS deal is made, Brexiters will protest that we have become rule-takers, obeying Europe’s standards. But that’s what Brexit did, obliging exporters to conform while removing our seat at the table to decide on standards and rules. There will be more trouble ahead, warns Liz Webster of Save British Farming, for as long as the government tries to keep strategic ambiguity with the US. The UK has agreed to allow up to13,000 tonnes of US beefper year (if it conforms to our standards, and is not hormone-fed), to the distress of beef farmers such as her. Donald Trump is pushing Britain for a full food trade deal, chlorine-washed chicken and all, yet that would kill off any deal with Europe. Given Trump’s erratic behaviour over existing deals, and ministers’ and senior MPs’ warning that all agreements with him are only “built on sand”, the time is rapidly approaching when Britain will have to choose. Forget the “bridge across the Atlantic” fantasies: on trade, on defence and in terms of our identity, we are Europeans.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBrexitOpinionEuropean UnionLabourEuropeTrade policycommentShareReuse this content"

This is whyAmu GibOur demands are simple – and they start with stopping the flow of arms to IsraelAmu Gib is an activist currently being held at HMP BronzefieldFri 19 Dec 2025 09.37 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 09.43 ESTShareAmu Gib is one of several prisoners on hunger strike who are awaiting trial for alleged offences relating toPalestine Action. Gib is being being held at HMP Bronzefield. Their charges relate to an alleged break-in at RAF Brize Norton this year. This article is based on interviews with Ainle Ó Cairealláin, host of the Rebel Matters podcast, and the writer and researcher ES Wight on days 18 and 33 of the strike.We began our hunger strike on 2 November: the anniversary of theBalfour declaration, when Britain planted the seeds of the genocide that we are witnessing today.Palestinians are now facing another winter without any of the things that anyone needs to survive. To reach the point we have, where Israel can weaponise starvation, you have to confront who enables that. Who arms them? Who allows Zionist settlers to steal and occupy Palestinian land? Who allows Israel to target farmers andpeople harvesting their olives?I first learned about Palestine in sixth form – not from the teachers, but from other students, young Muslim women. I didn’t understand the historical context back then, but the bombing of civilian populations was so obviously wrong. Then seeing the routine nature of it, the same thing happening from one year to the next, was just so stark. This will keep going unless people put a stop to it. And the more I learned about Britain’s role in enabling these atrocities, the more I was unable to deal with simply doing nothing.Our demands are simple. One: shut down the weapons factories that are supplying arms to Israel. Two: deproscribe Palestine Action. Palestine Action is a direct action protest group and should never have been labelled a terrorist organisation. Three: end the mistreatment of prisoners in custody. Four: set immediate bail. There are people whose parents are really ill or dying, people who have missed major life events. And five: provide a fair trial, including the unredacted release of the correspondence about activists betweenBritish and Israeli officialsand arms dealers.What prompted our hunger strike was partly the understanding that while we’re in here, the prison authorities can do whatever they want. They give us bogus non-association orders so we can’t spend time with each other; they move our lives around at will; they mess with our visits and gym slots, and censor our post. I was barred from the crafts group because they said I was a security threat after I embroidered “Free Palestine” on a cushion – ironically, that was on the day the UKrecognised the state of Palestine.While on a material level it doesn’t always look like we’re “winning”, the habit of resistance – as opposed to the habit of compliance – is something we instil in each other through trust, care and solidarity. And it’s that habit which reminds us that we always have choices, we always have our imaginations. This keeps us alive. There is no rhyme or reason to our imprisonment. But when you decide to take action despite being in prison, you’re free.There’s also the ongoing responsibility to the liberation of Palestine that landed us here – and that we are all still committed to. So our hunger strike is a way of declaring that the state can’t stop you even when it has you in prison, that we are not going to give up the focus and the responsibility to people, whatever conditions we’re in.Pro-Palestine activists daub MoJ building with red paint in protest over hunger strikersRead morePhysically I have lost 11kg now and am moving in slow motion. My blood sugar is really low and my ketones – which is the way you measure the amount of toxins that your body produces by eating itself, burning through fat and muscle instead of calories – are really high. Two fellow hunger strikershave been hospitalisedalready. The response from other prisoners has been incredible. Everyone’s checking in on me, making sure I have hot water, coming to socialise in my cell, lending me clothes to keep warm. This is despite one of the screws telling the other prisoners that they would get negative behaviour points if they help us.So the hunger strike has sharpened the reality of prison: the shouting and screaming from the screws, and the arbitrariness of the rules they enforce. But in another way the hunger strike also makes the prison fade into irrelevance. We’re focused on the world beyond these walls, and it seems much more real. We’re fuelled by every act of resistance we hear about. The prison demands that we be alive on their terms – but now it’s on our terms, and we have the power that they hold over us in our hands, in our bodies and in our empty stomachs. I wish I could convey how much energy resistance brings you.We have the power, agency, responsibility, creativity, resourcefulness and love it takes to be fuelled and moved to action not just once, but every minute of every day – now 46 days for some of us. It doesn’t ever feel like what we’re doing is enough, but in another way it feels like the best thing in the world.An HMP Bronzefield spokesperson said: “We cannot provide information about specific individuals; however, we can confirm that all prisoners are managed in line with the policies and procedures governing the entire UK prison estate. This includes specialist multi-agency processes, led by the government, to assess individual risks and security status. However, if any prisoner has specific complaints, we encourage them to raise them directly with the prison, as there are numerous channels available for addressing such concerns.”Amu Gib is an activist currently being held at HMP BronzefieldDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And my mother? She’s the matriarch of mistletoe.Every December, our home transformed into a living snow globe. We didn’t just buy ornaments, we made them. We didn’t watch Christmas movies, we lived them. We’d cut down our own trees, hand-string popcorn garlands and spend full afternoons debating the correct angle of the angel on top of the tree.But nestled inside all that holiday joy was one tiny annual trauma: the family photo.Why did I ever buy my kids refillable advent calendars? | Zoe WilliamsRead moreThis wasn’t just a casual snap on the stairs. No, no. This was a professional photoshoot. With outfits. And a booking. At Sears.For those unfamiliar with American suburban customs in the 1990s, let me set the scene. Once a year, children across the country were dressed in matching red sweaters, dragged to department stores and forced to smile in front of beige backdrops while a man named Gary – who most definitely had a ponytail – snapped away with a camera the size of a microwave.My mother took this annual production very seriously. We were her Christmas card, naturally. And her card was an artform. She coordinated outfits like a Vogue stylist on a budget. She barked hair instructions like Anna Wintour. If Anna Wintour was a hair stylist. There were props, poses, image references and a level of emotional intensity normally reserved for Oscar campaigns.My sister cried. My brother complained. As the eldest (10, but emotionally already 40), I begged them both to just smile so we could all go home. My father, in the most traditional of father fashion, played court jester behind the photographer, waving stuffed animals and making fart noises to try to elicit joy from our dead-eyed little faces. Mom would rush in to fix a cowlick, whisper “chin down!” through gritted teeth and sprint back behind the lights like a woman possessed.It probably lasted an hour. Maybe less. But to us? It felt like eternity.View image in fullscreenSean Szeps and his siblingsPhotograph: Sean SzepsBy the time I was 10, I knew what was coming. As soon as Mom uttered the words “It’s photo time,” you’d hear synchronised groaning from the backseat and I’d begin my breathing exercises. We’d arrive at the studio in funereal silence, negotiating bribes for good behaviour. The shoot would end with at least one of us in tears, often my mother, and my dad stress-sweating through his Christmas jumper.Now, look. I get it. I’m a parent now. I understand the panicked need to capture everything. To freeze time in pixels before your children grow out of their footie pyjamas and into someone else’s wardrobe. I want the memories, too. I ache for them, honestly.And I do, genuinely, love those old Christmas pictures. I display them proudly. I included a few in my memoir. I even sent one to my Aussie therapist once to give her “an idea of what we were dealing with”.But there’s a certain type of generational healing that comes from saying: “That ends with me.”So I made a decision a few years back. In our house, the Christmas photo still exists. But it follows a very different set of rules: keep it quick, keep it casual, and if it’s not funny … what’s the point?My husband and I don’t hire fancy photographers. We don’t stage anything and we certainly don’t pay for props. We put on reindeer antlers, naturally. We bribe the twins with marshmallows, of course. But we take three photos max. If no one smiles, then we reframe the image as Victorian. If the kids are unsure, my husband and I pretend to burst into tears. Two years ago, we tried to take a family photo and the kids just weren’t in the mood. What did we do? We bailed. There’s no photographic evidence of Christmas that year. Shockingly, life went on.Our most “liked” family photo features my husband and I fake-sobbing next to a mall Santa Claus while the twins look on with utter confusion. We printed it out, framed it and emailed it to the family … with the subject line:Season’s Greetings from the Hot Mess Express.Because that’s us. We’re not trying to win Christmas. We’re just trying to survive it with our sense of humour intact.Somewhere sitting in America, I imagine, my mother is proud. Not because I’ve continued her tradition. But because I understand it now. I understand the desperate, aching love behind every forced smile. The longing to hold on to something, anything, that proves you were all together, and happy, and safe.So maybe it did scar me. Just a little. But only the tiniest stain on an otherwise perfect holiday jumper. And honestly? That’s the stuff that makes the best stories anyway.Sean Szeps is a writer, content creator and father of twins.

Pretending this is not happening is not good enoughFri 19 Dec 2025 13.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 18.29 ESTShareIn 1981, IRA and other republican prisoners went on hunger strike in Northern Ireland, demanding the restoration of their political status. Ten would die; extraordinarily, their leader, Bobby Sands, had been elected as an MP by the time of his death. Margaret Thatcher took a hardline public stance. But by the end, behind the scenes, the governmentwas looking for an exit, and public opinion had shifted significantly.The lives of the Palestine Action-affiliated remand prisonersnow on hunger strikeare at growing risk. On Friday, two reached day 48 without food. (In 1981, one IRA prisoner – 29-year-old Martin Hurson – died on the 46th day.) Twenty-year-old Qesser Zuhrah isbeing treated in hospitalafter she reportedly collapsed at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey. Amu Gib, 30, has also been treated. Three more have refused food for more than 40 days and another, who has diabetes, is eating only every other day. Two others have now ended their protest, one after hospitalisation.The prisoners are variously on remand for alleged criminal damage, aggravated burglary and violent disorder at a factory for Elbit Systems, an Israeli arms manufacturer, in Filton, near Bristol, and in relation to an alleged break-in at RAF Brize Norton. All will have spent more than a year in prison before trial – much longer than the standard custody limit of six months. Some may not be tried until 2027. Demands include immediate bail, stopping restrictions on their communications and endingthe ban on Palestine Action.Ministers should rethink proscription not because of this hunger strike, but because, as this newspaper has previously maintained, it was anilliberal overreaction. There is a striking contrast between the government’s draconian zeal in this regard and its inaction and apparent indifference when faced with the deaths of tens of thousands in a war of annihilation in Gaza. More than 1,600 arrestslinked to support for Palestine Actionwere made in the three months following the ban’s introduction in July. Huda Ammori, the co-founder of the group, hasmounted a legal challenge. But independent reviewers of terrorism laws have anyway argued that proscription ordersshould be subject to time limits. The government does not need to wait for a high court judge; it should change its mind now.More urgently, it should address the issue of remand. Failures of the justice and penal systems are leading toincreasingly lengthy delaysand poor prison conditions. No defendant should wait this long for trial. Such lengthy periods on remand cannot be justified, apart from in the most exceptionally serious cases, where an individual poses an ongoing threat to public safety. Lawyers have pointed out that defendants could be tagged while awaiting trial.Ministers have said that prisons see around 200 hunger strikes a year and are“very experienced”with them. The government is understandably wary of setting precedents in such cases. But it should not simply ignore this in the hope that it will go away. Last week, Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, described the failure of David Lammy – deputy prime minister and justice secretary – to reply to MPs’ request for information on the hunger strikers as “totally unacceptable”. Asked about the prisoners at prime minister’s questions, Sir Keir Starmer’s response was perfunctory. The government must engage with the issue and examine the arguments for bail and the questions around prison communication. At present it looks dangerously complacent, given the prisoners’ rapidly deteriorating health.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A new generation of novelists are doing the same and sales are soaringFri 19 Dec 2025 13.29 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 18.29 ESTShareAt last, the perception of popular fiction by women as“silly novels by lady novelists”, as George Eliot sniffily put it back in 1856, is changing. Next year,the British Book Awardswill recognise romantic fiction for the first time. The recognition is long overdue.This welcome news came in the same week as the deaths of two doyennes of the form,Joanna Trollopeand, at just 55,Sophie Kinsella, only a couple of months after the loss of national treasureDame Jilly Cooper. Between them these publishing power houses produced more than 100 books, sold millions of copies, and inspired hit films and TV series, most recently last year’s star-studded adaptation of Cooper’s 1985Riders.Few writers have such a defining impact that they create a whole new genre: the bonkbuster, or Aga saga, as the novels of Cooper and Trollope patronisingly came to be known. The first of Kinsella’s mega-sellingShopaholic novelsin 2000 followed hot on the heels of Helen Fielding’s Bridget Jones and the birth of “chick-lit”.Jane Austen, whose 250th anniversary was celebrated this week, has mischievously been called the original chick-lit novelist. Her genius was to invent a form of storytelling that kept readers entranced by seemingly trivial matters. Since then, as Sally Rooney haspointed out, the stakes of the English-language novel have been love and marriage. With their acute awareness of money and class, seasoned with a generous sprinkling of wit, Cooper, Trollope and Kinsella are very much part of this tradition.As with Austen, their fiction tells you what life was really like at a certain period – especially for women – better than any history book. In her sex-and-champers sagas of the upper classes, Cooper distilled the competitiveness and excess of the Thatcherite 80s. Trollope’s darker tales of desperate housewives in country towns embraced the changing shape of modern families. And Kinsella’s Shopaholic series spoke to young women with small flats and big overdrafts in the noughties, when credit was cheap and the high street thrived. They all captured the zeitgeist.Some of the criticisms levelled against these novels are fair. Cooper’s attitudes on gender stereotypes and race now seem dated at best. Although, as Trollope insisted, Agas are only mentioned twice in her work, her fictional worlds are financially well insulated. And Kinsella’s novels unapologetically romanticise consumerism. None of these writers claimed great literary prowess. “I’m no lyrical stylist … and I certainly wouldn’t describe my novels as intellectual,” Trollope admitted in aGuardian interview. Instead, they wanted to comfort and entertain;“to cheer people up”, as Cooper said.Romance is all about escapism, so it is no surprise that the genre is flourishing today. While publishing, crime fiction aside, isstruggling, sales of romantic novelshave soaredsince 2020 alongside online communities like BookTok that have enthusiastically popularised them. Last year saw the biggest sales since records began, thanks mainly to the rise of another new genre,romantasy. In the run-up to Christmas, Onyx Storm by Rebecca Yarros hadearned morethan any book, in any category, this year.There has also been no shortage of more conventional romance, including Jessica Stanley’s hit debutConsider Yourself Kissedand novels from the established names Emily Henry, Ali Hazelwood, Jojo Moyes and Marian Keyes. Without romantic fiction, the book world would be much poorer in every sense. No wonder it is being taken seriously at last.Explore more on these topicsRomance booksOpinionFictionJoanna TrollopeSophie KinsellaJilly CooperSally RooneyMarian KeyeseditorialsShareReuse this content"

The sort of people who, if they fancy a new coffee Thermos at 8:42am, simply buy one. Socks? Ordered. Pyjamas? Bought in October. Candles? Seventeen already, none ever lit. These are also the people who believe a £10 gift is radical generosity, holding it out proudly as if they’d made a personal sacrifice, when it costs roughly the same effort as tapping their card at Pret. They mean well; they’re not villains, just living in a different festive universe.For normal people, those who don’t replace headphones the moment they crack, or buy new jumpers because the old ones “feel tired”, Christmas presents aren’t chores, they’re events. We notice things, such as “Mum mentioned she likes that tea”, “Dad’s gloves are falling apart”, “she’d never buy herself that scarf”.Christmas is the time when those small, thoughtful luxuries become possible. The candle isn’t unnecessary, the pyjamas aren’t a waste, the socks aren’t just socks, they’re a sign that someone noticed. Normal people look forward to giving presents as children look forward to the tree. Receiving one, chosen, wrapped and anticipated, carries weight far beyond the price tag.So, by all means, if you want a no-present Christmas, enjoy it. Light one of your 17 candles. Slip into your already-owned pyjamas. Sip from your latest flask. But don’t be surprised if the rest of us quietly miss the thrill, the thought, the meaning, and even the socks. For normal people, Christmas isn’t about having less. It’s about, just for once, having a little more.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus letters fromProf Michael RustinandJon DukeFri 19 Dec 2025 12.12 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 12.19 ESTShareIt is good to see Jonathan Freedland calling out the thuggery of the Trump administration (Donald Trump is pursuing regime change – in Europe, 12 December). To safeguard its security and values, Europe must act swiftly to prepare for a post‑Nato Europe. Most Europe-centric alternative proposals approach the issue from a traditional hard security perspective, not fully severing Nato ties but prioritising EU-led decision-making, often starting as a “Nato-plus” complement before evolving into a standalone entity.Such thinking also generally proposes major increases in military spending, an EU-based command structure independent of the US, integrated European military capabilities, a shared European nuclear deterrent, and binding mutual defence commitments. However, recreating a European-led “house of dynamite” will simply compound existing insecurities. A radical departure from traditional power politics is needed, drawing inspiration from successful neutral states (Austria, Ireland and Switzerland) and human security frameworks pioneered by the UN and Nordic countries.While challenging to implement, a compelling model for sustainable security without nuclear deterrence or offensive military capabilities could be developed. It would embrace a highly credible and transparent whole-society deterrence-by-denial and resilient-resistance approach, rather than a far less credible all-or-nothing threat of dominance and absolute mutual annihilation. This proposed European architecture is based upon ideas that human creativity, solidarity and moral courage can replace nuclear terror and offensive might. It is visionary, but not naive – grounded in proven concepts and successful neutral states. The question is: do European societies have the wisdom to choose long-term human security over short-term military superiority?Dr Ian DavisDirector,Nato WatchJonathan Freedland writes that the Trump administration is seeking to break up the EU by supporting ultra-rightwing parties in European nations. This view seems to be correct. He also states thatVladimir Putinhas long wished to weaken, if not destroy, the EU. Is that view also correct? Russia objects strongly to Ukraine joining Nato, a military alliance directed against it, but far less if at all to Ukraine joining the EU.There is a dissident view of theUkraineconflict put forward by reputed international relations experts such as Profs John Mearsheimer and Jeffrey Sachs, which seems to be denied coverage in mainstream UK media. Their view is that the Ukraine war is largely the consequence of the US project from the end of the cold war in 1991 to incorporate Ukraine in Nato, thus pushing it to Russia’s border.The EU continues to pursue this goal even though the US seems now to have lost interest in it. It would surely be to the advantage of both the EU and Russia to re-establish constructive relations with one another, for which acceptance of a neutral Ukraine is surely the precondition. Wouldn’t it be a good idea for European governments to explore this possibility?Prof Michael RustinUniversity of East LondonJonathan Freedland’s article is a call to action that our government ignores at our national peril. The incompatibility of Keir Starmer’s position of sucking up to Donald Trump while also attempting to participate in a “coalition of the willing” that does not include the US is unsustainable, as is his position of continually talking of increasing defence expenditure in years’ time instead of now.Parliament must put extreme pressure on Starmer to accept these realities and act on them now. It is essential that some sort of alliance of European nations prepared to support Ukraine and deal with Trump is formed. He should bargain his way into the European Defence Fund. Also,Franceand Germany are reintroducing forms of military service due to security concerns. We should be doing the same.Jon DukePocklington, YorkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus letters fromDr Peter PurtonandMichael BulleyFri 19 Dec 2025 12.11 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 12.19 ESTShareIn considering the continued popularity of Nigel Farage despite his alleged racism (Opinion, 15 December), Nesrine Malik concludes: “If he survives … it will be because there is now a little bit of his poison everywhere.” She is right. But not simply because racial intolerance has become newly contagious. It is because of a peculiarly British paradox: we abhor racists yet often excuse racism because we too often want to believe that only racists are capable of it.But racism is no more dependent on racists for its existence than it is reliant on malice to find expression. Too few among the general public are cognisant of this and too many politicians appear to be ignorant of it, which is why so many can be wooed by a hardline anti-immigration stance without recognising the extent to which it employs racist tropes.The likes of Farage, meanwhile, know very well that public scrutiny of racism is easily hoodwinked by face-saving talk of the “intention” of those implicated and the “benefit of the doubt” that this invokes on their behalf.Until we are prepared to recognise how racism emerges from problematic behaviours and attitudes – however commonplace, jocular or inadvertently produced – we shall remain perplexed but complicit spectators to its rising tide. Or become one of the blameless, inaudible but inevitably violated groups it targets. It is not only poison we must be careful of, it is passivity.Paul McGilchristCromer, NorfolkNesrine Malik misses a key point: demonstrating that theReform UKleader held racist views actually reinforces his support. Racism never went away, it just kept its head down. As a white male living in a predominantly Asian community, many times other white residents confided their racist views to me, thinking I must share them. Now such views have become respectable again. Labour’s policy of feeding the tiger will lead to the beast coming back for more.Dr Peter PurtonSouthall, LondonNesrine Malik’s article on racism leads to the uncomfortable idea that democracy is OK as long as the good people can fiddle it to keep the bad ones out of power. Once it becomes genuinely democratic, you might find that the intelligent and virtuous are outnumbered on three fronts – by the stupid and virtuous, the intelligent and evil, and the stupid and evil.Michael BulleyChalon-sur-Saône, FranceHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

He was fired around 2 December, the National Association of Immigration Judges confirmed.It is unclear why Day was fired. He did not comment when contacted by the AP, and a justice department spokesperson declined to discuss personnel matters.Hiring of military lawyers as immigration judges alarms law expertsRead moreBut federal data from November shows he ruled on asylum cases in ways at odds with the Trump administration’s stated goals.Of the 11 cases he concluded in November, he granted asylum or some other type of relief allowing the migrant to remain in the United States a total of six times, according to federal data analyzed by Mobile Pathways, a San Francisco-based non-profit.Such favorable outcomes for migrants have become increasingly rare as the Trump administration seeks to slash a huge backlog of 3.8m asylum cases by radically overhauling the nation’s 75 immigration courts.As part of that drive, the Trump administration has fired almost 100 judges viewed as too liberal and over the summer eased rules allowing any attorney, regardless of their legal background, to apply to become what recent recruitment ads refer to as a “Deportation Judge”.In response, Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, in Septemberapproved sendingup to 600military lawyersto hear asylum cases. The goal, migrant advocacy groups say, is to redefine a judge’s traditional duties as a fair, independent arbiter of asylum claims into something akin to a rubber stamp in a robe for the White House’s mass deportation goals.The American Immigration Lawyers Association has decried the influx of military officers lacking expertise in immigration law, likening them to cardiologists attempting to do a hip replacement. But Pentagon and White House officials have defended the move.So far, only 30 members of the military have been detailed to the immigration courts and for the most part appear to have lived up to the administration’s expectations. Nine out of every 10 migrants whose asylum cases were heard by such judges in November were either ordered removed from the US or requested to leave the country voluntarily, according to federal data. Overall, the military judges ordered removal 78% of the time compared with 63% for all other judges.But those like Day, whose rulings countered that trend, are especially vulnerable if it is determined they violated their military duties, said Dana Leigh Marks, a retired immigration judge.“It is hard to imagine someone being fired so quickly, after five weeks on the bench, unless it was for ideological reasons,” said Marks, the former head of the National Association of Immigration Judges. “It’s especially unfair to military judges because they don’t have the same civil service protections and could face severe consequences for failing in their assignment.”The Uniform Command of Military Justice, which governs service members, forbids senior military leaders from interfering or retaliating against military attorneys for their actions in a military tribunal. Army regulations also require judge advocate general attorneys to proceed with candor and honesty much like expectations of all licensed lawyers.But whether those standards apply to military lawyers working outside the normal confines of a military tribunal is untested.Brenner Fissell, a Villanova University law professor, said that there were a number of personnel actions that can be taken – letters of counseling or reprimand – that, even if found to be baseless later, would affect one’s potential for promotion and affect their discharge. Appealing such decisions, he said, was a byzantine process that can take years and require hiring a costly lawyer.A graduate of American University law school, Day has held multiple jobs in the federal government over the past two decades while simultaneously serving as a lieutenant colonel in the US army reserve’s judge advocate general’s corps.Unlike federal judges, who have lifetime tenure, immigration judges are employees of the justice department, which runs immigration courts, and can be fired by the attorney general with fewer restraints.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationUS militaryLaw (US)US politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Also in the race was Lullaby from the charity campaign Together for Palestine, which reached No 5.“It’s hard to put into words how special this feels,” Kylie told Official Charts. “BeingChristmasNo 1 really is the most wonderful gift.”It’s Kylie’s first No 1 in 22 years, after Slow in 2003, and only her second solo Top 10 hit since 2010’s All the Lovers. Xmas makes her the first woman to secure UK No 1 singles in four different decades, and she’s a rare Australian Christmas chart-topper – Nicole Kidman was the previous one, with her Robbie Williams duet Somethin’ Stupid in 2001.In a way, Kylie has been at Christmas No 1 once before, but only as a small part of the 1989 version of Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas?, performing alongside Cliff Richard, Bananarama and many more – the song doesn’t count as an official Kylie hit on the charts. She had nearly reached the top spot the previous year with her ultra-sappy Jason Donovan duet Especially for You, but Richard kept them off No 1 with his arguably even sappier Mistletoe and Wine.Kylie’s Xmas was helped along by sales of CD and vinyl versions, but its success is all the more remarkable because it isn’t available on most streaming services: she recorded it as an exclusive track forAmazonMusic.The online retailer has identified Christmas music as a big draw for customers in recent years, using exclusive songs as a way to tempt them into signing up to its music streaming offering (the songs can also be heard on YouTube). These exclusives are also often played when Christmas music is requested on Amazon’s Alexa devices, helping to increase their chart success.It’s the first time an Amazon-commissioned song has reached Christmas No 1, though previous efforts have nearly managed it. Last year Tom Grennan’s It Can’t Be Christmas reached No 3, and in 2023 Sam Ryder reached No 2 with It’s Christmas to Me. Ellie Goulding’s Amazon-exclusive cover of Joni Mitchell’s River, released in 2019, reached No 1 just after Christmas that year. Katy Perry, Olivia Dean, Laufey, Jorja Smith and George Ezra are among the other artists to have recorded Christmas songs for Amazon.Speaking to Music Weekas the Kylie campaign kicked off, Amazon Music’s Alex Nutton heralded “significant investment and promotional support in commissioning new Christmas tracks these past few years … A great Christmas track has the power to stand the test of time. When commissioning these songs, our goal is always to create a new holiday favourite that customers will return to year after year.”In terms of pure sales,Together for Palestinecame out on top, but Lullaby was relatively little streamed. The song is an adaptation of Palestinian lullaby Yamma Mwel El Hawa, featuring a mix of the original Arabic lyrics and new ones written by Peter Gabriel. It is performed by Palestinian artists such as Nai Barghouti alongside British ones including Neneh Cherry, Celeste, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Together for Palestine co-creator Brian Eno.Earlier this month, Enotold the Guardianhe was “not gonna be completely disappointed” if the song didn’t reach No 1, because “Christmas singles are a thing unto themselves.” Proceeds from the song will be distributed to Palestinian causes via the Choose Love charity.The rest of the chart is predictably stuffed with Christmas songs: 27 of them in all. Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas is You and Brenda Lee’s Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree are at No 3 and No 4, and the Pogues, Kelly Clarkson, Elton John and Bobby Helms’s Christmas songs all feature in the Top 10 (Dave and Tems’ Raindance is a non-Christmassy outlier at No 7).‘Harder work than almost any album we ever did’: Pink Floyd’s Wish You Were Here turns 50Read moreIn the album chart, Pink Floyd’s 50th anniversary reissue of Wish You Were Here is at No 1, ensuring they break an obscure record: the longest time between an album’s first No 1 appearance and its most recent. Previously this had been the Beatles’ Abbey Road, which topped the chart in 1969 and then again in 2019, a slightly shorter gap of 49 years and 252 days.Wish You Were Here is Pink Floyd’s second UK No 1 album of the year, after the live album Pink Floyd at Pompeii – MCMLXXII. They have also scored a Christmas No 1 single in the past, with Another Brick in the Wall in 1979.Kylie was last week’s album chart-topper with Kylie Christmas (Fully Wrapped), a reissue of her 2015 Christmas album.Explore more on these topicsUK chartsPop and rockKylie MinogueChristmasAmazonE-commercenewsShareReuse this content"

The decision comes less than two months after Tesla shareholders approved a new plan thatcould be worth $1tnto Musk, already the world’s richest person, in a decade’s time.Musk’s fortune currently stands at anestimated $600bn.Rescinding the pay deal would be “inequitable”, and would leave Musk “uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years”, theDelawaresupreme court justices wrote, echoing arguments from Tesla board members earlier this year.Elon Musk’s net worth hits estimated $600bn as SpaceX prepares for IPORead moreAt thecompany’s annual meetingin Austin, Texas, this November, shareholders had approved a stopgap measure for Musk, ensuring – regardless of how the Delaware supreme court ruled on this appeal – that he would get the $56bn his supporters say he is owed.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment or for more details on Friday’s ruling.Both of the compensation packages, as well as other pay plans approved by Tesla shareholders, require Musk to meet a number of lofty goals related to product development and increasing the company’s value to $8.5tn in order to cash out on those awards.The case that first invalidated the original pay package was launched seven years ago when a Tesla stockholder, who held just nine shares at the time, filed a suit arguing that the plan was set up to overpay the world’s richest person. That first ruling voided the billions Musk was to receive, which left the Tesla co-founder less than pleased.Not only did Musk relocate Tesla to Texas from Delaware, where it was incorporated at the time the suit began, he also publiclylashed out against the stateand specifically its court of chancery and chief judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick.“She has done more to damage Delaware than any judge in modern history,” he wrote on X, his social media platform, in February 2024.Tesla stockholders in 2024 were again asked to vote on the 2018 pay package. They approved it, and once again, McCormick struck it down, ruling that the “Superstar CEO”,as she called him, had undue influence in developing his own pay package and that stockholders weren’t fully informed ahead of the vote.US Senate confirms billionaire Musk ally Jared Isaacman as Nasa chiefRead moreMusk has voiced his displeasure ever since.“Any lawyer still recommending incorporation in Delaware at this point should be sued for malpractice,” he posted online earlier this year.In Friday’s opinion, the justices agreed with McCormick’s earlier findings that there was a breach of fiduciary duty in developing the original package and presenting it to shareholders. They ordered $1 be paid to the plaintiff in nominal damages.However, the five judges agreed that rescinding Musk’s full pay package wasn’t appropriate.While Musk has publicly called for other companies to follow his lead and leave Delaware – which has historically beenhome to more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies– experts have tracked only a few dozen companies that have actually done so. That includes big companies including Dropbox and Coinbase, while other tech companies like Meta have only threatened to leave.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDelawareTeslaLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

The defendant, who appeared via video link from youth detention accommodation, spoke only to confirm his name and did not enter a plea.During a brief hearing, Judge Blair KC, the recorder of Bristol, set a provisional trial date for 15 June next year.Later on Friday, Aria’s family on her mother’s side said in a statement: “For those who didn’t have the privilege of knowing Aria, she was the most beautiful little soul – happy-go-lucky, full of light, and joy. She loved to sing and dance, and she took such pride in dressing up, always wanting to look just like her mummy.“The loss of Aria has devastated us beyond words. Our hearts are broken in a way we never imagined possible. As a family, we are holding one another close and doing everything we can to support each other through this unimaginable time. We are truly touched by the lovely messages we have received from friends and the local community over recent days. It has meant an awful lot to us all.”Emergency services were called to Lime Close in Weston-super-Mare just before 6.10pm on Monday, where Aria was pronounced dead at the scene. Shortly after, the 15-year-old boy was arrested in nearby Worle and taken into custody.His father was among those attending in the public gallery at Bristol crown court on Friday. The teenager is next expected to appear in court on 16 March.In a separate tribute, Aria’s father, Tom Thorpe, who lives in Portsmouth, said: “It’s hard to put into words how devastating it is, our little Aria, that you’re up there with the angels looking over us. How sad it’s going to be not hearing: ‘Dad, how long left?’ on our long journeys back and forth at weekends.“How I’ll long to hear you asking me to test you with maths, ‘numbers’ as you called it, to entertain you when you get bored with the iPad. How sad it’s going to be not making your buttery crackers, grapes and a yoghurt for your breakfast.“You were such a brave, kind-hearted and a beautiful innocent soul. You always put a smile on people’s faces with your wacky ways and just outright madness. You always found it so easy to show your affection to others and ensure others around you were happy and never bored.”He added: “I’ll never ever forget our time in Disneyland as a family; seeing your face light up when we were watching the princess show was a picture that will last for ever in our minds. Your other little family down here in Portsmouth will for ever miss you. We’ll miss you begging to go outside, even in the pouring rain, just to have as much fun as possible in the little time we had at weekends.“You will be greatly missed, you special little angel. A life gone far too early but I hope a life lived well. We all love you dearly. Goodnight darling.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sources cited by the Telegraph said that, after the inquiry, steps were taken to limit contact between Walliams and some employees. Measures reportedly included ensuring some staff did not work directly with him, advising them to attend meetings in pairs and discouraging visits to his home.The decision to sever ties came after HarperCollins’ former chief executive, Charlie Redmayne, suddenly stepped down in October and was replaced on an interim basis by Kate Elton.In a statement to the Guardian, a HarperCollins spokesperson said: “After careful consideration, and under the leadership of its new CEO, HarperCollins UK has decided not to publish any new titles byDavid Walliams.”Walliams has “strongly” denied the publisher’s allegations, with a spokesperson saying: “David has never been informed of any allegations raised against him by HarperCollins.“He was not party to any investigation or given any opportunity to answer questions. David strongly denies that he has behaved inappropriately and is taking legal advice.”Walliams rose to prominence in the early 2000s as the co-creator and star of BBC’s Little Britain, which became a cultural phenomenon and made him one of the most recognisable comedians in the UK. He later became a familiar television personality through roles as a presenter and as a judge on Britain’s Got Talent. From 2008, Walliams reinvented himself as a children’s author, achieving huge commercial success. He has authored more than 40 books and short story collections – in 2019, it was estimated that he had sold £100m worth of books.However, Walliams, 54, has come under fire in recent years. Critics have challenged aspects of his writing, including the use of stereotypes. In 2021, a story titled Brian Wong, Who Was Never, Ever Wrong, about a Chinese boy,was removedfrom Walliams’ book The World’s Worst Children.Walliams left his role as a judge on Britain’s Got Talent in 2022 after 10 years, when the Guardian reported on a leaked transcript showing him making crude remarks about contestants during auditions in 2020. He referred to one contestant as a “cunt” and said “she thinks you want to fuck her, but you don’t”, about another. Walliams apologised for the comments.Explore more on these topicsDavid WalliamsnewsShareReuse this content"

The results, she said, were a shock: although crop yields increase, they become less nutrient-dense. While zinc levels in particular drop, lead levels increase.“Seeing how dramatic some of the nutritional changes were, and how this differed across plants, was a big surprise,” she told the Guardian. “We aren’t seeing a simple dilution effect but rather a complete shift in the composition of our foods … This also raises the question of whether we should adjust our diets in some way, or how we grow or produce our food.”While scientists have been looking at the effects ofmore CO2in the atmosphereon plants for a decade, their work has been difficult to compare. The new research established a baseline measurement derived from the observation that the gas appears to have alinear effect on growth, meaning that if the CO2level doubles, so does the effect on nutrients. This made it possible to compare almost 60,000 measurements across 32 nutrients and 43 crops, including rice, potatoes, tomatoes and wheat.“Although there was a lot of data from previous studies, there were few answers,” said Ter Haar. “These studies used paired experiments, where plants were grown under identical conditions except for one thing: the CO2level. This gives insight into possible changes, but the sample sizes were usually too small to draw conclusions from. Comparing these individual studies with each other was difficult because, as we know, the baseline of CO2is continuously increasing in our atmosphere, meaning that the baseline in these experiments is also increasing.”Their “baseline” measurement was a gas concentration of 350 parts per million – sometimes referred to as the last “safe” level. They compared this with a concentration of 550 parts per million, whichsome scientists expect to be reached by 2065. Most nutrients would respond negatively to the rise in concentration, they said, with an average drop of 3.2%.However, zinc in chickpeas would be expected to plummet by up to 37.5%, with a “significant” decrease in protein, zinc and iron in essential crops such as rice and wheat. The researchers warned of “devastating health consequences” including “hidden hunger, where people have sufficient food calorically but insufficient nutrients”.The CO2level is now 425.2 parts per million, the paper said, which had already resulted in “lowered levels of plant nutrition due to CO2rise”.The study is part of a growing body of research on the impact of climate breakdown on crops, not only outdoors but also in artificial conditions. The Netherlands isone of the world’s largest agricultural exporters, withthree-quarters of its productionfor export andmore than 4,100 hectaresof greenhouses, where crops are grown inCO2-enriched environmentsto increase the yield.“Climate change isn’t a faraway problem,” said Ter Haar. “The effects are already on our dinner plate.”Other experts welcomed the Dutch study, saying it was a good basis for further investigation. Courtney Leisner, an assistant professor at the school of plant and environmental sciences at Virginia Tech in the US, coauthoreda study earlier this yearon how crop improvement strategies could counteract the negative effects of CO2on crop quality. “This study offers critical insights into how environmental conditions affect crop nutritional quality, which is essential for sustaining future food security,” she said.There are, however, other factors such as fertiliser application that play an important role in how nutritious our crops are, said Jan Verhagen, a researcher on climate change and sustainable agriculture at Wageningen University.“Indeed, nutrient levels in plants are changing,” he said. “Whether this is only related to CO2is, I believe, less clear … we know that nutrition is a key factor in food security and health in general, so it makes sense to shift the focus on this topic.”He said more experiments would be needed to help design breeding programmes for crops with certain nutrient levels under different environmental stresses to better understand the effects of agricultural practices.The meta-analysis raises as many questions as it answers, said Ter Haar – who wants to do further study on climate change and nutrients.“Our goal isn’t to scare people,” she said. “The first step in solving a problem is acknowledging it, and with that, we think our study could be a useful puzzle piece.”The researchwas published in the journal Global Change Biology.Explore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsFarmingFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

The ancient forests hold groves of alerce trees that sprouted about 1,000BC, four centuries before the rise of the Roman empire.The newly acquired lands hold 11% of the remaining alerce forests on Earth. Logged for their solid, water-resistant trunk, alerce wood was fashioned into ship masts and telephone poles.View image in fullscreenThe thick reddish bark on the alerce tree allows it to survive forest fires, droughts and 11ft of annual rainfall.Photograph: Marcelo SalazarSparsely populated by a few remote homestead camps and rustic campgrounds, the Cochamó Valley is surrounded by 3,200ft (970 metre) granite cliffs that in 1997 lured climbers seeking the first ascent of rock faces on Cerro Trinidad.In 2012, rancher families and lone cowboys living in the valley joined forces with tour operators, NGOs, climbers, backpackers and explorers invociferous opposition to a $400m hydroelectric planthat included 150-metre transmission towers, access roads and complete disruption of the rural way of life along the Manso River. The communities then worked together to stop a high-end vacation home development and plans to pave roads through the valley.“Our goal was to transform threats into opportunities,” said José Claro, the president of Puelo Patagonia.Claro described how one large-scale project after another was stymied by Puelo Patagonia and the local community working together.The conservation campaigns highlighted Cochamó’s importance as a biological corridor that could connect to the surrounding 1.6m hectares of protected lands in Chile and Argentina. A coalition of local and foreign NGOs known as Conserva Puchegüín then began recruiting donors to fund long-term conservation strategies.Location mapThe valley receives over 3 metres of rain a year, making industrial agriculture virtually impossible. Cattle grazing is difficult as the mountain slopes are nearly vertical.Except for a few cave drawings attributed to native peoples from present-day Argentina who migrated along riverbanks, this corner of northern Patagonia reveals few signs of longstanding human habitation.These never-logged forests and free-flowing turquoise rivers are a field biologist’s paradise. The area teems with ferns the size of beach umbrellas. The undergrowth of native bamboo makes bushwhacking through this temperate rainforest nearly impossible, even with a machete.The dense underbrush prevents many larger mammals from migrating through the valley. Local species of deer known as puduhave adapted so they are rarely taller than 40cm.View image in fullscreenChilean cowboys often lead pack horses into Cochamó Valley with saddles and sacks filled with food and supplies.Photograph: Valentina Thenoux“You think about those trees being cut down or the valley flooded. It’s just terrifying,” said Alex Taylor, the chief executive of Cox Enterprises, who was first introduced to Cochamó in early 2025 by fellow fly fisher Yvon Chouinard, the founder of the clothing company Patagonia.Taylor returned to Atlanta with an idea for the James M Cox Foundation to support the protection of the valley. The other trustees agreed and approved a $20m donation.“It’s almost like the spiritual centre of the universe from a forest biodiversity standpoint,” said Taylor. “I can’t think of a place more pristine.”View image in fullscreenHikers and climbers who manage to reach the peaks inside Cochamó Valley are treated to a panoramic view of the many unclimbed peaks inside the future park.Photograph: Valentina ThenouxThe successful fundraising campaign to buy the land is the beginning of what is likely to be a decades-long project to conserve the homesteader way of life and the valley’s rich biodiversity.“How do we ensure that traditional living and practices that have been going on for the better part of a century or more don’t get disrupted?” said Alex Perry, the Latin America general manager for Patagonia, which has been funding local conservation groups in the Cochamó Valley for more than a decade and in 2024 donated $4m through the company’s non-profit owner, Holdfast Collective.“How do we make it so that this model is something that can be replicated and scaled and is attractive to the next generation?”While the 133,000 hectares may eventually be donated to the Chilean national park system, recently passed environmental legislation in Chile created a system that secures permanent protection of designated areas even when the land remains in private ownership.As the valley’s popularity surges among hikers, climbers and horseback riders, a limit of 15,000 visitors a year has been set.Reservations are now requiredand a master plan of hiking trails, base camps and horse stables is being developed with direct participation from the local communities.“The beauty of the Pucheguín project is that it’s coming with an endowment,” said Anne Deane, the president of the Freyja Foundation which helped fund land purchases in the valley and recruited additional funders including the Wyss Foundation. “Cochamó is only going to get more and more popular, so it’s very important that there is an operating budget to support it.”Using camera traps and through collaboration with residents, a survey of the area’s wildlife has begun. A small herd of Chile’s national symbol, the now-endangered huemul deer, was recently discovered.View image in fullscreenA pair of endangered huemul deer grazing in Cochamó Valley.Photograph: Benjamin ValenzuelaThere are no roads through the valley and electricity is generated house by house through solar or wind. The homes are often rough cabins set on riverbanks, allowing small motorboats to navigate up and down the Puelo River. Pack horses still haul in most food and supplies.The Cochamó conservation project was inspired by thelandmark conservation efforts of Kris and Doug Tompkins, who abandoned successful leadership roles at the Patagonia and Esprit clothing companies respectively, moved to a remote cabin in Patagonia anddedicated 25 years and $300mto creating national parks in Chile and Argentina.By buying massive swathes of land and then negotiating with the Chilean government to expand its existing parks, the Tompkins conservation group – now known asRewilding Chile– helped protect more than 5.7m hectares of wildlands.The path to becoming a park may be different in Cochamó. The measly budget allocated for national parks in Chile – highlighted by therecent deaths of five hikers in Torres del Paine national park– has convinced many conservation advocates to look at creating private parks that combine conservation with low impact commercial operations such as family farms or asolar-powered craft brewery.The plans for Cochamó are to place at least 80% in protected national park level status, while the remaining 20% will be zoned for multiple use, allowing locals to earn a living off tourism and traditional activities such as family farms and their small ranches.View image in fullscreenThere are no roads through the valley and electricity is generated house by house through solar or wind.Photograph: Rodrigo MannsOn a recent hike through Cochamó, the connection between conservation and community was evident.A Chilean cowboy hauling a horse piled high with fruits, vegetables and canned food stopped to share news.

The remote bridge washed away by the floods was nearly rebuilt.Stopping to chat in the cool fern forest, the cowboy spoke with excitement about the German tourists he would that evening be guiding down the mountain, on a path that his father helped build and that his children might one day continue to use and preserve.This article was amended on 19 December 2025. An earlier version said the valley was purchased for $78m; however, this was the amount raised by environmental groups. The land was bought for $63m.Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasNational parksnewsShareReuse this content"

Photographs by Ugo MelloneThe age of extinction is supported byAbout this contentFri 19 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 00.02 ESTShareIn the southern Peloponnese, the Greek fir is a towering presence. The deep green, slow-growing conifers have long defined the region’s high-altitude forests, thriving in the mountains and rocky soils. For generations they have been one of the country’s hardier species, unusually capable of withstanding drought, insects and the wildfires that periodically sweep through Mediterranean ecosystems. These Greek forests have lived with fire for as long as anyone can remember.So when Dimitrios Avtzis, a senior researcher at the Forest Research Institute (FRI) of Elgo-Dimitra, was dispatched to document the aftermath of a spring blaze in the region, nothing about the assignment seemed exceptional. He had walked into countless burnt landscapes, tracking the expected pockets of mortality, as well as the trees that survived their scorching.View image in fullscreenHardy slow-growing conifers usually thrive in the Peloponnese mountains.This time, however, something felt wrong almost immediately. The scale was off. As Avtzis and his colleagues moved deeper into the trees, the familiar sights of a post-fire forest gave way to something far more unsettling.The scale of the damage was profoundDimitrios Avtzis“There were hundreds upon hundreds of hectares worth of lost trees,” he says – not just those lost in the fire itself, but large patches dead and dying among the green, where the flames had not reached them.In the Peloponnese mountains, whole stretches of green forest are turning orange, as the long-lived fir trees dry up and die. The level of destruction was so far beyond what Avtzis had seen in previous years, it forced him to immediately contact the environment ministry and raise the alarm.“The scale of the damage was profound,” he says.View image in fullscreenResearchers found ‘hundreds upon hundreds of hectares worth of lost trees’.Researchers across Greece and central Europe have warned for years that climate breakdown will push local ecosystems into unfamiliar territory. Wildfires are not new: according to data from theGlobal Forest Watch, between 2001 and 2024, Greece lost 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres) of trees to fires.But fires are not the only thing killing trees, and the forces shaping wildfire aftermath have shifted dramatically in the past five years. What Avtzis saw was the result of multiple pressures stacking on top of one another, each amplified by the climate crisis.The first is severe, prolonged drought, now a defining feature of Greece’s climate. The dryness is compounded by a steady decline in winter snow. A study by the Institute for Environmental Research and Sustainable Development and the National Observatory of Athens found that between 1991 and 2020, Greece lost an average of1.5 days of snow cover a year, eroding one of the country’s most important sources of slow-release moisture.View image in fullscreenProlonged droughts and reduced snow fall are among the causes of the forest die-off.Then comes the biological fallout. Drought-degraded soils and shrinking groundwater leave fir trees weakened, creating an opening for insects. “We know that severe drought weakens the trees,” Avtzis says. “But when we looked more closely at what was happening, we found bark beetles had taken advantage. They were attacking the trees.”How an invasion of purple flowers made Iceland an Instagram paradise – and caused a biodiversity crisisRead moreBark beetles – particularly those in the Scolytinae subfamily – have emerged as a growing threat to Greece’s already stressed forests over the past two years.Their name is owed to the fact that the insects bore beneath the outer bark, cutting into the systems trees rely on to transport water and nutrients. Once they establish themselves inside drought-stressed firs, their numbers can rise rapidly. “When a population reaches outbreak levels,” Avtzis says, “it becomes extremely difficult to bring it back under control.”The phenomenon is not confined to Greece. Bark beetle outbreaks have become a wider European concern, Avtzis says, mirroring patterns seen elsewhere on the continent. “SouthernEuropemay be more vulnerable,” he says, “but we’re observing similar dynamics in countries like Spain.”The implication is concerning– indicating that the drivers behind the Peloponnese die-offs are not local anomalies, but symptoms of a broader ecological shift.Yet amid the accelerating pressures of the climate crisis, there are cautious notes of optimism. Nikos Markos, a forest climatologist at FRI, points to the regenerative capacity of Mediterranean ecosystems. “Post-fire regeneration can be quite satisfactory,” he says, “even in some areas of the Peloponnese.”View image in fullscreenForest recovery after fires is slow and uneven.Recovery, however, is slow and uneven. “It is not something we can see in the first year,” Markos adds. “It may take four or five years.”Avtzis is pragmatic when he speaks about what it will take to protect Greece’s highland forests. “I’m going to be realistic,” he says. “The government and the ministries have to take the initiative and mobilise the necessary funding to confront this problem.”Some steps, he notes, were already beginning by the time he had submitted his report on the Peloponnese. “They contacted the major regional forest services and asked how much funding was needed,” he says. “What really matters now is whether those plans are actually put into action.”Asked whether Greece’s shifting meteorological patterns are likely to keep accelerating, and whether that poses an existential risk for southern Europe’s forests, Avtzis pauses. “There is no time to be pessimistic,” he says. “But we have a lot of work to do.”The tools, he says, already exist. “We have the knowledge. We have the scientists. Now, we need to start going out and talking about this,” he says. “Because what we’re seeing now is only going to become more frequent and more intense.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageView image in fullscreenThe climate crisis will make extreme weather events more frequent for Europe’s forests.Explore more on these topicsThe age of extinctionTrees and forestsGreeceClimate crisisWildfiresEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A friend of his said: “It is rather rude, but at £500k, we are rather better value.” Membership of 5 Hertford Street is a relative snip at less than £2,000 a year.View image in fullscreenThe bar at 5 Hertford Street, which has long been a haunt of the libertarian side of the Tory party.Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images for Pace LondonOn a recent December afternoon, the bauble-bedecked club bursting at the seams with Conservative big hitters and their sequin-clad guests, a member asked the Guardian: “Who would pay half a million to hang out with Liz Truss?”The Leconfield was dreamed up by Truss and the property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz, who is transforming his Curzon Street offices for the venture. Unlike 5 Hertford Street, with its gleaming, blood-red facade, Leconfield House is a fairly run-down office block opposite a William Hill betting shop.While 5 Hertford Street is known for its swish sushi bar, fairy light-lit cigar terrace and friendly staff who will bring you the most expensive club sandwich you have ever eaten on a silver platter, Truss is championing no such trimmings in her pitch for new members.View image in fullscreenThe offices of Robert Tchenguiz, a two-minute walk from 5 Hertford Street, are being transformed into his and Truss’s new venture, the Leconfield.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyHer new club will be a “strategic nexus for a global network of pro-growth leaders”, she declares on its website, where she is heralded as the “56thprime minister of the United Kingdom”. The venue will be “a secure ecosystem where you can operate with others at the forefront of technology, policy and capital,” she adds.Business dealings and political ventures – including Truss’s own leadership campaign – are frequently schemed up in the plush meeting rooms of what insiders call “5H”. However, the club does not market itself as a “unique business centre”, rather a social club where deals are struck on the side.View image in fullscreenGeorge Osborne with the journalist Emily Sheffield at 5 Hertford Street in 2020.Photograph: David M Benett/Dave Benett/Getty ImagesWhile Nigel Farage is among those to have visited, the club has long been the home of the libertarian side of the Tory party, with Boris Johnson, Zac Goldsmith (Birley’s half-brother), Priti Patel and Truss herself often seen within. Its rooms, decorated in maximalist style with rare paintings jostling for space on the walls, have been a sanctuary for her in turbulent times. Its owners have allowed her to host events, and while trade secretary, Trussnotoriously demandedto have a £3,000 lunch there with the trade envoy to the former US president Joe Biden on the taxpayer’s dime.While 5H are understood to be mildly peeved that she is taking advantage of their hospitality to drum up support for a rival club just a two-minute walk away, it is not feared that she will make a dent in their business ventures. It is also believed to be unlikely that regular visitors including Harry Styles, Leonardo DiCaprio, Prince William and Margot Robbie will be swapping 5H for the Truss club any time soon.Location map of the two clubsOne former cabinet minister and member of 5H simply laughed when asked if he would become a “founder member” of the Leconfield, and that is understood to be the general attitude among loyalists to the existing club.The transformation of Leconfield House into Truss’s lair is the latest attempt by Tchenguiz to revamp the property. In 2022, he wasfoiled by the Planning Inspectoratein his attempt to turn the building into a 70-bedroom luxury hotel with a spa. Last year, he enlisted top architects to transform Leconfield intohigh-end flats, extravagantly priced at £7,500 a sq ft.Finally, the tycoon has bet on Truss to help him make the building into, as the website claims, a “beacon of sophistication and elegance”.Truss did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsLiz TrussLondonConservativesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

People denied the truth, documents going missing or being altered, families being blamed, families not being treated with respect. Forcing people to fight in grief is inhumane.”The IPA role,first announced in 2023, was born out of a report that found failings in the way the bereaved families of the Hillsborough disaster were treated by authorities.The role is the first of its kind in the world, and Butts will be responsible for ensuring victims of large incidents know their rights, get access to support, and are represented in inquires and inquests, as well as regularly reporting to parliament on her findings.View image in fullscreenButts says an important part of her role will be uncovering the truth in the immediate aftermath of large tragedies to avoid lengthy public inquiries.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianShe will also be able to produce independent reports on incidents without the need for ministerial approval.Only days after starting her five-year term in September, Butts travelled to Manchester to support the victims of the synagogue terror attack. “Within 24 hours, we set up a dedicated casework function so that victims, families and the wider community had a direct route to us for information, advocacy and practical help,” she said.“Its a stark reminder that this office is not symbolic. It’s operational. It’s active in real time and built to stand with victims from the very first moment a crisis happens.”She said an important part of her role would be ensuring the truth was exposed in the immediate aftermath of disaster so there would be no need for the substantial inquiries and reports the country had seen in recent years.“We are there in the early hours, weeks, months and years so that we don’t have to get to the stage where we have to have a public inquiry that lasts decades, where the truth has to be prized from institutions,” she said.“That’s the point. The lesson from Hillsborough is not that we should recreate Hillsborough-type panels, but we should build a system where we never again need one.”Butts has a long history in advocacy work. She said she was inspired by her mother, who campaigned on issues such as school exclusions, poor housing and racial disproportionality in “sus” [stop and search] arrests when she was growing up in west London.Butts joined the Metropolitan police authority, where she oversaw significant change in the aftermath of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, and went on to become a commissioner at the then Independent Police Complaints Commission (now the Independent Office for Police Conduct) during its Hillsborough investigation.She also chaired the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket, which published alandmark report in 2023finding the sport was “racist, sexist and elitist”.She said her biggest challenge as standing advocate was likely to be building trust with people who are “justifiably mistrustful” of the state and the officials who represent it. “My ambition is to quickly build credibility and to show through my actions that my loyalty is with victims, not to institutions,” she said.Final Hillsborough report ends investigation with no consequencesRead moreHer remit covers incidents that take place from September 2024 onwards, defined as events “declared in writing by the secretary of state to have caused the death of or serious harm to a significant number of individuals”, which would include events similar to the Grenfell Tower fire, theHillsborough disasterand the Manchester Arena bombing.Butts said she wanted more resources for her office, which come primarily from the Ministry of Justice, saying she did not think she had enough funding and staff to deal with a large-scale incident – although the body could “draw down funds” if needed.She also said she would be keen to expand the role to include individual deaths in “exceptional circumstances” where there is a significant public interest, such as in cases similar toHarry Dunnand Stephen Lawrence.To help inform her approach, she has been speaking with bereaved families from previous disasters still campaigning for justice decades later, such as the relatives of the 50 people who died in theIsle of Man 1973 Summerland fire. “They’ve not been given space and dignity to grieve because they have to fight for the truth – that’s profoundly wrong and inhumane,” she said.One of her first priorities will be pushing for full implementation of theHillsborough law making its way through parliament, which will lead to public servants who deliberately cover up state-related disasters facing prison.She said she welcomed the legislation, particularly how it would ensure “victims’ families are not outnumbered by armies of lawyers” when attending inquests and inquiries, but it that it had some significant shortcomings.“It’s taken 36 years since Hillsborough for parliament to stand on the verge of legislating for honesty, accountability and equality of arms. Yet families are absent from the bill itself. I think that’s a gap. It’s a massive legitimacy gap,” she said. “And it’s truly shameful that we need legislation at all.“The very fact that this legal duty of candour is required tells us how deep and persistent the problems have been.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandWalesGrenfell Tower fireHillsborough disasternewsShareReuse this content"

There have been no reports of injuries or damage to property.The British Geological Survey (BGS) has said that the more recent earthquake was an aftershock from the quake felt earlier in the month and that it was “not unusual” for tremors such as these to come in the weeks or months after bigger earthquakes.Earthquake of 3.3 magnitude rattles Lancashire and Lake DistrictRead morePeople in the Morecambe Bay area have described the quake with different levels of severity, with some saying there was “a quick sharp shaking jolt” and that it “made a thunder noise”, and others posting that it made a “a huge bang” and there was “a loud boom and the bedroom window shook” and “the radiators and pictures rattled”.Online, one resident posted: “Woke me up. Sounded like a short rumbling in the distance, like it happened a few streets away. Only lasted a couple of seconds. Nothing like the intensity of the previous one. I didn’t feel the need to check for damage, but because of the last one, I definitely knew it was an earthquake.”Earthquakes in Britain are far rarer than many parts of the world, and of the between 200 and 300 the country experiences every year, only 10% of them are strong enough to be felt or noticed without specialist equipment.Explore more on these topicsEarthquakesLancashireNorth of EnglandGeologynewsShareReuse this content"

Providers will also be allowed to lift this if they choose.The FCA said the changes would allow banks to respond to changing consumer demands, inflation and new technology.However, it said customers should be allowed to set their own limit or turn off the contactless facility if they chose to, and it added that in the short-term it expected most providers to keep their existing restrictions.Contactless card payments were introduced in 2007 with a £10 limit on payments. The limit was raised gradually, to £15 in 2010, £20 in 2012, then £30 in 2015. The Covid pandemic prompted a jump to £45 in 2020, then to £100 in October 2021.Aconsultation on the latest increasewas launched earlier this year.According to research by Barclays Bank, 95% of eligible payments made in shops are now contactless. However, despite rising shop prices, a survey done for the FCA found 76% of consumers thought the limit should be £100 or lower.The FCA said the rule change would apply to banks and card providers that had strong fraud controls in place.It said existing consumer protections would remain, and victims would have to be reimbursed in unauthorised fraud cases, such as if their card is lost or stolen.David Geale, the executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said: “Contactless is people’s favoured way to pay. We want to make sure our rules provide flexibility for the future, and choice for both firms and consumers.”Kate Nicholls, the chair of the trade body UKHospitality, said the change would be “a positive” for her members and other high street businesses.“Contactless has increasingly become the preferred payment method of choice for many people, and lifting the limit can mean quicker and easier experiences for consumers,” she said. “While many people still prefer to use cash or chip and pin, this change adds much-needed flexibility for providers and consumers.”However, Richard Whittle, an economist at the University of Salford, said the extra convenience could come at a cost for consumers. “If this ease of payment leads to consumers spending without thinking, they may be more likely to buy what they don’t really want or need,” he said.“This could be a particular issue with credit cards, when people are spending borrowed money and accumulating debt.”Explore more on these topicsContactless paymentsFinancial Conduct AuthorityConsumer affairsRegulatorsBanks and building societiesBankingCredit cardsnewsShareReuse this content"

Neves Valente was terminated from a position at the university the same year, Foley said.Further details of their connection camein an affidavitby special agent Bryce Ferrara of the FBI’s Boston field office violent crimes taskforce. The five-page document revealed that Neves Valente, who became a US permanent resident in 2017, and whose last known address was in Miami, rented a gray Nissan Sentra car with a Florida tag at a Boston car rental agency on 1 December.Images of the vehicle were captured on numerous surveillance cameras near the Brown campus on various dates between 1 and 12 December, the affidavit states, and it was photographed again on Monday close to Loureiro’s home with a false Maine license plate attached.“This was a highly dangerous individual capable of extreme violence,” Tom Greco, special agent in charge for the Boston division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), told the press conference.Neves Valente’s body was found in a storage unit he rented in Salem, New Hampshire, with a bag and two firearms, as well as evidence “that matches exactly what we see at the scene here in Providence”, Neronha said. There was also a bulletproof vest among the belongings.The authorities said on Friday that Valente had been “very strategic” and avoided certain roads with vehicle license plate readers in the Providence area. However, license plate readers ultimately helped investigators find the suspect.The discovery ended a stuttering five-day search for the killer, which analysts say was hampered by apremature assertion by the FBI director, Kash Patel, that the Brown case was solved following the detention of “a person of interest” on Sunday.That person was quickly cleared and released, leading some observers to call for Patel’s resignation, and forcing authorities to deny accusations that the episode had held up the investigation. The authorities then asked the public for their help.Police in Providence said several “strange encounters” between Neves Valente and the tipster called John before the Brown shooting helped investigators to identify the suspect, a development Neronha said “blew this case wide open”.According to authorities, John posted to Reddit that he recognized Neves Valente from a photograph released by the FBI, and urged detectives to look at “a gray Nissan with Florida plates, possibly a rental”. Until then authorities had not linked a vehicle to the shootings.According to the Associated Press, John encountered Neves Valente in the bathroom of Brown’s engineering building hours before the attack, where John noted the suspect’s clothing was “inappropriate and inadequate for the weather”.John also encountered Neves Valente outside, close to the building, where he watched Neves Valente “suddenly” turn from the Nissan, the news agency reported. A “game of cat and mouse” ensued, according to John’s testimony, in which the two would encounter each other and Neves Valente would run away.Brett Smiley, mayor of Providence,said on Friday, in an interview with CNN, that “everybody in Providence owes this individual a debt of gratitude”.“There was a Reddit tip that had to do with the vehicle that turned out to be a central part of this investigation,” Smiley said.Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, announced on Thursday that the Trump administration was suspending the green card lottery program that allowed Neves Valente, who entered the US in 2000 on a student visa, to become a permanent resident 16 years later.The Associated Press contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsBrown University shootingUS crimeRhode IslandMassachusettsnewsShareReuse this content"

Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged in Australia with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder.“We are now in the process of investigating the movements that these two suspects made while here in the Philippines,” police regional director Leon Victor Rosete told the Guardian.Islamic extremism in the Philippines: is it a terrorism hotspot, and which groups are active there?Read moreThe pair’s movements outside the GV hotel, where they holed up throughout their time in the country, have become the centre of the investigation.Rosete said police were also investigating the mobile numbers they used during their stay, and the pair’s contacts.“We are also determining their activities, their support networks. We are investigating and gathering intelligence information,” Rosete said.“The father has shown interest in firearms. He entered a firearms shop,” Rosete said, adding that the store was located in the city.He also referred to CCTV footage of the two in a “jog walk” that lasted about an hour around the vicinity of the hotel. Rosete said this appeared to be “physical conditioning” exercises.“We are patching together all the information. We are now connecting the dots,” Rosete said.Authorities are rushing to obtain CCTV footage from establishments before they delete their records. Staff at GV hotel said they override their CCTV footage after a week.The Philippines will “ensure that there is no stone left unturned,” the national security adviser, Eduardo Año, said.“We want to help the Australian government and at the same ensure that any possible terrorist threat in our country is eliminated.”One hotel worker, Jenelyn Sayson, told the Guardian the Akrams initially booked a seven-night stay online but requested extensions on arrival and continued to extend their stay until checking out on 28 November, according to Sayson, a front desk staff member who served them during their stay. The two arrived carrying one big piece of luggage and a backpack, she said.One line of investigation for officials is why the pair repeatedly extended their stay and whether they may have been waiting for something or someone to arrive.“They might have waited for someone who never came but I don’t want to speculate,” a security official leading the investigation said.“There are lots of speculations but we have to be evidence based,” said Año, who is in touch with Australian authorities in Canberra.“One thing is sure: that they just stayed in Davao for the duration of their visit. Likewise, they did not visit any firing range in Davao.”Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackPhilippinesnewsShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson, Geneviève Grégoir, said price increases were influenced by factors include disruptions in the global supply chain, volatility in commodity prices, changes in international trade conditions – and retail crime.According to the Retail Council ofCanada, retail crime is on the rise and accounted for more than $9bn in lost sales in 2024.“It should be noted that as a retailer, we are the final stop in the supply chain,” Grégoire said. “The prices on store shelves directly reflect the costs of the supply chain.” Grégoire also noted that Metro in 2025 donated $1.15m and provided more than $81m in food products to food banks.Three companies control the vast majority of Canada’s grocery stores and have enjoyed record earnings in recent years. Despite governmentconcern over profiteering, while the profits are near-record levels, the companies say their profit margins are shrinking.Police told reporters they were investigating the theft, but no arrests had been made.The Robins deposited some groceries in a public square at the foot of a Christmas tree on Tuesday evening, adding that the rest would be distributed through community food banks.“Don’t forget – the hunger justifies the means,” the group wrote. “Merry Christmas!”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Several people were also injured.The suspected assailant is among the dead after he fell from a building during a police chase through a busy shopping district on Friday evening.One of the victims was killed as they tried to stop the attack inside Taipei’s Main station, according to the city’s mayor, Chiang Wan-an.The suspected attacker has been described as a 27-year-old man from Taoyuan, a northern county in Taiwan. He was reportedly an air force volunteer soldier who had served near Taipei’s Songshan airport in a radio communication team but was discharged in 2022.Taiwan’s premier, Cho Jung-tai, told reporters that the suspected attacker had a prior criminal record and outstanding warrants. Local media reported he was wanted by the local prosecutor’s office for obstructing military service in 2024 due to his failure to report on duty.Cho described the incident as a “deliberate attack”, although by late Friday night the motive remained unknown.Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, said in a statement there would be heightened security across the country and that there would be “no leniency”.The attack started at Taipei Main station on Friday afternoon. The attacker allegedly threw smoke grenades inside the station at the peak of rush hour, before making his way to nearby Zhongshan.One video filmed by a bystander showed the young man in the middle of the main road outside Zhongshan subway station, a popular late-night and shopping district. He was wearing a black T-shirt and shorts, sneakers, a mask and some protective equipment.He appeared to have other weapons including at least one other knife strapped to his chest.The video shows him pulling smoke grenades from a bag on the ground and casually throwing them towards crowds gathered on the sidewalk, keeping their distance. He is then seen running across the road and into a shopping mall, randomly slashing at people with a long knife as he runs.Another clip shows him inside what appears to be Taipei Main station, pulling smoke grenades from a wheeled suitcase and calmly throwing them. Other clips show one of the underground stations filled with smoke, and people being evacuated out of buildings.“The scene was terrifying and smelled awful,” said one resident, who posted videos to social media.Two men who were working in a nearby fast food chain told local media they had heard screaming from outside and could smell the smoke. One said people had started running into the restaurant asking if they could hide inside, adding that they all took shelter behind the cashier.Violent crime is relatively rare in Taiwan, but in the past couple of years a number of stabbing attacks on the metro have raised fears. Some trains now carry instructional videos on how people can disarm attackers with umbrellas and fire extinguishers.In 2014, a college student killed four people and injured more than 20 in a stabbing spree on the Taipei metro. The student was executed for the killings in 2016. Last year, on the 10-year anniversary of the 2014 incident, three people were injured in a mass stabbing incident in Taichung, Taiwan’s second-largest city.Photos published by local media revealed a burned-out bag full of what appeared to be unused molotov cocktails. The smoke grenades pictured are replica US military equipment and advertised for sale online in Taiwan, but did not appear to be available on the website when the Guardian checked after the attack. An affiliated store on a separate shopping platform was taken down on Friday night.One prominent seller of the equipment told the Guardian they had checked their sales records after the incident and were not aware of any high volume or unusual sales that suggested the attacker had bought the grenades from them. They said the items were “intended for lawful uses such as outdoor activities, training or signalling, and not for violent purposes”.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsTaiwanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The company is searching for a permanent replacement.On Friday the company said it would be “applying malus and clawback to recover overpaid bonuses” from Cowling, and its former finance director Robert Moorhead, after the restatement of profits in its 2023 and 2024 financial year.Together, Cowling and Moorhead – who left last year – received just over £7m in bonuses and long-term share awards for those years. Cowling took home £4m in bonuses and long-term share incentives over the period, while Moorhead received just under £3m.It is unclear how much of those bonuses the company will attempt to recover, but it is understood to probably be less than half.WH Smith said the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority had launched a formal investigation into the company’s compliance with UK listing, disclosure and transparency rules, after itemerged last monthit had begun making inquiries.Andrew Harrison, the retailer’s interim chief executive, said the company had now put in place “a clear remediation plan” to “strengthen governance and controls to protect value and restore trust” supported by new systems.He said the revamp would cover the whole group, not only the US, overhauling policies and processes, culture, training and oversight.A review by the advisory company Deloitte partly blamed a “target-led culture” for the accounting issues in North America. Harrison said that while WH Smith would “not shy away from targets”, there would be more room for employees to raise concerns.He said the group was also simplifying its North American division, exiting about 40 unprofitable fashion and speciality stores, which it runs under brands such as Misura and Marshall Rousso in holiday resorts. It is also reviewing its InMotion technology retail portfolio, potentially exiting about 25 of those 124 outlets. He said it was possible that some stores could be converted to different formats rather than closing.Harrison said the group would also be reviewing some of its other overseas markets and focusing on franchising in new territories.“It has been a difficult end to the year for the group,” Harrison said. “The board and I are acutely aware that we have much to do to rebuild confidence in WH Smith and deliver stronger returns as we move forward.”The comments came as WH Smith revealed that pre-tax profits for the year to August 2025 were just £16m, after £92m of one-off costs, down from £73m a year before. Sales rose 5% to £1.5bn.Shares in the group fell by more than 5% on Friday morning as it said it expected underlying profits for the year to August 2026 to be £100m-£115m, approximately on a par with this year’s £108m.Harrison said the company would be investing in its UK airport stores, while trading at its railway station outlets had “softened” as these sites were “more exposed to general consumer sentiment”, which has been weak.The newspaper, books and stationery chain cut financial forecasts in August and launched an independent review led by Deloitte after it discovered the accounting blunder.The revelation came only a few months after the groupsold its high street business, which has since beenrebranded as TGJonesby its new owners. WH Smith had identified North America as a growth opportunity in its new focus on its branches in airports and railway stations.The Deloitte review found profits at the division had been overstated by as much as £50m.The FCA confirmed on Friday it had opened an investigation into WH Smith.Explore more on these topicsWH SmithExecutive pay and bonusesFinancial Conduct AuthorityRetail industryRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

It ensures that our current shareholders, partners, and the thousands of people who work for Yodel can continue to focus on delivering for our customers without the distraction of these meritless and dishonest claims.“Following these findings of forgery, Yodel is considering further legal action. We will continue to pursue our existing claims for breach of duty and misappropriation of funds against those involved to ensure the company and its creditors are fully protected.”The Guardian has approached Shift, where Corlett is the chief executive and founder, for comment.Explore more on these topicsCouriers/delivery industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Nonetheless, it does have a name: the Com.Short for community, the Com is a loose affiliation of cybercriminals, largely native English language speakers typically aged from 16 to 25. Its activities run from crippling the IT systems of British retailers tophoning in bomb threats to schoolsand encouraging teenage girls to harm themselves.Thelatest victims of the Comare premium users of PornHub, one of the world’s largest pornography sites, who have had their search history and viewing habits hacked by a group called ShinyHunters. The gang has emerged from the Com’s sprawling networks, whose constituents also include Scattered Spider, a collective that has been linked withhacks against the British retailers M&S, the Co-op and Harrods.The Com is thought to comprise thousands of people but there is no formal membership and no tightly delineated groups.“The Com ranges from 11-year-olds trying to hack Minecraft to people in their mid-20s targeting vulnerable kids online,” says Aiden Sinnott, principle threat researcher at the cybersecurity firm Sophos.Sinnott describes the Com as operating like a pipeline where older members groom younger recruits into carrying out increasingly sophisticated, and damaging, acts of cybercrime.“Older members of the Com contact kids and try to get them to commit increasingly sophisticated acts of criminality, moving through to what we are seeing Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters do,” he says.Members of the Com communicate on platforms such as Discord and Telegram, sometimes exchanging extreme imagery or boasting about hacks. One such channel on Telegram, its name an amalgam of the ShinyHunters, Lapsus$ and Scattered Spider groups, carried a post this month stating: “We are the supply and demand for the Com.”The Com is well known to law enforcement on both sides of the Atlantic. In July the FBIissued a public warningabout the Com, describing it as a “primarily English speaking, international, online ecosystem comprised of multiple interconnected networks whose members, many of whom are minors, engage in a variety of criminal violations”.The UK’s NationalCrimeAgency has said reports of Com networks have increased six-fold in the UK from 2022-2024. The NCA describes Com members as “usually young men who are motivated by status, power, control, misogyny, sexual gratification, or an obsession with extreme or violent material”.The Com is split into three subsets. The first is Hacker Com, which comprises groups such as ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider and Lapsus$. Scattered Spider activities include crippling company IT systems and extracting private data, then demanding cryptocurrency for its return as part of a process known as aransomware attack. ShinyHunters and Lapsus$ have more commonly stolen data without the ransomware element. Other activities include hacking social media accounts and using them as fronts for crypto scams.Noah Urban, a 20-year-old Florida-based member of the Scattered Spider group, was sentenced to 10 years in jail this year for his part in a cybercrime spree that included cryptocurrency theft.The second subset is IRL, or In Real Life Com, linked to groups such as Bricksquad or ACG. Its activities includecalling out armed law enforcement on US university campusesunder false pretences, in a process known as “swatting”, subjecting schools to bomb threats, or offering violence-as-a-service where contracts to carry out violent acts – often against other Com members – are posted online, with afinancial breakdownfor each act of violence.The last grouping is Extortion Com, which targets vulnerable children and includes a notorious group known as 764. According to the FBI, the victims are typically aged between 10 and 17. They are coerced or extorted into sharing or live-streaming acts of self-harm, sexually explicit behaviour or even committing suicide. The footage is then circulated among network members, so the victims can continue to be extorted or controlled.Manipulating teenagers into carrying out sexual acts and then blackmailing them for money isknown as sextortionand the Com is known to carry this out. But there is also an element of cruel manipulation for the sake of it. The NCAdescribes Com networksthat “manipulate their victims, who are often children, into harming or abusing themselves, their siblings, or pets”.According to Sophos, there are more than 250 active FBI investigations into this branch of the Com alone, with some of its members motivated by a desire to cause “fear and chaos”, according to US law enforcement.In the UK this year, Cameron Finnigan, 19, from Horsham, West Sussex, was given a nine-year prison sentence for possessing a terrorist document and encouraging someone online to take her own life. Counter-terror police said he hadbecome involved with 764, which is described as a “Satanic extremist group” with an “extreme rightwing” ideology.“It’s not three set pillars,” says Sinnott. “There is some movement between the groups.”The Com is a fluid grouping and a growing threat.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeInternetCrimeHackinganalysisShareReuse this content"

Recordings of it have leaked online – but many questions still remainFri 19 Dec 2025 10.15 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 10.16 ESTShareIs anything real any more? For the last few weeks there have been rumours that Marvel is about to drop the first official footage for its forthcoming superhero epic Avengers: Doomsday, ahead of screenings ofAvatar: Fire and Ash. And it makes a sort of sense: the latest instalment of James Cameron’s 3D mega-project about blue aliens and colonial shame is clearly a visual spectacle, so why not lure fans of Captain America and Thor into cinemas by dangling the promise of a Doomsday trailer in front of them? In a world in which everyone expects everything to be online instantly, could the most radical experiment be to put this thing in cinemas?If it once seemed like a good idea, it increasingly looks less so. There are rumoured to be multiple Doomsday trailers in circulation, to be ushered in ahead of select screenings of Fire and Ash. But several appear to have leaked online already, which means most Avengers superfans are now getting their first glimpse of the new movie through a prism of phone footage and compression artefacts. Audiences at early showings of Cameron’s film, meanwhile, havereported not seeing any Avengers trailer, though some insist they definitely saw something, briefly.The trailer trailed … casting announced in March this yearThe first leaked trailer appears, according to multiple eyewitness accounts and fragments of poor-quality footage, to show Steve Rogers once again positioned as a central heroic presence, framed with unmistakably sentimental weight. On-screen text reportedly confirms that the character will return in Doomsday. Whether this is meant to be a tease, a misdirect or a deliberate provocation is unclear, but the implication alone has been enough to send fandom into overdrive.This immediately creates a small mountain of problems.Marvelhas already introduced a new Captain America in the form of Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson, and has spent several years – including an entire Disney+ series and this year’s Captain America: Brave New World – establishing him as the future of the role. Chris Evans’ Rogers, meanwhile, was given a very public, very deliberate farewell in Endgame, as an old man who had slipped back through time to live out his remaining years with Hayley Atwell’s Peggy Carter. Are we really meant to believe that he is now returning, inexplicably youthful and combat-ready, to beat up Robert Downey Jr’s Doctor Doom? And how much narrative sleight of hand is Marvel prepared to deploy before the idea of consequence finally collapses under its own weight?There are, of course, ways the studio can explain all this weirdness without openly setting fire to Endgame. Perhaps Doomsday will introduce us to a variant Steve Rogers, one who was jettisoned from the main timeline before he even considered giving it all up for the love of a good woman. Maybe this is a Steve who has been dragged back into service by multiversal collapse. Or possibly this is simply what happens when a franchise wobbles at the box office and decides it needs Evans back. Another leaked trailer appears to focus on Chris Hemsworth’s Thor, suggesting that Doomsday really will see the old Avengers gang getting back together, even if Downey Jr is now in a very different suit.For Marvel fans, it is hard to understand what’s going on. You can go and see Avatar and you might just catch an Avengers: Doomsday mini-trailer. But also, you might not. The best you can get online at the moment is a shaky phone clip that looks as if it was filmed from inside a pocket (or a completely legit bututterly pointless countdown video, telling you it’s going to be nearly a year before the film actually turns up in cinemas).Is this what building hype and anticipation looks like in 2025? If so, Marvel has finally perfected a marketing strategy that feels appropriate to the age: a blockbuster launched as rumour, sustained by nostalgia, delivered via confusion, and headlined by two men who have already had their endings, now summoned back anyway.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSuperhero moviesMarvelcommentShareReuse this content"

For major ballet companies it’s usually their biggest spectacle of the year, with huge casts, lavish sets, all stops pulled out. So how do you make a Nutcracker for a small company such asNew English Ballet Theatre, with a dozen dancers? NEBT are an admirable outfit. Director Karen Pilkington-Miksa consistently commissions new choreography, in this case from Royal Ballet first soloist Valentino Zucchetti, whose work has been seen on the Royal Opera House stage and elsewhere.View image in fullscreenLots to enjoy … Rebecca Arias, top, and Zhaklin Gudeva in The Nutcracker by New English Ballet Theatre.Photograph: Andrej UspenskiNow, this isn’t the Royal Opera House. In an intimate venue such as this, you don’t get the instant magic and suspension of disbelief a grand stage brings, just real people dancing in front of you. And a ballet like the Nutcracker needs magic because it’s a confection, and the dance’s main job is to decorate its fantastic Tchaikovsky score (here in a recorded version).Zucchetti’s setting is contemporary: a Christmas party at Clara’s luxe home. The backdrop shows floor-to-ceiling windows, the kids at the party do the running man in between theirpetit allegro. There is a nice central conceit, that the Drosselmeyer character is a hypnotist, swinging his pocket watch, mesmerising guests into dancing, or Clara into dreaming up a battle between soldiers and pirates (instead of mice) and off into the land of snow. This all needs a bit more personality to really pop: more energy in the characters, more gusto in the fight scene. It needs to be less polite.With a small cast, Zucchetti has to be inventive. And he is, creating a balance between flow and tableau, setting his 10 snowflakes into ever-changing formations, giving sweeping shape to Clara’s choreography in her pas de deux (with Nutcracker Luca De-Poli). Clara is guest dancer Liudmila Konovalova, longtime principal at Vienna StateBallet. Her years of experience are evident, everything is danced with finesse, she never drops a stitch.The young, hard-working cast dance well (Marcos Silva has spirit and technical vigour; Audrey Nelson is a bright, sparkling Flower Queen). They’re very likable and there’s lots to enjoy. You have to take this production for what it is – a boutique company like this can’t compete with the big guns. They could inject more vitality into the first act, but what they do, they do well. Somewhere in the middle of a multiple pirouette I started to feel very Christmassy.AtSainsbury theatre, London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsDanceBalletChristmas showsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

But his music is quite different: a slippery layer cake of samples, multitudinous keys and lo-fi pop production, with Brown singing of a world where “the ebb and flow isn’t ebbing right”, be it in love or civic life. There is still room for an instant-classic R&B ballad though, in Tossed Away.Ben Beaumont-Thomas49Rochelle Jordan – Through the WallEverything isjust soon the British Canadian producer’s sixth album: expensively plush deep house suggesting club lights low, gleaming mirrors, potent looks igniting across the dancefloor. As much as the cold beat and ballroom flow of Ladida or the slapping “body, body, body” incantations of On 2 Something suggest a steadfast commitment to abandon, Jordan maintains impeccable poise and control throughout, whether in diva mode on Words 2 Say, breaking hearts on Bite the Bait, standing up for her needs on Doing It Too (“I’m not too much / You just give too little”) or patiently waiting for a frustrated lover to see the light on Ladida. Commanding, wise and committed to atmospheric excellence, party hosts don’t come better.Laura Snapes48Jerskin Fendrix– Once Upon a Time … in ShropshireView image in fullscreenHarebrained prog cabaret … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttJerskin Fendrix’s high-profile scores for the last three Yorgos Lanthimos films can’t really help prime you for the Midlands composer’s eccentrically beautiful second album, which pairs pristine musical theatre with the harebrained prog cabaret of Faith No More and (particularly) the under-sung Morphine. At first, Once Upon a Time … casts the rural bliss of growing up in 00s Shropshire in a golden light, a haven of getting ratted on Baileys and listening to Kanye on a farm, then having a lovely hungover group breakfast in someone’s kitchen. But the unexpected deaths he has experienced in recent years intrude to spoil paradise, eliciting feverish, absurdist expressions of grief – Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle is a bravura wig-out – and fathomless devastation from his camp, craggy voice. It demands a full theatrical production.LS47Clipping– Dead Channel SkyClipping frontman Daveed Diggs is best known for being in the original cast of Hamilton, and for all that this album is filled with noisy industrial rap, you can easily imagine it being successfully adapted for the Broadway stage. Dead Channel Sky is set in a cyberpunk dystopia not dissimilar to the scorched-sun “real world” of the Matrix, humming with janky tech and populated with fascists and freaky hedonists. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes render it in acid squiggles and revving breakbeats, while Diggs delivers his mutoid poetry like a prophet jacked up on some amphetamine he’s synthesised in a backstreet lab.BBTTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more46The Tubs – Cotton CrownIn different hands,the Tubs’ second album might be a crushing listen, and understandably so. In 2014, frontman Owen Williams’ mother, the songwriter and author Charlotte Greig,died by suicide. Grief, as these songs detail, made him a rubbish boyfriend. But Cotton Crown is often funny and ardent, and especially self-aware about how new love might feel like a life raft to a depressed mind ill-equipped to reciprocate: “Know it’s all in my brain / Caught in the middle of loving you and being insane,” Williams sings on Fair Enough. His striking voice, somewhere between Richard Thompson and Bob Mould, bolts through the band’s joyful jangle-pop. Clear students of the form, they’re virtuosos with zero patience for perfection, their riffs hurtling and plundering like seagulls going at a spilled catch as they vigorously rough you up with profundity.LS45Smerz – Big City LifeView image in fullscreenAn album of stilted beauty … Smerz.Photograph: Alva Le FebvreCatharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt feel like the pop girlies of the incredibly prolific and off-kilterCopenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory scene, making music that’s more outward-facing and arch than some of their insular and traditional (and equally great) classmates. Their second album lurches between throwing yourself at life – “you’re a girl in the city and you shouldn’t think twice”, they chant in deadpan harmony on Roll the Dice – and actually thinking twice quite a lot in existential spirals about purpose and desire. The dissonance between confidence and anxiety comes through in the album’s stilted beauty: one minute, their whorls of prepared piano carry you along like clouds amid perfectly turned pop-R&B and balladry; then they stab and stutter, like cracks in the pavement destined to trap your heels. In 2023, K-pop’s brightest hopes NewJeans hired them as co-writers: more pop bearing their imprint can only be a good thing.LS44Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendReleased almost exactly a year after her superstar-minting breakthrough Short n’ Sweet, and using a palette of soft rock, 80s pop, light disco and yearning country melodies, Carpenter added rich colour to one of pop’s most distinctive self-portraits. Her blatant sexuality is offset by an ironising sense of camp and a deep streak of cynicism, as she wonders whether to wrap her little finger round a series of hot but useless men. But whether dialling her exes while hopped up on “go-go juice” or being toxic for the sport of it (“you think that I’m gonna fuck with your head / well, you’re absolutely right”), Carpenter knows she’s part of the problem. Her fake helplessness at her own worst impulses is just one part of a formidable screwball comedy arsenal – she’s a Rosalind Russell for the dating app era.BBT43Jennifer Walton – DaughtersView image in fullscreenBolt from the blue … Jennifer Walton.Photograph: Liam CosfordThis Sunderland producer’s previous work included one EP of power electronics, one of antic club tracks, collabs with Aya and 96 Back as Microplastics, gigging with Kero Kero Bonito and a smattering of other credits. So her staggering, fully formed songwriterly debut was a total bolt from the blue. A swarming orchestral epic with shades of Julia Holter and Phil Elverum, it addressed her grief for her late father in serenely surrealist images – hitting a deer with a car in the middle of the night – and the painfully mundane realism of sitting in hospital corridors together. The standout Miss America combined both to stunning effect, a numbed incantation of everything Walton had seen on the US trip where she learned of her father’s diagnosis, the familiar now remade horribly mythic.LS42Erika de Casier– LifetimeErika de Casier’s fourth album updates the Y2K R&B template that fought for body-to-body sensuality in the face of rising digital creep. The old-school dial tones that pierce Lifetime’s rapt, liquid atmosphere work both as Janet homage and ironic sigh at how good those forebears had it when emotional warfare could only be conducted via pager: “Took a screenshot so / I could look at your pretty face all the time now / Without a sign that I’m online,” de Casier sings on earworm Delusional, a low-slung anthem for contemporary dating anxiety. “Hit midnight / Not even a text to hold me warm,” she rues on The Chase. That’s one of the most inviting things about Lifetime: its seductively cool surfaces conceal de Casier frantically kicking her feet below the surface, just like the rest of us.LS41Danny Brown – StardustThe Detroit rapper’s first post-rehab record totally disprovedhis fearsthat sobriety makes artists boring. On Stardust, Brown is still hard-wired with cartoonish verve, coupled with a genuinely touching sense of gratitude: “Sleeping real good at night ’cos I’m proud of myself,” he raps on Book of Daniel. While you probably wouldn’t describe someone who ponders “going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” as a wise elder, his hunger for life, opportunity and unmediated sensation blares through in how evidently gagged he is to centre younger producers from the digicore and hyperpop undergrounds: his unruly kids 8485, Jane Remover, Underscores, Frost Children and more make Stardust trip with glitch, rave, squealing riffs and overdriven noise. The rare record that makes you want to riot and shed a smiling single tear emoji.LS40-3140YHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsView image in fullscreenChews you up … YHWH Nailgun.Photograph: Steve GullickIn 21 minutes, the New York band’s debut chews you up and spits you out the other side in a tentacular whirr of rototoms, guitars that shriek and whine like neglected machinery, erratic tempos and frontman Zack Borzone’s choked-out vocals. The way the record lurches and reels brings to mind the classic horror film scene in which a human undergoes a violent, magnificent transformation into some sort of beast: much like Gilla Band’s Most Normal, 45 Pounds is a font of mutant rock pleasures.LS39Sudan Archives – The BPMThe title refers to the beats per minute of dance music, but for an album that is so totally alive, it surely also refers to a pounding heart. Sudan Archives (AKA Angeleno producer-singer-songwriter-violinist Brittney Parks) announces that “life’s a game and I got VR goggles” as she revels in the epicurean joys of sex, dancing, travel and music itself with an almost superhuman appetite: “The rest are cowards / They choose to eat and we devour.” It’s all done with breezy good humour but there’s something inspiring, even quietly political about this mindful rejection of the straight life. Her backings – full of pop-R&B and ethereal electro – also dart away from obvious mainstream paths.BBT38Ethel Cain – Willoughby Tucker, I’ll Always Love YouView image in fullscreenRomantic slowcore … Ethel Cain.Photograph: Dollie KyarnIt’s easy to see why US singer-songwriter Cain has become so adored. This album further sketches out the kind of storytelling universe that attracts footnote-writing fandoms: it’s a prequel to the events of her debut album Preacher’s Daughter, deepening the tale of Ethel and a cast of young peers as they fumble towards connection and understanding. Her moody, romantic slowcore is also perfect music for listening to on headphones as you walk around boring suburban streets wishing you could leave for bigger things. It’s also great for road trips: songs between five and 15 minutes that seem to make a long, slow blur of the pell-mell world outside.BBT37Olivia Dean – The Art of LovingThe British breakthrough of the year, as Dean – already doing decent business with her pleasant but rather neat debut Messy – reached a completely new level of songcraft. Bossa nova, folk and soul (classic and neo) are warmed together with beautiful production, evaporating any sense of pastiche to make a sound that’s both easy on the ear but distinctly Dean’s. Every song has a superb top line, Dean stretching them into loose jazzy shapes (Let Alone the One You Love, Lady Lady) or tightening them into brisk pop (Man I Need, Something Inbetween). But it’s the lyrics that make these songs so red-blooded: every stage of love, from the first flutter of flirtation to the adrenal shock of rejection, is made so true to life.BBT36Anna von Hausswolff – IconoclastsView image in fullscreenSense of awe … Anna von Hausswolff.Photograph: Philip SvenssonAnna von Hausswolff is no stranger to a monumental statement: her primary instrument is the pipe organ,a towering edifice of tin and arsenicthat offers her an ever-renewing sense of awe. But the Swedish composer’s sixth album goes bigger than ever, grappling with mortality, transcendence and evil in a series of stormy epics that also lash a little pop structure to her prow. “Oh, I’m breaking up with language / Oh, in search of something bigger than this,” she screams on Stardust, an exhilarating co-pilot on the path to absolution.LS35Bon Iver – Sable, FableIf, as Justin Vernon recently suggested, this is the last ever Bon Iver album, it’s a beautiful redemption arc: a loving send-up of his anxious, myopic sad-sack self blossoms into a radiant appreciation of possibility, sensuality, risk. Everything Is Peaceful Love has one of the year’s best refrains: “Damn if I’m not climbing up a tree right now!”, giddy with thrill and absolutely no idea of what to do when you get up there other than enjoy the view. And while there are gorgeously passionate songs here, it’s the ones about gracefully letting go of an unviable love that really underscore the admirable humility in Vernon’s bowing out.LS34Snocaps – SnocapsKatie Crutchfield’s full-throated transformation into country doyenne on her last couple of albums as Waxahatchee almost makes it easy to forget her indie-rock origins. Fourteen years since she and twin sister Allison wound down their teen band PS Eliot, the DIY stalwarts got back together – with a little help from MJ Lenderman and producer Brad Cook – and went back to brass tacks for their surprise album as Snocaps. What a treat it was: full of punchy indignation – “I could never just …coast!” they exclaim on Coast – crunchy ruminations and sing-songy contemplations of what it means to depend on and grow alongside one another. You’d follow them anywhere.LS33Amaarae – Black StarView image in fullscreenIrrepressible … Amaarae.Photograph: Salomé Gomis-TreziseWe all need an Amaarae in our lives: the person who, when you weakly protest that you’re a bit tired to go out, will soon have you holding a bottle of decanted rum in the back of an Uber, while alongside you she looks quizzically at a series of resealable plastic bags. “Ketamine, coke and molly,” she chants on Starkilla; “I spiked this drink so please open your mouth,” she tells her lover on Fineshyt. And this club-ready album from the irrepressible Ghanaian-American pop star ends up being a sensual body high, as she chases sex and glamour into the ends of the night.BBT32Perfume Genius – GloryWith typical grace and humour Mike Hadreas sends up his self-defeating tendencies on his seventh album, and wonders how old you have to be to escape those lifelong patterns: like the contradiction of struggling to face the world while also fantasising about violence and romanticising “all the poems I’ll get out” of it. It feels apt that Glory starts with the western twang of It’s a Mirror, suggesting a fixed, brawny masculine archetype – then breaks it down over the course of the record, a gothic, celestial voyage into the interior, and the latest addition to a uniquely beautiful American songbook.LS31Horsegirl – Phonetics On and OnView image in fullscreenFinely tuned … Horsegirl.Photograph: Ruby FayeSpindly rock à la the Velvets and the Raincoats is as spartan in its constituent parts as it is high on reward, and Chicago trio Horsegirl demonstrated the inexhaustible pleasures of this 60-year-old form on their second album. With production from Cate Le Bon, they wove magic from just a few thrumming guitar and bass notes and Nora Cheng’s nonchalant, near-spoken vocals, as well as a knack for melodic hooks as finely turned as intricate woodwork: the bittersweet, skipping chorus of Information Content is an all-timer.LS30-2130Oklou – Choke EnoughTrance, medieval polyphony and Y2K pop may seem like odd bedfellows, but French singer-producer Oklou cast them all in a dawn-like haze on her gorgeous debut album, flowing these distinct disciplines together until they swooped and soared like a flock of starlings. Choke Enough was no academic exercise, either, with standout pop moments including Take Me By the Hand with Bladee – a winsome conjuring of how Alice Deejay might sound in collaboration with a piping minstrel.LS29Jacob Alon – In LimerenceView image in fullscreenRustling with life … Jacob Alon performing at the ZYN Rolling Stone UK Awards, in London’s Roundhouse.Photograph: Sue Moore/Hogan Media/ShutterstockOne of the star-making moments of the year was at the Mercury prize, as Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon reduced the arena audience to a hush with just a voice and an acoustic guitar (though there were delighted whoops when a call of “free Palestine” was folded into their rendition of Fairy in a Bottle). It hopefully brought a broader audience to their debut album In Limerence, which has shades of Adrianne Lenker, Jeff Buckley and even Paul McCartney’s cadences to its unguarded indie-folk. It would have been easy to make this music blandly beautiful, but Alon and producer Dan Carey keep it rustling with life, as they reach for a burbling synth, trumpet improvisation or dusty-sounding drum kit.BBT28KeiyaA – Hooke’s LawThe title of the Chicago producer’s second album references the law of physics that reflects how stretch is proportional to load, how a spring always bounces back when tested within its elastic limit. The whistlestop Hooke’s Law expands and contracts accordingly as KeiyaA’s trifles with loss and romantic disappointment find their embodiment in racing breakbeats and collagist chaos one minute, gorgeous, soul-weary stillness – as with the liquid Stupid Prizes – the next. Listening can feel like being pleasurably blitzed with sensation, with each repeat revealing new details: an invitation to submit to KeiyaA’s masterful grip.LS27Wet Leg – MoisturizerIn 2022 they released one of the 21st century’s biggest indie debuts, which scored a UK No 1 and Grammy and Brit awards. The pressure was there for the follow-up, but not only did it top the charts again and earn another couple of Grammy noms, it had even more swagger and heart. “You wanna fuck me, I know, most people do,” Rhian Teasdale shrugs on Mangetout, and she actively intimidates a lustful bloke on Catch These Fists – but much of the album is given over to her wonderment at falling in love. “I’ll be your Davina, I’m coming to get you … I’ll be your Shakira, whenever, wherever”, she sings: great new vows for millennial weddings.BBT26Wolf Alice – The ClearingView image in fullscreenSomething symphonic … Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice performing at Manchester Arena.Photograph: Andy Von Pip/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“English bands are so hesitant to ever admit ambition, but I am ambitious with this record,” Wolf Alice’s drummerJoel Amey saidas The Clearing was announced – and sure enough, this was a huge step up and out for a band who were already one of British indie’s biggest. There’s something symphonic about the heft of it and not just because of the string sections, thanks to superb production by Greg Kurstin: the bass and toms are heavy yet warm, the piano pounding yet not overbearing. Ellie Rowsell sings about suitably big themes, too, from universe-bending love on Leaning Against the Wall (“it really, really made the room sing, the way you said my name”), invaluable friendship on Just Two Girls, and The Sofa’s uplifting manifesto for being wild and indolent instead of toeing the line.BBT25Wednesday – BleedsThe North Carolina band’s sixth album is littered with endings, some violent – the title of Carolina Murder Suicide tells you all you need to know – some devastatingly mundane, as Karly Hartzman examined the cracks that led to a long relationship’s end. Her unique gaze unites both, noticing the details and dynamics that other songwriters might write off as inconsequential: like the “mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail” at a wake in Wound Up Here (By Holdin On). Full of screaming noise and riffs that evoke knee-sliding through the mud, as well as moments of unexpected sweetness, Bleeds shows the fullest picture of her band yet.LS24Titanic – HagenView image in fullscreenUncontainable euphoria … Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta of Titanic.Photograph: Janet ChauThere can be few faster-evolving ensembles than that of Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta, who in just two albums have leapt from sparkling cabaret jazz to … whatever the uncontainable euphoria of Hagen is. It’s a record that vaults from blast beats to choral beauty, eerie splendour to nervy cacophonies, like nothing else you’ve heard. Despite these bold stylistic clashes, it hangs together beautifully, thanks also to Fratti’s spectacular voice, as capable of cirrus-like delicacy as parched sharpness.LS23Cate Le Bon – Michelangelo DyingWhere two of this year’s most prominent breakup albums were savage (Lily Allen) or spectacular (Rosalía), Welsh innovator Cate Le Bon’s hypnotically murky seventh album reflected the circular sadness of love faltering – the catch-22 of wanting to escape heartbreak while knowing that letting go means relinquishing something that was once profound. Michelangelo Dying contains some of her very best choruses and melodies, powerful enough to penetrate the album’s billowing haze of guitar, sax and synths, like a hand reaching out in the dark.LS22Little Simz – LotusView image in fullscreenWider reckoning … Little Simz performing at the Co-op Live arena in Manchester.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianSimz’s sixth album came amid a dispute with the Sault producer Inflo – she has sued him for allegedly failing to repay a loan – and a couple of tracks target him in all but name (“You talk about God when you have a God complex / I think you’re the one that needs saving”). But Simz seems to be having a wider reckoning: she revels in how far she’s come from once just having “a dream and a pushbike”, and reflects on self-preservation, creative frustration and – in a gorgeous, naturalistic back-and-forth with Wretch 32 – push-pull family dynamics.BBT21John Glacier – Like a RibbonFor all that you can link her to trip-hop and cloud rap, what British MC has ever really sounded like this? It would be easy to call Glacier monotone, but in truth her careful, even flow holds so much musicality: her deliberately limited melodic and rhythmic range means that the subtle distinctions in her vocals are fascinating, as she goes from bored to wry to boastful to poignant within one-degree turns on the emotional thermostat. The grainy, faintly corrupted beats are superb, but it’s that delivery, and her lyrics themselves – stoic and even amused as life blows her from place to place – which make this album an all-timer in UK rap.BBT20-1120Aya – Hexed!A series of surreal vignettes confronting addiction, panic and the challenges of growing up queer, Aya Sinclair’s experimental electronic masterwork is a wind-whipped dash around the towns and moors of Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. From the rotor blade-whomp of Peach to the infernal pattering snares on Navel Gazer, her sound design hits you like a ton of feathers: a surreal, destabilising flurry of detail. And the lyrics, done as careful mutters or sarky sing-song, are world-class. Her poetry revels in multiple meanings – is she saying “Flemish” or “phlegmish”? – and in the plasticity of language, rhyme and even lived experience, whether retelling a toxic relationship (“Couple rows so we could pop our cysts / as though the pus’d bust right out of the tryst”) or evoking the feeling of being totally cut adrift: “Abseil away another day supine inside the bag.”BBT19Clipse – Let God Sort Em OutView image in fullscreenRich with wisdom … Malice and Pusha T of Clipse.Photograph: Cian MooreThey may have been outdone by Oasis as 2025’s most anticipated fraternal comeback, but there was still considerable excitement around the return of Gene and Terrence Thornton, AKA Clipse’s Malice and Pusha T. After making two of the best albums in 00s rap, Malice found God and left Pusha to it. But on returning, Malice’s mic tone – which always had a sort of ancient, oaken majesty to it – felt rich with wisdom, while Pusha, who in the interim had beefed Drake to hugely entertaining effect, still had his nose for a scrap, this time with Travis Scott. Together, they advocated for their own brilliance and for what they see as a better class of rap, sometimes at the same time: “They content-create, I despise that / I create content then they tries that.”BBT18Big Thief – Double InfinityAfter their bassist Max Oleartchik left the group, Big Thief pressed on as a trio but brought in a number of auxiliary musicians, resulting in an album that sounds like it could have been worked up around the campfire of a utopian off-grid commune. These are some of the American band’s best, biggest-hearted songs to date, with the type of easy facility with melody – and equally easy access to their emotions – that can’t be taught. Take Grandmother, in which frontperson Adrianne Lenker surveys our collapsing world and flawed humanity, and decides on the singalong chorus: “Gonna turn it all into rock’n’roll.” In many other hands this would be trite, but as with so much of Big Thief’s music, the purity of intention makes it life-affirming.BBT17Alex G – HeadlightsView image in fullscreenA new frontier … Alex G.Photograph: Chris MaggioWhat constitutes integrity? Working for love or money? Freedom or obligation to others? On his first album for a major label, standing at a new frontier of success, Alex G weighs these existential questions in appropriately vast, beautiful indie-rock epics, some breathless with anxiety (Spinning), others sardonic (Real Thing) or severe (Headlights). Despite the very contemporary, very Alex G touches – take the sprite-like voices and distortion of Bounce Boy – there’s a comforting solidity to this record that makes it feel as though it’s existed for ever, sharing the same spooked twilight as the best of Yo La Tengo and REM.LS16Pulp – MoreThe anticipation of a reunion album rarely measures up to the often dismal results. Perhaps the key is to spend a solid chunk of years playing together again, as Pulp did, before risking putting anything down on record. “I exist to do this / Shouting and pointing,” Jarvis Cocker sang on comeback single Spike Island; anyone who’s seen Pulp in recent years can attest that he has lost none of his calligraphic physical flair. Nor, as the magnificent More proves, has his gimlet eye for the grubby disappointments of middle age diminished. Life apparently feels no less of a charade at 62 than early adulthood did back in the 90s, a fact he sells as both anticlimax and a weird kind of comfort: if that’s the case, the unvarnished love songs and heartfelt stands against commodification suggested, you might as well stick it all on the line.LS15Turnstile – Never EnoughView image in fullscreenUncomplicated thrills … Turnstile in concert in Guadalajara, Mexico.Photograph: Medios y Media/Getty ImagesIs it hardcore punk or not? As this dull debate brewed on comment sections and Discord servers, the rest of the world got on with the business of just enjoying the uncomplicated thrills on Turnstile’s latest. Certainly, Seein’ Stars sounds like 90s Duran Duran, the epic title track could be played as NFL teams run on to the field and even the hardcore-paced Dull and Solo have a sheen to them. But for every frowning punk purist, you had 10 more lining up to pile into the pit with smiles a mile wide.BBT14Deftones – Private MusicThis was the US alt-metallers’ first album back after serendipitously getting a huge new following via TikTok, particularly for their sweeter, shoegazier material. But rather than court that audience by cynically remaking Sextape 11 times over, they instead created a balletic cyborg of a record. The riffs could put a dent in concrete masonry, but the groove-metal rhythms are light-footed and, as ever, vocalist Chino Moreno sets out even wider tonal possibilities. It’s as if waves of pain and relief pass across his spirit as he goes from dry croaks to thunderous denouncements to blissful clean singing.BBT13Suede – AntidepressantsThree decades since their debut and five albums into the second phase of their career, Suede sound as impassioned and vital as they ever have. Brett Anderson’s voice is a long way from the nasal sneer of Animal Nitrate all those years ago: it’s now rounder and deeper in colour, reminiscent of Echo and the Bunnymen’s Ian McCulloch, but the core Suede theme – humanity in all its reckless and sexy brokenness – is still there. Playing post-punk with a Britpop grandeur, Anderson and co reckon with the fleeting nature of existence (“Formless as a cloud / Weightless as a sound”) and the caprices of brain chemistry, but with a sense of optimism, even triumph.BBT12Jim Legxacy – Black British Music (2025)View image in fullscreenMore assured … Jim Legxacy.Photograph: Igoris TarranHis previous mixtape Homeless N*gga Pop Music was at No 42 in our 2023 albums list; rapper-producer Jim Legxacy jumps up the rankings as his place in British rap becomes more and more assured. Beats-wise, he defines the joyous anything-goes energy of the current UK underground, expertly applying chipmunk effects to samples, adding funny DJ-style vocal tags (“turn that mediocre bullshit off, we’re listening to Jim Legxacy right now!”) and even making a left turn into high-tempo pop-rock for ’06 Wayne Rooney. There’s more of a mournful cast to the lyrics though, as he works through grief for his late sister, and confronts the lingering effects of his impoverished, fatherless childhood.BBT11Jade – That’s Showbiz Baby!Pop’s trickiest manoeuvre is crossing the divide from successful group to solo career. After departing Little Mix, Jade Thirlwall didn’t so much jump it as pirouette across: her multi-part debut solo single Angel of My Dreams was completely nuts, impossible to ignore and spent 20 weeks on the UK chart. Could a whole album match up? From trashy ballroom house (It Girl) to disco-funk (Fantasy, Headache), Robyn-esque sad bangers (Plastic Box, Self Saboteur) and waltz-time ballads (Natural at Disaster), she certainly has the range, not to mention smart and sweary lyrics – rhyming Edward Enninful with experimental is a neat encapsulation of what moves her. It’s her voice that really sets it all apart, though: as you’d expect of a talent show graduate turned longtime pop star, it remains stunning on a technical level, but Thirlwall also brings a whole West End musical’s worth of emotion.BBT10-110Billy Woods – Golliwog“The English language is violence, I hot-wired it / I got a hold of the master’s tools and got dialled in,” Billy Woods announces at the outset of a rap masterpiece that works both as stunning poetry on the page and thrilling music out of loudspeakers. With intensely vivid lyrics, he picks his way through psychic wreckage wrought by racism, poverty, war and more, menaced by horrible dreams (“Didn’t want the doctor to turn, I knew it’d be something awful on the ultrasound”) and dispensing jaded wisdom: “Amputation how you survive / Can’t get away if you don’t leave something behind.” And then there’s Misery, a vivid romcom about a polyamorous and possibly vampiric lover. Frantz Fanon, Cecil Rhodes, Miles Davis and “Black Thanos” are among the other figures populating these strange, heat-sick tracks, helmed by a diverse and stellar range of production talent including the Alchemist, DJ Haram and Kenny Segal.BBT9Geese – Getting KilledView image in fullscreenOutrageously accomplished … Geese.Photograph: Lewis EvansThe ways that love unravels us and knits us back together are explored on the outrageously accomplished and wise fourth album from the New York garage rock band, who are still in their early 20s. They originally formed as kids at a Brooklyn music school which partly explains the depth of their connection, but there’s something bigger at work: how to explain the way a tiny chord change can carry so much emotional weight, or how these songs can groove so tightly at the waist while their arms flail this way and that. Cameron Winter’s lyrics and vocals are peerless, too, done in a reedy head voice that’s also somehow soulful. He’s trying to live his life on a higher frequency than the rest of us, but so often he’s having his heart broken, “getting killed by a pretty good life”, or hemmed in by his circumstances: “I was a sailor, and now I’m a boat / I was a car, and now I’m the road,” he glumly pouts on Bow Down.BBT8Bad Bunny – Debí Tirar Más FotosWith the absolute integrity that has become his trademark, Bad Bunny shone his inestimable spotlight back on his roots in Puerto Rico for his sixth album, singing of sacrifice, colonial oppression and the importance of preserving tradition. He’s an incredible conduit, synthesising the past – salsa, bolero, perreo – with the present, bringing local artists including RaiNao and Lorén Aldarondo along for the ride. As if it needed stressing, Debí … also underscored his own legacy, and his incredible range: heartbroken that life must one day end on Baile Inolvidable; lovelorn in the rave on Perfumito Nuevo; seemingly cast in moonlight on the heavy Bokete.LS7Lily Allen – West End GirlLily Allen’s divorce album is so lurid in its apparent disclosures (she has said she employed some poetic licence) that it felt as though there was a risk of the carcass being tossed aside once the tabloids had picked it clean for gossip. But the quality of the songwriting and silvery electronic production, as well as the tangibility of Allen’s hurt and her ability to mint viral bits in “who the fuck is Madeleine” and Nonmonogamummy, gave West End Girl not just staying power but a place in the pantheon of great breakup albums. Standout Pussy Palace turned the grottiest of reveals into a kind of cosmic reverie that seems to suggest the elemental rearrangement of life as she knew it; the guttingly powerful Relapse, about the sober musician’s fear of losing her grip after her relationship breakdown, highlighted the temptation of oblivion in numbed-out vocoder. It lands light as icing sugar but lingers deadly as toothache.LS6PinkPantheress – Fancy ThatView image in fullscreenBreathless … PinkPantheress.Photograph: Charlie EngmanTrue to her form for writing the shortest songs in the biz, in just 20 minutes and 34 seconds, PinkPantheress vaults from weed highs to romantic lows, obsessive crushes to gripping paranoia, seduction to confrontation. (“The status cheque is due / So do I still belong to you?” from Nice to Know You, is a classic bluff call.) The music of Fancy That is just as much of a slip’n’slide through British club culture at its most playful and dazzling, from jungle to UKG and the big-tent joys of Underworld, Basement Jaxx and even the hyper-cheesy Just Jack, samples she deploys expertly, and all threaded together by her pointedly sugary voice. It’s a breathless ride, and PinkPantheress’s best case yet for her micro melodramas: why dither when you can pack this much into so little?LS5Lady Gaga – MayhemUnlike the smooth tech-house flavour of her previous album Chromatica, and quite diametrically opposed to the dinner jazz of her albums with Tony Bennett, on Mayhem, Gaga returned to the operatic electroclash that powered her first two albums. There are synths that sound like a Dyson on its last legs. There are the kind of trashy guitars that contractually can only be played by someone sporting a lime mohawk, low-riding leather trousers and nothing else. There is the baby talk of her biggest hit Bad Romance, only where that was “Ro-ma, ro-ma-ma / Gaga, ooh la la” it’s now “Ama ooh na-na / Abracadabra, mutta ooh Gaga”.Read more.BBT4Addison Rae – AddisonView image in fullscreenDreamy synthpop … Addison RaeOnce derided as a former TikTok dancer who made ill-fated attempts to break beyond the platform, Addison Rae’s fortunes changed last summer when Charli xcx invited her to collaborate on a remix, washing away the sticky juvenilia of her social media fame. Her debut album offered up dreamy synthpop that was weirder and more interesting than expected. Opener New York begins sounding floaty and fizzy, but ends in a pummelling explosion of chaos; High Fashion and Times Like These were an experimental hallucination of trip-hop and R&B. The fact that Arca remixed Aquamarine says it all. The pleasures Rae sang about, however, were far simpler. The gauzy, romantic Summer Forever distils the vibe: how fun it is, to be “young, dumb and cute / Nothing to lose”; the record’s mix of hedonism and nostalgia, its proud anti-lore depthlessness and hunger for sensation feel like extremely 2025 techniques for distraction and survival.Read more.Rebecca Liu3Blood Orange – Essex HoneyDev Hynes’ fifth album as Blood Orange felt uniquely keyed into the fragmented, distracted headspace that comes after someone passes, in his case, his mother. Essex Honey’s restive nature was summed up in its painful opening lines, which you could read as the dying’s acceptance of death starkly contrasting the living’s ability to meet them on those terms: “In your grace, I looked for some meaning,” Hynes sings on Look at You. “But I found none, and I still search for a truth.” That search is wide-reaching: The Field refashions the Durutti Column’s Sing to Me as a racing hymnal made for the stereo of a Ford Escort. There are tough little Robert Rental-style post-punk gems in The Train (Kings Cross) and Countryside that bristle with frustration. Vivid Light is a plainly soulful duet with Zadie Smith; Life, featuring Tirzah’s unmistakable vocals, basks in languid, flute-dappled funk.Read more.LS2CMAT – Euro-CountryDespite its fraught creation, CMAT’s third album sounds like the supremely assured work of a songwriter whose powers have reached a new peak. It is, by turns, poignant, moving, furiously angry, uproariously funny and packed with incredible tunes. It strides confidently away from the country-infused style she minted on her 2022 debut If My Wife New I’d Be Dead – into territory that variously touches on jazz (Janis Joplining), raging alt-rock (The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station), soul-kissed pop (Running/Planning; Take a Sexy Picture of Me) – without in any way losing the essence of what made her successful in the first place.Read more.Alexis Petridis1Rosalía – LuxWith its lyrics in 13 languages and references to dozens of historical female saints, the fact that Lux manages to transcend scholarly chin-stroking and dry Wiki deep dives is near miraculous, and the credit is solely Rosalía’s. While this isn’t her first album to alchemise the past and present – see 2018’s second album El Mal Querer and its heady flamenco-R&B hybrid – the stakes are far higher on Lux, and the balancing act more pronounced. What elevates it, apart from its multi-layered melodies, rich compositions and engrained drama, is the playfulness at its heart. Like Björk during her effortless 90s peak, there’s a sense of wonderment to Rosalía’s voice that sweeps you up into its tornado. Even when she’s tearing your heart in two, as on La Yugular’s blossoming balladry, or the ascension to heaven on the closing Magnolias, you want to be right there with her.Read more.Michael Cragg"

Losing one half of the show’s central duo was no easy thing to move past, but The Last of Us morphed into a touching meditation on grief, loss and the pain of love left unspoken – with added mushroom monsters.What we said:“A gutsy and thoughtful rendering of humans on the edge.”Read more49All Her FaultView image in fullscreenNo one is more watchable … Sarah Snook and Dakota Fanning in All Her Fault.Photograph: Peacock/AP(Sky Atlantic/Now) Is anyone as watchable as Sarah Snook? Her performance as Marissa, whose son Milo was kidnapped when she thought he was on a play date, was an absolute powerhouse as we’ve come to expect from the Succession star. It started with the most profound fear a parent can face, before it turned out to be even worse: orchestrated from within her own inner circle. But the plight of Dakota Fanning as her friend Jenny, trying to navigate the incessant hell and guilt of being a working mother, was relatable and affecting too. Together, they deepened this thriller into something far more intriguing.What we said:“All Her Fault is fantastically well done. All the carefully planted seeds come to fruition. All the narrative cogs turn and interlock fast and seamlessly. You come for the terrifying premise and stay for the absolute pleasure.”Read more48The Last Musician of Auschwitz(BBC Two/iPlayer) This exceptional film told the extraordinary story of the now 100-year-old cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, the only surviving member of the women’s orchestra at Auschwitz. First-hand testimonies – including from the stoic, straight-talking subject herself – plus archive footage and musical performances merged to show the emotional turmoil of prisoners playing beautiful music in a hellscape, as well as tiny glimmers of resistance.What we said:“This incredibly impressive programme does not let us forget about Auschwitz’s corpse mountains or stench of burning bodies for a second, all the while posing questions about art and humanity that should ring in your ears for years to come.”Read more47Apple Cider VinegarView image in fullscreenA tissue of lies … Kaitlyn Dever as Belle Gibson in Apple Cider Vinegar.Photograph: Ben King/AP(Netflix) A remarkable true story, superbly told; this series dramatised the rise and fall of Belle Gibson, an Australian woman who established herself as a “wellness guru” by falsely claiming to have mitigated cancer via dietary tricks and alternative medicine. The truth was simpler: Gibson didn’t have cancer and her career and persona was a tissue of lies. Kaitlyn Dever’s portrayal of Gibson was admirably nuanced; she’s deeply dishonest but also desperately needy and in denial about the consequences of her actions, not least for her followers, some of whom relied upon her hokum to combat life-threatening conditions.What we said:“A fast, drily witty, acutely intelligent, compassionate and furious commentary on greed, need, mass delusion, self-deception, the exploitation of the credulous and the enabling of insidious new forms of all of these by technology.”Read more46The ResidenceView image in fullscreenCharmingly good fun … The Residence.Photograph: Erin Simkin/Netflix(Netflix) Something terrible has happened at the White House! No, not Donald Trump’s new ballroom extension but a fictional murder at the heart of American power. This funny, quirky whodunnit starred Uzo Aduba as Cordelia Cupp, an eccentric detective (she’s a keen birder, dresses entirely in brown tweed and frequently utilises her binoculars for work purposes) sent to solve the case. It’s charmingly good fun – essentially a country house murder mystery with added snark and West Wing trappings.What we said: “A gorgeous, gleeful romp.”Read more45Common Side EffectsView image in fullscreenAn absolute triumph … Common Side Effects.Illustration: Adult Swim(Adult Swim/Channel 4) Has Mike Judge ever made a bad show? This is the question it was hard not to ponder while watching this impeccable animated thriller-comedy. The plot? A fungi expert discovers a mysterious mushroom that seems to cure all illness, and ill-advisedly tells his childhood crush Frances – who now works for big pharma. The resulting high-octane deep-state drama was a blackly humorous adventure with real heart that satirised the state of healthcare in a capitalist society. An absolute triumph of TV-making.What we said:“Not merely the best thing I’ve seen on TV this year but one of the best shows I’ve seen in my life.”Read more44Gaza: Doctors Under Attack(Channel 4) The film the BBC couldn’t broadcast. Thanks be, then, to Channel 4 for stepping into the breach and airing it – for this was an essential document of our times. Its unsparing look at the targeting of Palestinian medics showed a pattern that has emerged over the past two years at hospitals across Gaza. First, they are bombed. Then, they are raided and doctors detained and tortured. Then, when their workplaces are reduced to rubble, the cycle starts on the next hospital. The testimony by Dr Khaled Hamouda, whose home was bombed, killing most of his family … before a drone strike mere moments later hit the supposed safe house his remaining children had escaped to, was an unforgettable piece of television that really needed to be aired.What we said:“In an open letter before its broadcast, Channel 4’s Louisa Compton warned that Doctors Under Attack would ‘make people angry, whichever side they take’. She is right. This is the sort of television that will never leave you.”Read more43Am I Being Unreasonable?View image in fullscreenDangerously addictive … Daisy May Cooper as Nic in Am I Being Unreasonable?Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC/Boffola Pictures(BBC One/iPlayer) This riot of marital, sexual and social awkwardness (with a side order of murder and betrayal) came courtesy of Daisy May Cooper and Selin Hizli, who have created a worthy successor to Julia Davis’s scabrous 2004 sitcom Nighty Night. Cooper stars as Nic, a woman juggling guilt, trauma and parenting catastrophe, still finding time for extramarital hi-jinks and yetsomehowremaining deserving of sympathy, mainly because of the cavalcade of monsters around her. A dangerously addictive chamber of horrors.What we said:“Howlingly funny.”Read more42Task(Sky Atlantic/Now) This crime drama starring Mark Ruffalo as gone-to-seed cop Tom Brandis allocated a dangerous new assignment in Philadelphia certainly wasn’t for the faint-hearted. But if you could handle the all-pervasive air of impending catastrophe, it was a fine, gritty, twisty procedural centred on stick-up merchants, biker gangs and the grim ramifications of the fentanyl trade. An intense downer, in the best possible way.What we said:“A meditation on guilt, sin and the possibility of redemption.”Read more41The TraitorsView image in fullscreenThe worst traitor ever to roam the castle … Linda, with fellow traitor Minah and faithful Fozia.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert(BBC One/iPlayer) Before the celebrity version gave us Alan Carr, the third series of normies Traitors delivered Linda, AKA the worst/best traitor to ever roam the castle. Her head-turn when Claudia Winkleman said “traitors” wasn’t the only golden moment. Charlotte’s fake Welsh accent! Lisa the vicar’s bare-faced lie about her job! The shock return of Alexander! Rare is the show that makes appointment TV and creates national watercooler chat in 2025. But beyond all that – Claudia’s gothic outfits alone were worth tuning in for.What we said:“As a study of human behaviour – of deception, manipulation, self-preservation – it remains captivating. As perhaps the best example of social experiment-style reality TV, it has cemented its place in the cultural firmament.”Read more40-3140Dope ThiefView image in fullscreenRide-or-dies … Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura in Dope Thief.Photograph: Jessica Kourkounis/AP(Apple TV) The two amiable, small-time Philadelphia crooks at the heart of Dope Thief have a good thing going. They rob low-level stash houses disguised as DEA officers and put on a performance of authority to avoid using violence. But when a big score at an out-of-town location is offered, they roll the dice and very quickly regret it: soon they have a bunch of very dangerous people on their tails. The key to this show was the chemistry between ride-or-die leads Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura. As the stakes rose, these alternately hilarious and heartbreaking hoods had us rooting for them in no time.What we said:“Brian Tyree Henry ranges from comedy to tragedy in a single scene and never misses a beat. He is extraordinary and the rest of the cast are up there with him. He gives Dope Thief heart and at times threatens to break the viewer’s. Wonderful.”Read more39Squid GameView image in fullscreen‘Hi, Cate Blanchett!’ … Squid Game.Photograph: Netflix(Netflix) Hwang Dong-hyuk’s killer game dystopia was one of those exciting shows that nobody saw coming – and it quickly became the biggest show of 2021. But after the sagging second series, the end was in sight with this final one. Fans simplyneededto know whether Player 456 – name: Gi-hun – could take down the evil game masters and VIPs from within. While he attempted that, new games meant more scream-at-the-screen entertainment, and we had other contestants to side with (or hate). The twists were totally bewildering (hi, Cate Blanchett!), which made this one hell of a ride to the finish line.What we said:“If you can get on board with the new contestant twist – and that is a big if – then the final two episodes have a nicely grand and operatic feel to them, and ultimately, Squid Game does its job.”Read more38Dept. Q(Netflix) Like a Scottish Slow Horses, but with fewer fart gags. This TV adaptation of a series of Danish crime novels – relocated to Edinburgh – was a sarcasm-packed thrill ride as it told the tale of unpopular maverick copper Carl Morck, sent to work on futile cold cases in the basement. You couldn’t help but root for the team he pulls together to track down a missing lawyer, but the show’s real joy lay in the dynamic between grumpy Morck andKelly Macdonaldas his cheeky, pomp-pricking, work-mandated therapist.What we said:“It is all fantastically well, and rigorously, done. The pacing has a leisurely confidence that some may find a touch slow, but allows for a character-first approach, creating a richness that amply rewards initial patience.”Read more37This City Is Ours(BBC One/iPlayer) The city in question was Liverpool and while the drug gang at this drama’s heart had the territory well and truly locked down, the internal politics of family and succession were a different matter. James Nelson-Joyce stole the show as Michael, the gang’s heir apparent who finds his assumed rise to the top threatened by retiring boss Ronnie’s (Sean Bean) surprising preference for his feckless son Jamie. Needless to say, as the brains and the brawn of the operation, Michael doesn’t take this well. This City Is Ours never fully escaped from standard gangster tropes but instead, leaned into them with compelling relish. And that final rooftop standoff! Breathtakingly tense.What we said:“The Sopranos influence can be felt” …Read more36The Beast in MeView image in fullscreenAwards will surely be given … Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys in The Beast in Me.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/AP(Netflix) An extraordinary performance of jittery, self-destructive anguish fromClaire Daneslies at the heart of this ambiguous psychological thriller. Danes is Aggie Wiggs, a creatively blocked and prickly author who is dealing with the trauma of bereavement. When Matthew Rhys’s rebarbative (indeed, possibly murderous) real estate magnate Nile Jarvis moves in next door, it seems like the last thing she needs. Sure enough, the pair hate each other almost on sight – but soon, a weird, co-dependent fascination develops between them which leads to some very dark waters indeed. The two leads inspire each other into something genuinely startling.What we said:“It is, they are, absolutely wonderful to watch. Awards will surely be given, and in the meantime you cannot look away.”Read more35A Thousand Blows(Disney+) The best of Steven Knight’s many shows this year, this punchy underworld drama contained pretty much a full house of his favourite tropes: strangely poetic outlaws, beautifully realised period trappings (London’s East End in the grubby, gruesome late Victorian era) and regular outbursts of bone-crunching violence. It also boasted a trio of magnificent lead performances: Malachi Kirby’s immigrant boxer, Hezekiah Moscow, was charming, principled and deadly, while charismatic gang leader Mary Carr (Erin Doherty) was shrewd and slippery. Meanwhile, Stephen Graham – an actor whose combination of vulnerability and volatility loomed over this TV year – was somehow terrifying and desperately poignant as fading prize-fighter Henry “Sugar” Goodson.What we said:“Hasan irresistible, Dickensian-yarn quality that helps smuggle in timely social and political commentary, much as the great man did himself.”Read more34I Love LAView image in fullscreenA gen Z delight … I Love LA.Photograph: HBO/Sky Comedy(Sky Comedy/Now) Is internet comedianRachel Sennottthe Lena Dunham of her generation? Her first comedy series certainly has potential to be as relevant to gen Z as Girls was for millennials. The show follows 27-year-old aspiring talent manager Maia (Sennott) in LA as she navigates relationships, friendships, career ambitions and all of life’s mortifying moments in between. It took a few episodes to find its feet but the cast burst with energy as they delivered near-constant gags. Plus, for the millennials: Leighton Meester guest stars as Maia’s boss.What we said:“The endless embarrassments and boundless opportunities of celebrity can seem, by season’s end, not too different from that of being alive, particularly in one’s 20s. It’s a bumpy ride, but they’re just getting started.”Read more33The ChangeView image in fullscreenGorgeous whimsy … Bridget Christie as Linda in The Change.Photograph: Photographer: Jon Hall/Channel 4(Channel 4) Bridget Christie’s comedy drama is something special: a deeply personal call to arms for menopausal women who feel invisible. It’s also hilarious. Linda (Christie) is a fiftysomething mother and wife who escapes life on a motorbike to go and find herself in the Forest of Dean. By series two, she has had quite an effect on the local people: women wear “Je suis Linda” T-shirts and, armed with their copy of Linda’s Ledger, boycott doing unrecognised work. But she’s still on her own journey, too, with plenty of touching moments and acts of sisterhood. All of this was explored with Christie’s gorgeous whimsy. What a shame Channel 4 cancelled the show, despite Christie writing it for a three-series arc. Hopefully it will find a new home.What we said:“The Change is still the best (and probably the only) TV comedy series ever written about menopause.”Read more32South ParkView image in fullscreenIncredible … Donald Trump and Satan in bed in South Park.Illustration: YouTube(Paramount+) After Paramount settled a lawsuit with Donald Trump for $16m (£13.5m) and discontinued Stephen Colbert’s show after the late-night host called the deal “a big fat bribe”, South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker signed a $1.5bn five-year contract with the network – and immediately fought back. Episode one starred Donald Trump with a micropenis, climbing into bed with Satan. ICE, AI, tech bros and Labubus have all been in the line of fire. For an animated show in its 28th series to not just stay relevant, but boldly retaliate against the Trump administration’s censoring of the media, is incredible. It’s also still really, really funny.What we said:“Even for a show like South Park, which has often been defined by its anger, this may well go down as its most furious ever.”Read more31Mussolini: Son of the Century(Sky Atlantic/Now) Joe Wright’s stylish adaptation of Antonio Scurati’s doorstop of a historical novel followed Il Duce’s wobbly first steps towards fascism, as he moved from national laughing stock to the March on Rome and his ultimate enshrining as dictator. Luca Marinelli was chillingly compelling as a fourth-wall-breaking Mussolini, walking the audience through each of his norm-shattering acts in a series that served as a honking great warning klaxon in these fractious times.What we said:“A brilliantly performed portrait of a pathetic monster.”Read more30-2130What It Feels Like For a GirlView image in fullscreenCertainly a wild ride … Ellis Howard as Byron in What It Feels Like For A Girl.Photograph: Hera Pictures/BBC(BBC Three/iPlayer) Based on Paris Lees’ unflinching coming-of-age memoir, What It Feels Like For a Girl followed Nottingham teenager Byron (an incredible breakthrough for Ellis Howard) who befriends a group of club-loving transgender women and starts to explore their own identity. Byron is far from a likable protagonist – but that, along with the nuanced ways the story tackled sex work and drug use is what made it so authentic, so bold. It was a challenging but captivating watch, made even better for capturing the 00s in all their inglorious mess.What we said:“It’s certainly a wild ride – I’ll struggle to look at a toilet brush the same way ever again.”Read more29AmandalandView image in fullscreenWelcome to SoHa, darling! … Lucy Punch as Amanda and Samuel Anderson as Mal in Amandaland.Photograph: Natalie Seery/BBC/Merman(BBC One/iPlayer) Replicating the sheer watchability of Motherland’s phenomenal ensemble cast is no mean feat. But it certainly doesn’t hurt to draw on solid-gold comedy pedigree performers like Joanna Lumley and Siobhán McSweeney, plus Motherland’s most underrated character: the gloriously daffy Anne. Add in the subtlety and vulnerability that Lucy Punch brought to her turn as post-divorce queen bee Amanda, plus a script that skewered Insta-obsessed posh parents, and you had a televisual joy. Just don’t accuse her of living in South Harlesden: it’s “SoHa”, darling.What we said:“When writing is this good, it fizzes with the hysterical energy of perimenopause.”Read more28The BearView image in fullscreenStill hits so hard … Ayo Edebiri as Sydney in The Bear.Photograph: FX(Disney+) This one sure divided the critics. There were those who felt the hit restaurant drama that skyrocketed blood pressures and sales of sexy white T-shirts had served up its duffest course yet. But those who stuck with its fourth season were rewarded in spades with way less shouting of “Yes chef” and way more deep and brave and emotional television that had catharsis by the crateload. The under-the-table wedding scene? That two-hander between Sydney and Carmy (“I believe in you more than I’ve ever believed in myself”)? The funeral reveal (“I will fucking destroy you, Carmy”)? This was TV that still hits so hard.What we said:“Having put his creations and his audience through hell, showrunner Christopher Storer now lets the light in via a torrent of tenderly written, fiercely performed interactions where broken people who love each other start to heal, saying variations on those two beautiful phrases, ‘sorry’ and ‘thank you.’”Read more27Andor(Disney+) Probably the best and certainly the most universally appealing of the many additions to the Star Wars universe in recent years, this Rogue One prequel may have had the usual fantasy trappings but was also a stirring meditation on oppression and resistance. And dropping in the year of Donald Trump’s second coming, it felt particularly poignant and potent. It starred the excellent Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, a thief and scavenger whose home planet has been rendered uninhabitable by the Galactic Empire. Andor is a natural leader but he’s also a cynic; sceptical of revolutionary idealism. How does such a man turn into a freedom fighter, willing to risk everything for his cause?What we said:“Even when it’s in a lighter mode, Andor is Star Wars for grownups. This rebellion is a serious business.”Read more26HacksView image in fullscreenStuff of dreams … Jean Smart as Deborah in Hacks.Photograph: Universal(Sky Max/Now) Never mind that this wasn’t the Jean Smart-starring, odd-couple sitcom’s finest season. So glorious is this Emmy-winning tale of a veteran standup paired with a gen Z comedy writer that even a low-key outing is the stuff of most show’s dreams. This time round, we got a new roster of scene-stealing minor characters, heart-wrenching moments of pathos and zingers so acerbic you were in constant danger of spraying tea across the room. It also doesn’t hurt that the relationship between its two leads is one of TV’s most captivating.What we said:“Season four of Hacks is very funny. But what makes it really special is just how raw it is, too, ready to hit you in the feels when you least expect it.”Read more25Trespasses(Channel 4) This beautiful adaptation of Louise Kennedy’s layered story about a forbidden love affair set against the Troubles truly crushed hearts. It followed young Catholic teacher Cushla (Lola Petticrew) who falls for Protestant barrister Michael Agnew (Tom Cullen). Obviously, things couldn’t end well – as the story navigates the temperature of Belfast during that time. Gillian Anderson has, rightly, received a lot of praise for her portrayal of Cushla’s grieving alcoholic mother. But Petticrew is a rising talent, as proven in last year’s Say Nothing.What we said:“Trespasses seems like a collection of familiar melodramas, each borrowing from the Troubles for extra dramatic heft. The narrative is constructed with deceptive skill. As individuals’ hopes and feelings are crushed in the gears of events much bigger than them, we feel that pain.”Read more24The AssemblyView image in fullscreenRare candour … Danny Dyer is grilled in The Assembly.Photograph: ITV(ITV1/ITVX) There’s no denying that one of the great pleasures of this interview show was watching Gary Lineker subjected to an unfiltered grilling, just as he followed years of controversy by announcing he was leaving the BBC. But that was just one of many excellent reasons to tune in to TV’s most joyous chatshow, with the questions this group of neurodivergent people fired at a visiting celebrity leading to unfailingly brilliant viewing. The panel were fearless, funny and not afraid to ask questions most entertainment journalists wouldn’t dare to. All the celebrity guests, including Danny Dyer, Jade Thirlwall and David Tennant, answered with rare candour – while the musical performances left you bawling.What we said:“This is some of the warmest telly you’ll see this year … even when Danny Dyer starts dropping f-bombs left, right and centre.”Read more23Dreaming Whilst BlackView image in fullscreenAlways goes there … Adjani Salmon and his Tyrese backing singers in Dreaming Whilst Black.Photograph: BBC/Big Deal Films/Gary Moyes(BBC iPlayer) “Sometimes you have to Hit the Pavement. Ask Zohran Mamdani.” Since season two of his BBC comedy Dreaming Whilst Black came out, Adjani Salmon has been taking to the streets of central London with his Bafta in one hand and a poster in the other that says “Do you watch Black shows”. It’s an ace marketing strategy, but everyone in the UK should already know Salmon, and should already have watched his show – one of the most exciting and hilarious comedies of our age. In its second outing, aspiring film-maker Kwabena (Salmon) starts out unemployed – his uncle brutally roasts him, declaring “Kwabena is the only Black man in England that never got any work out of Black Lives Matter” – but soon lands what seems like a dream gig: directing a new period drama with colour-blind casting. Soon, though, the wheels come off (literally) in the most catastrophic way. It’s punchy and it always goes there; it even recreated the Tyrese Gibson RnB banger How You Gonna Act Like That. More please, BBC!What we said:“Dreaming Whilst Black remains rich with funny, true observations, about the hypocrisies and degradations of working in TV, and Black British life in general. Pertinent questions raised in this series include: “Who the fuck wines to Giggs?” and “What has Jamaican national dish ackee and saltfish – served on rye, no less – got to do with celebrating Barbados?”Read more22Riot Women(BBC One/iPlayer) This story about a menopausal rock band in Hebden Bridge was unmistakably by Sally Wainwright: a wickedly funny, hugely moving and personal take on women who feel invisible in midlife – with a few twists chucked in for good measure. The cast was some of Britain’s best, including Joanna Scanlan, Lorraine Ashbourne, Tamsin Greig and Sue Johnston. But Rosalie Craig was the standout as furious lead singer Kitty, who belted out their absolute bangers (“Give. Me. HRT!”). There was poignant social commentary, too, and many moments that were a reminder to call your mum tonight. But ultimately, it was a rollicking ode to women who won’t be ignored. Rock on series two!What we said:“Sally Wainwright should be prescribed on the NHS as a form of HRT.”Read more21MoView image in fullscreenAlmost miraculous … Mohammed Amer as Mo.Photograph: Eddy Chen/Netflix(Netflix) Mo is an almost miraculous thing, managing to find humour and humanity in the most impossible circumstances. And the worst of it is that while Mo’s struggles towards belonging in America during season one were already considerable, the Trump administration’s extreme hostility towards “invaders” makes the real situation for such people almost unbearable to contemplate. And yet, Mo’s Palestinian-American creator Mohammed Amer continues to make his extremely heavy points with remarkable lightness – really, the big takeaway should be that the pride, ingenuity and cultural richness offered by strivers like Mo would be an asset to any nation open-hearted and self-possessed enough to welcome them in.What we said:“Surely one of the most heart-rending things you’ll watch on TV this year. It brings together food, identity, immigration, family and Middle Eastern politics in a way that’s as fresh and intriguing as the falafel tacos that become central to the plot.”Read more20-1120Just Act NormalView image in fullscreenThere’s no other show like this … Tionne (Akins Subair), Tiana (Chenée Taylor), Tanika (Kaydrah Walker-Wilkie) and chicken in Just Act Normal.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The Forge(BBC Three/iPlayer) Drugs, social services, a live chicken: this wry comedy drama had it all. As if a comic tale of three under-18s desperately trying to avoid being taken into care after their mum vanishes wasn’t idiosyncratic enough, it set the series up with one of the year’s most astonishing narrative rug pulls. The youthful cast was astonishing, the gags were strong and its charmingly dark tone was like nothing else on TV. Eye-prickingly sad moments of childhood trauma rubbed up against satire, with plots that ranged from hilarious spoofs of heist movies to a tender teen romance whose early stage played out in a massage parlour. It also featured the most touching tale of a child bonding with a local drug dealer seen on TV this year. Like we said, there’s no other show like this.What we said:“It is, within each episode and over the entire series, beautifully structured and holds its many strands in perfect tension … It is altogether a wonderful thing.”Read more19ShiftyView image in fullscreenDazzling … a waxwork of Margaret Thatcher from Shifty.Photograph: Adam Curtis(BBC iPlayer) While it’s possible to argue that Adam Curtis has been telling variations of the same story for many years now (the slow death of liberal democracy and human autonomy at the hands of late-stage capitalism), he still finds new and dazzling ways of illuminating his thesis. Shifty was his most convincing offering in some time: an emotional rather than strictly historical journey and all the better for it. It begins in the Thatcher years and, using Curtis’s extraordinary skill as an editor and archive-hunter, maps a path to the New Labour years. There’s no voiceover – simply a cascading collage of imagery that feels at once familiar and revelatory. Curtis’s films are best appreciated as art installations rather than historical narratives, but this intuitive masterpiece felt convincing on every level.What we said:“It is an increasing rarity to stand in the presence of anyone with an idea, a thesis, that they have thoroughly worked out to their own satisfaction and then present stylishly, exuberantly and still intelligently. The hell and the handcart feel that bit more bearable now.”Read more18Slow Horses(Apple TV) We’ve reached season five of the little espionage thriller that could, and by this point it’s become a bona fide blockbuster. Though we can’t help but feel it’s a slight case of diminishing returns, this season still had Gary Oldman giving his all as the slovenly Slough House spy boss Jackson Lamb, Nick “Celebrity Traitors” Mohammed as the London mayor nearly getting shot in a mosque and the honey-trapping of Roddy Ho almost bringing down the whole of MI5. Thankfully, Jackson managed to step in with a cracking checkmate to save the day – and his Slough House crew. Or as he put it: “Fuck MI5. My gaff, my rules.”What we said:“Season five isn’t really about white nationalists, or environmental activists, or hostile foreign actors, and yet it is also about all of those things, all at once.”Read more17The Chair Company(Sky Comedy/Now) Fans of Tim Robinson’s awkward brand of humour were in for a real treat with this cracking series. He played family man and office worker Ron, who becomes obsessed with tracking down the company behind the chair that caused an embarrassing accident in front of his colleagues. But what starts as a week of angry emails and phone calls turns into a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and the unravelling of a man who has had enough. Bizarre, worryingly relatable and absolutely hilarious.What we said:“You can’t tell exactly when the next massive, stupid laugh is coming.”Read more16Last One Laughing UKView image in fullscreenAnyone who cracks is out! … host Jimmy Carr with the cast of Last One Laughing UK.Photograph: Amazon MGM Studios(Prime Video) It’s a simple concept: round up 10 comedians in a room and get them to try to make each other laugh – anyone who cracks is kicked out. No wonder it’s been a hit in 26 other countries. Joe Lycett lasted mere minutes, while Richard Ayoade’s deadpan ways consistently worked in his favour. Daisy May Cooper’s re-enactment of being on a rollercoaster deserves a shout-out, too, but it was Bob Mortimer who stole the show. So much so that he has already been confirmed for season two next year.What we said:“Bob Mortimer performed a magic act first seen on The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer 30 years ago and sang some songs he posted on social media during Covid. The fact that these routines not only found new life on LOL UK, but also pushed his fellow contestants to the brink, is testament to Mortimer’s talent.”Read more15PlatonicView image in fullscreenComedy gold … Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen in Platonic.Photograph: Katrina Marcinowski/Apple(Apple TV) Kayaking disasters, LSD-related wedding catastrophes and the most grim golfing-related accident ever shown on TV – in its second season, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne’s tale of two uni pals navigating midlife lost none of its anarchic spark. And yet its depiction of the pressures of working motherhood felt more acute than ever, with Byrne the standout performer, reliably turning in comedy gold that veered from deadpan to OTT frenzy. Not bad going in a year that her co-star broke records for the number of Emmys he won for his other comedy, The Studio.What we said:“The show does a brilliant job of capturing that feeling of exclusion from the real world that often accompanies motherhood, and Byrne expertly walks the line between aspirational cool girl and relatably downtrodden housewife.”Read more14Big Boys(Channel 4) It kicked off with Jack finally losing his virginity in a tent in Faliraki and ended up with an emotionally pulverising beach scene (“I didn’t make it did I?”) followed by the revivification of a most beautiful mate. But over three series, Jack Rooke’s gorgeous autobiographical uni comedy about awkward bod Jack (Dylan Llewellyn) and his straight best mate Danny (Jon Pointing) was never one to do things by halves. It tackled love, loss and the drinking of poppers. It had a fish named Alison Hammond, a dissertation called To Bum or Not to Bum, and it offered a masterclass in how to eat Peperami while giving birth to your delivery driver’s baby. But the way it moved towards its final moments was a masterstroke. We can’t wait to see what Rooke does next.What we said: “It’s heartbreaking, it’s beautiful, it’s a valuable companion in itself: sitcoms don’t get much more deep and meaningful than this.”Read more13Such Brave Girls(BBC Three/iPlayer) None of the characters are nice, but it’s almost impossible to watch an episode of this darkly comic, impeccably acted show about three women on the brink and not want to spend more time in their company. A ferocious, laugh-out-loud funny rampage through mental health crises, debt and toxic relationships. Given that creator Kat Sadler and her sister co-star Lizzie Davidson are wringing sparklingly bleak comedy out of material based on their own lives, it makes the bravery of this Bafta-winning creation even more impressive.What we said:“If you like your comedy scary, lairy and perfectly portioned, it is a total knockout.”Read more12PluribusView image in fullscreenSpectacularly original … Rhea Seehorn and Kevin Chambers in Pluribus.Photograph: Anna Kooris/Apple(Apple TV) With Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul behind him, there were huge expectations for showrunner Vince Gilligan’s new drama – but he has pulled off a spectacularly original sci-fi story. Carol (the brilliant Rhea Seehorn, who the show was written for) is a miserable novelist who is immune to an alien virus that takes hold of 99.9% of the world and turns them into a happy hive. As Carol tries to “save” the world, the show morphs into a sharply funny social observation and a psychological thriller that hums with existential dread. As per Gilligan’s works, trust and patience are rewarded – thanks in part to those hypnotic opening montages – and each episode racks up more questions that you’re happy to wait whole series to find answers to. It’s a good job season two has already been commissioned.What we said:“It takes some chutzpah to look at the world in 2025 – especially if you are a non-Maga citizen of the US – and say to yourself, “Yes, but wouldn’t it be almost more terrible if everybody just … got along?” But that is essentially what Gilligan has done. The execution may not be flawless but the audacity of the question is incredible.”Read more11The White LotusView image in fullscreenMelting hearts … Aimee Lou Wood in The White Lotus.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/AP(Sky Atlantic/Now) Parker Posey’s lorazepam-fuelled North Carolinian accent! Aimee Lou Wood’s melting of hearts! And … Patrick Schwarzenegger’s sibling incest! The third season of Mike White’s luxury resort drama, set in Thailand, might not have been the best – but it was stuffed with viral comedy moments, treacle-dark twists and career-high performances. This is still one of the most solid series going, with White taking it in weirder and wilder directions each time, so who on earth knows what the next White Lotus stay will bring.What we said:“Exquisitely shot, scripted, paced and performed, it’s a sumptuous feast for all the senses. ”Read more10-310Louis Theroux: The Settlers(BBC Two/iPlayer) As a follow-up to his 2011 film, The Ultra Zionists, Louis Theroux returned to the West Bank after the 7 October attacks, as more Israeli religious nationalists settled in the occupied Palestinian territory. Not many could keep their cool while having rifles pointed at them repeatedly, or when spending time with Ari Abramowitz, a gun-holding settler from Texas who refused to utter the word “Palestinian”, or Daniella Weiss, the outspoken “godmother” of the settler movement. Even Theroux, in a jaw-dropping moment, set aside his gentle persona and asked whether she is a sociopath. Bold, alarming and necessary viewing.What we said:“I’ve been watching Theroux’s films for more than three decades, and watching him be this forthright feels like a true watershed moment in his career. It suits him.”Read more9SeveranceView image in fullscreenTouching and troubling … Adam Scott and Britt Lower in Severance.Photograph: Apple TV+(Apple TV) Following up the stunning cliffhanger finale of this creepy workplace satire’s first season was always going to be a difficult feat. But this second outing managed to move past the novelty of a clever premise, featuring employees mentally “severed” into two personalities so that their workplace incarnations are ignorant of their personal lives and vice versa. What emerged were love stories that were touching, troubling and had a flair for wrongfooting the viewer, the show’s creepiest scenes ever and a terrifying guest spot from Gwendoline Christie that’s not just a strong contender for the show’s most memorable moment, but possibly one of her defining roles. Forget Brienne of Tarth: here’s Terrifying Corporate Goat Herd.What we said:“Severance is a rarity in so many ways – stylish without sacrificing substance, a thoroughly singular vision, fresh, challenging, a wholly credible world made of a tissue of incredulities.”Read more8How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge)(BBC One/iPlayer) The Gibbons brothers’ BBC revival of Partridge continued apace with this triumphant return to fly-on-the-wall TV redolent of I Am Alan Partridge. This supposed attempt by the broadcaster to tackle a mental health epidemic had a wide brief: from episodes spoofing BBC show Winter Walks to Partridge taking on borderline consumer champion role that saw him tackle an unscrupulous tech boss on behalf of an unfairly sacked employee (only to “give her story the hearing it deserves” by flying one of the company’s jetpacks while screaming “Sell your kids! Get one before they ban it!”). He got wasted on white wine at a book club, was forced to let Lynne nearly crash his car and ruined her church music group by turning them into a rehearsal space for his electronic drum kit. Is that how you champion better mental health? Clearly not. But this is Alan Partridge, after all – on the form of his life.What we said:“Whatever medium he inhabits, Partridge remains the funniest comic creation in Britain, and even placeholder Partridge has more laughs-out-loud per half-hour than anything else on telly.”Read more7The RehearsalView image in fullscreenPrepare to be wrongfooted … Nathan Fielder in The Rehearsal.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.(Sky Comedy/Now) Nathan Fielder is worried about aircraft safety. Well, he might be. Or he might be using the subject as a smokescreen for a rambling, surreal exploration of the concept of authenticity. Or maybe a bit of both? Fielder’s new series – in which he tries to persuade the aviation industry to adopt new techniques to ensure better cockpit communication between pilots – will wrongfoot you so frequently you’ll end up stumbling in circles. Along the way, he builds a full-scale replica of parts of Houston airport, performs an experiment with a pair of cloned dogs and suckles on a huge model of the mother of heroic pilot Chesley Sullenberger. He also (quite literally) sticks the landing in a way that genuinely leaves you gasping. Whatever you expect this show to be, prepare to be wrong. But prepare to be dazzled too: no one else makes television like this.What we said:“At the end of the finale, I realised that all I had written for the final 30 minutes was ‘how on EARTH did they do this????’ over and over again, like a bad version of the typewriter scene in The Shining.”Read more6Alien: EarthView image in fullscreenHell was unleashed …. it’s the demon-eyed sheep on Alien: Earth.Photograph: FX(Disney+) Who could have predicted that a demon-eyed sheep would become the most symbolic baddie in the Alien franchise? Making a TV series of the beloved films (the first two, at least) was a huge gamble. But boy did Noah Hawley pull it off. Fleshing out the mythology, he introduced us to a not-so-far-fetched dystopia where a rich brat in pyjamas called the shots and immortalised dying children via synthetics. He also really wanted aliens. But when his wish came true, hell was unleashed: the trypanohyncha ocellus – a tentacled eyeball that buried itself in its victim’s eye socket, including that poor sheep – joined the xenomorph in scaring the bejesus out of fans. Hawley took his time in telling the story, but even when humans weren’t being ripped apart, the masterly production ensured a sense of doom and always had you wondering: who are the real monsters here?What we said:“The series always has a way of making us feel like helpless prey being circled. Something gloriously horrific is just around the corner.”Read more5Blue LightsView image in fullscreenWhat a show … Siân Brooke as Grace in Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/PA(BBC One/iPlayer) It’s meticulously researched, so rooted in its Belfast location that it feels like no other cop drama on TV, and almost certainly the show with television’s finest Westlife-based comic moment. As its third season saw action move to the drug trade’s links to wealthy elites it took a darker turn than previously, with fewer comic moments, and a run of grippingly tense episodes that repeatedly raised the bar for the year’s most intense watch. The stress of two officers failing in their battle to stop a car crash victim bleeding out, only to nearly end up being assassinated by dissident republicans while informing the driver’s parents of his death? Pfft. Standout episode Ordo Ab Chao saw a low-key restaurant disturbance end in a stabbing for constable Shane, while colleague Grace had to protect a witness against a carful of gunmen, despite having no weapons, armour or clue what she was supposed to do. At times it was stressful enough to give you a panic attack, and yet, it still managed to end the series on a joyful, smile-inducing singalong. What a show.What we said:“Blue Lights has quietly become one of the best shows on TV.”Read more4The StudioView image in fullscreenOne side-splitting farce after another … Ike Barinholtz, Kathryn Hahn, Seth Rogen and Chase Sui Wonders in The Studio.Photograph: AP(Apple TV) Seth Rogen’s sitcom about a Hollywood film studio broke records for the number of Emmys it won, and with good reason. Despite being stuffed with brilliant celeb cameos (Dave Franco as a live wire, drug-taking party monster! Ron Howard knocking Rogen head over heels in a fight!), its core cast outshone them, oozing astonishing comic flair as they rattled through one side-splitting farce after another. The show’s embrace of its subject matter extended to a soundtrack of big band-style skittering drums redolent of golden era Hollywood and artfully directed episodes whose camerawork included one filmed in an elaborate single-take shot (while the plot of the episode is about a film-maker trying to get an elaborate single-take shot). Don’t let the highfalutin artsy stuff fool you, though: after all, one of the most memorable moments of this hilariously slapstick show is a drug-addled, violently spray-tanned Bryan Cranston in a leopard-skin thong. Unforgettable.What we said:“Many things mark The Studio out from the ever-increasing herd of satires on Hollywood. There is the unimpeachable casting, from core to cameos; the former comprising not just Catherine O’Hara as the raw-nerved Patty but also Kathryn Hahn as permanently, incandescently furious marketing maven Maya.”Read more3The Celebrity TraitorsView image in fullscreenBrilliant … The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert(BBC One/iPlayer) The Traitors has long blown every other reality TV show out of the water with its ability to create event television. And it might just have torpedoed even itself with its brilliant celeb version. Throwing in a troupe of national treasures to the Scottish castle made for instant investment in a show that has never exactly been difficult to care about. The joy of not just seeing the gripping game mechanics unfold, but also being able to draw conclusions about both the contestants (how does Alan Carr have so little volume control?) and the nature of celebrity itself (is the reason they did so badly that they’re all so used to fakeness that they can’t spot it?) added even more layers to a millefeuille of stressful viewing. And the twist in that finale! Undoubtedly the finest Traitors ever. How are we going to go back to caring about the normal one now?What we said:“All the essential elements are present and correct. The Winkleman. The castle. The only difference is that it is a bit easier to keep track of those first-round contestants because they are all familiar faces, designed as a group to pull in punters from all possible demographics and keep the BBC’s current greatest hit as popular as ever.”Read moreNo 2 coming soonStay tuned for the next episode"

From this simple premise comes a joyful game of mindfulness and social interaction, as Alta learns how to serve up witty conversation and decent hot drinks. Colourful and highly stylised, it is a thoughtful study of burnout and recovery.19Expelled!View image in fullscreenClass conscious … Expelled!Photograph: InkleInkle/Nintendo Switch, iPhone/iPad, Mac, PCAn attempted-murder mystery set in an a 1920s all-girls private school reveals itself to also be an eviscerating takedown of British class politics. Witty and beautifully drawn, it is full of amusing boarding-school stereotypes, from self-interested prefects to a terrifying matron, whose motivations and personal grievances must be slowly unpicked. It has the feel of a really excellent graphic novel.18Hades 2SupergiantGames, PC, SwitchA stylish return to Greek mythology for developer Supergiant Games, this time starring daughter of the underworld Melinoë, who is trying to prevent the titan Chronos from destroying everything. You are aided in your attempts to kill Time by a range of absurdly attractive fellow immortals and vicious familiars. Repeated runs bring gradual mastery of Melinoë’s spells and weapons, tipping the scales of fate ever so slightly in your favour.17GrunnSokpop Collective, PCA gardening sim that’s also a horror adventure, Grunn is a weird, often unsettling experiment in game design, set in a Dutch village inhabited by ghostly figures and intriguing secrets. Trim the lawn, collect photos, but be extremely careful when visiting the church or exploring that weird bunker beyond the hedgerow.16Lonely Mountains: Snow RidersView image in fullscreenPristine … Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders.Photograph: Megagon IndustriesMegagon Industries, PC, XboxAll is well with the world as you carve beautiful lines down pristine mountain snowscapes – until you smack into a rock or fly off a cliff, that is. Minimalist in both its aesthetic and its simple, stripped-back play, this is one of the best games ever made about skiing. Playing with other people adds a little enjoyable chaos to the experience, but Snow Riders is best when it’s just you and the mountain, and you’re testing your perseverance against a particularly challenging trail.15Donkey Kong BananzaNintendo, Switch 2Nintendo’s favourite ape returns in a wild take on the classic platform adventure, accompanied by series regular Pauline, who is able to attain shapeshifting magical powers. Instead of pixel-perfect jumps, you punch, crunch and blast your way through exotic locations, collecting power-ups and pulverising bosses, tearing up the Super Mario level design book as you go. Smashing.14Monster Hunter WildsCapcom, PC, PS5, XboxCapcom’s spectacular monsters, from fluffy pink snarling apes to elder dragons that command lightning, have long been waiting for a world big enough to contain them. Wilds is that world: an expanse of desert, volcanic plains, jungle and icy peaks that provides the perfect habitats for an extraordinary, dangerous menagerie – and perfect arenas in which to fight them. The story is a thrill ride of escalatingly epic face-offs, but afterwards it opens up a vast menu of more challenging hunts.13Split FictionHazlelight Studios/Electronic Arts, PC, PS5, Switch, XboxTwo aspiring writers become trapped in each others’ stories in this eminently likable interactive take on buddy comedy. Except they’re not buddies: they’re polar opposites. Standoffish sci-fi writer Mio and happy-go-lucky fantasy writer Zoe come to understand each other better as they are forced to cooperate their way through the bizarre realms of their imagination Play transforms unpredictably every 20 minutes - one level could be all-action space-blasting, the next will have you puzzling through a fantasy jungle as transforming animals, and an unexpected diversion will have you working together to wriggle sentient hotdogs into buns. You’ll be brought closer to your player two as well, as navigating these collaborative scenarios requires communication, patience, and a sense of humour.12The AltersView image in fullscreenLooks familiar … The Alters.Photograph: 11 bit studios11Bit Studios, PC, PS5, XboxAfter crash-landing on a planet supposedly rich in a valuable mineral, Jan Dolski finds himself all alone. The rest of the crew died on impact. So to keep the mission going, and escape an imminent sunrise that will fry him out of existence, he must clone himself to create a crew. After twenty-ish hours split between exploring a hostile planet, managing the base’s resources and managing the squabbles between all the alternate Jans, you will be left with a lot to ponder about how our life choices shape who we are.11DespelotePanic, PC, PS4/5, Switch, XboxSet at the time of Ecuador’s journey to the 2002 World Cup finals, Despelote is a beautifully designed semi-autobiographical adventure about a young boy and his obsession with the beautiful game. Focusing on families, childhood and the uniting power of fandom, it’s a unique take on the idea of a sports sim.10Two Point MuseumView image in fullscreenA lot to manage … Two Point Museum.Photograph: SegaTwo Point Studios/Sega, PC, PS5, Switch 2, XboxThe Two Point series of management sims has consistently combined humour and deep strategy to compelling effect, and the latest is no exception. Your role as museum manager is to gather exhibits from around the world then display them in an attractive setting to pull in visitors. Meanwhile there are staffing issues to contend with, and is your cafe serving nice enough snacks? It’s an engrossing challenge and the cartoon-style visuals provide plenty of amusing asides.9Ghost of YoteiSucker Punch/Sony, PS5A deliciously easy to enjoy and arrestingly beautiful samurai action game about a female warrior, Atsu, on a revenge quest, which unselfconsciously reproduces every possible trope of the genre, with panache. We have tense sword stand-offs under falling leaves. We have enemies eyeing each other menacingly from either side of a burning bridge. We have hot springs, shrines and quiet moments playing theshamisenor wielding asumi-eink brush. We have wolves and foxes leading us to secret spots in nature. And we have a selection of delightfully fun weapons and a seemingly endless horde of bandits and villains to use them on. Uncomplicated, beautifully made entertainment.8Death Stranding 2Kojima Productions/Sony, PS5Troubled delivery man and resistance hero Sam Bridges returns in Hideo Kojima’s visually astonishing, eccentric and engrossing sci-fi sequel. Moving the action to an apocalyptic Australia provides landscapes of stark beauty – and the odd kangaroo. And while the story is often indecipherable, the realisation of Kojima’s ghostly universe is incredible. This is a wasteland you can wallow in for months.7Clair Obscur: Expedition 33View image in fullscreenExtravagantly French … Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.Photograph: Sandfall InteractiveSandfall/Keplar, PC, PS5, XboxAn extravagantly French role-playing game in which a band of depressed people from a ravaged Paris set out to kill a supernatural painter, who wipes out a generation of people with a few strokes of her brush each year. It is surreal, exciting, melodramatic, sometimes self-indulgent, and strangely hopeful – a breath of fresh air even in a genre that’s hardly starved of stylish, thematically ambitious games.6Consume MeHexecutable, PCA satirical slice-of-life game about life as a dieting-obsessed teen in the 00s, Consume Me is extremely funnyandhas a point to make. Juggling studies with social time and walking the dog, Tetris-ing food on to your plate and and enduring excruciating conversations with your parents, all makes you properly relive the overwhelm and pressure of adolescent life. The presentation, meanwhile, is exuberantly, lovably absurd.5Mario Kart WorldView image in fullscreenDelightful … Mario Kart World on Nintendo Switch 2.Photograph: NintendoNintendo, Switch 2The showcase title for the Switch 2 is another glorious addition to the Mario Kart universe, boasting a delightful cast of characters and 30 varied circuits joined by a network of highways that provide the chance to explore a wide open landscape for the first time in the series. Add in the wonderful soundtrack of electronic lounge jazz pop bangers and you have another family gaming staple that will remain on rotation for years.4The Seance of Blake ManorSpooky Doorway/Raw Fury, PCIt’s the late 19th century and you’ve just arrived at a remote hotel in the west of Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. But as you dig for clues, the dead emerge from their graves – and they’re really not happy. Part Agatha Christie detective sim, part folk-horror opus, this is a fascinating and engrossing experience that has things to say about class, belief and colonialism.3Silent Hill fView image in fullscreenSpectral nightmare …Silent Hill f.Photograph: KonamiNeoBards/Konami, PC, PS5, XboxIn 1960s Japan, a young girl’s fury at her bullying father becomes a spectral nightmare that consumes a whole town. Written by acclaimed visual novel author Ryukishi07, the game puts you in familiar Silent Hill territory, which means foggy streets, fiendish puzzles and truly horrible monsters. But by infusing the uncanny, mythology and superstition with feminist themes, it is an intriguing slant on a much loved (and feared) series.2Hollow Knight: SilksongTeam Cherry, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, XboxEven the most tenacious player will feel like giving up at some point while trapped in Pharloom, a decaying realm full of desperate little bugs that was once a gleaming religious capital. Here lie some truly wretched places: former farms now fetid swamps, dank underground caverns overgrown with moss and misery, grand halls now dust-covered and reverberating with foreboding. And of course there are the guardians of these places, from mind-rotted beast-tamers to corrupted pilgrims and bug-automatons, silk-poisoned creatures and the realm’s former rulers, who stand in the way of your progress. Silksong’s most forbidding foes take hours to overcome. Its worst places will entrap you in despair. But it is worth it, because of the awe-inspiring moments that you will experience along the way: the hard-won victories, those first steps into previously locked-off realms, the secret revelations that seem so personal it’s hard to believe that any of the game’s millions of other players could discover them the same way. An extraordinary game whose sometimes extreme difficulty is both a strength and a weakness.1Blue PrinceView image in fullscreenUnforgettably clever … Blue Prince.Photograph: Raw FuryDogubomb/Raw Fury, PC, PS5, XboxA young man inherits a mysterious mansion from his uncle: a sprawling pile whose layout changes every day. He needs only to find the secret 46th room, and the place is his for ever. The mansion turns out to be an education: on the personal history of the family that owned it, the mysterious forces that shaped it and the political climate of the wider world in which it is situated. But before you get anywhere near Blue Prince’s deeper mysteries, you must master its blueprints. Behind every door is a choice: do you draft a library? A hallway with several exits? A security room, a laboratory, a pool, a bedroom, a nursery, a drawing room? Each will have its own secrets to discover, a useful item or a key or a new piece of information that gets you ever closer to that elusive 46th room. And each might offer you a new path to the rest of the mansion, or locked doors that you haven’t the means to pass. Every day, with every new route that you carve through these rooms, every dead end you meet, your knowledge accumulates. By the time you do reach that final destination, you’ll have so many unanswered questions, you won’t be able to resist continuing. Blue Prince turns out to be an almost bottomless mystery, leaving you with pads full of notes, theories, numbers and names, lines from books that you want to remember and drawings of strange mechanisms. It is among the best puzzle games ever made: atmospheric and understated and unforgettably clever; still somehow able to show you something new even after tens of hours of patient exploration.Explore more on these topicsGames2025 in cultureNintendo Switch 2PlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They’re all there, clearly defined in his very earliest interviews, right from the start of his career. Write like you mean it (perhaps that’s why his plays have so much heart and drive). Never write for money and never compromise (maybe that’s why two of the best TV shows he had a hand in, the controversial conspiracy dramaUtopiaand the Sharon Horgan comedyPulling, were cancelled after two series). And finally: make sure your writing always contains a secret.In the case ofMatilda, the smash-hit stage adaptation he wrote alongside Tim Minchin, Kelly only figured out the secret hidden inside his writing long after the awards came flooding in. It turns out that Matilda, a show that glows with love but also aches with a sense of a loss, was all about Kelly’s longing to be a father – a longing that was met just a few years after the premiere with the birth of Kelly’s now six-year-old daughter, Kezia.As we chat over video about his upcoming BBC prison drama, Waiting for the Out (WFTO), I repeat Kelly’s mantras back to him. So, what’s the secret contained inside his latest TV series? Kelly laughs and, after a thoughtful silence, offers up his answer. The secret to WFTO, which is all about men living in the shadow of a life in prison, is fear. Fear of speaking out. Fear of being vulnerable. Fear of simply being oneself. It’s the kind of fear that Kelly knows intimately: “I spent the first 30 years of my life utterly fucking terrified but always pretending I wasn’t scared. I thought it was blasphemy to admit fear. I’m not an idiot but that’s what I felt.”What was he afraid of? “Everything! I was scared of what people thought of me. I was scared physically in situations. I was scared of who I was or who I wasn’t. I was just a fearful individual but then, at the same time, I would constantly say I wasn’t scared.” It was only in his 30s, when Kelly confronted his alcoholism, sorted his life out and started to write in earnest, that his unspoken fears finally disappeared.View image in fullscreenPartners in crime … Finan with co-star Phil Daniels.Photograph: BBC/Sister Pictures/Jessica SansomThe day after our interview, Kelly – who has now been sober for 25 years – explains over email just how close he came to blowing up his life: “Living in addiction is a very fearful way to live but, for me, alcohol was the answer to the fear and shame I generally carried around with me every second of the day. It was only through catastrophic fucking up that I was able to get to a point where I could admit weakness and fear. Many men never get there and that can lead them to do stupid and terrible things.”His upcoming series is based on Andy West’s memoir The Life Inside, which explores West’s time spent teaching in prison and the illuminating – but also deeply unsettling – impact this had on his own life. While researching the show, Kelly clocked this same debilitating fear in some of the inmates he observed inside: “I’m always amazed by how many of those big scary blokes doing hard time are really just terrified little boys. That’s not to excuse what they’ve done. It’s just to try to understand it.”WFTO centres on philosophy teacher Dan, who has a lot in common with the real-life Andy West. In fact, for a long time the central character was called Andy West – until Kelly started to tinker with Andy’s story and felt it best to change his name to Dan. Real-life Andy, for example, isn’t in the least bit interested in finding his absent father, a man who spent a lot of time in prison and has been a difficult presence in Andy’s life. But in the show, Dan grows dangerously fixated by his father and tries to track him down.A lot of modern TV feels like it did a line of speed before talking to you. After a while you just feel drained by itBoth Kelly and West come from working-class backgrounds and grew up in London. West’s childhood was spent in the shadow of prison, with lots of his family – his dad, brother and uncle – serving time. Thanks to hard work, determination and perhaps a smattering of luck (all ideas the show grapples with), West managed to break the cycle and carve out his own successful and very different life.Kelly grew up in north London to relatively poor Irish immigrant parents. His father was a heavy drinker who worked on buses and his mother was a cleaner. For both Kelly and West, there’s a disconnect between who they are today and where they come from: “I’m from a fairly poor background yet I do this job. It’s the least working-class job you can have. So there’s a contradiction between those two parts of yourself,” says Kelly. “And that’s OK. I think humans are totally capable of those two contradictions. It’s OK to be working class and eat olives. It’s not some sort of betrayal.”The show was always going to be about Andy, says Kelly: “He’s easily the most interesting person involved in this project, and I include myself in that. He reads like this very middle-class person and, because we’re so weird about class in this country, your brain turns off. You start to think you know who he is. But then Andy tells you these incredible stories and he upends your prejudices. His existence is a challenge to some of the things you didn’t even know you thought but you really fucking do.”View image in fullscreenDennis Kelly with WFTO director  Jeanette Nordahl.Photograph: BBC Studios/Sister Pictures/Jessica SansomKelly visited a number of different prisons – Grendon, Isis, Belmarsh – while writing the show. These trips were partly about seeing Andy at work but also about trying to find a new way to depict prison on screen. Something quieter, slower, hopefully a bit more truthful: “Very often when we have prison dramas they’re very tense. They’re about people getting stabbed or being extorted. It’s not that those aspects aren’t there but the truth is that a lot of what prison is about is waiting. You basically get a couple of hundred people, you put them in a building that they can’t leave and they just have to wait.”Some of the episodes were written alongside Ric Renton, who has served hard time and was really helpful in fleshing out the show’s gently simmering depiction of life behind bars, including as an actor: “There’s a speech later on in the series when Ric talks about leaving prison and it’s his real-life experience. In prison, no one moves quickly because you don’t want to get where you’re going.”The first few episodes are directed by Jeanette Nordahl, who also directed the show’s star, Josh Finan, inThe Responder. She has a deliberately still style of directing, often sitting with her characters and just letting the silence spool. In many ways, suggests Kelly with a chuckle, it’s a decidedly old-fashioned way of making television: “A lot of modern TV feels like it did a line of speed before coming out and talking to you. And I’m not knocking that TV. I’ve made that TV. Sometimes it’s great. But after a while you just feel a bit drained by it all. We didn’t want to do that. We wanted to tell the story in a different way.”‘She took it as a personal affront that people didn’t like her!’ What it’s like when your TV show gets cannedRead moreMany of the still scenes are spent quietly observing Finan, who instils teacher Dan with an aching innocence but something much jitterier and darker, too. As the episodes unfurl, Dan’s doubts begin to crowd in on him and the mistakes of his father start to feel like his own. By the end of the series, Dan’s story is relatively resolved – although Kelly believes there’s potential for further exploration. Another series, perhaps? Kelly lets out a wry laugh: “I’ve sort of given up thinking about that sort of thing. I’ve had too many shows cancelled, to be honest. Two series and I’m out!”There’s talk of reviving Kelly’s recent stage play, The Regression, about a movement rebelling against technological advancement. So far the play has only run in Germany, to frankly terrible reviews. Kelly, who seems equally at ease with failure as he is with success, laughs at this critical mauling: “It’s this odd fucking play but I’m going to try to make it work. Let’s see if I can get people in this country to hate it, too!” And with that, we end our interview where his career began, with a total refusal to compromise. Write like you mean it – and to hell with the consequences.Waiting for the Out is on BBC One and iPlayer in January.Explore more on these topicsDennis KellyTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

We were all swept up, from teens to the retired, magistrates and retail workers, even non-gameshow fans. The show became the national conversation in a way TV pundits no longer thought possible. It was lightning in a bottle. Which would be a cool way of murdering someone.Why was it perfect TV? On the face of it, it’s a simple format that balances banter and tension, fun games and insidious group dynamics. Bucking the streamer “dumping” model, the BBC drip-fed episodes until we were slavering. Their ace, of course, isClaudia Winkleman– impeccable outfits, iconic hair, sly presenting style. I saw so many Winklemen at Halloween parties this October it was like Being John Malkovich with bangs. But this year the show surpassed even its own standards.The faithful were, objectively, the worst. They made it their mission to evict anyone useful or loyal, and never missed. But you can’t blame them, given the eccentric nature of the group. There was twinkly, two-faced Celia Imrie – flirting with Jonathan Ross, parping from nerves, talking about putting pussies in wells. Giggling assassin Alan Carr was delicious, gliding merrily along even while unable to pretend to be a faithful with any seriousness. Kate Garraway used the word “flabbergasted” at one point, which no one in any conversation in history ever has. (In response, Tom Daley gave her a side-eye which would take gold in the suspicion Olympics.)View image in fullscreenDelicious … Alan Carr in The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryThe faithful had their heroes, though. Puzzle-ninja Nick Mohammed, purer of heart than Harry Potter. And his “hundy”, rugby player Joe Marler. They were like David and Goliath teaming up. Roundtables, especially when stuffed with luvvies, are often conflict-aversion dances. (There’s only so many times you can hear “I’m voting for you because you’re clever and would make a brilliant traitor and I love you.”) There was none of that from the Harlequins loosehead prop, who took Traitor-catching personally. If he thought you were one, he would stare at you like Bane. For explanation, he might drag a finger across his throat.Marler’s “Big Dog” theory – as well as being bang on – was a fascinating insight into patriarchy. There does seem to be something about being a tall, white man in his late 60s that means people defer to you. It takes a lot to lose your seat at the table – see Jonathan Ross. One couldn’t help but think about our political life. It was like watching the group choose a prime minister. “It’s like playing chess against five-year-olds,” was Ross’s own assessment. A trickster to the end, his final speech was brilliant.View image in fullscreenTricksters to the end … Jonathan Ross, Alan Carr and Cat Burns on The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: BBCOne must give Stephen Fry his due, too. Often with reality shows, I wonder how clever the “clever people” really are. Are they just showbiz smart? But having judged the strategies of the faithful ineffective, Fry put forward an original theory: that the nocturnal traitors would be the most tired members of the group. Cat Burns, the traitor he levelled this at, had to stop yawning and think fast. She disclosed her neurodivergence, and the exhausting necessity of masking it. A risky card to play, but timed perfectly.You can tell a lot about people by what they respond to in the show. For example, as compelling as the double-bluffs and counterstrategies were, what I like best is that contestants spell each other’s names wrong. Roundtables are brutal enough – imagine having to listen to your friends explain why they think you’re shifty and a liar. Then imagine looking down at their slate, and they’ve called you “Meina” or “Nather” or “Charlot” or whatever. It’s 10 times funnier when the mangled name is “Tom Daylee”.Unlike me, TV audiences are sophisticated these days. They understand narrative, casting decisions and can tell when a player is being given a “hero edit”. There are podcasts examining the nuances of every interaction on the show. Given such scrutiny, the fact that the producers were able to deliver a gripping finale, and a result that felt shocking, inevitable and completely satisfying, is nothing short of astonishing. They are masters of psychological manipulation. You’d have to say, that’s traitor-ish behaviour.Explore more on these topicsCulture2025 in TVTelevisionReality TVCelebrityClaudia WinklemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Can a gimmick turn into a new form of entertainment?Adrian HortonFri 19 Dec 2025 05.03 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 10.22 ESTShareIf you have been anywhere close to the social media blast radius ofThe Summer I Turned Pretty, Amazon Prime’sbreakoutYA series on a tortuous teen love triangle, you may be familiar with the plight of Henley and Luca. The star-crossed lovers of a short-form video series called Loving My Brother’s Best Friend – plot self-explanatory – have made waves on TikTok with yearning stares and “I/we can’t do this” drama that echo the many fan edits of beloved TV couple Belly and Conrad. But whereas The Summer I Turned Pretty explored its central tension over 40-minute episodes on streaming, Loving My Brother’s Best Friend, produced by a short-form company called CandyJar, distilled its appeal to its barest essences: sexual tension hook, escalating line and cliffhanger sinker, all within two-minute “episodes” on your phone. Without even meaning to or really wanting to, I watched the first 10 chapters (of 44) in one 15-minute gulp – and I’mnot the only one.Growing pains: the struggle to make a must-see gen Z TV showRead moreHollywood is hoping that you, too, will be hooked. Though Loving My Brother’s Best Friend may not look like a typical Hollywood product – in fact, it resembles some mix of teen show, soap opera and amateur fan-cam edit – the industry is investing heavily in the future of series like it:low-budget, mobile-only “microdramas”with episodes between 60 and 90 seconds. These shows, also known as “verticals” for their phone orientation, have already become widely popular in China, where mobile screens dominate entertainment even more than in the US. In just three years, revenue for serialized short-form drama in Chinarosefrom $500m in 2021 to $7bn in 2024, and is projected to reach $16.2bn by 2030. The global microdrama market for 2025 is estimated at anywhere from $7bn to 15bn – and booming, with nearlytriple revenue growthfor microdrama companies outside China in the past year.Until recently, major players in Hollywood stood on the sidelines, content to let such companies, which make money via advertising or user gaming app-esque “micropayments”, release risible shows including Fake Married to My Billionaire CEO or Fated to My Forbidden Vampire. But the boom in business – along withcontinuedindustryconsolidationandproduction shiftsaway fromCalifornia – has made cost-efficient microdrama impossible to ignore. “It is the first inning,” said Bill Block, the former CEO of Miramax whose new microdrama venture GammaTime has raised over $14m from such investors as Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. “This is now a firmly established market, in the beginning, with lots to explore in terms of taste.”The 50 best TV shows of 2025Read moreIf ReelShort and DramaBox, as Block said, “defined and won the first round”, Hollywood is looking to win the second. In just a few months, aflurry of dealshave brought industry mettle into the still nascent space, indicating a potential revolution in serialized entertainment. In August, several prominent studio veterans – former WME and ABC entertainment head Lloyd Braun, former Showtime president Jana Winograde, and ex-NBC Universal Television chair Susan Rovner – founded MicroCo, backed by the tech-driven entertainment company Cineverse. In October, Fox Entertainment announced an equity stake investment in the Ukrainian company Holywater, which owns the My Drama app, with a commitment to make more than 200 new shows for the platform in two years.Disneyhas given DramaBox a spot in its selective accelerator program, betting thecompanywill expand beyond werewolves and billionaire romance. Spanish-language company TelevisaUnivision is on track to release 40 telenovela shorts this year on its app ViX, with another 100 for 2026. Paramount Skydance promoted its studio filmRegretting Youvia ReelShort and isworkingwith the company to cross-pollinate material. Lionsgate and Hallmark arereportedly doing the same.This is not Hollywood’s first crack at short-form content. Companies from Netflix to Sundance TV haveexperimented with premium short-form– often, glossy episodes south of 15 minutes – for the better part of a decade. You may recall thespectacular bellyflop that was Quibi, the “quick bite” platform founded by the DreamWorks Animation co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman thatlaunchedin spring 2020 with high-budget series, A-list talent and $1.75bn in funding – only to fold within six months. (Its content sold to Roku for a mere $100m.)But industry veterans are betting that things are different this time. For one, TikTok viewing habits are far more entrenched now than in 2020. And Hollywood, as a place and industry, is “going through a real moment of transition”, said Natalie Jarvey, an entertainment journalist forthe Anklerwho hasclosely trackedthe rise ofmicrodrama production in Los Angeles. From executives to directors, writers to crew, “there are a lot of people who’ve been squeezed out of jobs,” she said. “Everyone is searching for the silver bullet – what’s going to save Hollywood? What’s going to bring jobs back?”The answer could be a $75,000 short-form filmed over a couple of days and released within weeks. “A lot of people who’ve worked for a long time in movies and TV to start to consider, well, maybe I could go work for a microdrama or I could make one myself,” said Jarvey. “It’s offering a glimmer of hope for a lot of people in this town right now.”I hate this TV series I’m binge-watching, yet I’m on track to complete all 177 episodes. Why am I doing it? | Imogen West-KnightsRead moreThe barren labor landscape in Los Angeles was one major consideration for Anthony Zuiker, the creator of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, to begin writing microdramas for Block’s GammaTime. “I have a lot of people that I love that can’t find work,” he said. Microdrama production is entirely non-union, swift and cheap – the budget for most shows hovers around $100,000 total – but it is work and it can be lucrative, with some actorsminting six-figure careersvirtually overnight. (Last month, Sag-Aftra, the major actors’ union,proposeda contract to allow microdrama companies to employ union actors for rock-bottom minimum rates – $250 a day for lead performers, $164 for everyone else – plus provisions for overtime, pension and health contributions, and standard protections for stunts and sex scenes. The deal has not been finalized.)Zuiker is betting on microdramas’ potential to circumvent some longstanding structural issues with traditional entertainment. For one, the protracted timelines of film and TV production, which often stretches into the years even when things go smoothly. With microdramas, “you can write an hour movie in a couple of days, shoot for five days, and then have it on a platform in 10 days.” Zuiker has already written four bite-ified movies for GammaTime, which launched this fall with 20 titles spanning true crime, thriller and romantic melodrama.And as traditional film and TV continues to lose younger viewers to YouTube and TikTok, microdramas could court new audiences with its “freemium” model – a chunk of episodes for free, then additional ones unlocked from a few cents to a few dollars via in-app “coins” like money in a slot machine. As a writer, “I have to understand where this is going and not just ignore it,” said Zuiker. “I see the failed broadcast model. I know the challenges of streaming and cable. This is becoming something that’s getting some momentum. Why wouldn’t I want to be in this space?”That space comes with a host of pitfalls, not least of all the bare-bones budget. Though Zuiker has embraced the challenge of taking “high-end scripts and figuring out a way with paltry budgets, thin access to top-tier talent, thin access to top-tier directors, and making that all work for someone to say, ‘this is worthy of me paying for it,” he’s still working on the question: “how do we do premium so it’s not so awful?” A writer has less than two minutes to establish characters, stakes and a reason to keep watching. “Organically, I’m trying to figure out the rhythm of the writing, because I think that’s the only way this will sustain,” said Zuiker. “The more we flip on TikTok, the more we’re going to want to watch movies like that on TikTok. But there has to be constructive narratives.”There’s also the challenge of audience, somehow at once vast, fractured and siloed. Though mobile-friendly suggests a youthful customer base, the current US microdrama audience skews heavily female and over 45. Thus it’s still an open question whether the US microdrama business will expand beyond, as Bloomberg’s Lucas Shaw put in on industry insider podcastThe Town, “soft-core porn” for young women, or whether higher-budget shorts, a la Quibi, can compete with the quick and cheap and free. “Everyone who’s making microdramas is looking to raise the bar,” said Jarvey. “The question is how to balance increasing the production value a little bit, bringing on some more well-known talent with not kind of losing what makes them microdramas. Because if suddenly you’re increasing the budget significantly, then it starts to look a lot more like a Quibi.”As in Hollywood at large, some are betting on generative AI, which GammaTime uses to suggest storylines based on viewer habits, though not to actually write the material — “the hook writing, we have a respect for and appreciation of. And cliffhanger writing, too, is human-led,” said Block, but “the concepts of decision making can be AI, demand-driven.” (The company counts Slava Mudrykh, former head of Google Gaming, as a co-founder, along with Quibi’s Alex Montalvo as chief content officer.) Others, such as Zuiker, as more hesitant – “I think when that data drives the creative, it can be problematic,” he said.‘Less high school, more horror film’: why is teen drama so miserable now?Read moreBlock foresees microdramas as a mode of entertainment unto themselves, with their own star ecosystems. (Fairly or not, Cosmo has alreadydeclaredNick Skonberg, of Loving My Brother’s Best Friend, to be the first “superstar” of the “vertical movie industry”.) He likened his efforts with GammaTime to those of Samuel Z Arkoff, the 1960s pioneer of independent, low-budget, youth-focused genre films – Beach Blanket Bingo, I Was A Teenage Werewolf and the like – as the old Hollywood studio system collapsed.Hollywood again finds itself at a moment of significant upheaval – shifting viewer tastes and habits, increasingly mobile audiences,rapidly consolidating corporate power. In these shifting sands, microdramas could fundamentally alter how western audiences consume serialized storytelling. Zuiker predicted that in a matter of years, microdramas will “be every bit at the forefront of consumption that streaming once was, that cable once was, that broadcast once was”. Short-term, it’s “bad acting, salacious, hokey titles, billionaire’s mistress”, but “in the long term, it’ll be premium content written for the device, where the optimal experience of the flip is so enticing you can’t stop.”Jarvey was more measured. “I think of it as what soap operas are to prestige entertainment,” she said. “I don’t think anyone who works in microdramas would say that they’re trying to compete with a Sunday night HBO drama.” (Indeed, Block does not.) “But they are trying to find that sliver of time in your day where maybe you want something that’s a little bit faster to consume, or something that’s going to hook you and keep you scrolling.”What microdramas are still missing is a true, bona fide hit – something that escapes social media containment and reaches the majority of US audiences who probably still have not heard of the format. Something that gets and keeps the attention of skeptics. A show like Loving My Brother’s Best Friend that actually becomes aviral successlike The Summer I Turned Pretty. But those in the space assure that it is still too early to judge whether microdramas are a sea change or, like many short-form initiatives before it, a passing, tech-hyped fad. “If you want to go in with a critical eye and tear apart these vertical shorts at this stage, you’ll have a field day. It’s easy to do that,” Zuiker cautioned me. They’re not going to be good, breakout hits, he said, without some more R&D, money and, perhaps, institutional support. “This is a new thing – we need to get behind this and find this so we can employ more people, tell better stories, and have an industry.”“We are learning so much more every movie,” he added. “It’s all very TBD.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionUS televisionUS television industryTelevision industrySocial mediaDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The welcome is warm, the hot chocolate is decadent and the hotel building, bedecked with giant baubles, looks like a greetings card painting. But wait! Threatening music? Characters staring anxiously into space, because they clearly have a big dark secret? A guest in a witness protection programme, and another who recognises her as the witness in the forthcoming trial of his secret mafia brother?Attenzione!This Italian-made Green, Red and White Lotus might not be such a paradise. Bad stuff is about to go down.Specifically, the bad stuff is several thousand tons of snow and the thing it’s about to go down is the side of a nearby mountain. One avalanche later and, with frozen rocks blocking the tunnel that’s the only access to the valley – which we know on account of someone driving through it earlier and remarking “This tunnel is the only access to the valley” – everyone in the hotel is stuck there for the festive season, cut off from the outside world. Who lives? Who dies? Who chills in the bar with a grappa and a plate of carne salada, patiently waiting for help to arrive? Nobody, is the answer to that last question – they’re all too busy with their shady hidden agendas.View image in fullscreenBuffeted by events … Stranded.Photograph: Channel 4Alongside the possibility of one guest murdering another to protect the Camorra crime family that his regular domestic family don’t know they belong to, we have a girl in a coma, a teen love triangle, a police officer who doesn’t feel she is cut out for this job but will have to step up sharpish, a bartender too kind to be true, a potential new owner of the hotel, a guest who is in it just enough to make sure we know he exists, and a crabby old guy in a nearby cabin who is hostile to visitors. When a dead body turns up that can’t be explained by the mafia-hit storyline and then a child is found in the woods, half-dead and unable to speak Italian, truly we have a banquet of melodrama to feast on – a soapy melange of Agatha Christie, Lost and one of those cathartic sagas where rich people have a hellish time on a luxury holiday.Is it enough to fill eight episodes? Not really. With so many elements in its makeup, Stranded isn’t sure which one to lean into hardest, and doesn’t have the high camp chaos that could carry it through the script’s dead spots if it were willing to take itself less seriously.Flashbacks to the characters’ lives before they entered this frigid purgatory explain why everyone looks so shifty and sad, while tantalisingly failing to dispel the suspicion that any of them might kill to stop their failures being revealed. But we’re always back to the hotel too quickly for any of the individual narratives to gain enough heft – although travelling to Naples, Rome and Marseille isn’t that much of a hardship.There are even sprinklings of the supernatural in the first episode when a reindeer apparently kills itself and in the finale’s very last moments. These hold viewers to ransom and demand a second season – in Italy, where Stranded was a hit, it got one – just so that we can find out what in the freezing blazes just happened.

As it is, if it doesn’t hold your attention you can pick up the gist fairly easily when you lock back in. And if you do maintain concentration you’re presented with a perfectly serviceable drama led with anguished panache by Alessandro Preziosi as Giovanni Lo Bianco – AKA the ordinary, mild-mannered guy with hidden Mafia connections – whose impeccable knitwear and confident Jürgen Klopp-esque beard mask a growing desperation that Preziosi embodies with skill.We have seen Euro-dramas with greater sophistication than Stranded and we’ve certainly seen plenty of foreign crime shows with meatier mysteries to solve, but as a holiday from your regular Christmas drama fare, this Italian escape is diverting enough.Stranded is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTV crime dramaDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

Commissioned by the Royal Opera, and based on the movie and stage play of the same name by Thomas Vinterberg,Festenwas Mark-Anthony Turnage’s fifth large-scale opera, and showed vividly how the sure dramatic instincts revealed in his earliest stage works, Greek and The Silver Tassie, have matured into an operatic language of immense power and flexibility. Not a word of Lee Hall’s libretto is wasted in revealing the dark family secrets that are exposed at a 60th birthday party, while Turnage’s wonderfully varied, unsparing score never makes a false step. The horror of the drama was remorselessly focused by Richard Jones’s production, with a cast in which every role was made horribly believable. The best British opera in half a century? Probably.Andrew ClementsBeethoven with a riot of colour and freshnessSome highlights are more predictable than others. The Australian Chamber Orchestra has now been wowing audiences for half a century, with Richard Tognetti its maverick leader for 35 years. But not even that track record could prepare me for the raw vitality of theACO’s latest UK outing at the Barbican in Marchwith a programme of Bach, Shostakovich and Gubaidulina. The concert began as these world-class string players were still walking on, their balance of technical control and creative freedom utterly gripping from the first contact of bow on string. A few months later, the Aldeburgh festival provided my year’s most memorable discovery, when the Gildas Quartet premieredColin Matthews’ String Quartet No 6alongside Bridge’s Three Idylls and Beethoven’s third “Razumovsky” quartet. It’s the latter that has stayed with me above all – such a riot of colour and intense freshness that it felt like another first performance.Flora WillsonInvigorating Janáček and spellbinding WagnerView image in fullscreenMagical touches: Die Walküre, in Barrie Kosky’s staging, at the Royal Opera House.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianI’ve had some great evenings in the Royal Opera House this year. By the time I caught up with Festen I had heard glowing things about it from all directions, and I was not disappointed. Katie Mitchell’s production ofJanáček’s The Makropulos Casewas not so universally well liked, but to my eyes her reimagining of the story was invigorating: I found myself firmly rooting for the centuries-old anti-heroine, as sung by Ausrine Stundyte, and thrilling to the orchestral sound – Jakub Hrůša’s tenure as the company’s music director is off to a good start. And in May the orchestra played wonderfully for their previous boss, Antonio Pappano, when he returned forDie Walküre, the second instalment of Wagner’s Ring cycle. There are magical touches to Barrie Kosky’s staging, not least the spellbinding omnipresence of elderly Erda, the earth goddess. I can’t wait for Siegfried in March to see what will happen to her next.Erica JealHonouring Palestrina and PärtPictures of violinist Carolin Widmann, recently forced by airline staff tofly clutching her precious Guadaganini wrapped in a sweateron her lap, its empty case in the hold, were hardly credible. They were nevertheless a potent reminder for me of Widmann’s stunning playing – on this very instrument – of her brother Jörg’s violin concertoin the BBCNOW concertthat he conducted. A truly exhilarating performance.At St George’s, Bristol, theTallis Scholars’concert celebrating Palestrina’s 500th anniversary and Arvo Pärt’s 90th birthday, a model of clarity and elegant line, was one of two standout choral programmes.I Fagiolini, in the other, honoured Orazio Benevoli, wonderfully resonant and maximising the venue’s lovely acoustic.Pianist Tamara Stefanovich’s virtuosity in contemporary and 19th-century repertoire is unquestionable, so her Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama recital of music by the Bach family – Johann Sebastian, Carl Philipp Emmanuel and Johann Christian – was unusual, and authoritative and memorable.Rian EvansBlistering ShostakovichView image in fullscreenThe finest orchestra on the planet? Iván Fischer conducts the Budapest festival orchestra at this year’s BBC Proms.Photograph: Andy ParadiseThere was a real sense of freshness and innovation in the air this year. Southbank Centre’s inauguralMultitudes festivalproved a stimulating mix of artistic cross-fertilisation. The London Philharmonic Orchestra collaborated with Australia’s Circa for a death-defyingacrobatic take on Ravel’s Daphnis et Chloé, while Vasily Petrenko’s blistering account ofShostakovich’s Leningrad Symphonywas complemented by thought-provoking imagery from art director Kirill Serebrennikov and video artist Ilya Shagalov.On stage, Annilese Miskimmon’s searingly honest production ofJake Heggie’s Dead Man Walkingwas, remarkably, the work’s first full professional staging in the UK. English National Opera fielded an outstanding cast led by Christine Rice who brought enormous emotional reserves to Sister Helen Prejean, the nun at the centre of this tale of truth, love, compassion and redemption. Finally,Iván Fischer and the Budapest festival orchestrademonstrated why they are perhaps the finest orchestra on the planet playing, Beethoven and Bartók at this year’s BBC Proms.Clive PagetSomehow, the genius for creativity in performance survivesSimon Rattle says classical music is in “a long-term fight for existence”. It certainly is. Yet despite Arts Council England’s war on excellence in the name of its curdled theory of anti-elitism, the genius for creativity in performance somehow survives. In February, Regents Opera staged acompelling Wagner Ring cyclein an east London boxing hall with reduced forces and a slashed back orchestra of 22 under Ben Woodward. In November, the no less indomitableGothic Operarescued Offenbach’s Die Rheinnixen, containing much music that would resurface in the Tales of Hoffmann. Both were triumphs of talent, commitment and resourcefulness. Both overcame endless practical challenges. Neither of them got a penny from ACE coffers. “We’ll do it because we’re compelled to do it,”wrote Woodward. Heroic words. Musicians across the UK continue to create marvels amid the prevailing political and societal philistinism. But they – and the universal need for live music– deserve so much better.Martin KettleExplore more on these topicsClassical music2025 in cultureMark-Anthony TurnagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I do remember a book of dirty jokes I was obsessed with at the age of eight. I was convinced it was off limits to me (it wasn’t) and so I waited until my parents were at work to shamefully steal it from the bookshelf. One time, my mother found it under my pillow and I wasmortified.I recall her being confused and putting it back with a mumbled “I don’t judge” as she left the room.My favourite book growing upThat must have been one of Thea Beckman’s novels, most likely Hasse Simonsdochter. Beckman wastheauthor for young adults in 80s and 90s Netherlands.She wrote these gorgeous, rich novels about teenagers forced into adulthood at a young age. Some people might know Crusade in Jeans – the story of a 15-year-old boy in the 70s who is accidentally transported back in time to the 13th century and ends up leading a children’s crusade ... in jeans. Amazing.The book that changed me as a teenagerThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. I grew up in the alien boom of the 90s, when every other week there were UFO sightings and all the adults in my life were talking about The X-Files. It was very scary to me. It was my dad who gave me a copy of Douglas Adams’s book. He’d loved it when he was young. It worked like exposure therapy, if exposure therapy also means making the thing you’re most afraid of (aliens) ridiculous (Zaphod Beeblebrox).The writer who changed my mindI was very certain for a good chunk of my youth that when I hit adulthood I’d get a nose job. I’d done the research, I knew how much it would cost, the recovery time, everything. I was 19 when Nathan Englander’sThe Ministry of Special Casescame out; a devastating tragicomedy following a couple looking for their disappeared son during Argentina’s “Dirty War” in 1976. There’s a scene in that novel where the desperate parents stand before a soldier with a photograph of their son, and the soldier notes that he looks nothing like them – a different face, a different nose. This hits so intensely because the book opens with a series of events that lead to both parents getting a nose job, a barter-type payment in exchange for a service. I was heartbroken over it for weeks. I had thought the trade-off would be worth it – a stereotyped marker of my heritage in exchange for a more normative beauty standard, a less obvious way of existing – and then I read Englander’s novel and decided it was not.The book that made me want to be a writerAs a teenager, I typed Jonathan Safran Foer a very earnest letter announcing that I had readEverything Is Illuminatedand that now I, too, would be a writer!The bookI came back toI was 20 and breathing fire, desperately looking for myself in literature, which meant I eviscerated every novel I came across that didn’t reflect myself back at me. Alan Hollinghurst’sThe Line of Beautyisn’t about young queer Jewish women in the Netherlands. It is, however, gorgeous and layered and full of desire – and it’s subtle. Not fit for someone who is making their way through it with a machete. Notably, though, there were scenes in that novel that stayed with me for years. I returned to it, and to all of Hollinghurst’s work, in my late 20s, and was very happy to find I was wrong. I’m a huge fan, now. I’ve givenThe Sparsholt Affairto nearly everyone I know. I had the immense pleasure of meeting Alan this year, and was too flustered and confused in the moment to tell him how much I love his work, and what it’s meant to me. He, far more composed, had read mine, and kindly told me he’d enjoyed it. I very nearly died.The book I rereadI love returning to Zadie Smith’sChanging My Mind.I first read it as an undergrad in comparative literature, as someone whose entire life revolved around the analysis of other people’s novels, and so it was the essays that unpacked others’ writing that shaped my own approach to analysis. When I started publishing my own work, my interest shifted to her essays on writing, the process of creating, editing, returning to one’s work. Every time I dive back into that collection, I find myself drawn to a different essay, and that tells me a lot about the state of mind I am in – whether I feel myself more a reader or a writer.The book I could never read againJames Baldwin’sGiovanni’s Room.I read it in one sitting, on a six-hour train ride to Berlin, and was almost beside myself by the time we rolled into theHauptbahnhof. That kind of devastation can only be felt once.The book I discovered later in lifeWhen we first started dating, my girlfriend told me that the author who most shaped her as a reader and a writer was Elizabeth Strout. She gave me her copy ofMy Name Is Lucy Barton. I fell in love twice over: once with the book, and once with her.The book I am currently readingThe incomparable Zadie Smith’s latest essay collection,Dead and Alive.It’s been my entire personality over the past few weeks.My comfort readAusten.

I probably knew every frame as well as Walt Disney himself, who invested 20 years in bringing it to the screen.The culmination of his live action achievements, Mary Poppins remained the project Walt was most proud of. A sophisticated, multi-Oscar-winning musical that proved the House of Mouse was about more than just cartoons, its box office success enabled him to expand his Florida ambitions for Disney World resort and shore up the company’s financial future.But what was its secret formula? Here, Disney historian and podcaster Todd James Pierce methodically reveals the mechanics behind the magic. His accessible and slightly scholarly tome invites us to view the beloved movie, not through its star,Julie Andrews(then nervously making her Oscar-winning screen debut, aged 29), but through its unsung heroes. Really, it is a biography by stealth of Bob and Dick Sherman, the songwriting duo who redefined the Disney sound with hits including It’s a Small World (After All), one of the most performed songs of all time.‘Do you know what a nanny is? Disney asked the brothers. “Yeah, a goat,” Bob Sherman repliedThe immigrant sons of a Kyiv-born musician, the Shermans were jobbing LA songwriters when their work caught the ears of Walt Disney. For reasons Pierce never fully probes, Walt soon tasks “the boys” (as he called them), who had never developed a screenplay before, with realising his long-cherished Poppins project. Working directly from PL Travers’s book (ie, with no script or treatment) the Shermans composed tunes, then strung them together to construct an entirely new, cinematically satisfying narrative out of what was originally a book of interconnected short stories about a magical English nanny.“Do you know what a nanny is?” Disney asked the brothers. “Yeah, a goat,” Bob Sherman replied. No wonder there was such a culture gap with the formidable Travers, who was horrified at the Disneyfication of her spiky creation. In her book, Mary Poppins is a far less attractive figure who, rather than sing lullabies about feeding the birds, suggests baking them into pies. Resistant to Disney’s charms and many of his team’s suggestions (“She didn’t like anything we wrote … she chopped us apart,” said Bob), Travers had a list of demands that needed to be met before she would relinquish the Poppins movie rights. They ranged from dictating that all the cast were British (she didn’t get her way withDick Van Dyke– disappointingly, his notorious cockney accent barely gets a mention here), to making Walt “promise me there will be no colour red in the motion picture”.Her eccentric clash with the Disney is brilliantly and movingly realised in Saving Mr Banks (2013). Starring Emma Thompson as Travers and Tom Hanks as Disney, it makes the ideal, more emotive companion piece to Pierce’s dutifully researched account.However, where Pierce is rather lacking in curiosity, wonder or the desire to tell a high-stakes story – odd for a man so immersed in all things Disney – he is strong on the collaborative nitty-gritty of such a major adaptation. Many “making of” details will be familiar to Poppins fans, such as the origins of Supercali­fragilisticexpialidocious – based on a nonsense word the Sherman brothers heard as kids at summer camp in the 1930s – and how the Sister Suffragette song was quickly cobbled together to appease actor Glynis Johns, who mistakenly thought she was being cast as Mary Poppins. (The role had been earmarked for Bette Davies, with Cary Grant in the running for Bert.) Less well-known are the “lost” sequences that featured a flying sofa and a round-the-world trip to a magical zoo (which, like several discarded elements, eventually found its way into Bedknobs and Broomsticks); and the use of sodium vapour “yellow-screen” to create the groundbreaking live action/animated crossover. A few photos would’ve been nice – this book has none.With no new interviews to draw on, either – understandable given the age of any surviving cast and crew (Dick Van Dyke turns 100 this December) – Pierce diligently trawls the Disney archives for his illuminating and comprehensive cuts job.One major question, however, remains unanswered. How did Mary Poppins pour spoonfuls of multicoloured medicine from the same bottle?! Guess it was magic after all.Making Mary Poppins by Todd James Pierce is published by WW Norton (£22).

It has the sweetness and intensity of his heartfelt late medieval visions of the birth of Christ, with tiny angels gathered in prayer around the newborn child as Mary (much bigger than the angels) kneels reverently before her baby, her god. Instead of shepherds and kings, this scene is attended by a merchant couple. Behind the stable is a north European winter’s night, with leafless trees visible in the darkness.The winter trees and tiny angels are typical of Van der Goes and can also be seen in his huge, enfoldingAdoration of the Shepherds in the Uffizi, Florence. You can see from this rough copy and the Uffizi’s masterpiece how magical his Nativity at Night must have been. But his artistic excellence came at a cost. A heavy workload and international fame put his mind under strain: he also seems to have been afflicted by religious guilt and a terror of hell. He became ill and was cared for in a monastery, where the abbot reportedly tried to cure him with music. A later north European artist,Van Gogh, was haunted by the madness of Van der Goes, who was one of the earliest artists whose inner sufferings became famous – but he left us images of peace and hope in midwinter.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get intouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As Willa, the teenage daughter of former revolutionaries, she was called on to do shoot-outs, car chases, karate, and to hold her own against heavyweights like Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Benicio del Toro and Regina Hall. “My whole life has literally changed in the last six months,” she says.Tell ushow you got this role? Was there a giant karate tournament where you had to defeat all your rivals?No, thank God. I did six months of auditioning for the film while I was working on my first project, Presumed Innocent. So I was in California when I sent in my first self-tape. And about a month after that, the casting director called me and was like: “Hey,Paul Thomas Andersonwould love to do an in-person callback, and it’s going to be a chemistry read with Leonardo DiCaprio and Regina Hall.” And so after that, I had in-person auditioning, callbacks, chemistry reads and camera tests, and then I had four days of intensive karate training, private lessons and group classes. Paul came to watch the final one, and then after that, he told me I’d got the part.Were you fazed at all to be acting opposite such established names?I was definitely freaking out the first time that they told me. And I called my parents right away, and I was like: “Mom, I’m about to meet Leo DiCaprio and Regina Hall tomorrow.” So they were freaking out too, even more than me. Once I got there, on the day, I was like: “OK, I came here to do my job, and I’m gonna make sure that I’m doing right by myself and my scene partners.” Standing in front of DiCaprio, the facade kind of fades the second that they call “Action”. Also he’s such a kind person, and really funny. So even the first time I met him, it was really easy to drop in from the start.View image in fullscreenInfiniti in One Battle After Another.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyA lot of themen in this story are pretty dysfunctional, and a lot of the women are incredibly powerful. Didthey look out for you?Even before we started filming, Regina was like: “If you ever need anybody here, let me know.” I took her up on that. She’s just such a special person and such a genuine human being, and I love her very much.You get to do so much in this movie – shoot-outs, car chases – what was your favourite bit?Getting to do all those sequences has been one of my dreams for so long because I love action films. So I was so excited to race a car and to do a little fight sequence and to use firearms on camera. But one of the scenes I was the most excited to do reading the script for the first time was when Lockjaw [Sean Penn] and Willa first meet in that church at the Sisterhood of the Brave Beaver. I was so excited to do that scene, and then getting to see it on the big screen, I felt nothing but pride.The story deals with themes of racism and racial hatred. Was that difficult to negotiate, as a mixed race person?Unfortunately, they’re not themes that are so strange to me, given the state of the world – who I am, where I am, and how I look. But thanks to Paul, and also to Sean and the entire crew, I was given a space where I could feel comfortable to face it head-on and not be fearful. I was bringing from my personal experience, and a lot of it, [Anderson] was like: just bring what you think of Willa, because youareWilla. He completely entrusted her over to me, which I’m so grateful for now.She’s pretty fearless for a 16-year-old. What were you like at that age?Me at 16? I was scared. I had a really hard time figuring out where I fitted in. But the only place I really felt like I belonged was in theatre and performing. That was one place where I could completely lose myself and feel at home and at peace in a way that I never had felt before. I went to a school for musical theatre [in Indianapolis]. That’s where I really started to learn the importance of an ensemble, and working as a team, because no performance is individual.You must get asked to explain your name a lot.I love explaining it! I love my parents very much, and they spent a lot of time on my name. My first name comes from Batman Forever – I’m named after Nicole Kidman’s character Chase Meridian. And then my middle name, because Infiniti is my middle name [her surname is Payne], that comes from Toy Story, when Buzz Lightyear says: “To infinity and beyond.” My parents definitely love the movies.What’s next for you?I just finished filming the sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale called The Testaments [she plays Agnes, daughter of Elisabeth Moss’s character June]. So I got to dive into Gilead, which is really cool, but you’re seeing a new corner of it.What wasyourfavourite film of the year – apart fromOne Battle After Another?I absolutely loved Sinners. I am going to go rewatch it around Christmas. I think that movie is so special, getting to see people that look like you on the screen with an incredible story like that, and you just feel how much love and effort Ryan Coogler put into it.This article was amended on 19 December 2025.

In her studio, she used the same medical instruments to make art that surprises to this dayElise MortonFri 19 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 03.31 ESTShareEdita Schubert lived a double life. For more than three decades, the late Croatian artist worked at the Institute of Anatomy at the University of Zagreb’s medical faculty, meticulously drawing dissected human bodies for surgical textbooks. In her studio, she made art that resisted every attempt at categorisation – often using the very same tools.“She was producing these really precise, technical illustrations which were used in medical textbooks,” says David Crowley, curator of a new retrospective of Schubert’s work at Muzeum Susch, in eastern Switzerland. “She was right in the middle of that practice … She was totally unfazed about being in dissections.” Her anatomical drawings, notes Marika Kuźmicz, the museum’s curator, are still published in handbooks for medical students in Croatia today.View image in fullscreenDual vocation … one of Edita Schubert’s anatomical drawings, showing the surgical anatomy of head and neck.Photograph: Edita SchubertSchubert’s dual vocation wasn’t unusual for Yugoslav artists, who rarely had access to a commercial art market. But the way these two worlds bled into each other was. The scalpels she used to make clean incisions in cadavers became instruments for slicing canvas, the medical tape meant for wound dressing held her perforated artworks together, and the test tubes typically reserved for laboratory samples became vessels for her autobiography.In the early 1970s, Schubert was still working within the confines of traditional painting – meticulous, hyperrealistic still lifes in oil and acrylic of sweets (Kandit, 1973) and salt and sugar shakers (Salt and Sugar, 1973). But frustration had been building since her student days at Zagreb’s Academy of Fine Arts, where she’d been forced to paint nudes. “I had to plunge the knife into the canvas, it simply got on my nerves, that taut surface on which I had to talk about something, with my brush, what’s more,” she later told art historian Leonida Kovač, one of the few people she ever granted an interview, “I stabbed the knife into the canvas instead of the brush.”In 1977, that urge took literal form. Schubert produced eleven large canvases, painting each one a blue monochrome before taking a medical scalpel and making hundreds of deliberate, precise cuts. She then folded back the sliced fabric to reveal its reverse, creating works she documented with forensic precision, dating each one to underscore that they were actions, even performances. In one 1977 series of photographs, entitled Self-Portrait Behind a Perforated Canvas, she pushed her face, hair, and fingers through the perforations, turning her own body into artistic material.View image in fullscreenKandit, 1973.Photograph: Marina Paulenka/Edita SchubertKovač, who became close friends with Schubert, heard the artist’s own explanation of these works. When asked about their meaning, Schubert replied: “Yes, all my art has a character of dissection … dissection like an evening nude.” For Kovač, this was a revelation – a clue from an artist who rarely explained herself.Croatian critics have tended to treat Schubert’s two lives as entirely separate: the experimental avant garde artist on one side, the medical illustrator who paid the bills on the other. “My opinion since then has been that those two personalities were deeply, deeply connected,” Kovač explains. “You can’t work for 35 years in the Institute of Anatomy from eight in the morning until three in the afternoon and not be influenced by what you see there.”View image in fullscreenEdita Schubert with her artwork ‘Red Machine’, ca. 1983.Photograph: Marijan SusovskiWhat makes the Muzeum Susch exhibition particularly revelatory is how it traces these medical undercurrents through works that, at first glance, seem entirely abstract. In the mid-1980s, Schubert produced a series of geometric paintings – trapeziums, as they came to be known – that Yugoslav critics lumped into the fashionable neo-geo movement. But Kovač discovered the truth only years later, when cataloguing Schubert’s estate.“I asked her, how do you produce the trapeziums?” Kovač recalls. “And she told me, it’s very simple, it’s a human face.” Those characteristic colours – what colleagues called “Schubert red” and “Schubert blue” – were the exact shades she’d been using to illustrate the two main arteries of the neck for a surgical anatomy textbook used across European medical faculties. “I realised that those two colours […] appeared at the same time,” Kovač explains. The geometric abstractions were, in fact, highly stylised human bodies – painted while she worked on anatomical illustrations by day.In the late 70s and early 80s, Schubert’s practice took another turn. She began creating installations from branches bound with leather, collections of bone, petals, spices and ash arranged on floors. When Kovač asked why she’d shifted to such organic materials, Schubert explained that art “was completely desiccated in the concept”, and she felt compelled to transgress – to work with actual decaying material as a response to art that had metaphorically withered.One work from 1979, 100 Roses, saw her strip a hundred roses of their petals, weaving the stems into circles on the ground with the leaves and petals arranged inside. When Crowley encountered the work while preparing the exhibition, it still held its power – the leaves and petals now completely dried out but miraculously intact.. “You can still smell the roses,” he marvels. “The colour is still there.”View image in fullscreen‘You can still smell them’ … 100 Roses, 1979.Photograph: Edita Schubert“I always want to be mysterious, not to reveal what I’m doing,” Schubert confided to Kovač during one of their filmed conversations in her final year. Mystery was her method. She would, Kovač learned, sometimes exhibit fake works while hiding originals under her bed. She destroyed certain drawings, leaving only signed photocopies in their place. Despite exhibiting at the Venice Biennale and Biennale of Sydney in 1982, and being celebrated as the “first lady of Croatian avant garde,” she gave almost no interviews and her work remained largely unknown outside Yugoslavia. The Muzeum Susch exhibition is her first major solo show outside Croatia.Then came the 1990s, and the Yugoslav Wars brought violence to Zagreb itself. Schubert responded with a series of collages, pasting newspaper photographs and text directly on to board, photocopying and enlarging them, then painting over everything in acrylic – black bars resembling barcodes, geometric forms obscuring the images beneath. One work depicts the siege of Vukovar, that city’s devastation partially veiled by a motif resembling piano keys painted in black across the surface.View image in fullscreenWar Image, 1991.Photograph: Marina Paulenka/Edita Schubert“The uncertainty of the period, together with the continuous reports of destruction and loss, placed her in a difficult position between her artistic pursuit and the rapidly changing world around her,” recalls her sister, Marina. “In some of her works, she responded by partially veiling the wartime newspaper reports through her interventions, layering her own visual language over the stark realities of the time.”Painting over photographs of war might seem like obscuring or denying a harrowing reality, but it’s also a way of slowing down the viewer, forcing them to lean in and look closely at what might otherwise be consumed as media spectacle. Kuźmicz notes that Schubert’s approach reflects how many female artists engaged with the conflict – not by depicting battles or military actors, but by exploring war’s psychological aftermath.The final rooms chart Schubert’s confrontation with a different kind of violence. Diagnosed with colon cancer in 1997, she made Biography(1997-98) – five groups of glass test tubes filled with photographs spanning her childhood, travels, artworks, anatomical drawings from medical manuals, and self-portraits titled Phony Smile, showing her hairless from treatment. Her last installation, Horizons (2000), invited viewers to step inside circular panoramas of places she loved: Zagreb, the Croatian island of Vir, Paris and Venice among others.These final works feel like a protest against being medicalised – a prolongation of her life and memories beyond the clinical gaze she’d spent decades wielding herself. After years of anatomising others, Schubert refused to be reduced to a medical case. She declined further treatment, fully aware of the consequences.Walking through the exhibition’s 12 galleries, you encounter what seems like several different artists – radical shifts occurring every few years. Perhaps that’s exactly how Schubert wanted it. Even now, decades after her death, she remains elusive.Edita Schubert: Profusion,Muzeum Susch, Switzerland, until 17 May 2026.Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingCroatiaSculpturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

And everyone is attached to their own traditions, whether that’s the apple tart Matthew Ryle’s family loves in place of Christmas pudding, the hot chocolate-and marshmallow kit Yotam Ottolenghi’s kids can never resist, or Sabrina Ghayour’s favourite truffle-infused cheddar.‘In Italy, smoked salmon without Russian salad wasn’t Christmas’Giorgio LocatelliView image in fullscreenLocatelli’s smoked salmon with Russian salad and olive oil.“From a very young age, I helped out in my family’s restaurant in Lombardy every Christmas Day,” says Giorgio Locatelli. “And when we finished at five o’clock in the afternoon, everyone would go to the local pastry shop, because it was the biggest place and we would all have a meal there.” There was always smoked salmon. Today, if Locatelli is asked to bring food to a Christmas gathering, he takessalmon made by the Smokin’ Brothers(£8.90,smokin-brothers.com). “It is unbelievably good – the three brothers are very careful about sourcing quality fish.” He likes to serve it withRussian salad. “In Italy, smoked salmon without Russian salad wasn’t Christmas.” His base ingredients are always cooked potatoes, peas and carrots dressed in mayo. “But it’s versatile: you can add chicken, you can make it with pumpkin, you can make it vegan. I like to drain large gherkins to get rid of the vinegar, and then dice them into it.” He would never go to someone’s house without a bottle of his ownolive oil(£25 for 500ml,shop.nationalgallery.org.uk)for the host. “Olive oil is such a good present, because it lasts. When they’re using it in February, they will remember you.”Giorgio Locatelli’snew restaurantis at the National Gallery in London‘Jamon is my tradition – my mum is 92 and has a slice every day’José PizarroView image in fullscreenPizarro’s leg of jamon.“It is my tradition to take awhole leg of jamonto my mum’s house,” says chef José Pizarro, who grew up in Extremadura, Spain. “My mum is 92 and she has a slice of jamon every day. A leg weighs about 8kg, and in five days, between the 13 of us, it will be gone.” It’s £690.50 for a whole leg (£26.50 for 70g,shop.josepizarro.com); try Waitrose’s Jamon Iberico de Bellota (£14.55 for 100g,waitrose.com) for a budget option.View image in fullscreenTurrón (left) and Matusalem.Photograph: Steven Joyce/The GuardianView image in fullscreenValdespino Inocente (left) and Tio Pepe fino.Photograph: Steven Joyce/The Guardian“Another thing I always, always take to Christmas,” says Pizarro, “is sherry. As an aperitif I love,Tio Pepe fino(£12.75,thewhiskyexchange.com), or for something a little more expensive,Valdespino Inocente(£20.95,leaandsandeman.co.uk), which is also a fino and is aged for 10 years under a layer of yeast called flor, so it’s very dry. And then I loveMatusalem(£28.95,thewhiskyexchange.com), which is a blend of pedro ximénez sherry and oloroso. Since it is sweet and nutty, it goes very well with turrón, a Spanish version ofnougat made with almonds(£9.25 for 125g,brindisa.com).”Jose Pizarro’s latest restaurant isLoloinLondon SE1‘My sons make a beeline for hot chocolate’Yotam Ottolenghi“It’s helpful to have easy-to-rustle-up snacks and treats over the holidays that still feel special,” says Yotam Ottolenghi. “For a quick canape, I brushcocktail sausages with mysticky date and tamarind sauce(£4.75,ottolenghi.co.uk). It makes them glossy and tangy. I always make a big batch ofspiced nuts: 100g cashews, 100g macadamias, 120g pecans, 60g skin-on almonds and 80g pumpkin seeds roasted at 170C (150F fan)/325F/gas 3 for 15 minutes with a tablespoon of sunflower seeds, two of nigella seeds, three of sunflower oil, two of honey, a teaspoon of fine salt and the leaves from two sprigs of rosemary.

While they’re busy with that, I’ll be experimenting with a cocktail fromAlice Lascelles’ bookThe Cocktail Edit (£18.98, Quadrille) – her recipes have just the right mix of classic and playful. Once I have had my fill, a glass ofBotivo(£27.50,widely available) and soda with a wheel of orange is there for a non-alcoholic moment.”‘A brine mix to give turkey a flavour boost’Julie Lin“I like to take something people will use,” says Scottish-Malaysian chef Julie Lin. “I’ve been making adry turkey brine mixto give to friends in advance: three tablespoons of salt, one tablespoon of MSG, one tablespoon of sugar, one tablespoon of black pepper, one teaspoon of garlic powder, one teaspoon of onion powder, a sprig of rosemary, chopped finely, and one teaspoon of smoked paprika. Then I put it in little jars with instructions for how to use it: pat the turkey dry, rub the brine under the skin and over the entire bird, including the cavity (you may not need it all). Set it on a rack and refrigerate, uncovered for 24–48 hours. (Do not rinse.) Then roast. Salt and MSG penetrate deeply, boosting moisture and flavour while the uncovered chill dries the skin for superior crispness.”View image in fullscreenFrom left: Lin’s turkey brine mix, Fettercairn whisky and Sama Sama tamarind and lemongrass sour.Lin also makesSichuan pepper chocolate truffles: tweak your favourite recipe by stirring in one teaspoon of finely ground Sichuan pepper and a pinch of salt while the mixture is still liquid. Allow to cool until just firm, then use a small spoon to scoop out bitesize servings of the ganache. Working quickly, shape into balls then roll in cocoa powder, chocolate flakes or toasted sesame. Chill. “Pop them in a tin and it’s a lovely gift to arrive with.”To drink, Lin is all about whisky and beer. “Much of the Scottish whisky industry is made up of men saying you must drink your fiery drams straight, but I’ve been giving friendswhisky from Fettercairn(£52,fettercairnwhisky.com), which is delicious and not horribly peaty. I created a tamarind and lemongrass sour with Drygate in Glasgow, calledSama Sama(£2.50 for 330ml,drygate.com).”Sama Sama: ComfortFood fromMy Malaysian-ScottishKitchenby Julie Linis out now‘This black truffle cheddar is like crack’Sabrina Ghayour“I like giving panettone, but making them from scratch is hell in a hand basket – I did it once and never again,” says chef Sabrina Ghayour. “I usually buypandoro(Muzzi, £30.99,souschef.co.uk), which don’t contain candied fruit – not everyone likes it – and, like panettone, they’re great because they last for ages and don’t steal the limelight if someone has made a wonderful cake or pudding. As a chef, the last thing I want to do is arrive with something that outshines anything else.

At Christmas, especially if you’re making something as a gesture for someone else, you don’t want to cause yourself too much faff.”View image in fullscreenFrom left: Mullen’s pomegranate and blood orange trifle, tawny port and cheese scones.First, make the jelly by boiling together 710ml pomegranate juice, two tablespoons of caster sugar, the juice of half a lemon and 12g (two sachets) of Vege-Gel. Remove from the heat and cool for 15 minutes. Slice 400g madeira cake into thin pieces, then brush with 35ml Cointreau. Use the cake to line a glass bowl big enough for the whole trifle and pour over any remaining Cointreau. Peel and slice four blood oranges, removing any pips. Arrange the slices against the glass above the cake; any that don’t fit around the sides can lay on top of the cake. Ladle the jelly over, letting it come up around the sides of the orange slices. Set in the fridge for three to four hours. Combine 750ml good-quality custard with 300g melted white chocolate then pour it over the jelly and smooth over the top. Return to the fridge for at least an hour, or until serving. When ready to serve, whip 500ml of double cream into soft peaks. Spread roughly over the custard and sprinkle with pomegranate seeds and a small handful of chopped pistachio.If she’s not cooking, Mullen pairs drinks with food as Christmas contributions, such as10-year-old tawnyport(from £25, widely available) with good-quality dark chocolate. “It’s nice to bring something as a set: I givecheese sconeswith a hunk of cheddar, some butter and a jar of quick pickled apples.” For the pickle, boil together 125ml white vinegar, two tablespoons caster sugar, a bay leaf, a cinnamon stick and 10 peppercorns, then pour over one large eating apple, peeled and thinly sliced.

She makes two traditional bakes every holiday season: avasilopita sponge cakewith a coin baked into it (“Whoever gets the coin has good luck for the year,” she says), andmelomakarona,orange spiced cookies, soaked in syrup. This is her mum’s recipe: “In a large bowl, beat 175g caster sugar with 275ml olive oil and 250g soft butter or vegan margarine. Stir in 100ml brandy together with the juice and zest of two oranges and one lemon. Sift 1kg self-raising flour with three teaspoons of baking powder and add it to the oil mixture a cupful at a time, beating well after each addition, until the mixture becomes firm and manageable. Preheat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Take a tablespoon of mixture and shape into an oval. Using your index and middle fingers, make a slight ridge along the length of each shortcake. Place on to lightly greased baking sheets spaced 2.5cm apart. Bake for 30–35 minutes (in two batches) or until risen and golden brown. Leave to cool. Place 275ml water, 75g sugar, 250ml honey and one teaspoon of whole cloves into a saucepan and boil for five minutes, removing any froth. Discard the cloves. Mix 75g chopped walnuts with two teaspoons of ground cinnamon on a large plate. Place two melomakarona at a time on a slotted spoon, dip quickly into the hot syrup, then place straight on to the walnuts. Turn to coat and shake off the excess.

Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the lentils are tender, cooked through and pass into total mush. As they cook, stir them pretty constantly to encourage them to further break down into a coarse paste (not watery or soupy). This should take 20–25 minutes. Once the lentils are the perfect dip texture, remove from the heat. Add two tablespoons of lemon juice, two tablespoons of olive oil and two cloves of garlic, grated. Season with salt, plus more lemon juice if you want. Let cool. Fry two finely sliced cloves of garlic and 10 sage leaves in two tablespoons of olive oil until crisp. Spoon the toasted garlic-herb mixture over to serve.The full lentil dip recipeappears inSomething from Nothingby Alison Roman, out now‘Chocolate salamis are perfect to snack on while watching a Christmas movie’Ixta Belfrage“I often bring things I’m well known for making,” says Ixta Belfrage, who has Mexican and Brazilian heritage. “Likepink pickled onions, which have a zingy crunch and can jazz up vegetables or go on a crostino, and work well with smoked salmon, eggs and meats. To make them, slice onions and cover in a 50/50 mixture of lime juice and tangerine juice, a generous sprinkle of salt and some dried hibiscus flowers, which turns the onions bright pink.”View image in fullscreenFrom left: Belfrage’s pickled onions, Vault non-alcoholic aperitivo, and chocolate salami.Belfrage also likes to makechocolate salamisfor friends. “They’re perfect to snack on while you watch a Christmas movie.” To make her mint chocolate salami: set a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering water on a medium-low heat. Add 90g unsalted butter, 100g mint dark chocolate and 130g milk chocolate, all chopped, and cook, stirring now and then, until melted and combined. Remove from the heat and stir in 75ml whole milk and one tablespoon of espresso coffee until smooth. Fold in 200g ginger nut biscuits, chopped, and 100g roasted salted and chopped pecans, then transfer to the fridge for 25 minutes, until cooled but not set. Get a large sheet of greaseproof paper ready, and spoon the cooled chocolate mix on to it. Use the paper to help you roll out the chocolate into a 30cm x 6cm log or salami shape. Twist the ends of the paper to enclose the mix, then put on a tray and refrigerate until set – about five hours. Remove from the fridge a few times during that period, and roll again in its wrapping, so it keeps its shape. Sift one tablespoon of icing sugar on to a large piece of greaseproof paper, then unwrap the log directly on to it. Sift another tablespoon of icing sugar on top of the salami, then rub the icing sugar all over the sides. Arrange on a wooden board, cut into slices and serve.

Peel six pink lady apples, cut in half and remove the cores, then leave to dry at room temperature for an hour, if you have time. Put 100g soft butter in a nonstick, ovenproof 20cm frying pan and sprinkle 100g caster sugar on top. Place a cinnamon stick in the centre and two star anise on either side. Neatly arrange the apples on top, standing them up to pack them all into the pan. Roll 500g of puff pastry to the thickness of a pound coin. Cut a disc out of the pastry about an inch bigger than the pan. Lay over the apples, and tuck in the pastry edges around them. Prick all over with a fork and cut a small hole in the centre. Put the pan over a high heat for 5-10 minutes. This starts the cooking process; you are making the caramel in the pan, so should be able to see through the small cut in the pastry when the caramel is brown and ready. Place the pan in the oven for 50 minutes. Once cooked, leave to rest in the pan for 30 minutes before turning out.View image in fullscreenRyle’s tarte tatin and baked whole vacherin with pigs in blankets.“Another great centrepiece is to give someone avacherin(£25,paxtonandwhitfield.co.uk), which they can bake and can treat like a fondue,” says Ryle. “I like to dip leftover pigs in blankets in it.”Matthew Ryle’s new cookbook,French Classics:Easy andElevatedDishes toCook atHome, is out now;maisonfrancois.london‘It has to be pavlova’Helen GohView image in fullscreenGoh’s pavlova with poached pears.“I didn’t even know there was such a thing as Christmas until we moved to Australia when I was 11,” says Helen Goh, who is from Malaysia. “But when we caught on, we celebrated with all the trimmings.

On Monday, Emmanuel Macron named the series’ creator, Darren Star (best known for Sex and The City), a knight of the legion of honour for boosting France’s cultural prominence and soft power through the show’s global success.It is a long way from the initial backlash, which partly centred on the brash wardrobe of Emily Cooper, the American inParisplayed by Lily Collins. Brightly coloured, print-heavy and over the top, the outre outfits were received as a personal affront by many Parisians, who even objected to her embrace of archetypal French chic.View image in fullscreenEmily and Marcello, who in the show is the heir to a family-owned cashmere company.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixA beret caused particular consternation. As the Toulouse-born costume designer Marylin Fitoussi (theSex and the City legend Patricia Fieldconsulted on the first two seasons) told the Guardian this week: “I was really surprised by the Parisian audience, that they were offended by the beret – please!” But the backlash only spurred her and Collins on: “We didn’t just want to upset the French – we wanted to make them cry,” wrote Fitoussi in a new book, Emily in Paris: The Fashion Guide, published by Assouline.To Fitoussi, the Parisian resistance to Emily’s audacious American style was testament to the self-seriousness underlying the fabled French chic. “We are so boring and so posh sometimes. Nobody wants to smile because it looks stupid, nobody wants to be colourful because it’s tacky, no one wants to be a maximalist because they thought Coco Chanel said that you always need to take something off.” According to Fitoussi, tell a French woman she is overdressed and “she will jump out of the window”.View image in fullscreenEmily’s styling in Rome is more refined, with  romantic 1950s silhouettes.Photograph: Giulia Parmigiani/NetflixEmily might have finally won over France, or at least its president and the first lady – Brigitte Macron made a cameo in season four last year and Emmanuel Macron evenvowed to “fight hard” to keep Emily in Paris– but the new season, which landed on Netflix on Thursday, finds Emily settled in Rome, having had her head turned by Italy – and an Italian man – in last year’s finale.Fitoussi drew on classic cinema, includingLa Dolce Vitaand, of course,Roman Holiday. Emily’s styling is more refined. She is seen in romantic 1950s silhouettes, such as tulip skirts and coordinating sets, along with exaggerated power suits and, more frequently, flat shoes.Her look is also more vivid inItaly. Suddenly her wardrobe is full of polka dots – a nod to the on-screen wardrobes of Sophia Loren and Claudia Cardinale, Fitoussi said. “In several movies, they have a white dress with black polka dots or vice versa … I think it’s really something related to the DNA of Italy.”Iconic Italian brands such as Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi and Moschino are not just featured in the wardrobe but are namechecked. Emily’s new beau, Marcello, is the heir to a family-owned cashmere company, clearly inspired by the actual brand owned by the designer Brunello Cucinelli. In episode two, Emily dons a Dolce tie shirt with an exaggerated rose print, “because she stayed in Italy for love, and she’s blooming”, Fitoussi said.View image in fullscreenEmily and Mindy (played by Ashley Park) in Venice during Emily in Paris.Photograph: Giulia Parmigiani/NetflixFor Fitoussi, the change of scene meant freedom from the French “fashion police”. In Italy, Fitoussi found a more receptive setting. “Italy understood since season one what I understood – that it was about breaking rules and having fun with fashion.”Emily has also had a haircut – a new bob prompted by Collins’s own decision to get the chop, subsequently approved for the character by Star. Fitoussi said it meant rethinking some of her planned outfits: “The proportions needed to be different, but for me it was much more modern, sexy, Parisian, powerful.”View image in fullscreenMarylin Fitoussi is hopeful she will get the chance to fully realise the character and her ‘vision of the French chic, with this spicy Cooper touch’.Photograph: Cyril Pecquenard/SIPA/ShutterstockFitoussi sought to put a youthful twist on old-world classics. For a dinner ofcacio e pepe, followed by dancing in the piazza, Emily wears a polka-dot denim bra top and short outfit (from the Los Angeles brand For Love & Lemons). For the season finale, set in Venice for fashion week, Fitoussi selected an off-white two-piece from the Danish label Stine Goya with giant spots.Fitoussi is looking forward to seeing how Emily’s Roman holiday wardrobe is received, namechecking the unforgiving fashion critics @ideservecouture and @dietprada. “They kill me all the time, with their mean comments, but they make me laugh a lot.” She said the polarising response to the show’s fashion was a mark of success. “She looks spectacular, or hideous; it needs to be punchy.”A sixth season of Emily in Paris has not yet been confirmed, but Fitoussi is hopeful she will get the chance to fully realise the character and her “vision of the French chic, with this spicy Cooper touch”. She has already sourced a skirt suit, designed by John Galliano for Dior in 1997: it would be “the first time in Paris she will be fully dressed in grey, with no print”, Fitoussi said. Maybe then the Parisians will finally be happy.Explore more on these topicsFashionEmily in ParisParisFranceItalyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Archeological evidence suggests they were cultivated in South America “more than 4,500 years ago”, says Michelle Johnson, a seed historian, journalist and self-described “sweet potato superfan”.Flavorful, productive, resilient and adaptable to a wide range of climates, the entireIpomoea batatasplant is edible, and has thousands of cultivars; about 20 are sold commercially in the US, says Johnson. Surprisingly, they are kin to morning glories but unrelated to either white potatoes or yams.Their health bona fides, however, are clear. Here’s what to know about adding more sweet potatoes to your diet.What is the nutritional profile of sweet potatoes?A medium orange sweet potato (about 140g, or one serving, cooked) contains about 130 calories, 30g of carbohydrates and 2g of protein. Most of the carbs come from complex starches, or slow-digesting chains of glucose molecules; less than half derive from their approximately 10g of simple sugar.How you prepare a sweet potato can affect sugar content and glycemic index, or the speed at which a food causes blood sugar to rise. Steamed or boiled sweet potatoes retain most of their resistant starch, making them alower GIfood, while roasting sweet potatoes at high heat converts more of their starch into a sugar called maltose, giving them a higher glycemic index.How do sweet potatoes affect blood sugar?Despite their sugar content, sweet potatoes are still a healthy carb option for people with diabetes, says Asako Miyashita, a New York-based registered dietitian with a special focus on Japanese dietetics. That’s largely due to their high fiber content – about 4-6g per serving. Their fiber content “helps stabilize your blood sugar, as well as lower your cholesterol and increase satiety”, says Miyashita.She advises clients to eat sweet potatoes skin-on for maximum fiber and, if diabetic, stick to servings of about half a cup paired with green vegetables and protein for ideal blood sugar balance. Cooking sweet potatoes, then cooling them and eating them later allows for the development of even more resistant starch, which behaves like fiber and helps prevent blood sugar spikes.What digestive benefits do sweet potatoes offer?Fibersupports good gut bacteria and helps keep you regular, but sweet potatoes offer another digestive benefit, too. Cut a raw one open and you’ll see white sap oozing out. “That contains a compound called yarapin,” Miyashita says. Yarapin aids digestion by supporting peristalsis – the muscle contractions that move food through your digestive tract.Do sweet potatoes contain essential micronutrients?Sweet potatoes’ micronutrient density sets them apart from other staple starches such as white potatoes, wheat and rice. A medium sweet potato will give you some manganese, iron, vitamins C and B6, and calcium, plus 12% of your daily potassium and 34% of your daily copper needs.“Copper benefits skin, it protects against oxidative stress, and it’s important for the brain and nervous system as well,” says Sharniquia White, a North Carolina-based chef and registered dietitian. A2025 observational studyexamining the effects of dietary copper on cognitive function found people with a high copper intake performed better on cognitive function tests.Do different colored sweet potatoes have different nutritional profiles?Orange varieties, like jewels or Beauregards, carry significant amounts of beta-carotene. The body processes beta-carotene into vitamin A and is good for ourskin, hair andeyes. “It’s also really great for immune function,” says White. Beta-carotene is fat-soluble, so pairing sweet potatoes with fatty ingredients like olive oil or, as Miyashita prefers, sesame seeds can help with absorption.Beans, beans, the magical fruit: how healthy are they really?Read morePurple sweet potatoes, such as the Japanese Okinawa variety, are high in anthocyanins – antioxidants that researchersbelievehelp combat age-related disease. Laboratorytestsmeasuring antioxidant strength found purple sweet potato anthocyanins outperformed those from red cabbage, grapes and elderberries in fighting free radicals that contribute to cell damage. While more studies are needed, purple sweet potatoes offer “promising antitumor properties,” researchers havenoted.White sweet potatoes, like the Hannah variety, may boast fewer antioxidants than their colorful counterparts, but still offer some beta-carotene and more micronutrients and fiber than white potatoes like Idahos or russets. Even so, the takeaway isn’t to completely abandon white potatoes for sweet: “There’s a place for both” in a balanced diet, says White.How should you choose and prepare a sweet potato?White recommends selecting firm sweet potatoes with smooth, even skin and no smell. A sweet scent may mean the sugars are breaking down and your tuber is going bad, she says. Store them in a cool, dry place.Sweet potatoes are popular, but people often underestimate just how much can be done with them. Lately, White has been blending cooked sweet potatoes into smoothies and adding them to chai lattes as a kind of pumpkin spice analog. She also scores thick slices of sweet potato and grills them like steak, or roasts them until cooked but firm, to use as a base for avocado “toast”.A teacher recently sparked a TikTok trend bysharingher favorite way to eat a sweet potato: baked whole and stuffed with a baton of cheese.“You can have them savory, you can have them sweet, you can have them for a snack, you can have them for entree,” says White. “Not only are they nutritious – they’re also very versatile.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Everyone chips in, too, even the kids – well, they’ve got to earn their dinner somehow. Rather than shooing them off to watch cartoons while the adults do all the work, we make sure they’re hands-on in the kitchen alongside us, especially with the annual yule log. Not only is this a valuable life lesson, it also helps develop and strengthen our family culture. The children get to share in that sense of pride at a job well done, too, and everyone feels a part of the occasion. And isn’t that whatChristmasis all about?Red chicory with Cashel Blue, honey and walnutsView image in fullscreenAnna Haugh’s red chicory with Cashel Blue, honey and walnuts.Nibbles and canapes are Christmas essentials, but they don’t need to be fiddly or time-consuming. As with so many things in the kitchen, the best course of action is often just to keep things simple.Prep5 minCook10 minMakes12-18 canapesAbout 12 shelled walnuts2 headsred chicory100gCashel Blue, or other creamy blue cheese2 tbsp honeyCelery leaves, or flat-leaf parsley, to garnishHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then toast the walnuts in a baking tray for three minutes. Reove, leave to cool a little, then roughly chop.Cut the root off the end of each chicory, and separate the leaves. You want one leaf per canape, and sometimes they can be on the big side, so, for neatness’ sake, you may want to trim the leaves so they’re all roughly the same size. Well, it is Christmas, isn’t it?Arrange the chicory leaves cupped side up on a platter or wooden board, then crumble the cheese evenly between them. Scatter over the chopped walnuts, drizzle over the honey, then garnish with a few celery leaves and serve.Caramelised swede and honey soup (AKA Christmas Day soup)View image in fullscreen‘Definitely on the menu’: Anna Haugh’s Christmas Day soup (caramelised swede and honey soup).My sisters and I usually start planning Christmas from about August, and one summer I asked my sister Sarah what she was making that year. She responded: “Christmas Day soup, obviously!” I was intrigued as to what this magical soup might be, but she looked at me oddly: “Anna, it’syoursoup. You made it years ago, and your niece says it isn’t Christmas Day dinner without it.” It’s my turn to host this year, and this will 100% be on the menu.Prep15 minCook50 minServes41 medium swede(about 500g)2 tbsp vegetable oil, or other neutral oil3 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped40g honey, or to taste500ml milk100ml double cream20g hazelnuts, chopped, to garnish10g poppy seeds, to garnish10g black sesame seeds, to garnishSea salt1 heaped tbsp room-temperature butter½ small bunch each flat-leaf parsley and chives, choppedPeel the swede, then chop it into roughly even 5cm chunks. Heat a large pot, add the oil, then fry the swede, stirring often, for about five minutes, or until it’s golden brown all over. Add the garlic, cook, stirring for a minute, then add the honey and stir until it bubbles and starts to go golden brown.Add 500ml just-boiled water, simmer for 10 minutes, then pour in the milk and cream, and bring slowly to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer and cook for about 15 minutes, until you can squash the swede with the back of a spoon.Meanwhile, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the nuts and seeds on an oven tray, roast for four minutes, then remove, roughly chop and leave to cool.It’s now time to blend the soup – you want it to be as smooth as possible, so a jug blender is your best bet. Once the soup is pureed, taste it for salt and the sweetness of the honey, and adjust as required. Pour the soup back in the pan and reheat to a bare simmer.To serve, rub the room-temperature butter over the base of four soup bowls, and sweep it up the sides with a pastry brush or thumb. Sprinkle the toasted nuts and seeds into the bowls and add a scattering of parsley and chives. Pour the hot soup into a big jug and pour into the bowls at the table.Turkey wellingtonView image in fullscreenThat’s a wrap: Anna Haugh’s turkey wellington.Build this the day before you want to cook it, so on the day the only job is to pop it in the oven. If you’re not a turkey fan, some sausagemeat sandwiched between two chicken breasts is a good alternative, though it might need an extra five to 10 minutes in the oven.Prep20 minBrine2 hrMarinateOvernightRest1 hr+Cook1 hr 30 minServes4For the mushroom mix60g butter2 shallots, peeled and finely diced5 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped200g chestnut mushrooms(use a mixture, if possible), chopped400g tinned butter beans,drained and crushed1 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon1-2 dashes soy sauce, to taste, or saltFor the wellingtonSalt and black pepper400g piece turkey breast(about 11cm long x 8cm wide)2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushedFinely grated zest of 1 lemonA few thyme sprigs, leaves picked3 tbsp vegetable oil, or duck fat for extra flavour2-4 cooked pancakes, homemade or shop-bought2320g rolls puff pastryPlain flour, to dust2 egg yolks, beaten, for sealing and glazingThe day before you want to build the wellington, give the turkey breast a quick brine. Make a 5% salt:water solution in a big pot, drop in the turkey, making sure it’s completely submerged, and leave for two hours.Drain the turkey and pat it dry with kitchen paper. Put the garlic, lemon zest and thyme in a medium non-reactive dish or tray, then put in the turkey breast and rub all over to coat. Cover and pop in the fridge overnight.The next day, get the mushroom mix made as early as you can, because you want it fully cooked and dry. Melt the butter in a large frying pan on a low heat, then gently saute the shallots for about five minutes, until soft but not coloured. Add the garlic, cook for a minute or two, until it no longer smells raw, then add the mushrooms and a pinch of salt, and cook low and slow, stirring occasionally, for about 25 minutes, until all the moisture has gone from the pan. Take off the heat, leave to cool, then stir in the crushed butter beans and tarragon, and season with soy sauce to taste.Heat the oil or duck fat in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat, then sear the turkey breast, turning often, for a couple of minutes on each side, until nice and golden all over, and set aside.Arrange the pancakes in an overlapping line on a chopping board, then spread the mushroom and butter bean mix all over the top. You’re going to roll everything up a bit like a big burrito, so, depending on the size of your turkey breast, you may not need all four pancakes. Lay the browned turkey on top of the mushroom mixture, then roll up in the pancakes so it’s fully enclosed. Wrap in clingfilm and put in the fridge for 40 minutes, to rest and firm up.Lay out one sheet of the puff pastry on a well-floured worktop. Unwrap and discard the clingfilm around the pancake-wrapped turkey, lay it in the centre of the pastry, then cut the pastry to leave a 3-4cm exposed border all around the turkey; save the offcuts. Brush the exposed pastry with egg glaze, then lay the second sheet of pastry on top of the turkey and use floured hands to slide it down and tuck it in neatly between the turkey and the pastry base. Roll to wrap up completely, then press all around the joins, ideally with the back of a floured fork, to seal. Neatly trim away any excess pastry, then re-roll all the pastry offcuts and cut out pretty little Christmas designs to stick on top of the wellington (another job for the kids). Egg wash the outside of the wellington, transfer it to a greased and lined oven tray, and put in the fridge to rest and firm up.Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½. Bake the wellington for 45-50 minutes, keeping an eye on the colour of the pastry; if it starts browning too much too soon, turn down the oven accordingly. The wellington is ready when the centre of the turkey reaches 65C, so, if need be, cover it loosely with foil and keep roasting until it hits that core temperature. Remove and leave to rest for 10 minutes, by which time the centre of turkey should have reached 70C.To serve, I usually just cut the wellington into four large, showstopping slices.Red wine gravyView image in fullscreenSomething for everyone: Anna Haugh’s red wine gravy – don’t add any meat roasting juices until you’ve set aside some gravy for the vegetarians and vegans at your table.This is definitely something you could make ahead of time and freeze. Defrost in the fridge overnight, then gently reheat and bring to a boil just before serving. This gravy is vegan up to the point when you add the meat juices, so it’s very useful when you’ve got a whole crowd to keep happy. As a side note, if I ever handed my family a red wine gravy without mushrooms and onions in it, I’d be frogmarched out of the house.Prep10 minCook30 minServes4-62-3tbsp vegetable oil2 onions, peeled and chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 large glasses red wine(about 500ml)1 vegetable stock cube3-4 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked2tbsp plain flour200g chestnut mushrooms, cut into quartersSalt and black pepper, to tastePut two tablespoons of oil in a frying pan on a medium heat, add the onions and saute, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until golden brown. Add the garlic and fry for a couple of minutes more. Pour in the red wine, then leave to bubble and reduce by two-thirds.Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock cube in 800ml boiling water. Add the stock and thyme to the onion mix and bring to a boil.In a small bowl or cup, mix the flour with two tablespoons of water to make a paste, then stir this into the gravy to thicken. Don’t add any salt just yet: when you add the meat juices later, they might already be salty, so always wait until you’ve added them before adjusting the seasoning of the gravy. Blitz the gravy until smooth, then leave to cool, (at this stage, if you’re making it ahead, freeze in a suitable container).Just before serving, slowly reheat the gravy to a gentle boil. Meanwhile, heat a little oil in a frying pan, then add the mushrooms and fry on a high heat, stirring, for about five minutes, until nicely browned all over. Stir the fried mushrooms into the blitzed gravy, then set aside enough of it for the non-meat eaters at the table. Pour any resting juices from the meat into the meat-eaters’ gravy, then taste and adjust the seasoning, and serve hot.Cranberry relishView image in fullscreenEasy does it: Anna Haugh’s cranberry relish.Listen, this sounds as if it’s so easy that it can’t be that good, but it is.Prep10 minCook20 minServes4-62 banana shallots, peeled and finely chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed200g dried cranberries, roughly chopped1 pinch sugar1 pinch salt2-3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked, to servePut the shallots, garlic and dried cranberries in a pan, add 200ml water, bring to a boil, then leave to simmer for 10-15 minutes. Add a pinch each of sugar and salt to taste, leave to cool and it’s ready; I like to stir in some fresh thyme leaves at the end. Decant into a bowl and serve at room temperature.Sprout and hispi cabbage slawView image in fullscreenShredded treat: Anna Haugh’s sprout and hispi cabbage slaw.This is simplicity itself, and even better on Boxing Day in an epic sandwich with leftover turkey and ham.Prep15 minServes41 tbsp honey50ml white-wine vinegar200glarge brussels sprouts(the biggest you can find, ideally), very finely sliced or grated½ headhispi cabbage(about 250g), very thinly sliced50ml olive oil½ tsp sea saltFinely grated zest of ½ orange1 tsp caraway seeds, or cumin seeds, or chilli flakes or finely sliced fresh red chilli1 tsp pink peppercorns, crushedMix the honey and vinegar in a small cup, until smooth. Put everything else in a big bowl and toss to mix – the salt will start to break down the cabbage and sprouts, giving them a lovely, just-wilted texture. Drain off any liquid from the bottom of the bowl, then pour over the honey dressing to taste, toss again to coat and serve.Yule logView image in fullscreenRoll up, roll up: Anna Haugh’s yule log.The kids love this at Christmas, so I usually make the chocolate swiss roll and icing ahead of time, then leave them to design it themselves without any adults breathing down their necks. They never disappoint.Prep10 minCook40 minServes4250g unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing500g icing sugar85g cocoa powder, plus extra to finish45g room-temperature milk4 eggs100g caster sugar65g self-raising flour1 pinch saltI like to make the butter cream first, so that when I’m ready to roll, I don’t have to rush it. In a medium bowl, beat the butter and half the icing sugar until light and fluffy,then add the rest of the icing sugar, 40g of the cocoa and the room-temperature milk and stir very well to combine.Now for the sponge. Grease and line a lipped baking tray, and heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the eggs and caster sugar in a bowl, and beat vigorously until very well combined. Sift in the flour, salt and the remaining 45g cocoa powder, and fold in gently but thoroughly.Scrape the batter into the lined tray, spread it out evenly with a spatula and bake for nine minutes, until risen, evenly baked and a skewer poked into the centre comes out clean. Remove, leave to cool slightly, then turn out on to a large sheet of greaseproof paper and leave to cool a little more. While it’s still just warm, roll the sponge into the classic swiss roll shape, then, once it has cooled almost to room temperature, unravel it, spread it all over with the butter cream, then roll up again carefully.Keep any leftover butter cream for decorating the top – we like to spread some on the log and drag a fork through it to recreate that traditional bark effect. I like to serve this topped with a nice dusting of extra cocoa powder, too.Anna Haugh is chef/patron ofMyrtle, London SW1, and co-presenter of MasterChef on BBC OneExplore more on these topicsFoodChristmasChristmas food and drinkStarterMain courseSide dishesDessertrecipesShareReuse this content"

This year more than 50 people gave me their answerKatie CunninghamWhile every story has been unique in loveliness, I’ve found that many share a similar pulseRead ourkindness of strangers serieshereFri 19 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 20.36 ESTShareEarlier this year, I had a phone call with a woman named Debbie aboutone of her toughest days as a parent. While she was carting her two sick toddlers to buy medicine, one abruptly vomited across the floor of the local shopping mall. A passing stranger stopped, grabbed a roll of paper towel from the display in front of the chemist, and sopped up the mess – then went inside to pay for what she’d used, insisting on footing the bill. It was a small but lovely act that spoke to the decency of other people.Working as a journalist often involves speaking to people on, or about, the worst day of their life. But for the past year I have had the tremendous pleasure of interviewing Australians (and the occasional Briton) about something very different – the acts of kindness they’ve received from a total stranger. Guardian Australia asked readers to send in these stories, and we have been publishing them in our weeklykindness of strangers column.Some of these acts of kindness, like the one Debbie received, have been relatively minor. Others were as life-altering as securing the recipient a place in the rehab facility thathelped them beat addiction. Each of them left an indelible mark on the recipient – enough so that they still remembered them in vivid detail, even many decades later. One woman, now in her 70s, gave mea blow-by-blow accountof the surfer who saved her from drowning as a teenager. Another septuagenarian could still remember the exactwords of encouragementoffered by a classmate during his daunting first year at university half a century ago.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningI’ve now conducted over 50 of these calls and while every story has been unique in loveliness, I’ve found that many share a similar pulse. There have been several that came from people who put themselves in a potentially risky situation – accepting a ride or offer of accommodation from a stranger – and instead of being met with our worst fears, experienced only generosity. Sometimes a bad first impression, like that made by a gang ofscary-looking youthsorleather-clad bikers, was swiftly upended by those strangers’ immediate willingness to step in and help out.As was the case for Debbie, many times an act of kindness came on an otherwise awful day; a reminder of how the best and worst of life are so often intertwined. And almost every time, the act of kindness in question was not a showy public display but a quiet act of generosity seen by only the recipient. Many of the people I spoke to never even had the chance to thank their kind stranger, but forever thought of them fondly and wished them well. Our calls often involve tears (on both ends of the line!) and reflection on how the act inspired them to pay it forward wherever they could.At the end of our interviews, I usually ask subjects what they learned from their encounter. Debbie put it simply: “It still reminds me that there are good people out there who will drop what they’re doing and help you out, if they have the opportunity to.”That is something we’ve seen this week on a very different scale inAhmed al-Ahmed,Reuven Morrison, andBoris and Sofia Gurman, who risked or lost their lives standing up to the Bondi gunmen. It’s in those whoshielded others in the attackorran towards the danger to help out, and the very many Sydneysiders whostood in lines around the block, waiting to donate their blood.There is evil in the world: that much is sadly undeniable. But for a far greater percentage of people the instinctual reaction, in circumstances both exceptional and everyday, is one of selflessness.

While we came together to celebrate the tremendous impact of his life, death always hurts.Death also always makes me contemplate three things:1. The privilege of community;2. Whether I’ve sufficiently upskilled my children at life so they’ll be OK if I died tomorrow; and3.Hinduism.All three of these things – community, debilitating anxiety and religion – are gifts from my family.I know it’s not cool to talk about religion. Throughout human history, we’ve used it to justify mass murder, colonisation and its related crimes. But I want to talk about it – in particular the Hindu mantra “Sohum” that my parents gave me. In this fractured and frightening world, the mantra calls me. I’ve spent 87,502 words in my new manuscript exploring it (spoiler alert: my new manuscript is obviously not about sexy dragon riders).Sohum means “I am that.” It means I am divine. The word signifies oneness with the universal divine – I am one with the ultimate reality.Shankari Chandran: ‘In western thinking, duty is seen as a burden’Read moreMy parents taught us Sohum as part of our meditation training. When I say “training” I am understating my parents’ admirable efforts, and I am overstating the outcome of these efforts on me.I was a poor student of Hinduism and a very distractible child. But for years, Appa would call me and my little brother to the family shrine and ask us to sit cross-legged on the floor in front of a lamp. He instructed us to focus on the flame, bring the light into our minds, close our eyes, and breathe slowly and deeply.View image in fullscreenShankari Chandran, 1 year old, and her brother, Narendran, 4 years old. Early 1979. \n\"Our mother used to cut our hair as you can probably tell.\"Photograph: Shankari ChandranNaturally, my mind would turn to last week’s episode of Battlestar Galactica and my father, sensing the energy shift in the room, asked us to empty our minds of all thoughts and feelings.He gently instructed us to synchronise our breath with the repetition of the word Sohum. I can hear his voice: “Breathe in –So. Hold. Breathe out –Hum. Breathe in –So. Hold. Breathe out –Hum.”Sohum.Appa told us this daily exercise would help us connect with our inner divinity. He said inside our bodies, there is a divine energy, that also exists around us. It is everywhere and in everything. Most importantly, it is ineveryone.Amma added to this lesson. She taught us that our code in life is to live in this world with generosity and kindness, but to realise that we are not really of this world. Our deeper purpose is to shed its constraints and understand our shared divinity.When Hindus meet each other, we fold our hands together. People see this as a respectful greeting, but it is much more than that. It signifies the divinity in one person recognising the divinity in the other. This is the meaning held but often forgotten within that powerful gesture. It isn’t a “hello” – it’s a salutationbetweenthe divinity that exists in all things.And that is why this lesson from my parents has become so important to me, more than four decades after they tried to teach it to us.If I am not really me, but a divine energy, and you are not really you, but the same divine energy, then by deduction, you and I are one.I want to say that out loud again, because when I let it guide my thoughts and interactions, I am a much better person.You and I are one.All of us belong to different tribes that give us identity, meaning, stories about our past and stories about our place in the world. We love our tribes because they offer protection and belonging. These are good things. But tribalism also hurts us. In some cases it destroys us.I try hard to remember the lesson from our parents.Sohum.In this fractured world, we are more than our different tribes. We are deeply connected to each other, whether we can sense it yet or not. We are connected, we are equal and we are one.Shankari Chandran is a Miles Franklin award-winning author of the booksSafe HavenandChai Time at Cinnamon GardensExplore more on these topicsReligionHome truthsAustralian lifestyleHinduismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereChloe Mac DonnellFri 19 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 02.01 ESTShareAfter a 31-year stint on the Las Vegas strip, the showgirls from the revue Jubilee! took a final synchronised kick in 2016. The show, known for its elaborate costumes created by the American fashion designer Bob Mackie, came to an end due to falling audience numbers and unimpressedcriticswho described it as a spectacle “trapped in time”.Now, almost a decade later, showgirls, or at least the showgirl aesthetic, is back.Known as the “sultan of sequins”, Mackie has made theatrical showgirl glitz his signature style, dressing everyone from Marilyn Monroe to Madonna. Earlier this month, a “naked” bodysuit he created for Cher in 1978 fetched $57,600,seven times its estimated price, while a silver and gold fringed bodysuit with lamé wings that Mackie designed for Tina Turner for a 1977 performance sold for $19,200.It’s a look that sashayed all the way to the centre of popular culture in 2025 thanks toTaylor Swift. Earlier this year, the cultural juggernaut wore one of Mackie’s original Jubilee! costumes on the cover of her 12th studio album. The rhinestone encrusted bra and thong, feathered armbands and sparkly headpiece were perfect for a record titled The Life of a Showgirl.Swift isn’t alone. This year, showgirl references have been embraced by pop stars including Sabrina Carpenter, Miley Cyrus and Dua Lipa as they whizzed across arena stages in sequins, cut-outs and feathers, spotlighted against camp sets. Lipa’s stylist Lorenzo Posocco toldVoguehe wanted to bring “a showgirl attitude” to her Radical Optimism tour – referencing pictures from the 50s, Lipa’s dancers wafted giant feathered fans.View image in fullscreenIconic … Cher in a Mackie creation.Photograph: Harry Langdon/Getty ImagesLipa, Carpenter and other chart toppers also draw on 19th-century performances, including burlesque and chorus line references. The results are poles apart from the 90s Britney Spears era of crop tops and cargo pants, and hip-hop inspired dance moves that came before them. Mackie references Beyoncé as influencing her younger counterparts. “I think it looks more appealing for the younger performer who is seeking something other than what they grew up with”, he told the Guardian. “New stars are pushing toward a glamorous, more theatrical, show-stopping, entrance-making statement.”But not everyone is on board with this showgirl renaissance. Nancy Hardy, a former Jubilee! showgirl who danced in the 00s says the trend is “bemusing”. She thinks the word showgirl is being “used as an umbrella term covering everything from The Radio City Rockettes to Broadway performers and now apparently Taylor Swift.” She points to Swift’s combination of perfect makeup, glamorous costumes, dramatic lighting and special stage effects as the new indicators of a showgirl. “Today a showgirl is really someone who walks an illusion because everything is ‘perfection’ in a theatrical sense,” she says. There used to be a clear hierarchy between dancers, performers and showgirls. Showgirls, who she says were “more statuesque”, performed topless, while dancers were covered. “They barely moved because they didn’t want a lot of jiggling.”View image in fullscreenJumping on the bandwagon … Miley Cyrus in vintage Mackie.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for The Recording AcademyFor gen Z and millennial stars, Mackie’s vintage designs have become highly covetable. In 2024, Zendaya paid tribute to one of Mackie’s earliest clients, Cher, when the actor wore a semi-sheer beaded dress made by the designer in 2001, which was similar to one he created for Cher to wear in 1967 on the Carol Burnett show. Later that year, Miley Cyrus paid an undisclosed sum to buy the Mackietasseled mini dressshe had worn earlier in the year to perform at the Grammys. In September, Carpenter wore a trio of vintage Mackie designs at the MTV Video Music Awards. They are also a hit among collectors.The aesthetic reflects a wider ‘naked dressing’ trend in fashion, with everyone from Zoë Kravitz to Margot Robbie and Lily Allen embracing sheer, lacy and barely-there dresses. In May,Cannes banned such dressesfor “decency reasons”. Today’s showgirls, while not topless, still allude to nudity with flesh coloured bra panels and carefully placed rhinestones.“Showgirls evoke nostalgia for a past glamour,” says Su Kim Chung, head of special collections at the University of Nevada, who documents the history of showgirls. “Now it is viewed as a sort of ‘safe’ sexy because it has been modified. It has got all the glamour, the rhinestones and the sparkle but without the nudity.”View image in fullscreenEven the horse is shiny … Beyoncé takes it easy in sequins.Photograph: Valeska Thomas/PAChung says showgirls are central to the iconography of Las Vegas. She points to former mayor Oscar Goodman who, during public appearances, was flanked by two showgirls. Even though Las Vegas no longer has any showgirl-based productions, Jung says they are still used as an emblem of the city, appearing at conventions and in advertisements. “The showgirl is still a remaining icon of Las Vegas glamour,” Chung says.It was this pseudo glamour that Gia Coppola mused on earlier this year with the release ofThe Last Showgirl, starring Pamela Anderson. The film takes its inspiration from the closure of Jubilee! and follows Shelly, an ageing showgirl, as she comes to terms with Le Razzle Dazzle, the show she has performed in for over 30 years, winding down.Reflecting on her former status, the character muses: “Las Vegas used to treat us like movie stars. The iconic American showgirl. The Las Vegas showgirl. We were ambassadors for style and grace. You know, it was just... the costumes. I mean, it makes you feel like you’re stepping out of the pages of Vogue magazine.”Hardy says the transformative effect of a showgirl is part of the appeal. It’s something Swift alludes to ina recent docuseriesthat captures the behind-the-scenes action from her year-long 2023 Eras tour, which included gruelling rehearsals, gym sessions and 149 performances across 21 countries, each lasting 3.5 hours.Hardy describes her own showgirl performances as “like running a marathon in high heels every night”. Her feathered headdress weighed 34lbs. “I had to wear it all the way up the stairs to the stage from the dressing rooms three floors below in the basement. I had to leave early for my cue so I could catch my breath before I went on stage. You’re perspiring the whole time but creating this illusion that it’s easy and beautiful and ethereal.”Perhaps this is where the appeal of the showgirl really lies. In the chaos of 2025 there is a desire for escapism. Who better to turn to than showgirls, who have always embodied fantasy, perfection and a world where no one misses a mark.To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.In last week’s newsletter, we inadvertently published a picture of aT-shirt collar that was AI-generated.

One of my favourite routes is up the Herefordshire Beacon, on top of which is British Camp, an iron age hill fort. I always pass the tiny Giant’s cave (also called Clutters cave) and loop back above the reservoir. My inner child recommends taking cardboard for dry-sledging down the ditches (or a normal sledge, if we’re lucky enough for snow), but a post-ramble hot chocolate from either theSally’s Place cafeorMalvern Hills hotel, both across the road from the car park, is a must.Jemma SaundersUntamed route in north CornwallView image in fullscreenTrebarwith Strand in winter.Photograph: Maggie Sully/AlamyFew corners of the UK feel wilder than Cornwall’s north coast during low season. Here, the untamed Atlantic meets the spectacular sheer cliffs betweenTintagel and Port Isaac, with the South West Coast Path snaking its way precariously along the top. After a walk with the elements, settle down for some wave-watching at thePort William innperched above Trebarwith Strand. Spectacular sunsets and family-run surf clubs are on offer, all in the imposing shadow of legendary Gull Rock. The best part?

On the way we play Poohsticks, get stuck in mud and paddle in a stream. Once at the beach, every new trip brings fresh delights; devil’s toenails, ammonites, fossilised wood and crabs. We paint pebbles, fall on on our bums on wet rocks and play dinosaurs in rock pools.ChantelleCycling and dark skies in NorthumberlandView image in fullscreenA visit to the Kielder Observatory is the perfect end to a day exploring the forest.Kielder Waterin Northumberland, one of the largest artificial lakes in Europe, offers walking, wildlife, cycling and water sports.

Apps such as Seek can help you identify the ones you find (but don’t rely on apps to establish whether a mushroom is edible or not). I also have my little pocket-size mushroom book. It keeps me on the lookout and interested in my surroundings, helping me stay mindful. I especially like the common name of the mushrooms. I am on the lookout for witch’s butter, wood ear and velvet shank. I am combining this with my love of photography and learning how to take pictures of mushrooms to highlight their beauty. They really are the unsung heroes of the underworld.EseHiking has taught me to embrace the rainI’m usually the hibernating type in winter, but since joining a local hiking group, I’ve changed my ways. There has been nothing more satisfying than feeling the crisp, fresh wind against my face and forcing myself to be present in the moment. It’s taken me 37 years to acknowledge the beautiful, natural landscapes right on my doorstep. Where once I was afraid of the cold and rain, I now wrap up warm, take it in my stride and beat those winter blues one step at a time. Not to mention the sense of achievement I feel afterwards.ShemaBoxing Day charity walk in DerryView image in fullscreenThe Peace Bridge in Derry.Photograph: Shawn Williams/Getty ImagesTheGoal Mileis a charity walk (and run) that takes place in many locations across the island of Ireland every Boxing Day to support the charity Goal’s work in the developing world.

Instead, we ploughed ahead with our cliff-jumping boat tour and found ourselves stranded in choppy waters …Joel SnapeFri 19 Dec 2025 04.00 ESTShareIt was probably the fish stew. We got it from a street food vendor on Ko Phi Phi, Thailand’s most party-centric island, and I remember it being absolutely delicious. Fifteen hours later, my wife and I were lying on the bare boards of a long-tail boat, rocking gently in the waves, huddled together under a blanket and regretting every single choice we’d made thatChristmasDay. As the song says, we can smile about it now, but at the time it was terrible.Thailand is a fantastic place to go for Christmas: it’s hot, the people are lovely, and there are plenty of fairy lights but nottoomuch Cliff Richard. Ko Phi Phi is more of an acquired taste – it’s the sort of place you buy heavily diluted vodka by the bucket – but we were very much making the best of it. The night we arrived, in 2014, we watched a bunch offarangs(foreigners) flail away at each other in oversized boxing gloves, some of them chugging beers between rounds. For the big day, we decided to push the boat out: the limestone rock formations around the islands are a popular spot for deep-water soloing, where you climb up a cliff face with no rope and then leap (or fall) into the clear blue sea below. We hired a guide, had a light supper and hyped ourselves up for an unforgettable festive morning.The problems started at about 3am. My wife was the first to get ill: I can’t share the details, but think about the worst case of food poisoning you’ve had and let me assure you that it was at least as bad as that. I tried my best to be comforting, every rumble of my stomach sounding like the bugles of an approaching army.The sword of Damocles dropped at about 6am, when my body decided to rid itself of everything I’d eaten for the past 12 hours by the fastest means it could muster. Unbelievably, we decided to go on our cliff-jumping boat tour anyway. We weren’t getting our deposit back, but also there are points during every bout of food poisoning where you feel inexplicably, almost miraculously better. Somehow, hopscotching between these moments was enough to get us down to the docks and on to a tiny wooden boat, but not before a nice old lady explained her toilet’s bucket-flush system, while I kept one hand over my mouth.It will be fine, we reassured each other.It will probably be fine.Obviously, it was not fine. I managed a couple of cliff climbs: the after-plunge was exhilarating, even if the rocks were a bit sharp. I ate some pineapple chunks, then swiftly returned them to the sea. And then the boat broke down, right in the middle of Maya Bay, just where the water was getting choppy. A few minutes later, it started to rain.The next couple of hours felt almost comically horrible, like one of those bits in The Simpsons where Homer falls out of a plane into a factory full of angry bees. Eventually, another boat came to the rescue, but rather than taking us aboard it dragged us through the waves, buffeting us up and down like a cork in a bathtub. We hit the shore just as happy hour kicked in, glowstick-waving Swedish ravers in Santa hats lining our route like an off-its-face guard of honour. There were speakers blasting trance on every corner, and pneumatic drill-wielding workmen outside our apartment. The whole episode exists in my mind like the cautionary second half of a film about substance abuse. Fish stew: just say no.And yet … my wife and I have told this story about 40 times, and I don’t think there’s a pre-child Christmas either of us remembers with more fondness. We had salty fries and Fanta for Christmas dinner, retired to bed at 8pm and slept for 14 hours. On Boxing Day, I asked a friend in Bangkok to put us up for a couple of days and we got the first boat out of Phi Phi, leaving the ravers to face the workmen through the ringing blur of their own hangovers. Sometimes, a bit of peace and quiet is the greatest gift you can get.Explore more on these topicsChristmasMy weirdest ChristmasThailand holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I felt quite light-headed. Finally, the moment I dreamed of had arrivedOle Fredrik SveenFri 19 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 14.03 ESTShareIcan’t remember the first time I played the lottery – I was probably quite young. I’m an optimist. If you don’t play, you can’t win, and somebody has to win the big prize. Why not me? To me, winning would mean freedom – leave my job, have no debts and do exactly as I pleased.I live in Norway, and every few weeks I’d buy a lottery ticket. I’d occasionally win 100 kroner (£7.50), which just covered the cost of the ticket. It kept the dream alive, though.In June, I was on holiday in Greece with my girlfriend. We’d had the most amazing day, and were watching the sunset with a glass of wine. Earlier in the day, we had discussed buying a holiday home there. “I’d need to win the lottery first!” I joked.Suddenly, my phone buzzed with a text message. It was from Norsk Tipping, the Norwegian lottery corporation, saying I had won big in the Eurojackpot. I had to read the message two or three times. My hands were starting to shake as I logged into the app and saw a notification saying I had won 1.3m kroner (£97,000).My heart skipped a beat. I felt quite light-headed. Finally, the moment I had dreamed of had arrived. I showed my phone to my girlfriend. She gasped. My head started to spin with possibilities. Could I leave my job as a culinary teacher and go travelling? Maybe we could buy a holiday home after all.I called my mum and blurted out: “I’ve won the lottery!” She couldn’t believe it. “You’re due some luck your way,” she laughed.It was two or three days before we were able to stop thinking about what could have beenAfter I hung up, I sat and stared at the screen, and started to feel that something wasn’t right. I checked the winning numbers and compared them with mine. I’d only matched two main numbers and one bonus number. My heart dropped to the pit of my stomach. There was no way I could have won so much money.Dozens of news stories had already started to pop up. They said that the company had made a mistake when converting the prize money from euros into Norwegian kroner; instead of dividing winners’ portions by 100, someone had accidentally multiplied them by 100.Reality laughed in my face, and I worked out I’d actually won about £10, along with thousands of others who had been wrongly told they’d won big. The CEO of the company resigned, but with a payout bigger than my imagined win, 3m kr (£225,000), which I found quite ironic.It was a crushing disappointment. The holidays, the plans I’d made in my head all disappeared. I had to call my mum and tell her I hadn’t actually won any money. My girlfriend broke down in tears.The rest of the evening felt very subdued. We were both drained. You can’t miss what you never had, but we felt so angry they could get people’s hopes up like that. The next day, I was even more annoyed that nobody from Norsk Tipping had been in touch to confirm we hadn’t won and apologise. It was two or three days before we were able to stop thinking about what could have been. It took the shine off what had been a wonderful holiday.Experience: I gave birth to the world’s first IVF boyRead moreIt wasn’t until the Monday morning that I received a message from Norsk Tipping to confirm it. I’m glad I had my wits about me and realised quite quickly there was an error, because if I thought I’d won for a whole weekend, I might have already spent a lot of money. Getting the confirmation in writing felt like the first blow all over again.I haven’t taken it too seriously. Norwegian people generally don’t like to make a fuss, so, like me, people just moved on. I wouldn’t say I’m at the stage of being able to see the funny side, though. My friends have all been very sympathetic – I’m sure they would have liked me to win, too.I don’t actually know what I spent my actual winnings on. It’s not even enough money for a glass of champagne here in Norway. It probably went towards some grocery shopping.The lottery feels tainted for me now; I don’t play any more. There’s a saying in Norway: “You’re either lucky in love or games.” I have to accept that I’m lucky in love, and that’s my lot. I think my girlfriend would agree we’d much rather it be that way – even if the Greek holiday home has to remain a pipe dream.As told to Heather MainDo you have an experience to share?

Here’s my step-by-step guideAll you need is oil, vinegar, steel wool and a whetstone to get everything looking as good as newClaire RatinonFri 19 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 06.56 ESTShareIam a tool-care evangelist. I like to keep my harvest knife sharp and my garden fork hung up tidily in the shed. At least this is what I tell myself – because I believe tool care is important despite, in reality, being the kind of grower who drops her secateurs and forgets to pick them up before an overnight rain, or leaves a trowel stuck in the ground at the end of a veg bed, convinced – erroneously – that I’ll remember to put it away as the sun starts to set.Rust corrodes the metal parts of our garden tools, affecting how well they work and even their safety. Small patches can be removed using wire wool and perseverance but, ideally, we’d prevent it from appearing in the first place by cleaning, drying and storing our tools properly after each use. But if you, like me, are a fallible human who occasionally finds certain tools have turned the shade of autumn leaves, it is entirely possible that they can be rescued.Treat your tools with linseed or camellia oil which have protective qualities for both metal and woodFirst, soak the rusted parts of your tools in humble white vinegar which will do the heavy lifting of removing most of the rust. You can leave your tools soaking for up to 24 hours, depending on how much rust needs removing, but no longer as that risks the chemical reaction corroding the good metal underneath. And be sure to protect any wooden or plastic handles or components as you don’t want them soaked in vinegar.Had a bad year? Embrace ‘volunteer crops’, your garden’s gift to youRead moreHaving taken your tools out of the vinegar soak, you can remove any lingering patches of rust with a wire brush or steel wool, gently buffing the metal until any rusty remnants have been removed. Then rinse the tools and dry them thoroughly as any moisture that remains will cause the rust to return. You might also consider giving any wooden parts a quick rub down with some fine-grade steel wool (as this will remove the dirt without wearing away the wood as sandpaper would) before treating your tools with linseed or camellia oil which have protective qualities for both metal and wood. Use a rag to rub the oil on to your tools, applying a thin layer on the metal and a couple of coats on the wooden parts for optimal protection.If you’ve reached this point, with your now rust-free tools gleaming, you may realise that your shears, knives or secateurs could do with sharpening. I’d highly recommend investing in a whetstone and a copy of Do Maintain by Gareth Heaton, which is an excellent step-by-step guide detailing how to approach sharpening different types of blade. Not only will your tools last longer, but your plants will be healthier as ragged cuts made with blunt snips can be an invitation for pests and disease to ravage otherwise happy specimens.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is part of sweeping changes to childhood immunizations by the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, which have global repercussions – including cutting funding for programs that bring vaccines to countries around the world.“He has a fixed, immutable belief that vaccines cause harm,” said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “He will do everything he can to try and prove that.”The actions taken this year by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, have “a global impact”, said Elizabeth Jacobs, professor emerita at the University of Arizona and a founding member of the grassroots group Defend Public Health. “It is spreading like an infection all its own throughout the globe.”CDC ends recommendation for all US newborns to receive hepatitis B vaccineRead moreTesting established vaccines in a country with high rates of hepatitis B and a fragile health system “reeks of a neocolonialist attitude” and risks expanding global mistrust of the US and science, said Gavin Yamey, professor of global health at the Duke Global Health Institute.When Kennedy announced in June that the US would end funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which has vaccinated more than 1.2 billion children and saved an estimated 20.6 million lives, he sent shock waves through global health – and he cited an unusual study from 2018 to justify the action.Thestudymade an alarming claim: the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine caused death in young girls in Guinea-Bissau. It was published by a group of Danish researchers, including a married couple named Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn.But when Kennedy made his announcement in 2025, he did not mention a 2022paperfrom some of the same authors on the same topic finding completely different results, essentially nullifying the first study.“We did not find that early-DTP was associated with increased female mortality as found in a previous study,” the researchers wrote.It is one example of their questionable research, which has drawn criticism from other researchers and journalists examining their findings.Now those same researchers will be the ones carrying out the new study on hepatitis B vaccination in Guinea-Bissau. US funding will go to theBandim Health Project, led by Aaby and Stabell Benn, at the University of Southern Denmark.Aaby and Stabell Benn did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiries about the details of the five-year study, set to begin in early 2026.Babies in the randomized, controlled trial will or will not receive the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Researchers will then compare early-life mortality, illness and development between the groups, according to theaward announcementfrom the CDC.The World Health Organizationrecommendsgiving the vaccine to all babies at birth, but Guinea-Bissau has struggled to roll out the shots to every newborn, insteadrecommendingthe dose at six weeks of age. The country has pledged to fill that gap and plans on recommending hepatitis B vaccines to all newborns in 2027.It is a major breach of scientific ethics to withhold an intervention that has been proven safe and effective. “It’s highly unethical to choose to give a vaccine to some children but not others,” Offit said.Yamey noted: “There’s already an RCT [randomized, controlled trial] showing superior outcomes with the birth dose, so why is another one needed?”The study does not appear to be looking at whether the vaccine is more effective at birth, which Jacobs said was “concerning” as “nowhere in this do they say that they’re going to study the efficacy of the vaccine itself.”Instead, the trial will examine whether there are “overall health effects” – not specific outcomes, such as preventing infection from the virus – when the shot is given at birth,accordingto the Bandim Health Project.“This announcement has set alarm bells ringing in the global health community,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, calling it a symptom of “a policy desperately searching for evidence”.“It is not clear what the research question is. It seems to be about the safety of the vaccine rather than its effectiveness, but both are already well-established, and to undertake such a study in a population where almost one in five of the adult population has a marker of infection seems extremely risky,” McKee said.He also questioned whether participants could truly give informed consent, given the ethical concerns about how the study is being conducted.In a recent survey, about 18% of Bissau-Guinean adults had hepatitis B, a virus that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer, especially among young children. If a baby is infected in the first year of life, there is a 90% chance they will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer; between the ages of one and five, there is a 25% chance. Among adults, about 5% have a chronic infection.In a recentstudyof toddlers in Guinea-Bissau, about 11.2% already had hepatitis B infection, which means not enough babies are getting the shots, said Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity and director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford. Across sub-Saharan Africa, only about 17% of babies receive the recommended birth dose, he added.“The priority should be to increase vaccination with the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and protect more babies from the risk posed by this virus,” Pollard said.In the US, recommending the vaccine at birth to all babies – not just those who appeared to be at risk of infection – caused rates among children to drop precipitously, from 20,000 to about 20 a year.“We virtually eliminated hepatitis B in children less than 10,” Offit said. Children may be infected at birth, but they may also come into contact with other children and adults carrying the virus – which can remain infectious on surfaces for up to a week.The experts voiced concerns about how the study would take place. It is unusual for a trial like this to take place inGuinea-Bissauinstead of the United States or Denmark, they said.“Why on Earth is this study happening in a high-endemic setting where the birth dose matters the most?” Yamey asked.In Denmark, where onlythree in 1,000people have the virus, the shot is not currently recommended at birth either, which means the same study could be conducted there. Denmark also has health registries, making it easier to access complete medical records. Instead, by working in a country with precarious healthcare and high rates of the illness, studies like this may lead to “expanding distrust in global public health”, Jacobs said.The US canceled much of its global aid and research earlier this year, Jacobs said.“In the face of the US canceling all this funding for vulnerable countries, and then it’s still going to pay for this research to be done – that is really worrying,” she said. “It seems to say we don’t value your lives enough to continue to provide support overall, but we won’t hesitate to experiment with your population.”The study is single-blinded, which means the patients will not know who got the vaccine and who didn’t, but the research team will – which can affect the way they collect and interpret the data. “This means they can stamp their own biases on the results,” Yamey said. And the endpoints – “overall health effects” – are “very squishy”, which leaves the results vulnerable to manipulation, Jacobs said.Henrik Støvring, a professor of statistics and pharmacometrics at Aarhus University who co-wrote aboutred flagsin Bandim Health Project research for the journal Vaccine this month, said “broad hypotheses like these carry a high risk of false positive findings, and in general the research group has previously been reluctant to use appropriate statistical methods to curb such a risk.”“I think conflicts of interests are always an issue when the donor so explicitly seeks out a research group and funds a study,” Støvring said.The Danish journalist Gunver Lystbæk Vestergård has alsowrittenabout major issues with research conducted by Aaby and Stabell Benn.After the CDC sparked outrage by changing the recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination with no evidence, Jacobs said, “they’re now funding this to try to give themselves cover for having done that.”“BecauseRobert F Kennedy Jris an anti-vaccine zealot, he will somehow contort that study to look like the hepatitis B birth dose causes harm” or that it is better to delay the shots, Offit said.Scientists, doctors and medical organizations are speaking out against Kennedy, he said, but “this is a political problem, and it requires a political solution.”In the meantime, children will bear the brunt of these decisions, Offit continued: “This breaks my heart. It really does. It’s hard to sleep knowing that children are constantly being put in harm’s way by the administration.”Explore more on these topicsVaccines and immunisationGuinea-BissauAfricaRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It holds a grim secret beyond the unremarkable beige brickwork – a cramped, second-floor apartment in the British capital, linked to murderous atrocities unfolding 3,000 miles south.The one-bedroom flat off north London’s Creighton Road is, according to UK government records, tied to a transnational network of companies involved in the mass recruitment of mercenaries to fight in Sudan alongside paramilitaries accused of myriadwar crimesand genocide.View image in fullscreenA Colombian mercenary in El Fasher, Sudan. Hundreds of former Colombian soldiers have been fighting with the Rapid Support Forces.Photograph: The GuardianHundreds of former Colombian military personnel have beenenlisted to fightwith Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group responsible for mass rapes, ethnic slaughter and the systematic killing of women and children.Colombian mercenaries were directly involved in the paramilitaries’ seizure of the south-western Sudanese city of El Fasher in late October, which prompted a killing frenzy that analysts say hascost at least 60,000 lives.As news of atrocities continue to mount, a Guardian investigation has found connections between the mercenaries hired to overrun El Fasher and addresses in the UK capital.View image in fullscreenThe flats in north London where Zeuz Global was registered.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianThe flat in Tottenham is registered to a company called Zeuz Global, set up by two individualsnamed and sanctioned last weekby the US treasury for hiring Colombian mercenaries to fight for the RSF.Both figures – Colombian nationals in their 50s – are described in documents at Companies House, the government register of firms operating in the UK, as living in Britain.The firm is active. The day after the US treasury announced sanctions on those behind theColombian mercenary operation– 9 December – Zeuz Global abruptly moved its operation to the very heart of London. On 10 December the firm shared “new address details”. Its new postcode matchesOne Aldwych, a five-star hotel in Covent Garden.Yet the first line of Zeuz Global’s new address is, confusingly, “4dd Aldwych,” which corresponds to theWaldorf Hiltonhotel 100 metres away.View image in fullscreenThe elegant Waldorf Hilton, a luxury hotel in central London that is almost next to One Aldwych.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianBoth hotels said they had no link to Zeuz Global and had no idea why the firm had used their postcodes.Experts say the saga raised questions over how individuals whom the US has openly censured for “their roles in fuelling the civil war in Sudan” were able to seemingly set up and run a company in the UK capital.The British foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, hascondemnedthe RSF for “systematic killings, torture and sexual violence” after the group’s seizure of El Fasher. The RSF has beenaccused by the US of genocide.Mike Lewis, a researcher and former member of theUN panel of experts on Sudan, said: “It is of major concern that the key individuals the US government claims are directing this mercenary supply have been able to set up a UK company operating from a flat in north London, and even to claim that they’re resident in the UK.”When Companies House was asked if it had any knowledge of what Zeuz Global actually did, or is doing, it did not respond. The government agency would also not confirm whether the sanctioned individuals were, in fact, resident in the UK.Contacting Zeuz proved fruitless; its website, set up in May, was labelled as “under construction” with no contact details provided.View image in fullscreenOne Aldwych, a five-star hotel on the edge of Covent Garden in central London.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianAccording to the US treasury, the man at the centre of the Colombian recruiting network for the RSF is a dual Colombian-Italian national and retired Colombian military officer based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) called Álvaro Andrés Quijano Becerra.The US treasury accuses Quijano of playing a central role in recruiting former Colombian soldiers to be deployed to Sudan using a Bogotá-based employment agency he co-founded. His wife, Claudia Viviana Oliveros Forero, was also sanctioned for owning and managing the agency.A dual Colombian-Spanish national called Mateo Andrés Duque Botero was similarly censured by the US for managing a business accused ofhandling funds and payrollfor the network hiring the Colombian fighters.“In 2024 and 2025, US-based firms associated with Duque engaged in numerous wire transfers, totalling millions of US dollars,” the US treasury statement said.On 8 April this year Duque and Oliveros registered a company in north London called ODP8 Ltd – later renamed Zeuz Global – with £10,000 capital.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Sudanese fleeing from an RSF attack on the Zamzam camp in April.Three days later, theRSF attacked Zamzam displacement camp, slaughtering more than 1,500 civilians. After its capture, the camp was handed over to Colombian mercenaries who began the preparations for attacking El Fasher, eight miles to the north.Duque and Oliveros are named in Companies House records as owning “initial shareholdings”, with the latter named as a person of “significant control” within the company.Oliveros, a 52-year-old Colombian, describes Britain as her “country of residence”.On 17 July 2025 Duque was appointed as a director and is also described as resident in the UK. The hiring of the Colombians has had a profound impact on the trajectory of the conflict, analysts say, and its nationals have trainedchildren to be soldiers, as well fighting as snipers and infantrymen.They have also served as instructors and pilots for the drones that proved instrumental in the fall of El Fasher and during fighting in Kordofan, the region borderingDarfur.Lewis said: “The war in Sudan is a hi-tech one, with guided weapons and long-range drones causing daily civilian deaths. These weapons require external help to operate. We know that the Colombian mercenary operation has been a major component of this external assistance.”View image in fullscreenRapid Support Forces paramilitaries: experts say the hi-tech weaponry used by the RSF would need outside help to operate.Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty ImagesHe added that the involvement of sanctioned individuals in a London firm underlined broader concerns over the lack of rigorous checks undertaken when companies were set up.“Having a UK company like this is a passport for criminals to do business with legitimate counterparts. It’s still harder to join a gym in most cases than to set up a UK company,” said Lewis.“As a result, there is a long, well publicised history of UK shell companies being used to broker weapons and military assistance to embargoed actors in Sudan, South Sudan, Libya, North Korea – even to Isis [Islamic State].”RSF massacres left Sudanese city ‘a slaughterhouse’, satellite images showRead moreLewis added that the issue raised concerns over what the British government was doing to ensure UK companies were not involved in the mercenary operation.A government source said therecent introductionof “mandatory identity verification” for directors and persons with significant control would provide greater assurance about who was setting up, running and controlling UK companies.New powers for Companies House, they added, had made significant progress in tackling false information entered on the register and improving support to police.The Colombians’ involvement in Sudan first emerged last year, when an investigation by the Bogotá-based outletLa Silla Vacíarevealed that more than 300 former soldiers had been contracted to fight.

Every country in the world reserves the same option. We just simply have more power than some of them.”The recentseizure of a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuelahas led to a full-scale upheaval in the “dark fleet” that ferried oil from the heavily sanctioned country, according to industry data shared with the Guardian, in a move that experts have said will cut significant revenues to Maduro’s government.Of more than 30 sanctioned tankers that operate in Venezuelan waters, many are now sheltering in the Indian Ocean in order to avoid interdiction. An analysis of their tracking data provided by Windward AI, a maritime data company, “reveals a significant shift in maritime activity, with vessels rerouting to the Indian Ocean to evade US naval forces”.Of 59 “high-risk vessels”, however, “many are trapped in the blockade zone or engaging in location manipulation,” the report said.Asked at a news conference on Friday whether the United States was planning regime change, Rubio said: “It is clear that the current status quo with the Venezuelan regime is intolerable for the United States,” he said. “So, yes, our goal is to change that dynamic.”Experts say that blockade makes a direct US attempt to unseat Maduro more likely as the Venezuelan regime is slowly starved of oil revenues from sales to China.US wargames played out scenarios for Maduro’s fall. None of them ended well for VenezuelaRead more“The blockade of these sanctioned vessels provides an additional source of leverage for the United States,” said Jason Marczak, vice-president and senior director at the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, in a recent analysis.“By cutting off a significant part of the regime’s income, the United States gains an additional chip to put on the table in discussions on ending Maduro’s dictatorship in Venezuela. This move elevates the Caribbean campaign from a counter-drug operation to one that is also cutting off the financial lifelines to Maduro, who the United States has designated as the leader of[putative drug trafficking organisation] the Cartel de los Soles.”Trump refused to say whether ousting Maduro was the ultimate goal in his military offensive, which has been escalating for four months, with about 15,000 troops positioned at Venezuela’s doorstep and attacks on vessels that have already killed more than 100 people in the Caribbean and the Pacific.But Susie Wiles, his chief of staff, said in an interview published in Vanity Fair this week that Trump “wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries uncle”, undermining the administration’s claims that law enforcement was the key goal of the US military buildup.During his news conference, Rubio confirmed that the US was trying to put pressure on Maduro through the campaign of strikes against boats that the US has said were carrying drugs.“He knows exactly what I want … He knows better than anybody,” said Trump, who added that there would be additional seizures of oil tankers, such as the Skipper last week, which was carrying about 2m barrels of heavy Venezuelan crude and was reportedly bound for China.Maduro called the seizure an act of “piracy”, and his regime, without providing details, this weekaccused the government of Trinidad and Tobago of taking part in it, on the same day the Caribbean country announced it would allow the US military access to its airports in the coming weeks following the recent installation of a radar system.Inside the White House, several top Trump aides have enthusiastically thrown their support behind more direct action in Venezuela. They include his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, who the Washington Post reported had initially pushed for an anti-drug campaign in Mexico before backing the Venezuela strikes, as well as Rubio, whose parents are Cuban immigrants, and has been a consistent critic of the Venezuelan regime for decades.“The national interest of the United States, specifically when it comes to Venezuela, is as follows,” he said. “We have a regime that’s illegitimate, that cooperates with Iran, that cooperates with Hezbollah, that cooperates with narco-trafficking and narco-terrorist organisations.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyVenezuelaAmericasTrump administrationMarco RubioDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson, Geneviève Grégoir, said price increases were influenced by factors include disruptions in the global supply chain, volatility in commodity prices, changes in international trade conditions – and retail crime.According to the Retail Council ofCanada, retail crime is on the rise and accounted for more than $9bn in lost sales in 2024.“It should be noted that as a retailer, we are the final stop in the supply chain,” Grégoire said. “The prices on store shelves directly reflect the costs of the supply chain.” Grégoire also noted that Metro in 2025 donated $1.15m and provided more than $81m in food products to food banks.Three companies control the vast majority of Canada’s grocery stores and have enjoyed record earnings in recent years. Despite governmentconcern over profiteering, while the profits are near-record levels, the companies say their profit margins are shrinking.Police told reporters they were investigating the theft, but no arrests had been made.The Robins deposited some groceries in a public square at the foot of a Christmas tree on Tuesday evening, adding that the rest would be distributed through community food banks.“Don’t forget – the hunger justifies the means,” the group wrote. “Merry Christmas!”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Two police officers were killed on Tuesday inCali.Colombian rebels warn civilians of military drills amid ‘imperialist’ Trump threatsRead more“I categorically reject the ELN’s terrorist action using drones and launching of explosive devices against a Military Base … with the regrettable loss of 6 of our soldiers and at least about 28 soldiers wounded,” Pedro Sánchez, Colombia’s defense minister, wrote on social media early on Friday.Videos circulating on social media showed wounded soldiers being brought into a local medical center on stretchers and in wheelchairs, and a fire reportedly caused by explosions at the military outpost.In October, the United States imposed sanctions on Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s president, for his alleged reluctance to target armed cocaine-trafficking factions.After taking power in 2022, Petro, himself a former guerrilla, attempted toengage well-armed cocaine-producing groups in talks,rather than conduct open warfare. But negotiations faltered.Washington, conducting a campaign against alleged narco-trafficking off the coast of Venezuela, has warned Petro that he could “be next” over his country’s cocaine production.Colombia is the world’s top cocaine producer, according to the UN.The ELN, which is present in over a fifth of Colombia’s 1,100-plus municipalities,vowed last week to fight for Colombia’s “defense” in the face of US “threats of imperialist intervention”.The group has also built a growing presence in neighbouring Venezuela, where it is present in eight of the country’s 24 states, expanding its finances, territorial control and political influence, according to the Insight Crime research center.While professing to be driven by leftist, nationalist ideology, the ELN is deeply involved in the drug trade and has become one of the region’s most powerful organized crime groups.Explore more on these topicsColombiaVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The ancient forests hold groves of alerce trees that sprouted about 1,000BC, four centuries before the rise of the Roman empire.The newly acquired lands hold 11% of the remaining alerce forests on Earth. Logged for their solid, water-resistant trunk, alerce wood was fashioned into ship masts and telephone poles.View image in fullscreenThe thick reddish bark on the alerce tree allows it to survive forest fires, droughts and 11ft of annual rainfall.Photograph: Marcelo SalazarSparsely populated by a few remote homestead camps and rustic campgrounds, the Cochamó Valley is surrounded by 3,200ft (970 metre) granite cliffs that in 1997 lured climbers seeking the first ascent of rock faces on Cerro Trinidad.In 2012, rancher families and lone cowboys living in the valley joined forces with tour operators, NGOs, climbers, backpackers and explorers invociferous opposition to a $400m hydroelectric planthat included 150-metre transmission towers, access roads and complete disruption of the rural way of life along the Manso River. The communities then worked together to stop a high-end vacation home development and plans to pave roads through the valley.“Our goal was to transform threats into opportunities,” said José Claro, the president of Puelo Patagonia.Claro described how one large-scale project after another was stymied by Puelo Patagonia and the local community working together.The conservation campaigns highlighted Cochamó’s importance as a biological corridor that could connect to the surrounding 1.6m hectares of protected lands in Chile and Argentina. A coalition of local and foreign NGOs known as Conserva Puchegüín then began recruiting donors to fund long-term conservation strategies.Location mapThe valley receives over 3 metres of rain a year, making industrial agriculture virtually impossible. Cattle grazing is difficult as the mountain slopes are nearly vertical.Except for a few cave drawings attributed to native peoples from present-day Argentina who migrated along riverbanks, this corner of northern Patagonia reveals few signs of longstanding human habitation.These never-logged forests and free-flowing turquoise rivers are a field biologist’s paradise. The area teems with ferns the size of beach umbrellas. The undergrowth of native bamboo makes bushwhacking through this temperate rainforest nearly impossible, even with a machete.The dense underbrush prevents many larger mammals from migrating through the valley. Local species of deer known as puduhave adapted so they are rarely taller than 40cm.View image in fullscreenChilean cowboys often lead pack horses into Cochamó Valley with saddles and sacks filled with food and supplies.Photograph: Valentina Thenoux“You think about those trees being cut down or the valley flooded. It’s just terrifying,” said Alex Taylor, the chief executive of Cox Enterprises, who was first introduced to Cochamó in early 2025 by fellow fly fisher Yvon Chouinard, the founder of the clothing company Patagonia.Taylor returned to Atlanta with an idea for the James M Cox Foundation to support the protection of the valley. The other trustees agreed and approved a $20m donation.“It’s almost like the spiritual centre of the universe from a forest biodiversity standpoint,” said Taylor. “I can’t think of a place more pristine.”View image in fullscreenHikers and climbers who manage to reach the peaks inside Cochamó Valley are treated to a panoramic view of the many unclimbed peaks inside the future park.Photograph: Valentina ThenouxThe successful fundraising campaign to buy the land is the beginning of what is likely to be a decades-long project to conserve the homesteader way of life and the valley’s rich biodiversity.“How do we ensure that traditional living and practices that have been going on for the better part of a century or more don’t get disrupted?” said Alex Perry, the Latin America general manager for Patagonia, which has been funding local conservation groups in the Cochamó Valley for more than a decade and in 2024 donated $4m through the company’s non-profit owner, Holdfast Collective.“How do we make it so that this model is something that can be replicated and scaled and is attractive to the next generation?”While the 133,000 hectares may eventually be donated to the Chilean national park system, recently passed environmental legislation in Chile created a system that secures permanent protection of designated areas even when the land remains in private ownership.As the valley’s popularity surges among hikers, climbers and horseback riders, a limit of 15,000 visitors a year has been set.Reservations are now requiredand a master plan of hiking trails, base camps and horse stables is being developed with direct participation from the local communities.“The beauty of the Pucheguín project is that it’s coming with an endowment,” said Anne Deane, the president of the Freyja Foundation which helped fund land purchases in the valley and recruited additional funders including the Wyss Foundation. “Cochamó is only going to get more and more popular, so it’s very important that there is an operating budget to support it.”Using camera traps and through collaboration with residents, a survey of the area’s wildlife has begun. A small herd of Chile’s national symbol, the now-endangered huemul deer, was recently discovered.View image in fullscreenA pair of endangered huemul deer grazing in Cochamó Valley.Photograph: Benjamin ValenzuelaThere are no roads through the valley and electricity is generated house by house through solar or wind. The homes are often rough cabins set on riverbanks, allowing small motorboats to navigate up and down the Puelo River. Pack horses still haul in most food and supplies.The Cochamó conservation project was inspired by thelandmark conservation efforts of Kris and Doug Tompkins, who abandoned successful leadership roles at the Patagonia and Esprit clothing companies respectively, moved to a remote cabin in Patagonia anddedicated 25 years and $300mto creating national parks in Chile and Argentina.By buying massive swathes of land and then negotiating with the Chilean government to expand its existing parks, the Tompkins conservation group – now known asRewilding Chile– helped protect more than 5.7m hectares of wildlands.The path to becoming a park may be different in Cochamó. The measly budget allocated for national parks in Chile – highlighted by therecent deaths of five hikers in Torres del Paine national park– has convinced many conservation advocates to look at creating private parks that combine conservation with low impact commercial operations such as family farms or asolar-powered craft brewery.The plans for Cochamó are to place at least 80% in protected national park level status, while the remaining 20% will be zoned for multiple use, allowing locals to earn a living off tourism and traditional activities such as family farms and their small ranches.View image in fullscreenThere are no roads through the valley and electricity is generated house by house through solar or wind.Photograph: Rodrigo MannsOn a recent hike through Cochamó, the connection between conservation and community was evident.A Chilean cowboy hauling a horse piled high with fruits, vegetables and canned food stopped to share news. His horse was pregnant. Rex, a neighbour’s dog, needed medicine. The remote bridge washed away by the floods was nearly rebuilt.Stopping to chat in the cool fern forest, the cowboy spoke with excitement about the German tourists he would that evening be guiding down the mountain, on a path that his father helped build and that his children might one day continue to use and preserve.This article was amended on 19 December 2025. An earlier version said the valley was purchased for $78m; however, this was the amount raised by environmental groups. The land was bought for $63m.Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasNational parksnewsShareReuse this content"

Several people were also injured.The suspected assailant is among the dead after he fell from a building during a police chase through a busy shopping district on Friday evening.One of the victims was killed as they tried to stop the attack inside Taipei’s Main station, according to the city’s mayor, Chiang Wan-an.The suspected attacker has been described as a 27-year-old man from Taoyuan, a northern county in Taiwan. He was reportedly an air force volunteer soldier who had served near Taipei’s Songshan airport in a radio communication team but was discharged in 2022.Taiwan’s premier, Cho Jung-tai, told reporters that the suspected attacker had a prior criminal record and outstanding warrants. Local media reported he was wanted by the local prosecutor’s office for obstructing military service in 2024 due to his failure to report on duty.Cho described the incident as a “deliberate attack”, although by late Friday night the motive remained unknown.Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, said in a statement there would be heightened security across the country and that there would be “no leniency”.The attack started at Taipei Main station on Friday afternoon. The attacker allegedly threw smoke grenades inside the station at the peak of rush hour, before making his way to nearby Zhongshan.One video filmed by a bystander showed the young man in the middle of the main road outside Zhongshan subway station, a popular late-night and shopping district. He was wearing a black T-shirt and shorts, sneakers, a mask and some protective equipment.He appeared to have other weapons including at least one other knife strapped to his chest.The video shows him pulling smoke grenades from a bag on the ground and casually throwing them towards crowds gathered on the sidewalk, keeping their distance. He is then seen running across the road and into a shopping mall, randomly slashing at people with a long knife as he runs.Another clip shows him inside what appears to be Taipei Main station, pulling smoke grenades from a wheeled suitcase and calmly throwing them. Other clips show one of the underground stations filled with smoke, and people being evacuated out of buildings.“The scene was terrifying and smelled awful,” said one resident, who posted videos to social media.Two men who were working in a nearby fast food chain told local media they had heard screaming from outside and could smell the smoke. One said people had started running into the restaurant asking if they could hide inside, adding that they all took shelter behind the cashier.Violent crime is relatively rare in Taiwan, but in the past couple of years a number of stabbing attacks on the metro have raised fears. Some trains now carry instructional videos on how people can disarm attackers with umbrellas and fire extinguishers.In 2014, a college student killed four people and injured more than 20 in a stabbing spree on the Taipei metro. The student was executed for the killings in 2016. Last year, on the 10-year anniversary of the 2014 incident, three people were injured in a mass stabbing incident in Taichung, Taiwan’s second-largest city.Photos published by local media revealed a burned-out bag full of what appeared to be unused molotov cocktails. The smoke grenades pictured are replica US military equipment and advertised for sale online in Taiwan, but did not appear to be available on the website when the Guardian checked after the attack. An affiliated store on a separate shopping platform was taken down on Friday night.One prominent seller of the equipment told the Guardian they had checked their sales records after the incident and were not aware of any high volume or unusual sales that suggested the attacker had bought the grenades from them. They said the items were “intended for lawful uses such as outdoor activities, training or signalling, and not for violent purposes”.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsTaiwanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The group has been “accused of targeting politicians and groups critical of the Chinese government”, the newspaper said.A government spokesperson told the Guardian: “We have been working to investigate a cyber incident. We take the security of our systems and data extremely seriously.”Although little is known about Storm 1849, it has been linked to a hacking campaign named ArcaneDoor first detected in 2024. Its victims have included government networks, according to the US tech firm Cisco, which had its technology targeted in those attacks.Ciscoissued an updated alertabout ArcaneDoor activity in late September, shortly before the Foreign Office hack reportedly took place. It has said the attacks have shown the hallmarks of a “sophisticated state-sponsored actor”.Toby Lewis, the global head of threat analysis at the UK cybersecurity company Darktrace, said it would be “reasonable” to suggest the ArcaneDoor and Whitehall attacks might be linked.“It would be fair to say these two things happened broadly at the same time and it would be a reasonable hypothesis to suggest they are linked,” he said.Lewis added that Chinese state-backed actors are known to target large sets of data. In 2024 the governmentblamed Chinafor ahack of the UK’s Electoral Commission, in whichaccesswas gained to the personal information of approximately 40 million people.“We do see some Chinese threat groups targeting datasets that might serve a benefit to Beijing in the future,” said Lewis.‘The frontline is everywhere’: new MI6 head to warn of growing Russian threatRead moreBryant said the investigation could take “quite a long time” to identify the attacker.He said: “We managed to close the hole, as it were, very quickly. There was a technical issue in one of our sites, I gather, and we’re fairly confident there’s a low risk of any individual actually being affected by this.“I know that some of the reports have said potentially various things could happen. I think that’s a bit more speculation than is helpful. So I don’t want to scaremonger. We are on top of it. And also, it’s not entirely clear where this has come from. I know everybody’s speculating about that as well.”Asked ifChinawas behind the attack, Bryant said: “That’s not entirely clear.””Explore more on these topicsForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeCybercrimeHackingInternetChris BryantChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The company has consistently denied the allegations.During Joe Biden’s administration, Congress passed legislation prohibiting ByteDance from retaining operational ties with TikTok US. However, the national security law gave the US president the power to decide whether any deal met its requirements.Trump has approved the joint venture that will control TikTok’s US business.Under the new structure Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX will each control 15%. Existing ByteDance investors will take 30.1%, while ByteDance will own 19.9% – the maximum permitted under US foreign ownership laws. The remaining 5% will be held by as-yet-unnamed new investors.The US joint venture will be overseen by a seven-member board of directors, the majority of whom will be American, according to Chew’s staff memo.“Upon the closing, the US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organisation, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” he added.In September, the Trump administration said a framework agreement had been reached after abreakthrough in negotiationsbetween US and Chinese officials.JD Vance, the US vice-president, said at the time that the deal would value TikTok’s US joint venture at $14bn.Under the arrangement, Oracle will oversee the algorithm that recommends videos in US users. The system will be retrained using US data to “ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation”, Chew’s memo states.China will retain control of the algorithm, with the country’s cybersecurity regulator previously saying it had agreed that any TikTok US deal would include “licensing … and other intellectual property rights”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Currently, the scheme covers only hair loss caused by medical reasons, such as alopecia areata. Most treatments for common male pattern baldness remain excluded from coverage.“There may be young people who think it’s unfair that they only pay insurance premiums and can’t receive benefits,” Lee said, noting that the “sense of alienation” among them had become severe.The presidentfirst proposedthe policy as a candidate during his unsuccessful 2022 presidential election campaign, when it drew criticism as populist pandering, but dropped it from his most recent election platform.The proposal has highlighted South Korea’s intense cultural focus on physical appearance. A2024 surveyof young adults found that 98% of respondents believe attractive people receive social benefits.The cultural pressure is particularlydemandingand acute for women, who face strict expectations about makeup, skincare andbody shape.For men, the issue is less openly discussed, but some with a receding hairline opt to grow out their fringes to disguise hair loss, or seek expensive treatments.South Korea’s hair-loss treatment market was thought to beworth around 188bn won (£95m)in 2024, and industry groups claim that of a population of more than 51 million, around 10 million experience hair loss, though this figure has never beenofficially verified.Hair-loss shampoos are particularly popular, though in recent years some products have faced criticism over their claims of effectiveness.The timing of Lee’s proposal is particularly sensitive because South Korea’s health insurance system faces mounting financial pressure. Recentinternal projectionssuggest the system could reportedly face deficits as large as 4.1tn won (£2.1bn) in 2026.Medical professionals have reacted with scepticism to the idea.The influential Korean Medical Association said that “rather than investing health insurance finances in hair loss treatment coverage, prioritising coverage for cancer and other serious diseases would better align with health insurance principles.”Conservative newspapers have been particularly critical. The Chosun Ilbo arguedin its editorialthat “this is not something the president should suddenly instruct without collecting opinions from citizens who pay insurance premiums.”Health minister Jeong Eun Kyeong expressed caution about the proposal, interpreting Lee’s “survival” claim as referring to young people’s confidence during job searches and the impact on mental health.When askedon a radio show whether extending coverage would substantially affect health insurance finances, Jeong replied: “I think so,” and noted that expanded coverage would require a comprehensive analysis.Former conservative lawmaker Yoon Hee-sook, who has a relative undergoing cancer treatment,wrote on Facebookthat while she sympathises with young people’s hair-loss stress, “prioritising treatments directly connected to life and bodily function represents the current social consensus.”Park Joo-min, a ruling party MP who has publicly discussed his hair transplant procedure and is known for his advocacy on hair-loss issues,posted“truly Korea!” on X in an apparent endorsement.Separately on Friday, Leeinstructedthe fair trade commission to investigate the price of menstrual pads, claiming they are 39% more expensive than in other countries due to possible monopolistic practices.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaLee Jae MyungAsia PacificMen's hairnewsShareReuse this content"

But on land tensions frayJewish voices say an attack of this kind was entirely predictable given the surge in antisemitic attacks in Australia since 2023Ben DohertyFri 19 Dec 2025 15.39 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 18.20 ESTShareThe sun rises early at this time of year, hitting the south of the beach first before chasing the shadows north, the gradual retreat of the darkness to the light.Hanukah, the Jewish festival of lights, was being celebrated here on Sunday evening, when the darkness came brutally roaring back.At dawn on Friday,people came in their thousands, in their many colours and their many tribes, to be back in the sea.“In this time of darkness, let’s spread light, love and compassion,” the crowd was urged, before thousands took surfboards and rescue boards, or simply swam out to join together in a mammoth circle in the sea, facing the middle of the beach.That solidarity is holding, for now. In the water, it feels strong and loving.But back on land, acrossSydneyand the rest of Australia, that unity is taut and fragile. Undercurrents of political division, of a politicisation of a community’s grief, of a fraying social cohesion, are breaking through the surface.The water helps to forget. But some things cannot be undone.Fifteen innocents were shot dead here in minutes by high-powered rifles allegedly carried by the father and son, Sajid and Naveed Akram. Sajid was shot dead. Naveed was shot too, but survived. From hospital,he has been charged with dozens of offences, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder.View image in fullscreenThe park footbridge at Bondi, a scene of violence less than a week ago, has reopened.Photograph: Steve Markham/APThe footbridge from where the gunmen fired has been reopened. On the wall, someone has sketched a menorah in chalk. There is a bee drawn too,in remembrance of the youngest victim, 10-year-old Matilda.But the bridge that was once the passage of thousands of innocent visits to the beach each day will be forever marked now. A stain that cannot be erased, a memory that cannot be forgotten.The park too: the site of Hanukah events for years, the place of kids’ birthday parties and work barbecues and scratch games of cricket, where exhausted City to Surf runners sprawl on the grass after the finish of Sydney’s classic 14km run and van-life nomads hang their washing.Bondi has long been the spiritual home of Sydney’s Jews. Now it will be a place of remembrance and grief | Michael VisontayRead moreA city on high alertThe attack was recorded on dozens of phone and dashboard cameras. The calm cruelty of the shooters, firing round after pitiless round into a defenceless crowd of men, women and children lighting candles in celebration of their faith.At one point one can be seen to halt firing at the Hanukah celebration, turning back towards the road.He appears to gesture at people off-camera to wave them away but he does not raise his weapon. He does not fire.He turns around, and starts firing again.Dozens of Jewish voices have said an attack of this sort, aimed specifically at Jews, in the heart of a Jewish community, wasentirely predictable, if not inevitable.0:47Hundreds return to waters of Bondi Beach in paddle-out tribute to victims of mass shooting – videoAustralia has seen asurge in antisemitic attackssince 2023 – including an arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue – some domestic in origin, some allegedlyorchestrated by organised crime, others allegedlyengineered from Iran.For many outside Australia’s Jewish community, these were seen as isolated events, the vile work of a deranged fringe, of outliers and the alienated.But for those within the community, this was very different: this was a coordinated series of assaults on their very being, overlaid with dark historical memories.There was ashrinking space to be Jewishin this country.As those attacks roiled the country, Eli Schlanger, assistant rabbi of theBondiChabad, urged his congregation: “In the fight against antisemitism the way forward is to be more Jewish, act more Jewish, and appear more Jewish.”Schlanger organised the Hanukah by the Sea event on Sunday night.His was the first body to be identified.His youngest child is three months old.Mass killings are exceedingly rare in Australia. The Bondi attacks have drawn immediate comparison withthe Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania in 1996, in which 35 people were killed.But this attack is different, and it has taken place in a different Australia, a place more divided, more politically tribalised, less able to find consensus and common ground.View image in fullscreenA poster of 10-year-old Matilda, the youngest victim of the Bondi Beach shooting. She was buried on Thursday.Photograph: David Gray/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the aftermath of Port Arthur, the conservative prime minister, John Howard, had broad political support for sweeping gun control reforms, including bans on semi-automatic and automatic weapons, and a government-funded compulsory buyback that took 650,000 firearms off the streets.Australia’s current prime minister, Anthony Albanese, hasannounced a similar measure, but faces a different political climate. Even before the first funeral, he was being directly, personally blamed for the attack.“Your government did nothing to stop the spread of antisemitism in Australia,”the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said.“You let the disease spread and the result is the horrific attacks on Jews we saw today.”The conservative former treasurerJosh Frydenberg – currently out of parliament but considered a future prime ministerial candidate – said: “Our prime minister … has allowed Australia to be radicalised on his watch.“It is time for him to accept personal responsibility for the death of 15 innocent people, including a 10-year-old child.”Sydney remains on high alert. In the south-west of the city on Thursday night,seven men were dramatically arrested– cable-tied on the side of the road – on suspicion they were driving to Bondi with an intent to commit a “violent act”. They were later released pending further investigations.On Friday, police were called tothe funeral of two Bondi victims – Boris and Sofia Gurman– over reports, ultimately false, that a man was carrying a weapon.And on the same day the NSW premierproposed sweeping anti-protest laws, including a power to effectively ban all protests where the government believes they could “add to community disharmony … a combustible situation”.View image in fullscreenFloral tributes at Bondi, where vigils have taken place daily since Sunday’s attack.Photograph: James D Morgan/Getty ImagesBefore the gun reform announcement Albanese’s plans has been criticised as an “attempted diversion” by none other than Howard himself, defying overwhelming expert opinion that, once a global gold standard,Australia’s gun laws have loosened and fractured.Sajid Akram held a licence for six high-powered rifles. His son had come to the attention of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisationas long as six years ago, according to police, because of “associations” with known preachers of Islamist extremism.On Sunday, Sajid Akram packed four of his six rifles in a car and drove with them to Bondi. Until he opened fire on innocents he had not broken any laws.‘An Aussie hero’Amid the fierce debate around antisemitism, social cohesion and political unity, it appeared symbolic that the principal resistor of an attack on a Jewish festival wasan Arabic-speaking, Syrian-born Muslim.As the gunmen fired into the crowd, Ahmed al-Ahmed, unarmed but unhesitating, risked his life to save the lives of others unknown to him.Phone camera footage shows him lunging at the elder Akram and wrestling his rifle from him. Ahmed menaces the disarmed Akram with his own weapon, forcing the shooter backwards. But he does not shoot, instead, he lays the firearm gently against a tree.1:52Prime minister meets the ‘Australian hero’ Ahmed al-Ahmed in hospital – videoAhmed’s actions represent an image Australia has clung to, has celebrated, of the diverse, multicultural country it aspires to be.“Ahmed al-Ahmed represents the best of our country,” the prime minister said of the father of two, newly a citizen of his adopted homeland.At Ahmed’s modest tobacconists by a suburban train station, friends have laid flowers bearing messages: “thank you”, “we love you”.One reads “you are an Aussie hero”. A sign taped to his door says, “we are so very proud of you”.The footage of Ahmed’s intervention made a stark contrast set against the savage violence.‘We are all human beings first’: Jews and Muslims embrace at vigils for those killed in Bondi beach terror attackRead moreAs he walked towards the gunfire, he turned to his cousin. “I’m going to die,” he said. “Please see my family and tell them that I went down to save people’s lives.”Ahmed did not die. But he was shot five times. He faces rounds of surgery and months of recovery.As the sun rose over the sand at Bondi on Friday morning, Rabbi Yosef Eichenblatt urged defiance in the face of terror.“They want us to be afraid,” he said. “We need to be more joyful, more brave.”Hanukah, he told those gathered on the beach, celebrates the victory of light over darkness.“We need to bring more light into the world … even in the darkest of times, we can always light a candle.”In Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, andGrieflineon 1300 845 745.

He has spoken toSteven Gallant, who was on day release from prison when he used a chair to help bring down the attacker,Usman Khan, who had killed two people. “He said he reacted on instinct, whereas I was thinking about every action and consequence of it,” Frost said.When the London Bridge attack unfolded inside the hall on 29 November 2019, Frost said chaos and confusion took hold. “There was screaming, noise, no one knew what was going on and I imagine it would have been the same on Bondi Beach.”View image in fullscreenDarryn Frost: ‘I can still remember the flecks of dust in the air.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianRunning towards danger, he insisted, was not a natural impulse. “I don’t think it comes naturally to anyone. I sawSaskia[Jones, who was killed by the attacker] fall to the stairs, and she was very clearly severely injured. So the next thought in my mind was: ‘I need to prevent that from happening to anyone else’.”He said what followed felt unreal: “It’s crazy, but this was all happening in split seconds. It really is like the Superman or Spider-Man movies, or the Matrix, where time literally slows down for you.”He said his senses narrowed to a single point: the attacker. “I had tunnel vision,” he recalled. “My hearing switched off to everything around me except for the perpetrator in front of me. It’s a really strange thing. Sirens, alarms were going off, I couldn’t even hear that. All I could hear was what he was saying and anything that he did, my hearing just became super fine-tuned.“My vision went tunnel vision just on to him so anything in the periphery I couldn’t see at all, and what I could see was super-high detail like an 8K TV. I can still remember the flecks of dust in the air.”A neuroscientist, Dr Daniel Glaser, said humans, like all mammals, exhibit a natural “fight or flight” response to threat or surprise, but it does not dictate the course of action they choose.“It prepares your muscles, and to some extent your brain, for action, but the action that you take depends on a bunch of other things,” he said.“How you perceive what’s happening changes what you’ll do, and your perceptions are driven by prejudice and expectations. Your sense of what’s happening depends on what you expect to be happening and how you read different situations.“You shouldn’t necessarily think about it as a choice. There’s very good evidence to say that lots of things in the brain which determine your behaviour happen before you’re aware of them.”He said the kind of bravery that caused people to run towards danger while others were running away was guided not by “instinct”, but by life experiences and any training they may have had.Earlier this week,Dan Barr, a former soldier, was hailed as a hero for jumping into the car of Paul Doyle, who drove into crowds of pedestrians at the Liverpool FC parade.View image in fullscreenDan Barr.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAProf Craig Jackson, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society, who has a specialist interest in gun violence and mass killings, said there was no “profile” of the kind of person who would “have a go”.“It’s just as likely to be an angry mum in defence mode as it could be a fit, healthy rugby-playing male,” said the professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University. “That’s reassuring because that means that attackers, either lone wolves or terrorists, they’re never quite sure who’s going to be the hero who could challenge them.”During the London Bridge attack in 2017Roy Larner, 56, a football fan, was stabbed in his hands, chest and head as he tried to fight off three knife-wielding terrorists with his fists.“Fuck you, I’m Millwall,” he shouted after Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba burst into the Black and Blue steakhouse.View image in fullscreenRoy Larner pictured around 2017.Photograph: Facebook“They’d come in and kicked the door open, and that’s when the three of them started stabbing me. I started fighting back with them, but it gave that 20 or 30 people a chance to get out in front of me. It nearly cost me my life,” he recalled.“I was fighting for my life. Punching and punching and punching. [I was stabbed] eight times and slashed in the head as well. They were slicing me, stabbing me. I broke my ribs when I went back into the table. But luckily – my arm’s a bit weak still – but nothing major. It’s only the trauma side of it that really hurt me.”Larner, who was hailed the “Lion of London Bridge”, said he made a split-second decision to intervene.“You should run. [But] you can be an idiot and take three on,” he said. “There was an older bloke with us, about 78, and I think that was the reason why I stood there. But obviously it gave other people a chance to get out as well.”Larner, who lives in Peckham, south London, was not formally recognised for his bravery and didnot receive compensationfor his injuries. He said it was because he had convictions, including for racially aggravated common assault.Despite this, he said he would not hesitate to intervene again. “I’ve never had any boxing training or anything like that. [But] I’ve done something good. Whether that makes up for the bad things I’ve done, who knows?”Explore more on these topicsPsychologyBondi beach terror attackLondon Bridge terror attack 2019London Bridge attack 2017NeurosciencefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her research found “the harm the UK puberty-blocker ban has caused is truly appalling”.“These are young people living in abject misery and severe distress, unable to lead normal lives and socialise with their peers at a crucial time as they are developing into adults,” Kennedy told Guardian Australia.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“The psychological harm they were experiencing was very significant and included extreme levels of stress, anxiety, fear, trauma and increased suicidal ideation.”Her study,published in the Journal of Gender Studies in June, found that these harms were constant, pervasive and all-encompassing.After bans were introduced in Queensland andNew Zealand, Kennedy said her “initial response was of absolute horror”.“This ban will harm trans children,” she said.“Not might, may or could. Will.“Some … will take their own lives. They [politicians and policymakers] may choose to ignore this inconvenient fact, but their actions will be directly responsible for harming children.”The Queensland situationAsked about the Cass review in 2024, Queensland’s then health minister, Shannon Fentiman, described the state’s Children’s Gender Service as “one of the best in the country” and said “all trans young people deserve access to high-quality and timely healthcare”.But after defeating her Labor party at an election later that year, the Liberal National governmentissued a directive blocking doctors in the public system from prescribing puberty blockersor hormones for gender dysphoria in new young patients.Then, in November, the New Zealand governmentannounced a similar ban, only todelay its introductionpendingajudicial review.Rachel Hinds is the chief executive of the Open Doors Youth Service, which offers mental health support and help accessing healthcare to the LGBTQ+ community. She said was given no notice ahead of Queensland’s puberty blocker ban.“We’re now supporting a number of families who have their young people on suicide watch,” Hinds said.“I was talking to one mum after the pause on puberty blockers, who was just was sobbing down the phone to me and saying: ‘The goalposts have changed for us now. We just need to keep her alive’.“It is taking an incredible toll.”Puberty blockers pause the onset of puberty and prevent the development of associated physical characteristics. This is fully reversible and gives adolescents time to explore their gender identity before any further steps are taken.Gender-affirming hormones such as oestrogen or testosterone, which produce physical changes aligned with the young person’s gender identity, may also be prescribed. Some effects of hormone treatment are irreversible without surgical intervention.Governments implementing bans have cited concerns over the quality of evidence regarding long-term effects of puberty blockers, adopting a precautionary approach.A spokesperson for Queensland’s health minister, Tim Nicholls, said that “in light of the divergent and inconclusive evidence around the world”, the government had appointed psychiatrist Dr Ruth Vine “to lead an independent team to investigate and report on the evidence and to provide policy advice for consideration”.Despite Vine finding that with proper and cautious oversight, standards and appropriate reporting, “there can be benefit for a young person in being able to access puberty blockers,” Nichollsextended the ban until 2031.‘Evidence’ limitationsWhat the Cass review – and governments in the UK, Queensland and New Zealand – appear to have ignored is that most paediatric medicine operates on a low to moderate-quality evidence base, according to the paediatrician and biomedical researcher, associate professor Ken Pang.This is because conducting large studies in children is often impossible, unethical or unfeasible – in part because there may not be enough children with a certain condition.“Those of us working in the field readily acknowledge the need for more high-quality evidence to continue to strengthen care further,” said Pang, from Murdoch Children’s Research Institute.“But it’s important to realise that the quality of evidence in this field is similar to that of most other areas of child health.“This continual focus on the evidence completely disregards the other two pillars of evidence-based medicine, which are patient values and clinical expertise.“If politicians and policymakers are interested in families’ best interests and in promoting best practice health care, then they need to up-lift the voices of the young people, parents and clinicians with knowledge and direct experience in this field.”Pang is a member oftheNational Health and Medical Research Council’s gender guidelines development committee,which is drafting recommendations for the care of trans and gender diverse children with gender dysphoria. He said he was commenting based on his clinical experience, and that his views do not necessarily reflect those of the committee.“Many of the people who criticise gender-affirming care have never actually worked with transgender young people, but that doesn’t stop them from claiming to be experts in the area,” Pang said.“I know that if I was diagnosed with cancer, then I’d be seeking advice from an oncologist, not listening to some other random doctor.”Thishas led to misinformation, including that providing access to puberty blocking and hormone medications to gender-questioning children is a standard form of treatment and “too easy” to access, Pang said.Butdocuments released under freedom of information lawsfrom the Australian department of health show that puberty blocker prescriptions are not routine treatments for youth with gender dysphoria or incongruence.The documents cite an independent review of Queensland’s gender clinic, which found out of the total cohort of children and adolescents who attended an initial session at the clinic between February 2023 and April 2023, most (71%) had not been prescribed gender-affirming hormone treatment and puberty blockers at least 12 months later.The review also found the service to be safe, evidence-based and consistent with national and international guidelines.What implications does England’s review of trans healthcare have for Australia?Read moreSimilarly, only 23% of those attending a large clinic in Victoria over a 10-year period had started puberty blockers.The documents note that the UK’s Commission on Human Medicines recommended ongoing restrictions on prescribing puberty blockers due to insufficient evidence for this specific use, not because of any new safety concerns.The medicines themselves remain safely used for conditions such as precocious puberty, endometriosis and fertility preservation during cancer treatment, the commission found.“There are now trans people in their late 40s who were prescribed puberty blockers [as children], so if there were any significant long-term harm caused, we would know about it by now,” Kennedy said.Politicisation fearsResearch has also foundfast access to gender-affirming care is crucialfor those who need it.But in recent years, healthcare for gender-questioning youth has become increasingly politicised, and misinformation is rampant, making it more difficult for youth to access care when they need it, said Dr Ronita Nath, the vice-president of research at the Trevor Project.The organisation is the leading nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth mental health in the US. In 2024,a first-of-its kind studyco-authored by Nath found state-level anti-transgender laws in the US had led to a direct increase in recent suicide attempts among a sample of more than 61,000 youths.“It’s understandable to have questions,” Nath said.“However, stripping young people of this life-saving care only results in causing them harm.“It is deeply disappointing to see lawmakers, in any country or community, take action to prevent transgender and non-binary young people from receiving access to best-practice medical care.”In Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

It is idiotic. It is cruel. It is bone‑headed. It just should not be happening.”Croucher agreed Kylie Stott, 40, Dimitri D’Elio, 27, and Danny Clarke, 41 – who were accused of kidnapping and murdering 19-year-old Charlie Gander and burning his body – could not receive a fair trial in Shepparton because they were too tired to meaningfully follow the trial and give instructions.The judge noted the severity of their alleged crimes when he questioned why police would wake them up continuously throughout the night.“These people are on trial for murder, the most serious crime in the criminal calendar, as well as kidnapping and arson,” Croucher said.“It is unthinkable in today’s world, to me at least, that police would engage in such behaviour all dressed up in the name of welfare.“If it is truly aimed at welfare, it is a complete and utter overreaction to completely different sets of circumstances that obtained in the inquests which, I was told, were the catalyst for these changes.”Croucher made the criticisms of police on 27 May but they were only made public this week because his reasons for moving the trial could not be published until after it had finished.D’Elio was found guilty of murder, kidnapping and arson, Stott was found guilty of kidnapping and manslaughter, and Clarke was found guilty of kidnapping.Clarke was sentenced on Monday while D’Elio and Stott are due to be sentenced in February,the ABC reported.Explore more on these topicsAustralian police and policingVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

He was speaking during his annual call-in show with the nation, a carefully choreographed event that has become a fixture of Russia’s political calendar.0:41Ukraine launches drone attack on Russian oil tanker in Mediterranean – videoThe marathon broadcast, which lasted more than four hours, allows journalists and hand-picked members of the public to put questions directly to the president, projecting an image of openness while the agenda remains tightly controlled.A source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said Friday’s attack was a “new, unprecedented special operation”. However, they did not give further details of the attack, including how the SBU deployed a drone in the Mediterranean, from where it was launched, or which countries the drones could have flown over.The source said the cargo ship was empty at the time and no environmental threat resulted from the operation. The Ukrainian official did not say how the drones reached the ship, but said the operation involved “multi-stage” measures.They claimed the tanker, identified as the Qendil, had “sustained critical damage and cannot be used for its intended purpose”. The tanker was being used to circumvent western sanctions and fund Russia’s war chest, they claimed, making it “an absolutely legitimate target”.“The enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop, and will strike them anywhere in the world, wherever they may be,” the source added.The British maritime risk-management group, Vanguard, said: “This development reflects a stark expansion of Ukraine’s use of uncrewed aerial systems against maritime assets associated with Russia’s sanctioned oil export network.”Speaking to the online outlet Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian official justified the strike. “This tanker was used to circumvent sanctions and earn money that was used for the war against Ukraine. Therefore, from the point of view of international law and the laws and customs of war, this is an absolutely legitimate target for the SBU. The enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop and will beat him anywhere in the world, wherever he is.”According to Vessel Finder, the tankerwas last in port in Suez, Egypt, on 16 December and was off the coast of Libya when it turned back.Kyiv has claimed similar hits on Russia-linked tankers off Turkey’s Black Sea coast, after two empty oil tankers were hit by explosions.The Ukrainian attacks follow increasingly aggressive efforts by a number of countries against shadow fleet activities.This month, US forces boarded a sanctions-hit shadow tanker off Venezuela, and the Trump administration hasannounced a blockade of other shadow tankers in the countryas part of Donald Trump’s apparent efforts to force regime change.European countries have also boosted efforts against shadow tankers operating in their waters amid mounting concern over the security and environmental threat posed by the ageing vessels, which often travel without automatic identification systems to avoid being tracked.During the press conference Putin struck to his familiar hard-line on the war in Ukraine, reiterating the Kremlin’s determination to continue fighting until all of its conditions are met.The Russian leader insisted that Moscow had no plans to invade Europe, before adding that there would be no new “special military operations” provided Russia was treated with respect and “not deceived”. Putin also called the use of frozen Russian central bank assets to finance Ukraine’s reconstruction “robbery” and said Moscow would pursue legal challenges, adding that it would “find a suitable jurisdiction” for any cases.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

But the solution they came up with was not the one most had wanted.More than two months ago, theEuropean Commissionfloated a plan to provide a loan to Kyiv secured against some of the €210bn of Russian central bank assets frozen in Europe, most of which are held at the Euroclear clearing house in Belgium.The idea was for the EU to borrow from Euroclear in order to lend to Ukraine.Russiawould remain the legal owner of the assets, and Kyiv would repay the loan using Russian reparations after the war, with the EU then reimbursing Euroclear.It looked neat, it was – EU lawyers argued – legally watertight, and appealed for two main reasons: it involved no new common borrowing, and there was a certain moral satisfaction in seeing Russian money help Ukraine fight off Russian aggression.There was an obstacle, however. The Belgian prime minister, Bart De Wever, argued that Moscow, which saw the plan as theft, would retaliate, and that courts in Russia-friendly jurisdictions, such as China, could order Belgian assets to be seized.Frozen assets graphicFor weeks, De Wever held out, resisting heavy pressure in particular from the commission chief,Ursula von der Leyen, and her compatriot Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, for whom the “reparations loan” was Plan A, with no Plan B.The alternative – joint borrowing – may have appealed to some southern EU countries but was strongly opposed by Berlin and its frugal northern European allies, who did not fancy underwriting more debt for already overburdened fellow member states.Up until the start of Thursday’s EU summit, leaders and diplomats were convinced De Wever – whose popularity has soared at home – would cave. Instead, he demanded unlimited cash support from every EU member in the event of any Russian claim.That was too much. And so, backed principally by Italy’s Giorgia Meloni but also increasingly by the French president,Emmanuel Macron, Plan B – using unallocated funds in the EU budget as collateral for a collective loan for Ukraine – won the day.Objections that a eurobonds alternative required unanimity were overcome, in a historic and potentially far-reaching move, by securing the backing of Eurosceptic Hungary, Slovakia and theCzech Republicin exchange for exemption.The result was first and foremost hugely important for Ukraine, which will also get its much-needed cash sooner than under Plan A. It was a political loss for von der Leyen and Merz – although the German chancellor expressed delight with the deal.It was a victory for a jubilant De Wever, who said “rationality has prevailed” and “the voice of small and medium-sized member states counts”, and good news for Eurosceptic prime ministersViktor Orbán, Andrej Babiš and Robert Fico.They can go home and boast to their populist bases that the taxpayers of, respectively, Hungary, the Czech Republic andSlovakiawill not be asked to stump up anything for Ukraine’s defence.Friday’s deal once again laid bare the deep divisions that so often hobble the EU’s decision-making, and underlined how far it still has to go to create a fully united Europe that can can act effectively and decisively in a hostile world.But the bloc did manage to pull together an agreement for an existentially important end. It may even, analysts suggested, have found a new path forward. This was a “huge deal for EU”,said Guntram Wolff, of the Bruegel economic thinktank.“If you want to do EU foreign policy, you need EU resources and debt. The European Council delivered,” he said, adding that the summit also marked, significantly, the first time that a decision on new EU debt had been reached without unanimity.Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law,agreed the dealwas “unprecedented”. Allowing willing states to move forward had never before been tried for “EU budget-backed borrowing, with selective participation in collective liability”, he said.“Debt without unanimity … Is that the long-term direction for common European resources?” asked Jeremy Cliffe, of the European Council on Foreign Relations. If it is, Thursday’s summit could go down as something of a landmark.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaGiorgia MeloniEmmanuel MacronUrsula von der LeyenFriedrich MerzViktor OrbánanalysisShareReuse this content"

But the plan hinged on the demand of Belgium, which hosts 88% of the Russian funds in the EU, to have unlimited budget guarantees from other member states if Moscow won a successful claim for damages.Frozen Russian assets graphicBelgium’s prime minister, Bart De Wever, said the reparations loan had not been a good idea. “When we explained the text again, there were so many questions that I said, ‘I told you so, I told you so.’ There are a lot of loose ends. And if you start pulling at the loose ends in the strings, the thing collapses.”Euroclear in Brussels is beingsued by the Russian central bank for $230bnwhile its top executives have also faced acampaign of intimidation orchestrated by Russian intelligence, the Guardian reported this week.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, a strong advocate of the reparations loan, said the agreement was “a decisive message because [Vladimir] Putin will only make concessions once he realises his war will not pay off”.What is the row about the EU using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine?Read moreHe said he was delighted with the outcome and that it still fulfilled his goal of using the Russian assets, because they would be used to repay the loan if Russia refused to pay reparations to Ukraine.“We just changed the timeline a bit,” Merz told reporters. “It remains the case that Russian assets will be used as a securitisation for the loan and then also for paying back the loan.”As the loan will be raised on capital markets, it will also be available more quickly to Kyiv, whereas the Russian assets plan would have required a potentially complicated sequence of legal steps. Merz said he expected the funds to be available from mid-January – well ahead of Ukraine’s cash crunch forecast for April.Merz and other supporters of the reparations loan plan had argued that funding Ukraine via the EU budget was impossible because it required unanimity.But the path was cleared when the three nationalist governments in central Europe indicated they would approve the use of the EU budget to fund Ukraine, as long as they did not have to contribute to the loan guarantees. The leaders of Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic were pictured in a trilateral meeting by the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who tweeted: “back in business!”View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz and Ursula von der Leyen  in Brussels on Thursday.Photograph: ANP/ShutterstockAccording to the final text of the agreement, the EU guarantees for the loan “will not have an impact on the financial obligations” of these three countries.The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said it was “quite something” to get 27 countries to agree on a €90bn loan for another. She said: “There are a lot of people outside theEuropean Unionand unfortunately also inside the European Union who tries to divide us. It is getting more and more difficult and I think this will continue.”Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said she was glad that common sense had prevailed and that resources for Ukraine had been agreed on “a solid legal and financial basis”. She said the most important decision had already been taken a few days earlier when the EU decided tofreeze the Russian assets indefinitely.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, also said the indefinite freezing of assets was “the big win”.1:20Zelenskyy hails unity of Ukraine and Poland after EU’s €90bn loan – videoIn a post on Telegram, the Kremlin’s top economic negotiator, Kirill Dmitriev, welcomed the failure to “illegitimately use Russian assets to finance Ukraine”, adding that “for the time being, the law and common sense have won a victory”.The Ukraine finance decision had been cast as“money today or blood tomorrow” by Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk. EU officials had hoped that if the union went ahead with using frozen assets for Ukraine, other western allies , such as the UK, Canada and Japan, would follow suit. Now it is not clear how they will respond. But Brussels has called on non-EU allies to provide about €45bn to cover the rest of Ukraine’s estimated €136bn needs for military and civilian finance in 2026 and 2027.Writing on X, the former head of the Foreign Office in the UK, Lord Ricketts said: “In the face of [Donald] Trump’s disdain and Russian intimidation, the EU has shown it can act even if at the last moment. But if a reparation loan had been agreed, UK was set to put its £20bn or so of frozen Russian assets into the pot. How does UK contribute now?”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

New York’s Central Park received a few centimetres of snow, while 21cm (8.5in) was dumped in parts of Long Island. This is the earliestNew Yorkhas experienced snowfall since 2018.New York narrowly missed out on widespread snowfall a few weeks ago. The low-pressure system tracked ever so slightly to the north of New York, enabling the warmer air to edge in. Meanwhile, upstate New York and other parts of New England were on the colder side of the system and received significant snow accumulations.This week, however, the synoptic picture was different. Bitterly cold air plunged down from Canada into the north-east of the US. In tandem with the cold air, a low-pressure system began to track eastwards. As the cold air was already embedded over New York, any precipitation that fell was snow.SouthernSpainwas hit by Storm Emilia this week. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, a tornado, along with heavy rain, wreaked havoc in the seaside town of La Cala de Mijas, Málaga. The tornado swept through the town, tearing down the £67,000 Christmas lights along the main high street. It is estimated the storm caused £500,000 in damages.View image in fullscreenRain falls in Málaga, Spain.Photograph: Lorenzo Carnero/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe tornado formed as warm, less dense, moist air rose, while colder, drier air sank. A process known as “wind shear” allowed winds at different altitudes, blowing at different speeds and directions to create an invisible horizontal tube of rotating air. An updraft, created by the rising moist air, lifted this tube of air and shifted its orientation vertically. This forms a “mesocyclone”, a rotating column of air within a storm. Cold, sinking air facilitated downdrafts which wrapped around the mesocyclone, causing it to intensify and focus the rotation downward, providing the perfect conditions for localised wind gusts to reach 80mph (130km/h). Outside the tornado column, winds were strong but not of debris-shifting strength, highlighting the hyper-localised nature of this phenomenon.Explore more on these topicsSnowWeather trackerNew YorkSpain (World news)Spain (Weather)EuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Most people in Gaza live in tents or other substandard accommodation asIsraeldestroyed much of the housing and civilian infrastructure during its two-year war.Israel has partly eased restrictions on the entry of aid since an October ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, but delivery was still limited and inconsistent, the UN said.“No areas are classified in famine,” said the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) initiative, used by the UN to monitor food crises. The IPCfirst declared a famine in parts of Gaza in Augustafter Israeli restrictions of food aid into the territory led to mass starvation, with at least 450 people starving to death, according to the Gaza ministry of health.More than 9,000 children in Gaza treated for acute malnutrition in October, UN saysRead moreThe monitor said that despite the end of the famine classification, the situation in Gaza still remained dire, with “the entire Gaza Strip classified in emergency”. According to the IPC’s five-phase classification system, the emergency stage is just a step below famine and occurs when households have “very high acute malnutrition and excess mortality” due to lack of food.Before the ceasefire, Israel maintained a severe blockade on the entry of aid into Gaza,described as“systematic obstruction by Israel” by the UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, Tom Fletcher, in August.After the US-mediated ceasefire took effect in October, Israel began to allow more aid from the UN and its partners to enter.“Following the ceasefire … the latest IPC analysis indicates notable improvements in food security and nutrition compared to the August 2025 analysis, which detected famine,” the IPC said.Aid workers have said that the deal remains fragile, however, with Israel carrying out near-daily strikes in the territory and both sides trading accusations of ceasefire violations.About 1.6 million people were expected to face “crisis” levels of hunger in the next four months, the IPC said, warning that if the ceasefire broke down, the strip could slip back into famine.Israel has vehemently denied the accusations that there is famine in Gaza and that it is restricting the entry of aid. Israel’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, said in a post on X on Friday that in the face of “overwhelming and unequivocal evidence, even the IPC had to admit that there is no famine in Gaza”.Cogat, the Israeli body in charge of humanitarian affairs in Gaza, said the IPC report “portrays a distorted, biased, and unfounded picture of the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip”.The humanitarian community and the UN have widely acknowledged famine in Gaza, and the IPC is considered the global authority on food crises.Oxfam said hunger in Gaza remained at an “appalling” level and accused Israel of blocking humanitarian groups from bringing aid into the territory. “Oxfam alone has $2.5m worth of aid including 4,000 food parcels, sitting in warehouses just across the border. Israeli authorities refuse it all,” Nicolas Vercken, the campaigns and advocacy director at Oxfam France, said in a statement.Hundreds of thousands of people are still enduring torrential rains and the cold in frayed tents. Pictures of flooded encampments at the start of winter have circulated on social media. The threat of disease outbreaks remains high as hygiene conditions are subpar in the crowded tent settlements.On Wednesday, a 29-day-old baby died of hypothermia, according to Gaza’s ministry of health. “Children are losing their lives because they lack the most basic items for survival,” said Bilal Abu Saada, the nursing team supervisor at Nasser hospital, which received the baby before it died.The ceasefire remains fragile, with negotiators still unable to bridge the differences necessary to move to the second phase of the deal – meant to lead to a permanent peace.The US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is due to meet senior Qatari, Egyptian and Turkish officials in Miami on Friday to discuss how to move to the second part of the ceasefire deal, Israeli media reported.Under the second phase, Israel is supposed to withdraw from the 53% of Gaza it still controls, while a transitional authority will replace Hamas as the governing power, and an international stabilisation force is to be deployed in the territory.The Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, warned on Thursday that delays in moving to the second phase of the deal, as well as ceasefire violations, “endanger the entire process”.Explore more on these topicsGazaUnited NationsPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

They are the only family travelling together from Gaza whose evacuation the British government has facilitated. Most students have had no choice but to leave their families behind, while others have simply refused to take up their places.Set to expire on 31 December 2025, theUK’s Gaza evacuation schemehas been described by students as beset by delays, poor communication and uncertainty. It has left students stuck in Gaza, where conditions havedeterioratedamid floods, escalating food shortages and disease.Some told the Guardian that they felt pressure from the UK government to travel without their children despite the recent policy change stating they could bring them.When Wahhaj Muhammad, 32, was advised by theForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office(FCDO) to consider evacuating alone, he believed his family would soon follow. But two months have passed, and his wife and two children remain trapped in Gaza with no clear timeline or assurances from the UK on when they will join him.View image in fullscreenWahhaj Muhammad was advised to evacuate alone, but two months later his family remain trapped in Gaza.Photograph: CourtesySince arriving to study for his PhD in Glasgow, Muhammad says he has been consumed by guilt. “The uncertainty affects every aspect of my life here,” he says. “It’s difficult to settle, to feel present or to engage academically when the people you love most remain living under constant threat.”Muhammad has received no explanation for why his family was not on the last evacuation bus that left this week. British officials said they remained “hopeful” that they would be able to evacuate in the new year but have offered no guarantees.Another two eligible students who refused to leave their families behind and were not permitted to evacuate this week do not know if they will need to defer their studies for another year or risk losing their places altogether.View image in fullscreenMother-of-three Amany Shaher says she will not travel to take up her university place without her family.Photograph: CourtesyAmany Shaher expected to have settled well into her master of research at the University of Bristol by now. Instead, as the autumn term draws to a close, she is certain that she will not make it out of the enclave this year.“None of us know if the UK’s student evacuation scheme will be extended or not,” says Shaher. “We haven’t been given any clear guidance or timelines and have no idea what 2026 will bring.”The 34-year-old mother of three says when presented with the choice of travelling alone, without her children, she felt nauseous. “How can I even consider leaving my children behind in Gaza?” she asks. “Nowhere else in the world would a mother be expected to part so easily from her children. It’s dehumanising. We have a right to stick together as a family and not be forced to separate – that should not be too much to ask.”Gaza PhD student ‘heartbroken’ as family blocked from entering the UKRead moreMohammed Aldalou has a scholarship to pursue his master of research and PhD at the London School of Economics (LSE). But for the past six months, he has been locked in a bureaucratic limbo with British authorities, which he described being “almost as traumatic as the war itself”.His five-year-old son is severely autistic and non-verbal, and has been without access to treatment for two years. Yet the FCDO has suggested Aldalou take the opportunity to leave while he can – but he refuses. “They should ask themselves what they would do if they were in my shoes,” he says.Without the guarantee of evacuating together as a family, Aldalou insists there will be no leaving Gaza. “It’s heartbreaking that, after everything we’ve been through, we’re being asked to make this impossible decision.”Last week, during a closed meeting between the department for education and universities, there was discussion of whether students still stuck in Gaza could begin studies online and if the evacuation scheme could be extended to allow later arrival.However, sources told the Guardian it was unlikely that the FCDO would extend the scheme without Home Office approval. The FCDO declined further comment, while the department for education said it had nothing to add.Explore more on these topicsGazaRights and freedomMiddle East and north AfricaUniversitiesHigher educationForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

He has spent five years in prison, where he has been tortured and put in solitary confinement.His request for a retrial was turned down on 15 December. On the same day, he was unexpectedly granted a visit from his mother, a move that campaigners believe could signal that he will soon be executed. She was told in a phone call from the prison that his case had been forwarded to the department for the implementation of sentences in Mashhad.“His life is in grave danger, the execution of his death sentence could occur at any moment,” said Shahin Gobadi, of the foreign affairs committee of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, a coalition of opposition movements. “One has to keep in mind that in the past six years, the regime has used extensive torture and has tried hard to force him to renounce the MEK.”Vafaei Sani was convicted of “corruption on Earth” and sentenced to death for a third time in September 2024 after “a grossly unfair trial”, according to Amnesty International. The supreme courtupheld his death sentence on 4 October.Nassim Papayianni, Amnesty International’s senior campaigner on Iran, called on the Iranian authorities to immediately halt any plans to carry out Vafaei Sani’sexecution and quash his conviction and death sentence.She said: “Amnesty International has repeatedly held that this charge does not meet the principles of legality and clarity as required by international law and standards. Our research has consistently shown that revolutionary courts lack independence and impose harsh sentences following grossly unfair trials. People tried before such courts are systematically denied their fair trial rights, including Vafaei Sani.”In November, more than 20 Olympic medallists, coaches and other international athletes, including the tennis player Martina Navratilova and the swimmer Sharron Davies, signed a lettercalling for a halt to the execution of Vafaei Sani.Ina subsequent statement, Mauricio Sulaimán Saldívar, president of the World Boxing Council (WBC), said: “Boxing is a discipline that inspires courage, respect and the pursuit of self-improvement, not a reason for political punishment. The execution of a boxer, of a champion, for expressing his ideas is a direct attack on the fundamental values of sport and human dignity.”In 2023, more than 100 human rights experts and organisations wrote a letter to the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, calling for action to prevent the athlete’s execution.Child bride spared execution in Iran after blood money is paidRead moreIran has a history of executingathletes for their beliefs, includingHabib Khabiri, captain of the national football team, in 1984, andFourouzan Abdi, captain of the national women’s volleyball team, in 1988. In 2020,Navid Afkari, a 27-year-old Iranian wrestling champion,was also executed.Executions are soaring in Iran, prompting growing international outrage. At least1,000 people were executed in the country in the first nine months of2025 – a 30-year high. The number is now believed to have surpassed 1,500, according to Iran Human Rights. Amnesty International, said there is an “execution crisis in Iran, which has reached horrific proportions”.Political prisoners and dissidents are targets, especially in the aftermath of the2022 Woman, Life, Freedom uprising.

He said transforming young people’s prospects could do that.But he said that without substantive action, the UK was at risk of abandoning a whole generation to a life on benefits and could push them away from mainstream parties towards rightwing populism.After launching his review of why a quarter of 16- to 24-year-olds are not in education, employment or training earlier this week, Milburn said they faced a “perfect storm” in the youth labour market after the Covid crisis, with systemic failures and policy neglect in education and welfare over decades.“You write off a generation, you write off the country’s future,” he said. “You’ve got this sort of downward escalator: we’re plunging young people into a lifetime on benefits, rather than creating an upward escalator, with opportunities for people to learn and to earn.”The former cabinet minister is not shying away from recommending radical reform of the system in his final report, due in the summer. He said he was prepared to look at pressure on employers and the steep rise in mental health claims.Before the budget, Treasury insiders were among those who were concerned about the increase in youth rates of the minimum wage, amid fears they could be priced out of entry-level jobs.“We’ve got to look very carefully at exactly that,” Milburn said. “We’ve got to make sure that in a fragile youth labour market, and it’s been fragile for very many years, that public policy is providing the right incentives for employers to employ more young people, rather than less.”Asked whether he thought businesses had been squeezed too much by the government, which put up national insurance at the last budget, he added: “I hear that being said. I’m going to examine the evidence, and we will reach a conclusion.”Milburn also wants to address sensitive issues around the mental health of young people, citing it as a reason for a sharp rise in sickness benefits in recent years.“We’ve got to be careful that just because you’ve got anxiety or depression, that automatically puts you on to the downward escalator into the world of benefits,” he said.“We’re at real risk in the debate that’s taking place sometimes, of a new currency developing which says that work is bad for people’s mental health, whereas the opposite of that is true, which is good work in particular, is extremely good for people’s mental health.“When I talk about these uncomfortable truths that the review is going to have to confront, you know, this is one of them.”The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has ordered a clinical review of the diagnosis of mental health conditions in England, which will inform Milburn’s review.However, the Labour veteran said 16- to 24-year-olds were a “generation under duress”. They faced a different world from their predecessors, who had a “social transaction” with the state that no longer existed.“It’s very easy to play the blame game ... but we’ve got a job to act as custodians, to make sure that young people have got the right opportunities in front of them,” he added, saying that the government and business needed to step up.They had a responsibility, in particular, to prepare younger generations for “tomorrow’s potential tsunami” – the advance of technology – which could send further shockwaves through the youth labour market.“You can’t simply say, King Canute-like, we’re going to resist the forward march of technology. That’s not possible. What we have got to do is equip people to be able to adapt, be agile enough, to have enough resilience, to be able to succeed in that labour market,” he said.With Labour losing support among younger voters, many of them disillusioned by a political system they feel is entrenching generational inequality, Milburn said young people were deserting the mainstream parties.“If young people start feeling society isn’t interested in me, to this question of how they’re thinking of potentially voting in future, then there’s an obvious quid pro quo,” he said, suggesting that they could turn to Reform UK instead.“That should be something that people would want to avoid, particularly people who are concerned about progressive politics. It’s pretty obvious that that social contract is being broken”.Milburn, who is close to Streeting – regarded as a potential successor to Starmer if he stands down – urged the government to be more optimistic about what it could deliver. “The centre-left of politics only wins when it creates a sense of possibility about the future,” he said.“So my very strong advice would be generate hope for the future. This [review] is about saying the future can be better than the present and better than the past. It is about making sure that we’re investing in the future generation. The biggest deficit in the country is the shortage of hope.”Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, is planning to proposefurther welfare reformnext year, after the government abandoned a significant part of its bill in June under pressure from Labour MPs.Milburn, whose review is reporting to McFadden, said the government had “self-evidently” got its attempts to win MPs round on welfare badly wrong. “Framing welfare reform as a cost-out measure wasn’t a sensible approach to take, and it produced the inevitable result,” he said.“If you want to reduce welfare bills, the only way of doing that is to provide more opportunities for people to learn and to earn first.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyLabourYoung peopleWelfarenewsShareReuse this content"

She replaces Christina McAnea, who has held the role since 2021 and has been close to Starmer’s government.In contrast, Egan, a social worker with decades of union experience, is a leftwinger who was expelled from Labour in 2022 after the party said she had shared articles on social media from Socialist Appeal, an organisation banned by Labour.In her article, Egan suggested a Labour leadership contest was likely in 2026 and warned against the party backing Streeting.“We will call time on our union’s inexcusable habit of propping up politicians who act against our interests, undermine our fundamental values and make our lives worse,” she said.“Like colleagues across the movement, I have in recent weeks been appalled by Wes Streeting’s attacks on resident doctors and their union. It is simply unacceptable for a Labour politician to describe striking workers as ‘morally reprehensible’.”Egan said she would engage open-mindedly with Streeting, but added: “Given the likelihood of a Labour leadership election in 2026, it’s important for me to be clear: swapping Starmer out for Streeting or anyone else from the right wing of the party would be no solution to the gigantic challenges facing the country. What’s needed is a radical change in approach based on the Labour movement’s core values.”The general secretary elect also indicated she would run the union in a different way, saying: “Some at the top of our movement have contributed to its decline by creating cultures where workers, ordinary members, are consistently disregarded by their own organisations.”In response to Egan’s criticism, Streeting’s spokesperson said: “Wes is aUnisonmember delivering with, and for, Unison members – from introducing the first ever fair pay agreements for care workers to ending the use of subcos [wholly-owned subsidiaries] for outsourcing staff and undermining their pay and conditions.“Wes has never closed the door on resident doctors or the BMA after the 28.9% pay rise he awarded them, and he won’t be doing that now. To act as though the strikes would have no impact on patients or other NHS staff would have been dishonest and irresponsible itself.”Egan’s comments suggest Unison may in future take an approach closer to Unite, led by Sharon Graham, which has been pressing Labour to stay closer to leftwing values.Egan said in her article: “It should be clear that putting members first doesn’t mean relegating or turning away from politics. That would be an abdication of responsibility. But it does mean bringing Unison’s support for the destructive right wing of the Labour party to an end.”The change at the top of Unison leaves Starmer facing concerted pressure on the left from key trade unions on top of the challenge from Zack Polanski’s Green party and Your Party, co-founded by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana.At the same time, Labour recently struck a compromise to water down its employment rights bill, whichpassed through the Lordsthis week, after pressure from the right and business groups. The government agreed for workers to qualify for protection against unfair dismissal after six months, instead of the current two years, despite day-one rights being aLabourmanifesto pledge. Unions agreed to this climbdown alongside the lifting of the compensation cap for unfair dismissal.The TUC has praised the bill for banning exploitative zero-hours contracts, bringing in sick pay for all, expanding parental and bereavement leave, repealing Tory anti-union laws, ensuring union access to workplaces, and establishing a social care fair pay agreement.But it emerged on Friday that Labour Together, a group that helped support Starmer’s leadership, had circulated a discussion paper that suggested scrapping many of the regulations in the recently passed bill to help boost the economy, while floating a new system of employment insurance alongside easier hiring and firing.A Labour Together spokesperson said: “Labour Together totally supports this week’s Employment Rights Act. This paper was a provocation for private discussion about how to build a political economy centred on technological change and innovation.“It looks beyond current policy, exploring ideas for spreading innovation and investment outside the south-east and how to support workers through technological change with a bigger welfare state rather than regulation alone. But given the welfare state we inherited from the Conservatives, that is far away. The Employment Rights Act is the best way to give workers much more security now.”Explore more on these topicsUnisonTrade unionsLabourKeir StarmerWes StreetingnewsShareReuse this content"

A couple on their way home from midnight mass were also attacked in the early hours of Christmas Day 2024 in London’s West End.View image in fullscreenAiden Chapman.Photograph: Family/PAThe jury was told of desperate scenes, terror and heroism as one man shielded his partner from being struck by the car with his own body.Four other people were seriously injured, with the rampage ending only when Gilheaney, who drove at more than 100mph to elude police, crashed his car.Gilheaney, who is British, was found guilty of Chapman’s murder, one count of wounding with intent, two counts of attempted murder, and one count of causing grievous bodily harm, after a trial at the Old Bailey.His car struck Marcelo Basbus-Garcia after reversing into him at high speed, and he also drove at Miguel Waihrich while he was tending to his injured partner, Basbus-Garcia. Waihrich told jurors he had made eye contact with Gilheaney as he drove at them a second time, while Basbus-Garcia was unconscious and “covered in blood”.Waihrich said: “I remember his eyes and the position of his hands on the wheel, I remember his face and me crying for him to stop, and he didn’t stop.”The couple had been to midnight mass in Piccadilly and were on Great Windmill Street when they saw Gilheaney shouting, naked from the waist up, in the middle of the road. Gilheaney got in his car and drove off, then returned and headed towards the couple.Waihrich told the court: “It was very high speed, the way he reversed. It was so fast every person in that street was in panic – we started to run.”People ran for their lives as Basbus-Garcia was knocked to the ground. He told the Old Bailey: “The car came after me – but it would be fair to say that he [Gilheaney] was after everybody in that street. The last thing I remember was being hit by the car. The last thing I remember, actually, is being terrified.”Waihrich ran over to his partner, who was bleeding and unconscious, and saw the car returning. He told the court: “He [Gilheaney] stopped and looked at me. He is coming in my direction, I try to make signs, gesture and say: ‘Stop it, please.’ The car doesn’t stop and accelerated towards us, and I decided to protect Marcelo’s head with my body as a shield. I’m just counting the seconds before the final attack.”The prosecutor, Crispin Aylett KC, said the attack on Waihrich and Basbus-Garcia was “clearly a homophobic attack”. Afterwards, Gilheaney ploughed into Chapman and his friend Tyrone Itorho as they crossed Shaftesbury Avenue.Anthony Gilheaney.Photograph: Metropolitan police serviceChapmandied in hospital on New Year’s Eve, having been thrown into the air after being struck by the car. Doctors described the brain injuries he suffered as “unsurvivable”.Chapman’s parents said: “Words cannot describe the pain and anguish Anthony Gilheaney has caused us by his evil actions. No amount of justice or prison time will ever be enough to compensate for our loss.“Gilheaney has taken the best part of us. He has left us with a dark void in our lives that can never be filled. He took our only son from us. Something we will never get over. Something we will never forgive.”Minutes before the rampage, Gilheaney, who had been drinking heavily, shouted racial abuse at an Asian man before driving into him, then getting out of his car and attacking him.He also crashed into a taxi, then mounted the pavement where a family pushing a child in a pushchair had to run to get out of the way. Three people escaped by pinning themselves against a wall.A witness described Gilheaney as “ping-ponging from side to side along the street” in between using his car as a weapon.His blood alcohol when tested several hours later was more than one and a half times the legal limit and he is estimated to have hit people at more than 30mph. He had been drinking in Bar Rumba, leaving at about 12.40am on Christmas morning. A witness said Gilheaney was “very angry, his whole body was tensed and primed”.His Mercedes had alcohol bottles, including vodka, strewn on the floor, as well as mixer cans.Between March 2012 and 2023 Gilheaney accumulated six convictions for dangerous driving and had been disqualified twice, including at the time of the attacks.DCI Wayne Jolley, of the Metropolitan police, said: “Gilheaney got behind the wheel of his car in a drunken rage, determined to inflict as much damage as possible. He targeted innocent people, who were out celebrating Christmas Day and killed 25-year-old Aiden Chapman.“He has refused to acknowledge the seriousness of his offences, making every attempt to portray himself as a troubled victim. I commend the jury for seeing through this act.”Gilheaney, from Harlow, Essex, had denied murder. He faces a mandatory life sentence and the judge will decide on 30 January the minimum term he must serve before release can be considered.Explore more on these topicsCrimeLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Also in the race was Lullaby from the charity campaign Together for Palestine, which reached No 5.“It’s hard to put into words how special this feels,” Kylie told Official Charts. “BeingChristmasNo 1 really is the most wonderful gift.”It’s Kylie’s first No 1 in 22 years, after Slow in 2003, and only her second solo Top 10 hit since 2010’s All the Lovers. Xmas makes her the first woman to secure UK No 1 singles in four different decades, and she’s a rare Australian Christmas chart-topper – Nicole Kidman was the previous one, with her Robbie Williams duet Somethin’ Stupid in 2001.In a way, Kylie has been at Christmas No 1 once before, but only as a small part of the 1989 version of Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas?, performing alongside Cliff Richard, Bananarama and many more – the song doesn’t count as an official Kylie hit on the charts. She had nearly reached the top spot the previous year with her ultra-sappy Jason Donovan duet Especially for You, but Richard kept them off No 1 with his arguably even sappier Mistletoe and Wine.Kylie’s Xmas was helped along by sales of CD and vinyl versions, but its success is all the more remarkable because it isn’t available on most streaming services: she recorded it as an exclusive track forAmazonMusic.The online retailer has identified Christmas music as a big draw for customers in recent years, using exclusive songs as a way to tempt them into signing up to its music streaming offering (the songs can also be heard on YouTube). These exclusives are also often played when Christmas music is requested on Amazon’s Alexa devices, helping to increase their chart success.It’s the first time an Amazon-commissioned song has reached Christmas No 1, though previous efforts have nearly managed it. Last year Tom Grennan’s It Can’t Be Christmas reached No 3, and in 2023 Sam Ryder reached No 2 with It’s Christmas to Me. Ellie Goulding’s Amazon-exclusive cover of Joni Mitchell’s River, released in 2019, reached No 1 just after Christmas that year. Katy Perry, Olivia Dean, Laufey, Jorja Smith and George Ezra are among the other artists to have recorded Christmas songs for Amazon.Speaking to Music Weekas the Kylie campaign kicked off, Amazon Music’s Alex Nutton heralded “significant investment and promotional support in commissioning new Christmas tracks these past few years … A great Christmas track has the power to stand the test of time. When commissioning these songs, our goal is always to create a new holiday favourite that customers will return to year after year.”In terms of pure sales,Together for Palestinecame out on top, but Lullaby was relatively little streamed. The song is an adaptation of Palestinian lullaby Yamma Mwel El Hawa, featuring a mix of the original Arabic lyrics and new ones written by Peter Gabriel. It is performed by Palestinian artists such as Nai Barghouti alongside British ones including Neneh Cherry, Celeste, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Together for Palestine co-creator Brian Eno.Earlier this month, Enotold the Guardianhe was “not gonna be completely disappointed” if the song didn’t reach No 1, because “Christmas singles are a thing unto themselves.” Proceeds from the song will be distributed to Palestinian causes via the Choose Love charity.The rest of the chart is predictably stuffed with Christmas songs: 27 of them in all. Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas is You and Brenda Lee’s Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree are at No 3 and No 4, and the Pogues, Kelly Clarkson, Elton John and Bobby Helms’s Christmas songs all feature in the Top 10 (Dave and Tems’ Raindance is a non-Christmassy outlier at No 7).‘Harder work than almost any album we ever did’: Pink Floyd’s Wish You Were Here turns 50Read moreIn the album chart, Pink Floyd’s 50th anniversary reissue of Wish You Were Here is at No 1, ensuring they break an obscure record: the longest time between an album’s first No 1 appearance and its most recent. Previously this had been the Beatles’ Abbey Road, which topped the chart in 1969 and then again in 2019, a slightly shorter gap of 49 years and 252 days.Wish You Were Here is Pink Floyd’s second UK No 1 album of the year, after the live album Pink Floyd at Pompeii – MCMLXXII. They have also scored a Christmas No 1 single in the past, with Another Brick in the Wall in 1979.Kylie was last week’s album chart-topper with Kylie Christmas (Fully Wrapped), a reissue of her 2015 Christmas album.Explore more on these topicsUK chartsPop and rockKylie MinogueChristmasAmazonE-commercenewsShareReuse this content"

We had been awaiting the plans to implement a previous 100% figure and this decision leaves disabled people feeling betrayed and excluded, and questioning the government’s commitment to disability equality,” he said.“Requiring 100% of all new-build homes to be built to improved accessibility standards, with 10% to wheelchair user standards, would have been the right thing to do, creating a level playing field for developers and sending a strong signal that our housing stock must change to meet the needs of our older and disabled citizens.“The government’s failure of resolve and watered down proposal leaves a bitter taste, raising questions about whose interests are being served.”Millie Brown, deputy director for homes at the Centre for Ageing Better, said the 40% target was an “important step in the right direction”, although she acknowledged it was a “step back” from the Conservative government’s previous plans.“Of course, the announcement could have gone further,” she said. “We would hope that local authorities are encouraged to view 40% as the minimum to achieve and exceed.”The government’sproposed changes to the planning systemsay that 40% of new homes should meet the M4(2) standard, but that councils should “set requirements for M4(2) that meet or exceed their locally assessed need for this housing”.This category of home accessibility requires step-free access, wider doors and entrance-level toilets to make them adaptable for people with limited mobility and older people.Homes built to the M4(3) standard must be fully accessible for full-time wheelchair users, with ample turning spaces and accessible bathrooms and kitchens.Many local authorities set their own targets on this – since 2015, in London the standard has been 90% of homes at M4(2) and 10% at M4(3).But rates fluctuate sharply across the country – analysis by the Centre for Ageing Better found that people living in the East Midlands or north-east of England were six times less likely to be living in a fully accessible home compared with people living in London.Just 13% of homes in England were fully accessible, the research found.The housing secretary, Steve Reed, said the changes to the planning system were part of his plan to “get Britain building” and that “we owe it to the people of this country to do everything within our power to build the homes they deserve”.Mark Gale, policy manager at the disability charity Sense, said he wanted the government reconsider the accessibility targets.“We’re disappointed to hear the government is cutting back on accessibility targets for new homes,” he said. “Inaccessible housing can be a huge barrier to independence for disabled people with complex needs. Sadly, there is often far too little suitable housing stock available, meaning some people have no choice but to live in homes that don’t meet their needs.”The Ministry ofHousing, Communities and Local Government has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsDisabilityHousingPlanning policyEnglandOlder peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

They were part of a long-awaitedrelease of documentsfrom Donald Trump’s justice department, which has been slammed for being only a partial release and heavily redacted.But one document, called EFTA00004179, consists of a formal FBI evidence cover sheet and 13 pages of handwritten investigative notes from an interview conducted on 2 May 2019. The interview subject is redacted, as is some of the content.Still, themes emerge; recruitment of girls, sexual encounters under the guise of “massages” and Epstein’s specific preferences regarding age and race.“Friends of [redacted] friends. Big Brazilian group. Desperate time,” the witness said, according to the notes. “Running out of girls.” The notes ostensibly refer to Epstein by the initials “JE”.Photos from the first batch of the Jeffrey Epstein filesRead moreA “dark-skinned Dominican” was brought in during this “desperate time” but “JE didn’t want Spanish or dark girl”, the notes read. The initials of the person who brought the underage girls to Epstein are redacted in the document. This person told Epstein that they had been “bringing young girls” to Epstein, but Epstein complained that “yea but not dark”.The witness said she was unsure whether Epstein had paid the procurer for the “service”, but that he had paid the girl.The notes then refer to a bathroom and “boobs and vaginas near bathtub … he got in shower and told her can’t just bring girls he doesn’t like. … told her keep looking for girls”.“At one point [redacted] witnessed him asking for ID to girl,’” the notes state, “wanted make sure under 18 b/c he wasn’t believing them b/c [redacted] messed up by bringing more older girls.”The notes contain the witness’s descriptions of sexual encounters, like Epstein making “crazy noises” and touching victims “roughly”.The document contains photographs of girls described in the notes as from 14 to 17 years old, around town and in bikinis on the beach. The notes reference New York locations: the “41st St Apartment” in Manhattan, locations in Rochester and Brighton Beach, New York, and a high school prom.The identity of the witness is not clear. The notes jibe with Epstein’s known interest in Brazilian children.US legislators say justice department is violating law by not releasing all Epstein filesRead moreMarina Lacerda, a Brazilian immigrant identified as “Minor-Victim 1” in the federal indictment, was a central witness who spoke publicly for the first time in September. She detailed her abuse by Epstein from the age of 14 and said she saw Donald Trump with Epstein more than once, though Trump has denied knowing of any of Epstein’s criminal actions.Her testimony ultimately resulted in Epstein’s indictment. Epstein later killed himself in a New York jail cell in 2019.Jean-Luc Brunel, who founded a modeling agency with Epstein’s support, wasarrestedin 2022 by French authorities on suspicion of trafficking and raping underage girls. Brunel was accused of supplying more than 1,000 girls and young women for Epstein to have sex with.In April 2019, Brunelvisitedan agency in Brazil that his company had worked with in the past to find new models to bring over to the US, according to a source who saw him in Brasilia.

The decision comes less than two months after Tesla shareholders approved a new plan thatcould be worth $1tnto Musk, already the world’s richest person, in a decade’s time.Musk’s fortune currently stands at anestimated $600bn.Rescinding the pay deal would be “inequitable”, and would leave Musk “uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years”, theDelawaresupreme court justices wrote, echoing arguments from Tesla board members earlier this year.Elon Musk’s net worth hits estimated $600bn as SpaceX prepares for IPORead moreAt thecompany’s annual meetingin Austin, Texas, this November, shareholders had approved a stopgap measure for Musk, ensuring – regardless of how the Delaware supreme court ruled on this appeal – that he would get the $56bn his supporters say he is owed.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment or for more details on Friday’s ruling.Both of the compensation packages, as well as other pay plans approved by Tesla shareholders, require Musk to meet a number of lofty goals related to product development and increasing the company’s value to $8.5tn in order to cash out on those awards.The case that first invalidated the original pay package was launched seven years ago when a Tesla stockholder, who held just nine shares at the time, filed a suit arguing that the plan was set up to overpay the world’s richest person. That first ruling voided the billions Musk was to receive, which left the Tesla co-founder less than pleased.Not only did Musk relocate Tesla to Texas from Delaware, where it was incorporated at the time the suit began, he also publiclylashed out against the stateand specifically its court of chancery and chief judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick.“She has done more to damage Delaware than any judge in modern history,” he wrote on X, his social media platform, in February 2024.Tesla stockholders in 2024 were again asked to vote on the 2018 pay package. They approved it, and once again, McCormick struck it down, ruling that the “Superstar CEO”,as she called him, had undue influence in developing his own pay package and that stockholders weren’t fully informed ahead of the vote.US Senate confirms billionaire Musk ally Jared Isaacman as Nasa chiefRead moreMusk has voiced his displeasure ever since.“Any lawyer still recommending incorporation in Delaware at this point should be sued for malpractice,” he posted online earlier this year.In Friday’s opinion, the justices agreed with McCormick’s earlier findings that there was a breach of fiduciary duty in developing the original package and presenting it to shareholders. They ordered $1 be paid to the plaintiff in nominal damages.However, the five judges agreed that rescinding Musk’s full pay package wasn’t appropriate.While Musk has publicly called for other companies to follow his lead and leave Delaware – which has historically beenhome to more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies– experts have tracked only a few dozen companies that have actually done so. That includes big companies including Dropbox and Coinbase, while other tech companies like Meta have only threatened to leave.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDelawareTeslaLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

The investigation found that Dollar General stores have failed more than 4,300 government price-accuracy inspections in 23 states since January 2022. Family Dollar stores have failed more than 2,100 price inspections in 20 states over the same time span.“These staggering numbers lead us to wonder how seriously your companies prioritize affordability, consumer transparency and corporate ethics for the constituents we represent,” says the letter, authored by US representative Nikki Budzinski of Illinois and signed by 29 other Democrats.The demand from the lawmakers comes amid what they describe as an American affordability crisis driven by stagnant household incomes and rising consumer prices, including a surge in grocery costs of “almost 30% over the last five years, with the highest increases occurring in everyday goods like ground coffee, beef and eggs”.The Guardian’s investigationdetailedpricing errors on frozen pizzas, Pedigree puppy food, Frosted Flakes, frying pans, cough medicine, socks and other items. In one example at a Family Dollar in North Carolina, a state inspector found that Bounty paper towels, listed on the shelf at $10.99, rang up at the register at $15.50.The letter says the Guardian’s investigation shows that overcharges at dollar stores are “not isolated to a geographic area or to a handful of stores across the country. Instead, the scale of documented violations seems to be the result of systemic failure within your corporate operations, leading to customers overpaying for their groceries, potentially without knowing, at a time in our history when they can least afford it.”Neither Dollar General nor Family Dollar responded to the Guardian’s questions about the letter.The congressional letter also takes aim at another practice highlighted in the Guardian’s investigation: both dollar-store companies ban users of their mobile apps from filing class-action lawsuits.Dollar General’s app and website also require that disputes instead “be resolved exclusively by final andbinding arbitration”, although the company also allows for individual claims in small-claims court.“This refusal to honor shelf prices coupled with forced arbitration agreements takes away virtually any possible course of action for customers who have been wrongly and unfairly overcharged at your stores,” the letter said.The lawmakers ask the companies to turn over four years’ worth of correspondence about their price labeling practices. They also ask for documents about the revenue generated by price inaccuracies and about mobile app policies.In addition, the lawmakers ask the Dollar General CEO, Todd Vasos, and the Family Dollar CEO, Duncan MacNaughton, a series of pointed questions, starting with: “Why have your stores’ internal auditing systems continuously failed to detect pricing error rates of this magnitude before state inspectors arrive?” They also ask what steps the companies are taking to provide restitution to communities hit by “chronic overcharging”.Budzinski, who represents parts of central and southern Illinois, said her district had 30 Dollar General and Family Dollar stores. For some of her rural constituents, she said, there were no nearby supermarkets. “They have nowhere else to go for milk, for bread, for toilet paper,” she said. “People are coming in their doors banking on affordable options. But really what’s happening – and what was really exposed, I think, in the story – was that [the companies] are engaging in deceptive pricing and that there’s little recourse right now for the customers.”Many states inspect businesses for price accuracy, but Illinois does not. “What this could lead us to is looking at something of a federal enforcement mechanism so that all of the states have the same protections,” Budzinski said.Family Dollar told the Guardian in a statement in November that “we take customer trust seriously and are committed to ensuring pricing accuracy across our stores”. Dollar General said in a previous written response to the Guardian that it was “committed to providing customers with accurate prices on items purchased in our stores, and we are disappointed any time we fail to deliver on this commitment”.In addition to being signed by the 30 lawmakers, the letter was endorsed by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) and two economic justice organizations, Groundwork Collaborative and Public Citizen.“Corporations cannot be allowed to screw over consumers without accountability,” said Joshua Miller, director of Public Citizen’s Congress Watch. “With everyone struggling with this Trump-induced affordability crisis, the last thing people need is to be walking into stores that are advertised as being affordable only for them to get the switcheroo.”Ademola Oyefeso, director of UFCW’s legislative and political action department, said his union was concerned about dollar-store price mismatches because of the implication for workers. The discrepancies stem in part from the industry’s minimal staffing, according to industry watchers, ex-employees and lawsuits cited by the Guardian. Some stores only have one or two employees on duty at certain hours, and they are responsible for stocking shelves, ringing up customers, looking for shoplifters and cleaning the building. This leaves them with little time to put up new shelf tags, even as prices are updated automatically at the register.Oyefeso said he worried that other companies, like supermarket chains, would follow the dollar stores’ lead and cut the jobs of workers responsible for assuring price accuracy. “When some retailers see a way to save money,” he said, “there’s a monkey-see, monkey-do attitude.”Jocelyn CZuckerman contributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsUS CongressThe price we payUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Novartis, Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Sanofi and GSK have also signed on.Under the deals, each drugmaker will cut prices on most drugs sold to the Medicaid program for low-income people, senior administration officials said, promising “massive savings” on widely used medicines without giving specific figures.US patients currently pay by far the most for prescription medicines, often nearly three times more than in other developed nations, and Trump has been pressuring drugmakers to lower their prices to what patients pay elsewhere.The details of each deal were not immediately available but officials said they included agreements to cut cash-pay direct-to-consumer prices of select drugs sold potentially through the TrumpRx.gov website, to launch drugs in the US at prices equal to – not lower than – those in other wealthy nations and to increase manufacturing. In return, companies can receive a three-year exemption from any tariffs.Merck said it will sell its diabetes drugs Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR – set to face generic competition next year – directly to US consumers at about 70% off list prices. If approved, its experimental cholesterol drug enlicitide will also be offered through direct-to-consumer channels.Enlicitide is one of two Merck drugs expected to receive a speedy review under the FDA’s new, fast-track pathway, Reuters previously reported.In July, Trump sent letters to leaders of 17 major drugmakers, urging them to offer so-called most-favored-nation prices to Medicaid and ensure new medicines launch at prices no higher than those in other wealthy countries.Five companies had previously struck deals with the administration to rein in prices - Pfizer, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, Novo Nordisk and EMD Serono, the US division of Germany’s Merck KGaA. The remaining three that have not announced deals are Regeneron , Johnson + Johnson, and AbbVie. Investors initially feared sweeping US price controls, but the details of recent deals have largely eased those concerns.Reuters previously reported that AbbVie was expected to announce a deal on Friday. Drugmakers on Friday committed to “most-favored-nation” pricing on all new US drug launches across commercial, government and cash-pay markets, including the US Medicare program for those aged 65 and over, officials said.A portion of revenues from each company’s foreign sales will also be remitted to the US to offset costs, officials said. The companies pledged together to invest more than $150bn in US for research and development and manufacturing, according to officials, although it was unclear whether that included earlier commitments. Several also agreed to donate drug ingredients to the US strategic reserve.Merck said it chipped in $70bn of that sum.Analysts have noted that Medicaid, which accounts for only about 10% of US drug spending, already benefits from substantial price discounts, exceeding 80% in some cases.Pfizer, which announced its 2026 financial outlook on Tuesday, said the Medicaid discounts would result in price and margin compression next year.Explore more on these topicsBusinessPharmaceuticals industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The company has consistently denied the allegations.During Joe Biden’s administration, Congress passed legislation prohibiting ByteDance from retaining operational ties with TikTok US. However, the national security law gave the US president the power to decide whether any deal met its requirements.Trump has approved the joint venture that will control TikTok’s US business.Under the new structure Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX will each control 15%. Existing ByteDance investors will take 30.1%, while ByteDance will own 19.9% – the maximum permitted under US foreign ownership laws. The remaining 5% will be held by as-yet-unnamed new investors.The US joint venture will be overseen by a seven-member board of directors, the majority of whom will be American, according to Chew’s staff memo.“Upon the closing, the US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organisation, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” he added.In September, the Trump administration said a framework agreement had been reached after abreakthrough in negotiationsbetween US and Chinese officials.JD Vance, the US vice-president, said at the time that the deal would value TikTok’s US joint venture at $14bn.Under the arrangement, Oracle will oversee the algorithm that recommends videos in US users. The system will be retrained using US data to “ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation”, Chew’s memo states.China will retain control of the algorithm, with the country’s cybersecurity regulator previously saying it had agreed that any TikTok US deal would include “licensing … and other intellectual property rights”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The proposed settlement was filed on Thursday in the federal district court in Washington and requires a judge’s approval.The accord would pay potentially millions of ATM users who were charged an unreimbursed access fee to withdraw cash from independent, non-bank ATMs. Visa would contribute about $88.8m and Mastercard about $78.7m to a settlement fund. The money would be distributed to eligible customers with qualifying ATM transactions made since October 2007.Visa and Mastercard and lead attorneys for the consumers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The lawsuit, one of three related cases in the DC federal court, was filed in 2011. Consumers challenged industry rules by Visa and Mastercard that allegedly blocked independent ATM operators from offering lower prices.Visa and Mastercard denied any wrongdoing. The two companies last year agreed to pay $197.5m to resolve related claims from a different group of ATM users who claimed they were overcharged at bank-operated ATMs. Several banks in 2021 agreed to pay $66m to settle claims against them in the litigation.Attorneys for the plaintiffs in a court filing called the settlement “an excellent result in light of the risks of continued prosecution”. They said they planned to ask the court to award them up to 30% of the fund, or about $50m, in legal fees.A third lawsuit by independent ATM owners and operators is pending in the same court.Visa faces other antitrust lawsuits, including one from the US justice department accusing it of illegally monopolizing the US debit card market. It has denied the claims in that case.Explore more on these topicsBusinessDebit cardsnewsShareReuse this content"

Shareholders of each firm will own about 50% of the combined company. The company will be overseen by a nine-member board of directors, which will include Trump.Trump Media has also agreed to give TAE $300m in cash to continue developing its fusion energy technology.The deal comes amid soaring demand for new energy sources that can feed artificial intelligence and themassivedatacentersthatpower it. While this deal is a big bet on fusion power meeting that demand, a commercially viable reactor has never been built.So is Trump Media still a social media company?Kind of. Trumplaunchedthe company in 2021 to be a competitor to the big tech companies that had kicked him off their platforms at the time, including Facebook and Twitter. But Truth Social has only a few million active users, a speck compared with the larger platforms.Though Truth Socialwent publicon the stock market as part of Trump Media in 2024, the wider firm has been racking up losses: $54.8m in the three months to 30 September, more than double those incurred during the same period of 2024.Shares of the company soared when Trump was re-elected for a second term, but they are down almost 60% since the start of the year.The merger with TAE, while seemingly out of left field, is on track with the company’s attempts to diversify Trump Media’s assets beyond Truth Social. In recent years, it built out a massive,volatilecryptocurrency treasury and tried to create new financial products andbetting markets.What exactly is fusion energy?TAE is one of a handful of companies that is working on developingfusion energy, a type of nuclear energy that mimics the power of the sun to produce energy.While a type of nuclear energy, fusion energy is different from the nuclear energy that was developed in the 1940s, which was created through fission. Fission energy was created by splitting atoms, whereas fusion energy creates energy by forcing atoms together.The technology is still in its early stages, and some scientists areskepticalthat it can be produced at a commercial scale.But demand for clean, safe energy has soared with the AI revolution, which has put hugepressureon the energy grid. This is why tech companies and AI leaders such as Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and OpenAI’s Sam Altman have been investing in fusion energy companies including TAE and Helion Energy, which are trying to commercialize fusion energy.Wait, why is this deal happening?The move by the Trump family business into the fusion energy space comes amid steps by the Trump White House to bolster the technology.‘We wanted to take action’: US toy company fights back over Trump tariffsRead moreSince entering office in January, the US president has made moves to deregulate the nuclear energy industry and accelerate technology development, including signing executive orders that deem developing new technology as an issue of national security.Trump’s Department of Energy has especially beenfocusedon the new technology, with the creation of a new Office of Fusion whose goal is to get fusion technology ready for commercial use as quickly as possible.After the merger, TAE said it will start construction on a utility-scale fusion power plant that it hopes will generate power for commercial use by 2031. In an interview withCNN, TAE’s Binderbauer said more capital will mean the company can build its plant more quickly.“The velocity [at which] you can get the capital is differentiating. If I raise $2bn over five years, I can’t build the plant sufficiently fast,” Binderbauer said. “Sometimes you get lucky and you meet the right people.”Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, noted that TAE will probably get “major political support from President Trump” because of the deal, though Binderbauer toldCNNthat he welcomes regulatory scrutiny.“I’m not looking for anything special,” Binderbauer said. “Perhaps you get more scrutinized from a regulatory perspective and that’s good because it will give the world confidence that technology is what matters.”Explore more on these topicsMergers and acquisitionsDonald TrumpEnergy (Technology)Energy (Environment)Social mediaDigital mediaexplainersShareReuse this content"

The settlement is confidential and closes a painful six-year process, the Skaggs family said in a statement.From monkey elixir to fentanyl: Tyler Skaggs’s death is merely a chapter in baseball’s 136-year drug fixRead more“We are deeply grateful to the members of this jury, and to our legal team,” the family said in the statement. “Their engagement and focus gave us faith, and now we have finality. This trial exposed the truth and we hope Major LeagueBaseballwill now do its part in holding the Angels accountable. While nothing can bring Tyler back, we will continue to honor his memory.”The team contended officials didn’t know Skaggs was taking drugs and would have sought him help if they did. The team was expected to make a statement later Friday.Jurors began deliberating earlier this week.Orange County superior court judge H Shaina Colover thanked jurors for their diligence. “That is why this matter was able to be resolved today,” she said, before releasing them.Six years ago, the 27-year-old left-handed pitcher was found dead in the suburban Dallas hotel room where he was staying as the Angels were supposed to open a four-game series against the Texas Rangers. A coroner’s report said the player choked to death on his vomit, and a toxic mix of alcohol, fentanyl and oxycodone was found in his system.Kay, a longtime Angels employee, was convicted in 2022 of providing Skaggs with a counterfeit oxycodone pill laced with fentanyl and sentenced to 22 years in prison. His criminal trial in Texas included testimony from five MLB players who said they received oxycodone from Kay at various times from 2017 to 2019.View image in fullscreenAttorneys listen as Daniel Dutko gives his closing arguments in the wrongful death lawsuit by the family of pitcher Tyler Skaggs against the Los Angeles Angels.Photograph: Paul Bersebach/APIn California, MLB players including outfielder Mike Trout, Angels president John Carpino, and Skaggs’ and Kay’s relatives testified during the trial in a Santa Ana courtroom. Witnesses for the plaintiffs described how Kay was acting erratic at the stadium and found with multiple plastic bags filled with pills at his home and later hospitalized for a drug overdose. They also recounted how Kay got players massage appointments, tee times and even prescription medication, and was paid by players for stunts like taking a fastball to the leg.Angels attorneys pointed out that Skaggs was hooked on painkillers before he signed with the Angels in 2013. They said Skaggs got his teammates into taking pills and got Kay to provide them, but kept it secret out of concern it could jeopardize their MLB careers. Had team officials known Kay was dealing drugs, or Skaggs was taking them, they would have done something, the lawyers said.Witnesses also sparred during the case over how much money Skaggs would have made as a pitcher had he lived. Experts for the plaintiffs said he could have reeled in between $91m and $101m, while the Angels put the figure at no more than $32m.Skaggs had been a regular in the Angels’ starting rotation since late 2016 and struggled with injuries repeatedly during that time. He previously played for the Arizona Diamondbacks.After Skaggs’ death, the MLB reached a deal with the players association to start testing for opioids and to refer those who test positive to the treatment board.Before the judge announced the settlement Friday, jurors had remained behind closed doors after lawyers for both sides had gone to speak with Colover.Late Wednesday, jurors had sent out a note asking whether they “get to decide the punitive damage amount”, saying there is no field for it on the verdict form. The judge said she would send a note replying that if they decide there should be punitive damages, they would decide how much at a later time.The jury did not work on Thursday and resumed deliberations Friday morning.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles AngelsFentanylMLBBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Jacksonville v Denver, yes please. Baltimore v New England, bingo. Pittsburgh v Detroit, hmm … OK. Still not satisfied? The strange lights of Saturday night over in the NFC North should do the trick with a sepia-toned showdown between the Chicago Bears and theGreen Bay Packersat Soldier Field. A win for either and a Detroit defeat confirms a playoff slot while victory for the Bears gets them close to sealing the division (even in defeat the Packers still will be ahead for the seventh seed). The gaping hole left by Micah Parsons in Green Bay’s defensive front may have Chicago fans edging to the side of expectation that their Bears can put together a deep playoff run if home-field advantage is on their side.What Green Bay need to do to winDominate time of possession. The longer Green Bay keep the ball on offense the better as they try to adjust to the chunky hole left in their pass rush nowParsons has landed on injured reserve. Confidence should remain high that quarterback Jordan Love and company, with as much ball as possible, will keep running up the scoreboard to cover any slack from the defense despite the slip against Denver last week. Love showed some familiar struggles in throwing two interceptions. The picks should be credited to the Broncos pressuring him at a career-high rate of 52% though rather than a regression in Love’s play. The season taken as a whole has been brilliant, in particular his deep passing to Christian Watson who handily did not pick up a serious injury at Mile High. Throw in a matchup skewed in Green Bay’s favor between bruising back Josh Jacobs averaging more than 90 yards in his past three games with Chicago’s so-so run stopping and the Packers have the offensive might to sweep the Bears aside.What Chicago need to do to winThere is no escaping how one-sided this rivalry has been over the past 15 years. Since 2010, Green Bay are 27-5 against Chicago in the regular season while only two wins of the Bears’ five were at Soldier Field. Ancient history, so what does it matter when Chicago are on top at 10-4? Well, starting 0-2 after being blown away by Detroit 52-21 felt familiar, another lost season in the pipeline. Meanwhile, it has been anything but with Ben Johnson clearing away the wreckage of years of failure. Quarterback Caleb Williams is still a work in progress but no longer a progress stopper under the offensive-minded head coach. Progress is what will clinch a huge win for Chicago on Sunday. Johnson needs to pull out every positive from the second-half comeback that fell just short at Lambeau Field leaving the Packers 28-21 winners. Tire out a wounded Packers defense with the impressive tandem of D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai, open up play action and keep the Packers guessing. It might get ugly and Williams might fluff his lines here and there but Johnson has shown he has the knowhow and tools to record a seismic win.Rising: BuffaloA statement victory over New England puts Buffalo right on the verge of clinching a spot in the postseason. The scenario is straightforward: a win over Cleveland and a loss for Indianapolis to San Francisco does the trick. A victory on Sunday and a much less likely defeat for Houston to Las Vegas also would work. Realistically they will make it regardless so the win/loss gymnastics are redundant. Buffalo making the playoffs is unremarkable, it is how they are exploding into life through Josh Allen’s successive high-wire comebacks that has caught the eye. Allen’s six touchdown passes while leaning on fine-tuned connections with his tight ends rather than the less-than-stellar receivers have shifted the Bills back to being a powerhouse. In doing so they still have an outside chance of pipping the Patriots to the AFC East title while affirming that no team or lead is too great for the Bills to overcome. Only the Denver Broncos have steadily built anything close to an aura of invincibility this season but, as it stands, would you write off Allen in the championship game against Bo Nix? At worst that is a coin-flip game. The biggest boost for Allen is that there will be no meeting with Patrick Mahomes this January. No old wounds. No reminders the Chiefs own you when it matters. Just a clearheaded shot at hauling a first Super Bowl title back to Buffalo.View image in fullscreenNo lead is safe against Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills.Photograph: Jamie Schwaberow/Getty ImagesFalling: CarolinaNeither Tampa Bay or Carolina appear able to cope with the pressure of even making the playoffs after both snatched defeat, and an outright hold of the division, from the jaws of victory. The Bucs let a 28-14 lead of the Falcons slip at the top of the final quarter while Carolina went scoreless from the top of the third to throw away a 17-7 advantage over the rudderless Saints. Carolina will be kicking themselves after wilting with the chance of a win and in opportunity on Sunday against … you guessed it, Tampa Bay. Victory would still give them a great shot at the title. But if you can’t beat the Saints with two weeks rest after recording a seismic win over the NFC’s current No 1 seed then maybe the die has been cast for the Buccaneers to take over from here.Race for No 1 pickThe sprint to the bottom continues with the cursed Chimera of Tennessee, Las Vegas and Cleveland fused at 2-12. On last week’s performances the Raiders and Browns look the most likely to be thrashing it out come season’s end. Vegas have no hope whoever starts at quarterback against Houston on Sunday. If the Eagles can pitch a shutout then the Texans’ brutal defense will easily handle Kenny Pickett or Geno Smith. Cleveland welcome surging Buffalo to town. That’s a paddlin’. But what a difference seven days make in theNFL, Tennessee host the Patrick Mahomes-less Kansas City Chiefs after making a decent fist of things in defeat to the 49ers. Rookie Titans’ QB Cam Ward might be quietly aiming for a statement win against the fallen giants to maintain control of the offense next season.Season ended todayAFC1) Denver 12-2; 2) New England 11-3; 3) Jacksonville 10-4; 4) Pittsburgh 8-6; 5) LA Chargers 10-4; 6) Buffalo 10-4; 7) Houston 9-5.

The striker also claimed his relationship with Slot had broken down and that he had earned his position in the team after eight phenomenal seasons.Slot has refused to disclose whether he received an apology from Salah before recalling the 33-year-old for last Saturday’s win over Brighton. At a press conference on Friday, the head coach said he would not comment further on the Salah situation to avoid creating “a distraction” while the Egypt international is at the Africa Cup of Nations.However Jones, in an interview with Sky Sports, said Salah had spoken to his teammates about the furore that followed his incendiary interview after the 3-3 draw at Leeds and apologised.TheLiverpoolmidfielder said: “Mo is his own man and he can say his own stuff. He apologised to us and was like: ‘If I’ve affected anybody or made you feel any sort of way, I apologise.’ That’s the man that he is. I can only speak from me knowing Mo and how he is with us and how he acted on that. He was positive as well. He was the exact same Mo, he had a big smile on his face and everybody was exactly the same with him. I guess it’s just part of wanting to be a winner”Jones insisted he would have a bigger problem with a teammate being happy to sit on the bench than Salah claiming he should be in the team. “I get that there are certain ways you can go about things,” he said. “But if a lad’s fine to just be on the bench and he doesn’t want to play and help the team, then I think that’s more of an issue.”Liverpool are unbeaten in the five games since Slot reacted to damaging home defeats by Nottingham Forest and PSV by dropping Salah to the bench. Jones believes the forward’s outspoken comments were not designed to destabilise the team.“When there’s been any sort of anger from us, including myself, it’s always been from a good place,” he said. “In the moment, it might not have come out in the right way, but it’s never been to affect the team, the staff, the manager, anybody like that. We’re past that now and we’re gelling well as a team, playing well and starting to win games.”Slot has said Florian Wirtz’s adaptation to the Premier League is being helped by the Liverpool playmaker bulking up in the gym.Wirtz impressed inLiverpool’s 2-0 defeat of Brighton last weekendwhen his strength in the physical challenges was noticeably improved. The £116m signing has yet to register a goal or an assist in 15 league appearances for his new club but Slot insists there has been clear progress from the Germany international. A few extra kilos of muscle is one contributory factor, according to the Liverpool head coach.“Florian has improved a lot,” said Slot, who hopes Dominik Szoboszlai will have recovered from an ankle injury to face Tottenham on Saturday. “I am not talking about his ability on the ball because we could see from the start that he was top. But I saw in one moment against Brighton where he took the ball off Dom, dribbled and a player came to him and he pushed him away and kept on dribbling. Then he provided a cutback cross for Hugo [Ekitiké] who shot over the bar.“Later, he won the duel with [Jan Paul] Van Hecke that led to the counterattack with the shot from Mo [Salah]. In those moments, you see it gets easier for him. It takes a lot of effort for him to play in this intensity but he is getting used to it. That is my take.”Slot believes a combination of gym work and game-time is behind Wirtz’s recent improvement. He added: “A lot of them have grown in kilograms, in muscle. That’s one thing. And, secondly, if you are only in the gym you cannot be prepared for 90 minutes of Premier League football. It is about playing games. I would say training as well but we hardly ever do that, so it’s playing, playing, playing.“The only way to make these players better is by playing them. I have played players during the season when you would usually take pre-season for that. The only way to get Florian stronger, Macca [Alexis Mac Allister], Conor [Bradley], is to play games. It’s a combination of things but definitely also about the gym work where they all get stronger.”Szoboszlai returned to light training on Thursday after being injured in the Brighton game. Bradley is available for Spurs after suspension and Jeremie Frimpong is back in the squad for the first time since suffering a hamstring injury in October.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolMohamed SalahnewsShareReuse this content"

Darnold’s deflected pass intended for Zach Charbonnet was initially ruled incomplete, but after a replay review was determined to be a backward pass. Charbonnet, who had casually picked up the loose ball in the end zone, was credited with the two points.\"Is this the craziest 2-point conversion EVER?\"The@Seahawkstie it up in a WILD way 😳LARvsSEA on Prime VideoAlso streaming on@NFLPluspic.twitter.com/KwNtEIWVQ7— NFL (@NFL)December 19, 2025“I’m glad Charbs picked it up,” Darnold said, “and that obviously was a game-changing play.”Rams head coach Sean McVay appeared dubious about the reversed call when he spoke after the game.“Very interesting,” McVay said “Didn’t get a clear explanation of everything that went on just because of some of the timing of it. I’ve never seen anything or never been a part of anything like that. And I’ve grown up around this game. I’m not making excuses. We don’t do that. I don’t believe in that. It doesn’t move us forward, but we do want clarity and an understanding of the things that we can do to minimize that when we rejected the two-point conversion.”The Rams got the ball first in overtime and Matthew Stafford connected with Puka Nacua, who cruised untouched into the end zone for a 41-yard touchdown to make it 37-30. Nacua finished with 12 catches for 225 yards and two TDs, and Stafford had 457 yards passing – the third-most of his career – and three scores as the Rams’ offense totaled 581 yards without a turnover.Nonetheless, the Seahawks came up with some big stops in the fourth quarter that were crucial to Seattle’s rally. The Rams had four punts and a missed field goal on their final five possessions of regulation.Seattle (12-3) clinched a playoff spot and moved into position for the top seed in the NFC, while LA (11-4) face a road playoff opener if they can’t overtake the Seahawks in the final two weeks of the season.The Seahawks trailed 30-14 when Rashid Shaheed returned a punt 58 yards for a touchdown and Darnold connected with Cooper Kupp for the two-point conversion. After a three-and-out by the Rams, Darnold found tight end AJ Barner for a 26-yard TD, and Charbonnet tied it on the quirky two-point play.Darnold, who threw four interceptions against the Rams in a 21-19 loss in November, was picked off twice in this one, including by 297lb defensive end Kobie Turner. But he made clutch throws in the fourth quarter and OT, finishing with 270 yards passing and two TDs.“He’s resilient,” Kupp said. “His steadiness. His leadership.

It is the second time Taylor has failed a drugs test. He was banned for a month by the DRA in January for a failed drugs test in November last year.That suspension came during the Players Championship Finals and led to him missing the World Championship. He was in line to receive a two-year ban but it was reduced as the substance was not performance-enhancing and was taken outside of competition.Meanwhile, Beau Greaves just missed out on a first win at the worlds after a 3-2 defeat by Daryl Gurney. The 21-year-old from Doncaster, making her second appearance on the Alexandra Palace stage, hit a 10-dart leg to level the match against the 22nd seed. But Gurney pulled off the biggest checkout of the match, a 144, to break in the deciding set before wrapping up victory despite winning 10 total legs to Greaves’ 11.View image in fullscreenBeau Greaves gets a salute from her opponent Daryl Gurney and the crowd after losing in the first round.Photograph: John Walton/PA“For me, she’s the best woman dart player on the planet,” Gurney said on Sky Sports. “If there’s going to be a dart player that can win the World Championships or any majors, that’s the player you want to look to. Even from a man’s point of view, that woman has got some cojones.“Obviously everybody says that she was the favourite coming into the game, but sometimes I showed my class, I showed my composure, and I got over the finish line.”Ireland’s William O’Connor – who beat Greaves in her only previous appearance at Ally Pally in 2022 – averaged 102.3 in a 3-0 win over Krzysztof Kciuk of Poland to earn a shot at three-time champion Michael van Gerwen in round two.Josh Rock survived a minor scare before overcoming Gemma Hayter 3-1 and booking his place in the second round at Alexandra Palace. The Northern Irishman, touted by many as a tip for the title after a stunning 2025 season, cruised into a two-set lead before Hayter seized the third and pushed him to the limit as she pressed for parity in the fourth.Rock, a 2025 World Cup winner alongside Gurney, missed 10 darts at doubles in a below-par first set but appeared to have shrugged off his early nerves as he cruised through the second. But Hayter, who qualified by finishing fifth on the 2025 Women’s Series order of merit, stepped up to seize the third set and battled to a deciding leg in the fourth before Rock belatedly got the job done with an 81 checkout.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.

It dictates that, given Eddie Howe’s ambitions of qualifying for the Champions League via the league, this is a pivotal fixture. How Newcastle’s manager must hope Enzo Maresca’s recent cryptic hintsabout potential discordbehind the scenes at Stamford Bridge somehow help to undo the visitors on Tyneside, cutting the aforementioned gap in half. If off-pitch harmony endures at St James’ Park, Newcastle’s Saudi Arabian ownership will, nonetheless, be keen to see Howe and his players make further amends for last Sunday’signominious defeat at Sunderland. Falling nine points behind Chelsea may not be well received in Riyadh. Howe might have been tempted to start with a back five but with Tino Livramento the latest victim of a defensive injury crisis, he only possesses sufficient fit personnel to staff a four-man rearguard. Assuming Howe sticks with his preferred 4-3-3 it will be intriguing to see whether he drops a winger and fields Yoane Wissa to Nick Woltemade’s left in attack. Or does he opt for a potentially more fluid 4-2-3-1 with Woltemade as the No 10 and Wissa at No 9?Louise TaylorNewcastle vChelsea, Saturday 12.30pm (all times GMT)2Parker under pressure on Bournemouth returnBurnley manager Scott Parker is heading back to Bournemouth, where his Premier League journey went disastrously, ending after a9-0 defeatto Liverpool. Parker criticised the recruitment, saying the squad was “ill-equipped” before his employment was terminated. His comments were part of his downfall and the experience was a learning curve for a young coach. Another difficult situation faces Parker on his return to the Vitality Stadium; after seven straight defeats Burnley are six points from safety and, with three games before the January transfer window, Parker is smart enough to know he needs results for his own job security and in order to make Turf Moor an attractive prospect to potential recruits. But if the gap to 17th continues to grow, many will be wary of joining a club heading in one direction.Will UnwinBournemouth v Burnley, Saturday 3pm3Sunderland stir fond memories for WelbeckIt may be 15 years since a fresh-faced Danny Welbeck went on loan from Manchester United to Sunderland but the veteran striker still has fond memories of his time on Wearside. Six goals in 28 appearances for Steve Bruce’s side helped convince Sir Alex Ferguson he was ready to step up to United’s first team the following season and Welbeck remembers how he grew up quickly being away from home for the first time. “I had to learn to cook and clean for myself,” the 35-year-old said this week. “Before that I was living with my mum and my family, so it was a big learning curve for me and it was a great year and a great experience.” But with Sunderland on a high aftertheir derby win over Newcastle, Welbeck – who could be named captain in Lewis Dunk’s absence through suspension – will be looking to bring them down to earth as Brighton attempt to get back to winning ways after three games without a victory.Ed AaronsBrighton vSunderland, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenDanny Welbeck is Brighton’s top scorer in the league this season with seven goals.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Getty Images4Two hopes for West Ham?Pep Guardiola often bewails a schedule that overloads players, so he will surely be beaming at the Christmas present of a whole week until Manchester City’s trip to Nottingham Forest, following West Ham’s visit on Saturday. Nuno Espírito Santo desperately needs a victory as his team have gone five matches and six weeks without a win, their last coming in November’s3-2 defeat of Burnley, yet their hosts have won their past six games, includinga 2-1 win at Real Madrid. Eighteen goals have been plundered in that run and, given City are second, two points behind Arsenal, and the Hammers are third-bottom, three points from safety, there is likely to be only one winner.Jamie JacksonManchester City v West Ham, Saturday 3pm5Doomed Wolves should give minutes to ManéEveryone can now accept that Wolves will be relegated from the Premier League. They were bitterly disappointed tolose at Arsenal, having equalised in the last minute, only to be undone by Yerson Mosquera’s own goal. The assist for Tolu Arokodare’s goal at the Emirates Stadium came from the teenager Mateus Mané on his fifth Premier League appearance for the club. The 18-year-old is highly regarded at Molineux, having moved from Rochdale in 2024, making his debut last season against Brighton. Planning for the Championship is the sensible thing to do and giving more minutes to Mané in the coming months would be advantageous for his development. Home supporters will be more forgiving and supportive of a youngster making his way in the game, rather than those who have let Wolves down thus far.WUWolves vBrentford, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenRob Edwards is facing the harsh reality of a return to the Championship.Photograph: Brett Patzke/WWFC/Wolves/Getty Images6A chance for Ngumoha to take centre stage?Trying to take the positives out of an injury to Dominik Szoboszlai and the departure of Mohamed Salah to the Africa Cup of Nations is tricky. For all the talk around the Egyptian in recent weeks he will be missed, especially with Cody Gakpo injured. Arne Slot’s options on the bench will be reduced when Liverpool visit Tottenham on Saturday evening. Supporters will be a little concerned but it should be a boost for Rio Ngumoha, the 17-year-old who announced himself with a 99th-minute winnerat Newcastle in August. Since then he has, understandably, been reduced to cameos when Liverpool have been chasing the game but, with a need to manage minutes amid a hectic schedule, Slot may turn to the teenager more often. Ngumoha has not looked fazed since his promotion to the first team and would certainly embrace the chance to show his fearlessness.WUTottenham vLiverpool, Saturday 5.30pm7Everton absences boosting GunnersThere will be no excuses for another flat performance from Arsenal, with Mikel Arteta having a rare free week to address the flaws thatalmost cost his team two pointsat home to the bottom club, Wolves, last time out. Apprehension may accompany the league leaders on their visit to Everton, given recent displays and the growing threat from Manchester City, but there is also opportunity for Arteta against his former club. David Moyes has lost Iliman Ndiaye and Idrissa Gueye to Afcon, while Jack Grealish is doubtful with a hamstring problem sustained at Chelsea. The likely absence of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall also threatens to have a major impact. Dewsbury-Hall had been in excellent form before pulling up with a hamstring injuryon his return to Stamford Bridge. The midfielder’s rapport with Grealish is vital to Everton’s creativity. Without them, and the protection offered by Gueye, Bukayo Saka should relish going up against Vitalii Mykolenko.Andy HunterEverton vArsenal, Saturday 8pmView image in fullscreenBukayo Saka could be a beneficiary of Everton’s injury problems.Photograph: Javier García/Shutterstock8Calvert-Lewin for England?Hats off to Daniel Farke for silencing those minded to sack him with a series of much-improved results. If that has had a lot to do with the Leeds manager’s decision to switch from a possession-based 4-3-3 to a counterattacking 3-5-2 system, pulling it off so well might not have been possible without Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The now fully fit former Everton striker has five goals in 15 appearances this season but four have arrived in his last four outings. “Dominic needed a few weeks to find belief in his body again,” said Farke ahead of Crystal Palace’s visit. “Right now you can see the rewards. Dominic’s in a period where he just has to touch the ball and it goes in.” So might the 28-year-old, who won the last of his 11 senior international caps in 2021, be a shock inclusion in England’s World Cup squad? “It’s crucial I don’t give advice to Thomas Tuchel,” said Farke. “But Dominic is definitely one of the best strikers in the English league. There’s no limit for him.” Calvert-Lewin’s potential duel with Palace’s Marc Guéhi will be compelling.LTLeeds v Crystal Palace, Saturday 8pm9Villa will threaten United’s ragged back lineThe loss of Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo to Afcon from the Manchester United side thatdrew with Bournemouthon Monday will provide a headache for Ruben Amorim, but his biggest problem is at the back. Noussair Mazraoui has also departed for Morocco, taking another defensive option away from a side that have missed Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt in recent weeks. The centre-back trio of Leny Yoro, Ayden Heaven and Luke Shaw struggled against the Cherries, giving Amorim plenty to ponder. Lisandro Martínez has come off the bench in the past four United games after recovering from a cruciate ligament injury and it could be the right time to start the Argentinian for the first time since February because his experience would be advantageous to those around him when United meet the in-form Aston Villa.WUAston Villa vManchester United, Sunday 4.30pm10Hudson-Odoi revival to roll on at Fulham?Callum Hudson-Odoi got his season back on track whenNottingham Forest beat Spurs 3-0last week. His record for the season before that win was one goal and no assists from six starts and eight substitute appearances in the league. His form had dipped after a bright couple of years at the City Ground. However the former Chelsea winger remains a vital player for Forest. Hudson-Odoi scored twice against Spurs and, although there was an element of fortune to his second goal, given that it was an overhit cross, he will be looking to push on when Sean Dyche’s side visit Fulham on Monday.Jacob SteinbergFulham vNottingham Forest, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal1620362Man City1622343Aston Villa168334Chelsea1612285Crystal Palace165266Man Utd164267Liverpool162268Sunderland162269Everton16-12410Brighton1622311Tottenham Hotspur1642212Newcastle1612213AFC Bournemouth16-32114Fulham16-32015Brentford16-32016Nottm Forest16-81817Leeds16-101618West Ham16-131319Burnley16-151020Wolverhampton16-262Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendNewcastle UnitedChelseaBournemouthBurnleyBrighton & Hove AlbionSunderlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They were a ­fantastic club, winning the European Cup four times, but then it took them 31 ­[actually 30] years to win the league again [after 1990]. We are now in the same situation [as Liverpool in the 1990s].”Amorim responded ­diplomatically but suggested the wait for another title would not extend to a decade. “He [Ferguson] understands football more than me, especially English football,” the Portuguese said. “We will not take that long to win a league [though] I don’t know which manager [will be here then].”Amorim criticised what he described as a sense of “entitlement” among some United players. Last ­Sunday the head coach, questioned about why he did not use more youth players, said Harry Amass was “struggling” on loan at Sheffield Wednesday and Chido Obi was not always starting for United’s under-21s. Amass responded by ­posting a picture of himself with Wednesday’s player of the month award for November, and Obi posted an image of him scoring for the under-21s. Each was deleted soon afterwards.Amorim said: “It is the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club. Nowadays they speak and go against the club because they feel entitlement and then we have legends of the club saying: ‘If you don’t play, leave.’We have to fight against this feeling. The players sometimes forget what it means to play for Manchester United. The door to my office is open, nobody is coming to talk to me and that is the way we can solve things so I think we need to change as a club.”Amorim’s comments come after the former United player Paul Scholes said Kobbie Mainoo should join Chelsea and Mainoo’s half-brother Jordan Kwadwo Osei Mainoo-Hameswore a “Free Kobbie Mainoo” T-shirtat Monday’s 4-4 draw with Bournemouth and posted the image on Instagram. Mainoo is yet to start in the league this season. Amorim said he would not take action against the 20-year-old for his half-brother’s behaviour.View image in fullscreenKobbie Mainoo will not be punished for his half-brother’s behaviour.Photograph: Paul Currie/Shutterstock“It was not Kobbie that wore the T-shirt,” he said. “He is not going to start because of the T-shirt or go to the bench because of it. He is going to play if he is the right player to play. I am not going to do something to Kobbie because someone in his family is doing something. And he played really well [when coming on versus Bournemouth] so that is the important thing.”Casemiro is suspended for Sunday’s trip to Aston Villa, and Amorim has previously said Mainoo could be capable one day of playing in the Brazilian’s holding role. Amorim spoke in the summer of how he wanted a leadership group to deal with certain problems to lessen his workload, and was asked whether the incident involving Mainoo’s half-brother was an example. “It continues a bit – everything is on my desk, but my door is still open,” he said.It emerged this week that Amorim’s captain, Bruno Fernandes, believes the hierarchy wanted him to leave in the summer window, and in a previous one. Amorim was asked about this and Fernandes’s claim that some teammates do not value United as he does. The midfielder had been speaking with the Portuguese Football Federation’s in-house channel.Amorim said: “He spoke with the club before that interview and we can avoid these things, but he talked with the board and everything is clear. I don’t know if it is fair [the claim about teammates]. He spoke his feelings and he needs to answer for that, not me.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimAlex FergusonnewsShareReuse this content"

He has stumbled into a fight he cannot win. It did not go down well with Chelsea when Maresca lobbed a grenade into the mix by talking about not being supported enough after last Saturday’s humdrumwin against Evertonand it is hard not to read his refusal to defuse the situation since then as the stance of a man daring his bosses to act.Chelsea remain bemused by their head coach creating speculation that he has issues with the club’s hierarchy by saying that the 48 hours before the Everton game had been his worst since joining the club. Sources say the outburst even caught people close to Maresca by surprise. Confusion reigns. It does not help that Maresca has publicly and privately rejected repeated opportunities to explain the source of his discontent, leaving it open for outsiders to assume that the Italian’s issues are with Chelsea’s hierarchy.Enzo Maresca plays down Manchester City link and insists future lies with ChelseaRead moreNo wonder this was all anyone wanted to talk about before Chelsea’s trip to Newcastle on Saturday. Rumours of Manchester City identifying Maresca as a potential replacement for Pep Guardiola next summer were deliciously timed. It has been noted that Maresca’s new agent, Jorge Mendes, is close to Hugo Viana, City’s sporting director. There is speculation that the links with City have emboldened Maresca and form an attempt to gain more power at Chelsea, who have built a structure that leaves no room for a manager to call the shots.Maresca did not back down when he addressed reporters on Friday morning. Hedownplayed the links with City, where he was assistant to Guardiola during the 2022-23 season, but said it was “important to understand the reason why this news” had surfaced. Was he hinting at a leak? This is a PR battle now. Maresca is currying favour with Chelsea fans. The 45-year-old tapped the badge on his chest when the travelling support sang his name after their side’s Carabao Cup quarter-finalwin against Cardiffon Tuesday. Perhaps Maresca is playing up to the fact that a large section of the fanbase remain wary of Chelsea’s sporting directors, Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, and the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital ownership.Stewart and Winstanley give regular tactical and technical feedback to Maresca after games, no matter the result. The sense is that someone annoyed the former Leicester manager by questioning whether his substitutions cost Chelsea in theirrecent defeat by Atalanta. Chelsea remain in the dark, though. On Friday Maresca said general discussions with the sporting directors this week had not focused on the Everton press conference. He said nobody had asked to clear the air with him. Asked whether that should have happened, Maresca replied: “I don’t know. That was just a press conference after the game.”View image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca’s promise that he will still be at Chelsea next season is even harder to believe now after his recent comments.Photograph: Chelsea Football Club/Getty ImagesThat was disingenuous; it was clearly more than “just a press conference”. This was pointed out to Maresca, who was asked whether there were issues that needed to be addressed with the board. “It’s a question for them, not for me,” he said. “I said already many times that what I said, it was not an emotional reaction. It was not an emotional reaction. I said what I said. Full stop.”If only. This was Maresca all but admitting his comments were premeditated. It was an obvious provocation. His position is hardly aligned with the club’s given that Chelsea insiders had sought to downplay Maresca’s initial comments, describing them as nothing more than “an emotional response to an emotional win”. That line means nothing now. Maresca has ripped it apart and can have no complaints if it is held against him.His promise that he will still be at Chelsea next season is even harder to believe now. The plan remains to review Maresca’s position at the end of the season and it is safe to say this episode is going to count against him.Chelsea do not want drama. The five-strong recruitment team gives them stability, as does the decision to hand out long contracts to young players. The structure is set. Collaboration is encouraged and the strategy is never going to be led by the coach.Maresca knew what he was signing up for when he joined last year. Chelsea dislike him using the success of the past six months to act out. One source pointed out earlier this week that Maresca was happy to toe the line last season. A dim view is taken of his change of behaviour, and another figure adds that Chelsea have been good for Maresca. They took a chance by recruiting him from a Championship club and upping his pay. Maresca is an inexperienced coach. He is playing a dangerous game. There is no guarantee that he will walk into a better job and while Chelsea have no desire to make a mid-season managerial change their hand may be forced if the mood becomes toxic and the team’s form is affected.Maresca should change course. Chelsea have been moving in the right direction but this is a brutal, fickle business. Maresca’s contract runs until 2029 but he was noncommittal when asked how he would respond if offered a new deal. “This is a question for the club, if I deserve a new contract,” he said. It is not hard to guess the answer at the moment.Explore more on these topicsChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is the pleading for time bit. “If nobody gets this, nobody will be able to turn this around,” he said after last Sunday’s 3-0 Premier Leaguedefeat at Nottingham Forest. It is not a “quick fix,” he added. And nobody was about to disagree.Frank is veering towards another – the one where it is as if he wants to scream, to release the inner hurricane that he referenced in Nottingham. Is anybody seeing what he is seeing? In other words, the immense difficulties that he faces.Premier League news: Guardiola dismisses exit talk and Slot has ‘moved on’ from Salah falloutRead moreFrank does not want to make excuses for how his team have stuttered since the end of September after an encouraging start to his tenure because that would not be a good look. But he does want understanding, perspective. And so on Friday, as he looked ahead to the visit of Liverpool on Saturday night, he sought to get a few points across – in that deft and charming manner of his.The Champions League is not the Europa League. It takes a greater physical and mental toll on the players, Frank suggested, and Spurs’s involvement in the competition, which has gone well so far in terms of results and them being set fair to qualify for the knockout rounds, must be factored in. Frank said his players had lacked energy at Forest. They played their sixth Champions League game of the season at home to Slavia Prague five days previously. It is linked.Frank talked about how there were not many players in the squad who were used to performing every third or fourth day at this level and then there have been those who have barely been involved because of injury – “a few good players out with a lot of goals and assists in them,” as he put it. In other words, Dejan Kulusevski, James Maddison and Dominic Solanke.Frank had a further bugbear, the one that seems to get to them all. It involves the distance between where Spurs are or have been and where they want to go. For Frank, it has been particularly pronounced given that Ange Postecoglou bequeathed him a team that finished 17th in the league. To repeat, as Frank did, there is no quick fix.“What is the potential of Tottenham?” he asked. “That is: I would like to win trophies. And we would like to compete with the best clubs in the country and hopefully win the championship one day. That’s what all Spurs fans are dreaming about. That’s what I’m dreaming about. But how do we get that?“Reality is: we finished eighth [in 2022-23] with Champions League [participation], then we finished fifth with no European competition, then we finished 17th with the Europa League. Now we’re in the fourth season and there’s been some players through the systems and so on. That’s the reality.”It added up to a nice turn in expectation management and when you listen to Frank it is easy to nod along with him, to follow the logic. And yet another line that he uttered after the Forest match came to resonate. “No one will want to hear about this,” he said in the context of needing time and there being no magic wand. Nobody is about to disagree with that either.View image in fullscreenDominic Solanke and James Maddison, posing in May with the Europa League trophy, are currently out injured.Photograph: Michael Regan/UEFA/Getty ImagesTough job, Spurs. You must challenge for the league title with a budget that is the sixth biggest, at best, in the competition. Definitely qualify for the Champions League. And do so playing the kind of exciting, attacking football that satisfies a home crowd which pays extremely high prices and is rarely slow to voice unhappiness if bang does not follow their buck.Frank’s reasonable comments in pre-match press briefings go only so far. It is possible to wonder how much the board want to hear his thoughts on how bad the club have been for so long. But there is no doubt that the supporters want to see more from his team.It is about results because if they have been good in the Champions League, they have been erratic in the league – three wins in their past 12 games in the competition; each of the five defeats during the sequence feeling like an earthquake. It is also worth saying that beating opponents such as Copenhagen and Slavia in Europe does not buy massive credit.As big a problem for Frank has been the style of the performances, the collective identity. He has brought greater efficiency on set pieces and generally tightened things up defensively but they are not vote winners when the team can look so stodgy when trying to build through the thirds; so loose and disjointed.View image in fullscreenXavi Simon (right) battles for the ball with Elliot Anderson – defeat at the City Ground was Spurs’ sixth of the season.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/ShutterstockHe is acutely aware that his Spurs must be better in creative terms; their displays in half of their league fixtures have been anywhere between deeply frustrating and totally unacceptable. It has sparked a troubling question about the direction of travel and his future. What are Spurs evolving towards under him and is it a vision that the fans can get behind?And so to Liverpool, who have often brought out the worst in Spurs in recent years. Spurs have beaten them twice in 18 attempts – and one of those was the 1-0 Carabao Cup semi-final first leg win last season, which was rather overshadowed by the 4-0 defeat in the return. The results in the league last time out? Two defeats: 6-3 at home, 5-1 away.“We conceded a few goals in those games … it’s probably a good idea to also defend a bit,” Frank said. It would be a start but by no means an end.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He watched that game from the stands before officially beginning his role the next day.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreWith second-placed Manchester City facing West Ham in a 3pm kick off and trailing by two points,Arsenalcould be knocked off the top of the Premier League table for the first time since mid-October before their game begins. Arteta has 18 months on the contract extension he signed in 2024 but is aware he must deliver sooner rather than later.He said when asked whether he could imagine himself staying beyond 2027: “Yes, but it’s about today. And a lot of things have to happen in the next few months as well to earn the right. I think a manager has to earn the right to be here tomorrow. And that’s how you react, how you talk here, how you go in the dressing room, the message that you send, how much the players follow you. I always say that you need support. I said it before, from ownership and the board is great.”Arteta added: “At the end, the most important one is those players. You open that door, you confront them, you talk to them … And for six years, I’ve seen just players with a level of attention, desire to learn and give the maximum to the team. That is what it gives me in this job. Nothing else. And obviously winning a lot of football matches, that percentage-wise I think is quite high. So that’s the only way. If not, you cannot survive in this environment.”View image in fullscreenBen White is the latest absentee for Arsenal after sustaining a hamstring injury.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesDespitea dramatic late victory over Wolvesin their most recent match and presiding over a squad that has sustained more than 100 injuries since the start of last season, Arteta barely seems to have aged since taking his first senior managerial role. Ben White is the latest absentee, ruled out with a hamstring injury expected to sideline him for a few weeks.Arteta believes the “priorities and messaging” are very different to the day he arrived and is confident Arsenal are close to finally achieving their objective.“You look at the performances, all the records that we had that they were breaking in the history of the club …” he said. “We still haven’t managed to do that [win trophies]. But that tells you the level that we are in, which is a level that the Premier League has never experienced in the past. And that we want to achieve even higher goals. And if we do that, I think we are on the right path to winning.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetanewsShareReuse this content"

None of us will be for ever in this world but there are no discussions. What is going to happen will happen and the club has to be prepared for everything – for the players and the CEOs, except the owners.“The last three or four years every time during a certain period someone asks me that question. Sooner or later, when I’m 75 or 76, I will quit Manchester City. I understand the question when I have the end of a contract [coming] but I have 18 months left and I am so delighted, happy and excited about the development of the team and being there. That is all I can say. That question happens every single season at a certain point and I’m OK. The club and I are incredibly connected in terms of the decisions we have to take and when it’s going to happen, it’s going to happen.”Guardiola extended his stay in Manchester by signing a new contract last November when he only had seven months remaining. “I’m happy here,” Guardiola said. “I want to stay here. What can I say? When the club and myself have results, always results decide. When it is the chapter the club will choose the best one to continue this incredible period in Man City. There have been rumours for the last years, many many times. I want to stay here. At the end of the season, we’ll see.”City beat Brentford in midweek to reach the Carabao Cup semi-finals and the team is on course to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League. With City active in four competitions, Guardiola will be confident of adding to his haul of silverware. “Always I need to be challenged. Enthusiasm is for many other reasons, apart from the titles, I fight for the titles. At the end, the titles, I would say it’s done.” Guardiola said.“Of course I want to win the Premier League and the Champions League but that is not the reason why I wake up in the morning. It’s not. It’s the process, the journey. Do it better. With the trophy raised high and a parade, we’re happy. Well done Pep. Two days later, it’s ‘what’s next?’ It is the process to see the team move along.”Will Unwin2.Wolves chief Shi steps down amid strugglesThe under-fire Wolves executive chair, Jeff Shi, has stepped down from his role. The 48-year-old has come in for criticism from supporters, with the club languishing bottom of the Premier Leaguewithout a win all season.Wolves say he will remain chairman and chief executive of the Fosun Sports Group, but will have no operational duties with the club. He has been replaced for an interim period by Nathan Shi, who has been with Fosun since 2016.View image in fullscreenJeff Shi watches Wolves at Molineux this season.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersIn a statement on the club’s website, Jeff Shi said: “I took the keys to this chair with humility; today, I step aside with a heart full of gratitude. My seat may change, but my heart will still roar for this club every single game. I give my full support to the new management team and wish them every success in driving Wolves to even greater heights.”3.Slot: Liverpool have ‘moved on’ from Salah falloutArne Slot feels Liverpool have “moved on” from the Mohamed Salah controversy and hopes the player’s Africa Cup of Nations involvement takes further heat out of the situation. Salah sparked crisis at the club withan explosive interviewa fortnight ago in which he, among other things, claimed he had been made a scapegoat for a poor run of form.He was consequently dropped for a Champions League game at Inter but, after talks with the manager, returned as a substitute inlast week’s Premier League victory over Brighton. The 33-year-old is now on international duty, for potentially up to another month, with Egypt.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah came on as a substitute for Liverpool against Brighton.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PASlot said: “As I said last week, actions speak louder than words and we moved on. He was in the squad and he was the first substitution I made. But now he is at the Afcon, playing big games for himself and the country, so I think it is fair to them, and also to us because we are going to play some important games, that all the focus is for him over there and there should not be any distraction from me saying things about his time at Liverpool.“We have moved on after the Leeds interview and he played against Brighton. Now he is there, so it is fair for his country, and for him and us, to talk about Tottenham and other games.”Liverpool will give a fitness test to Dominik Szoboszlai ahead of Saturday’s trip to Spurs after the Hungarian suffered an ankle injury late in the Brighton game.PA Media4.Arteta backs Gyökeres to improve in 2026Mikel Arteta has backed Viktor Gyökeres to improve in the second half of the season but admitted Arsenal need to build on their understanding with the £64m striker. Gyökeres hasn’t scored since returning from injury againstChelsealast month and has six goals in 18 appearances. Arteta is optimistic Kai Havertz will be back from a long-term knee injury in the new year, and Gabriel Jesus has returned after 11 months and should feature against Everton on Saturday.Gyökeres is expected to retain his place having started ahead of the Brazilian and Mikel Merino inthe last-gasp win over Wolvesand Arteta believes the best is yet to come from the 27-year-old.“We bought a player with an incredible goalscoring record that had to adapt to the league,” Arsenal’s manager said. “He had no pre-season. The first few weeks were difficult because physically he wasn’t in his best state. And he’s a player that needs that, like any other player in this league almost, to perform at that level.“Then he kicked on. I think he had a really good period and got injured. And now he’s back. But I saw a lot of positive things in the last two games that he’s done. We need to continue to tweak and understand him a little bit better in certain situations. And he needs to do the same. But that’s about time. And we have full support for him.”Asked whether expected Gyökeres to go to another level in the second half of the season, Arteta said: “I think so, yes.”Ed Aarons5.Moyes claims West Ham undersold RiceDavid Moyes believes West Ham were short-changed when they sold Declan Rice to Arsenal for £105m as the England international was worth £150m. Moyes faces his former West Ham captain when the Premier League leaders visit Everton on Saturday evening.The pair remain in contact, as do Moyes and his former Everton captain Mikel Arteta, and the Scot’s view that Rice was sold cheaply in 2023 has strengthened over the course of the midfielder’s Arsenal career. Rice was the joint-most expensive British footballer of all-time when he left West Ham for £100m, plus £5m in add-ons, but his former manager believes Arsenal landed a bargain.“I genuinely meant it at the time – I thought Declan was £150m,” said Moyes. “I thought we didn’t get enough at West Ham, I really didn’t. We had offered Declan huge contracts to stay but we couldn’t get him to stay. And we knew, so the club had to do what they had to do. I think it was £105m in the end but I always thought he was £150m at that time.”Friday marked 12 months since The Friedkin Group was announced as Everton’s new owners and Moyes believes the company is satisfied with the progress made so far, although he insists there is more to be done.View image in fullscreenDavid Moyes likes what he is hearing from The Friedkin Group.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThe Everton manager explained: “I get the feeling we are in a pretty good place with them. They are happy and I think they are seeing progress around the club, around the team, obviously there’s the new stadium, so I think the pace is being set. I don’t think we are going to be a club that’s owned by a state and can keep spending so much, I think it will be done in a business way.“We are getting in a better position but there are other things. We want to try and bring our academy back to life, and things like that are going to take much longer. We are seeing how the new stadium is coming along and there are probably a few things there. The first-team squad had 12 players coming out of contract so I knew we wouldn’t be able to fix that right away.“You could say: ‘How many windows is that going to take?’ I don’t think you can put a number on it, you just have to accept that hopefully the new ownership are right behind us and are going to try and help us improve every chance we get. They’ve been pretty good.”Andy Hunter6.Bournemouth blow as Adams is ruled outBournemouth midfielder Tyler Adams has been ruled out for at least two months after sustaining a medial collateral ligament injury in Monday’s4-4 draw at Manchester United. Adams was forced off after just five minutes at Old Trafford and Andoni Iraola confirmed the extent of his injury before Saturday’s fixture against Burnley.Iraola said: “From our previous experience with MCL injuries, it is normally around two or three months. It’s a big blow because he is an important player for us. Straight away, when you see the mechanism of the injury and the action itself, we felt it could be something serious.”Bournemouth are boosted in other areas with Lewis Cook set to return after completing his three-match suspension, while Ryan Christie, who has been out since November with a knee injury, faces a late fitness test.View image in fullscreenTyler Adams injured a knee in the 4-4 draw with Manchester United.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/ShutterstockMeanwhile, Iraola insisted he is relaxed about Marcos Senesi’s future at the club after the defender’s failure to sign a new contract led to increased speculation that he is set to leave.“The most important thing is he is playing very well,” said Iraola. “Both parties still have time regarding his contract situation – there are still seven months left. There is no doubt I want him to continue here.”PA MediaExplore more on these topicsFootballThe talkPremier LeagueManchester CityWolverhampton WanderersLiverpoolArsenalBournemouthnewsShareReuse this content"

Wolves appear to be answering that question this season. Sixteen games into the season they are without a win, have just two points, and are threatening to relieveDerby Countyof the unenviable label of the Premier League’s worst ever team. This isn’t just another bad side going down; this is a club threatening to become the Premier League’s ultimate cautionary tale.Wolves may have already crossed that line. They became the first team in Premier League history to start consecutive campaigns with 10 or more winless matches, and now they stand on the brink of further infamy. Failure to beat Brentford this weekend would mean Wolves had equalled Sheffield United’s record 17-game winless start in the 2020-21 season.The broader picture is even more damning. With just 0.13 points per game, they are on course to finish the season with fewer than five points. This would not only fall short of Derby’s notorious 11-point campaign in 2007-08 but fail to reach even half of that total. Derby had six points at this stage of the season.Wolves had become a solid Premier League club over the past few years. After earning promotion by winning the Championship in 2017-18, they have enjoyed a few peaks: anFA Cup semi-final at Wembley in 2019, a run to theEuropa League quarter-finals in 2020and, perhaps their greatest achievement of all, eight consecutive seasons in the English top flight – their longest run since a nine-year streak between 1967 and 1976.Successive seventh-place finishes in 2018-19 and 2019-20, the two seasons after their promotion, encouraged their more starry-eyed fans to dream of a new era at Molineux. Perhaps some even had flashbacks to the glory days under Stan Cullis. Nuno Espírito Santo had built a side with a clear identity, one rooted in organisation but unafraid of expression.Adama Traoré was encouraged to embrace chaos down the right wing with his lightning speed; Diogo Jota was given licence to drift and attack space from the left; and Rúben Neves, Leander Dendoncker and João Moutinho orchestrated the play. Raúl Jiménez was the focal point; the Mexican scored or set up 61 goals over those two seasons. What Wolves would do for just a fraction of that output this season.Molineux was a theatre of goals and Portuguese flair. Fast forward to today and even their own manager cannot bear to watch his side. “I’d be angry if I were a Wolves supporter,” Rob Edwards said after their 15th loss of the season, against Manchester United. The fans protesting against the club’s owners outside the stadium for the first 15 minutes of that game would have been better off staying thereas their side were beaten 4-1. The performance summed up their season: uninspiring, no attacking intent and a defensive structure leakier than a sieve.View image in fullscreenThe squad that took Wolves to seventh-placed finishes, an FA Cup semi-final and a Europa League quarter-final has been dismantled.Photograph: Sam Bagnall/AMA/Getty ImagesWolves have slipped into mediocrity over the last five years. The fans who dared to dream when they were playing at Wembley or taking on Sevilla in the Europa League have watched the team finish 13th, 10th, 13th, 14th and 16th in the Premier League. After two relegation fights, five managers coming and going, and the sale of any player who dared to show a glimpse of potential, this season felt inevitable.The club has spent years quietly dismantling the spine that brought them success. Jiménez, Neves,Traoré, Pedro Neto, Matheus Nunes, Max Kilman, Conor Coady and Moutinho have all left for greener pastures, each departure chipping away at the team before it could live up to the promise it had shown.The exits of Rayan Aït-Nouri and Cunha in the summer may have been the final nail in the coffin. They were directly involved in 32 of the team’s 54 league goals last season and both ranked among the Premier League’s best for take-ons, progressive carries and goal-creating actions – all areas of creativity where Wolves are now ranking near the bottom of the league. Their replacements came in the form of players with no Premier League experience, shifting that heavy burden on to the shoulders of Fer López, Tolu Arokodare and Jhon Arias.Unsurprisingly, they have struggled to make an impact. Arias has yet to score or set up a goal in 15 appearances; Arokodare looks a ghost of the striker who scored 21 goals in Belgium last season; and López may be sent on loan to Celta Vigo just a few months after he arrived for £19m. Wolves gambled on promise over proven quality and it backfired.Football quiz: how much do you know about the Africa Cup of Nations?Read moreWolves tore the creative pulse out of their side and tried to patch it up with sticking plasters. It is no surprise they have scored just nine goals this season and have become the first club to enter December with no player with more than a single goal since Leicester in 1977-78. Even Jørgen Strand Larsen, whomNewcastle tried to sign for £50m in the summer, has delivered a solitary goal across 14 appearances.And yet, even amid the chaos, not everything has been lost. They showed plenty of fight in their2-1 defeat at Arsenallast Saturday. Losing a game after scoring two own goals – one of which came in the dying seconds of the game – must have been heartbreaking for the players but this felt like a disappointment with a silver lining. They were a minute away from becoming just the second visiting team to take a point from the Emirates Stadium this season, after Manchester City. Players knew their roles, mistakes were minimised, the team had structure and the defence was stubborn.Wolves showed heart and resolve; they have not given up. As Robert Earnshaw, who played for Derby in 2007-08, has warned: “You can relegate yourself based on how you think. It was almost as if everyone gave up. It was 20 games to go and it was like: ‘We’re never going to do it.’” A team can be undone as much by doubt as by goals conceded; Edwards will be hoping the performance he saw at Arsenal will give them the hope and confidence they need to avoid making unwanted history.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsWolverhampton WanderersGuardian Sport NetworkDerby CountySheffield UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

West Ham v Manchester City, Liverpool v Chelsea, Manchester United v Tottenham and Crystal Palace v Arsenal means the top four in the Women’s Super League are involved. With clubs having voted to remove teams competing in the Champions League from next season, major changes are afoot.The future format of the League Cup is still to be finalised and is subject to Football Association signoff but this forms part of plans for a revamp of an underloved competition that has an identity crisis. The changes include ditching the confusing group stage with its uneven number of teams, weird point scoring and odd geographical groupings. It is understood proposals have been put together in consultation with a competition working group that included clubs and was reviewed by representatives from fan associations through the Football Supporters’ Association.WSL at halfway: best of the season, second-half hopes and biggest gripeRead moreInstead, aSwiss-style league formatwill be used, with the top eight going into the knockout stage. At present, the two or three teams in the Champions League group stage enter at the quarter-finals, potentially winning the tournament having played three games.There is logic to excluding Champions League clubs. The international match calendar is strangling players. Those at the top – the minority, but the audience drivers – are playing more than ever. According to Fifpro’s recently released Precarious Workload report, last season the top 15 players in its sample played 50 games or more in a season for the first time since it began collecting data in this area in 2020. The three-time Ballon d’Or winner Aitana Bonmatí, who recentlysustained a leg fractureruling her out for at least five months, topped the list with 60 appearances.There is a difficult balance to be struck. In the WSL, one of the most developed leagues in the world, 43% of players made fewer than 20 appearances and 72% played fewer than 30 matches, with only 11% playing 40 or more matches.View image in fullscreenAitana Bonmatí faces a long spell on the sidelines after fracturing her left tibula during a training session with the Spanish national team.Photograph: Soccrates Images/Getty ImagesWSL Football, the body responsible for the WSL and WSL2, has very little wriggle room though. It does not have enough weekends in the calendar to play with,despite data suggesting that across the top women’s leagues international windows account for six weekends. It has a square peg and Fifa has, in the form of the international match calendar, provided a round hole to try to fit it in.The problem is complex. The NWSL, WSL, Liga F, Frauen-Bundesliga and Première Ligue use weekends differently but domestic club matches account for about three-quarters of the games played by the footballers from those divisions.When WSL Football confirmed that England’s top flight would expand from 12 to 14 teams from the 2026-27 season, something many viewed as long overdue, it also announced changes to licence criteria minimum standards and guidelines around player loading, which included a minimum six-week break after a major tournament before the season kicks off, a two-week winter break, a maximum of two consecutive weeks with midweek games across any competition for any club and no midweek games after international breaks.For this player care approach, though, it is in effect being punished, with not enough available matchdays.It is understood that when expanding the top tier was explored, the option of moving to 16 teams was looked at but ruled out in part owing to a lack of space in the calendar.The expansion to 14 teams means an extra four matchdays need to be found, but the calendar is getting more restrictive owing to the introduction of the Champions Cup,which kicks off this season in late January, the expansion of the Champions League proper from 16 to 18 teams, the World Cup growing to 48 teams by 2031 and aClub World Cup on the horizon from 2028.Fifa is reducing the number of international windows from six to five in the 2026-29 calendar, but the arrival of the Champions Cup, which is essentially a Fifa window, counterbalances that (albeit with fewer players involved). It will be played annually other than in Women’s Club World Cup years.View image in fullscreenThe Women's Champions Cup has been added to the calendar, with the semi-finals and final being played in London in January and February.Photograph: Judit Cartiel/Fifa/Getty ImagesThe women’s Champions League semi-finals are also played on weekends, unlike in the men’s tournament, and WSL matches are not played on FA Cup weekends in the way they are in the men’s game.The Guardian understands Fifa does not view international football as a barrier to domestic growth but as one of its strongest drivers and best opportunities to grow the women’s game and that 1,041 clubs benefited from the £8.4m distributed to clubs through the Fifa Club Benefits Programme for players competing in the 2023 World Cup.Additionally, it is understood Fifa believes the solution to loading issues lies not in having fewer games but in smarter distribution of minutes and deeper squads, alongside raised minimum standards and sustainable financial foundations.The obvious benefit to losing Champions League sides from the League Cup is it removes at least one game from the most overloaded players and rewards players in teams with underloading problems (those who do not have enough games), giving them greater prospects in a competition won only by Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea in its 14-year history.It is clear the current League Cup format does not work and a revamp is needed. Something also needs to be done about a calendar that is stifling the development of the WSL, one of only two profitable women’s leagues in the world (with the NWSL in the US). We shouldn’t be adverse to, or instantly critical of, change or trying and failing. The chaotic draw for the League Cup quarter-finals, done live on TikTok by the influencer GK Barry and her girlfriend, the footballer Ella Rutherford, was an experiment gone wrong, but that is OK.Removing the Champions League teams from the League Cup has downsides though. First, teams in England realistically lose the significant opportunity of securing a domestic treble. Chelsea managed it last season, as did Barcelona, and it would put England out of step with the other key women’s leagues in Europe.Then, there is the impact on the League Cup itself. People want to see the top teams and top players and the change will affect broadcast interest, audience scope and sponsorship opportunities. There is also the risk it becomes a procession for the team that finishes fourth or for a club that failed to make it through the Champions League qualifiers.The best solution would be an international calendar that doesn’t undermine domestic leagues and competitions by prioritising the expansion of international football and international club football before the base is solid enough.In the absence of that, radical and not altogether perfect changes may be necessary.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

A bit of a pinch-me moment, a lot of goosebumps,” Renshaw said of the famous win.“A lot of people probably put us out of the contest, and probably we did as well when we lost that first wicket.“Just that never-say-die attitude. It was just trust yourself. We had a bit of luck on our side as well tonight.”There was drama in the final over when Max Bryant (28 off 16) had to retire hurt after appearing to dislocate his left shoulder after slipping while turning for a run.But Wildermuth kept his cool, hitting the winning runs to lift his side to victory with just one ball to spare.Wildermuth’s previous highest BBL score was 31, but he smashed that during an innings in which he cracked nine sixes.He was dropped on 42 when Ashton Turner fumbled a skied ball.Earlier, star Scorchers opener Mitch Marsh (3) fell cheaply for a second-straight match, but Connolly and Allen went about dismantling the Heat from there.Allen was dropped on four and 44 on the way to his highest BBL score, the New Zealander whacking eight sixes and three fours.Connolly, who helped guide Perth to a season-opening win over the Sydney Sixers, smacked six sixes and six fours against the Heat for his second consecutive half-century.“It’s a hell of a game for Big Bash cricket – it’s exciting,” Connolly said after the loss.“Unfortunately, we weren’t on the winning side of it. Credit to Wildermuth and Renshaw – they played superb knocks.”Explore more on these topicsBig Bash LeagueCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Lando Norris was unable to emulate Lewis Hamilton, who had pipped McIlroy when the Northern Irishman was a warm favourite in 2014. And withEurope’s Ryder Cup winnersalso being named team of the year, a delighted McIlroy was able to reflect on a blockbuster night for him and his sport.Rory McIlroy named Sports Personality of the Year at emotional ceremonyRead more“This has been a great night for golf,” he said. “There’s been golfers that have been up for this award that haven’t quite done it, and I’ve been one of them. But golf was recognised in such a big way, with the team winning and then with my award. It’s a big night for golf, and hopefully we can build upon that.”But rather than celebrate at the aftershow party, McIlroy was already focusing on his next sporting adventure. Having played in the Golf Channel Games in Florida on Wednesday, and flown to the UK, he was heading straight back to the sunshine state to watchAnthony Joshua’s fight with Jake Paul.“It’s been a whirlwind 24 hours,” said McIlroy. “I landed here, went straight to the Stick to Football studio and did that with the boys. Hopping on a plane on Friday, I’m going to the fight in Miami. So I’ve sort of been here, there and everywhere, but I’m looking forward to a little bit of downtime over Christmas.” However, McIlroy said he has no plans to rest on his laurels, despite completing the career grand slam with victory at Augusta in April. “I still feel like I’ve got a few good years in me,” he said. “Knock on wood, I’ve been injury-free. I’ve been on tour for half my life, 18 years, but still feel the enthusiasm for the game.“More majors,order of merit titles, Ryder Cups, that’s great. But as long as you feel like you can keep improving at the game, and have the hunger and the drive to try to keep getting better, that’s the most important thing.”Meanwhile Tommy Fleetwood, who was on stage to receive Europe’s team of the year award, also lauded golf’s remarkable night – and his great friend’s achievement.View image in fullscreenTommy Fleetwood was an important part of Europe’s Ryder Cup-winning team in September.Photograph: David Davies/PA“Those are the times and memories that will live with us for ever so to get the public’s recognition for that is really cool,” he said. “We’re very lucky. And to be there watching Rory pick that up, I think he deserves it so much. He’s had such a phenomenal career and a phenomenal year. So to see how happy he was stood on stage, and to be there with him, that was amazing.”When reminded that McIlroy was only the third golfer to win the award in its 71-year history, Fleetwood smiled before quipping: “Not a very popular bunch are we!”Fleetwood hopes to finally win his first major next year but he knows McIlroy still thirsts for more success despite having “completed golf” at the Masters. “As long as you want to be the best you can be, and you’re still motivated, you’ll find things that you want to improve,” the 34-year-old said. “Goals come and go. There are things that motivate you, things you want to achieve, things that inspire you. It’s easier for me than it is for Rory, probably at the moment. He has kind of completed golf. But I’m sure he’s got a lot more he wants to do.”Rory McIlroy secures career grand slam with dramatic Masters playoff win over Justin RoseRead moreBefore McIlroy left, there was one final question. As a huge Manchester United fan, he has been asked to parade his trophies at Old Trafford in the past. So could he be persuaded to do it again after his Masters and Spoty triumphs?“As long as theystop conceding four goals at home,” he replied. “The last United game I watched was the Europa League final in Bilbao and I was, like: ‘Why did I fly all this way to watch this?’ But they’re getting better. There’s a few encouraging signs there. There’s a little bit of optimism around.”Not everyone will agree. But after a 2025 for the ages, it’s no wonder that McIlroy is looking on the bright side.Explore more on these topicsBBC Sports Personality of the YearGolfRory McIlroynewsShareReuse this content"

For the Olympics, Eurosport – nowTNT Sports– made live coverage from Paris available to streaming subscribers for £3.99, and plans to do similar for Glasgow.TNT also has the UK rights for next year’s Winter Olympics in Milan following last year’s merger with the Warner Bros-owned Eurosport, as well as the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles, part of which will also be shown by the BBC. Having recently lost the rights to the Champions League and international rugby, TNT regards securing the Games as a coup.The decision of Commonwealth Sport, which runs the Games, to prioritise revenue over reach reflects its financial problems before an event that has been beset by difficulties and could have been cancelled altogether.Glasgow stepped in as last-minute host after Australia pulled out, with £100m of funding for the event still coming from the state of Victoria, which was the original host. The Games have been reduced in size, with fewer events, but the financial margins remain tight.While it did make an offer, the BBC is open about prioritising other sporting events that bring in more viewers. The BBC has added live rights to Bundesliga football, the Women’s Champions League and the home nation’s World Cup qualifiers, as well as retaining its existing coverage of Six Nations rugby and highlights of the men’s Champions League.The long-term future of the Games remains in doubt amid declining interest from broadcasters, sponsors and athletes, but last month’s announcement that Ahmedabad will host the event in 2030 has provided a timely boost.India is also preparing a bid to stage the Olympics for the first time in 2036 in what is expected to be a straight fight with Qatar.“This is another landmark moment as we continue to re-imagine what a Commonwealth Games looks and feels like for athletes and fans alike,” said Katie Sadleir, the chief executive of Commonwealth Sport. “With a heavyweight broadcast partner like Warner Bros Discovery on board across the UK and Europe for Glasgow 2026 and the recent decision to award the 2030 Commonwealth Games to India, alongside strong interest for 2034, the future of our movement has never been more secure.“With more events available live and a strong focus on athlete storytelling, fans will be closer to the Games than ever before.”Explore more on these topicsCommonwealth GamesBBCTNT SportsSports rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Bayern manager Vincent Kompany gave Díaz a few days off to press the reset button after his sending off against PSG, but now the 28-year-old winger is back and ready to wrap up the year as Bayern play their final game of 2025 this Sunday when they travel to Heidenheim. I spoke to the Colombian star about his new club, life in Germany and next summer’s World Cup, which includes a headline matchup against Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal.This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.Why do you think you have acclimated well to Bayern, especially given you’ve had to adjust to the Bundesliga?I think it’s because they have placed a tremendous amount of trust in me. From the first day, my teammates and the club also made me feel welcome very quickly, and even though learning the language is a little difficult they made me feel like part of the family. The truth is that with Bayern I have found a very united team, at ease -something I have always been used to and something I have always wanted. So that’s why this has been very easy.I was also coming from good years atLiverpool, the final year especially, so playing in the Premier League really helped me. And for me I wanted a challenge and to play in the Bundesliga, try a new experience. I knew that I would do well. Obviously I didn’t expect for me to do well so quickly but that’s what I work for.You have always been a creative player but it seems that Kompany has really allowed you to be even more free. Do you agree?Yes, completely. I feel more confident, more comfortable. And I also have a spectacular group [of teammates] where all of us play for the team. I mean, we have many stars! But we play more together and so that’s very important as well. It’s worth repeating.After the game against St Pauli, Kompany said you have a “chaotic creativity.” You’re someone who can always do something in chaos. Do you see yourself as someone who likes to create chaos on the pitch?[Laughs] Yes, totally. I love [the chaos]. I try to enjoy it as much as possible. Obviously with the commitment that you must have, [you do] whatever the manager asks of you. But I also want to enjoy it and create those chaotic moments you were talking about. It’s fundamental for me because I also live on the pitch like that, a player that causes headaches.You mentioned there are no egos among the team there are certainly a lot of stars. One of them is Harry Kane.Wow. Harry Kane … is incredible. I faced him many times back when he was with Tottenham so I knew him on the pitch but never shared it with him. Because one thing is seeing him and the other is sharing with him in training or in the dressing room.The day by day…Exactly, the day by day. The little details. He surprised me.How did he surprise you?He does things in training where I say to myself, “this can’t be.” He’s so good. So good. It’s the truth! He plays so much and does everything well. Hunts for the ball, passes, defends – you watch him defend, he dedicates himself so much, someone so calm … and yet he scores goals. This guy lives for them. Each one that comes to him – once, twice, three times – he scores all of them.He’s also a great person. Very down-to-earth, family-orientated…just a spectacular person.View image in fullscreenLuis Díaz and Harry Kane have formed a formidable partnership at Bayern.Photograph: Alex Grimm/Getty ImagesBayern’s other objective is to win the Champions League again.How confident are you of the club’s hopes of winning it once again?Every time I come to a new club, just because of the way I am, I want to win everything. Whatever is up for grabs. The club obviously wants to win [the Champions League] from the beginning, and we are currently doing well. But at the end I think we need to show it and confirm it at the final stages.I remember in my school days I had to learn German and thought it was the hardest thing in the world. How do you, your partner Geraldine and two daughters like living in Germany? Was it a culture shock?Honestly, my life here has been great because the city of Munich is also so great. There are so many things to do. It’s big, there are lots of things to do with the kids, the restaurants…Have you found any Arepas? (traditional Colombian patties)No, that’s impossible here – you know the best Arepas are Colombian! But no, honestly, there are lots of great things here. It’s very modern and clean, I love Munich. I go out with the girls to the park and everything else. The public respects [your privacy] – they see you but they respect you. They’re very grateful. My family too.Your kids are going to speak three languages now!Yes! The eldest especially speaks English too and I love that because we didn’t have that growing up. I didn’t learn English in school, only Spanish. So for them to have it is a great advantage.But not with a scouse accent.[Laughing]Yes, exactly.View image in fullscreenColombia are likely to draw large crowds in the United States for the 2026 World Cup.Photograph: Gabriel Aponte/Getty ImagesLet’s finish with Colombia. Now you know your group at theWorld Cup. You will face Ronaldo and Portugal in Miami! It will be one of the biggest matches of the group stages and it will surely have a tremendous amount of Colombian support. How do you feel about it?We are very excited for the World Cup, we’ve had a great process [getting there] underel profesorNéstor [Lorenzo] since he came and I think we have grown a lot. We have played some good matches, learned some positive and equally learned some negative things. Bad and good. And so now you see a happy team, very calm, very united that aims for the same objective and I love that. I also see that our fans, our people are in the same sentiment.The game against Portugal? It’s going to be incredible. They have one of the best players in the world – Cristiano Ronaldo. I also had a chance to play with Vitinha [at Porto], they have Bruno Fernandes … it’s going to be a very well played match. We have shown that we can play against any national team and so we will obviously be looking for the win.The Colombian fans in America are everywhere – the largest South American community in the US. I myself live in New York City, I live close to Jackson Heights, Queens – which is basically Barranquilla. The Colombian fanbase is incredible here. Do you think that can help the national team next summer?Yes, yes, yes. Totally. That’s a super important factor. To have a complete fanbase and to fill half the stadium is incredible from all the matches we have played in the US. To have those fans to support us is going to be incredible and we will feel like we’re home. It’s going to be so enjoyable.I also wanted your thoughts on James Rodríguez as this is probably his final World Cup – anotherCafeterowho played for Bayern. How important is he to Colombia – the fans and the team?He’s our captain, our leader and every time he puts on the Colombian shirt he transforms himself. He always gives everything for the national team every time he plays and he’s the one we look up to. He’s also at an age that allows him to be more at ease, happy and enjoy life. I don’t know how long he has, I want to enjoy him more! I want him always with the national team. So for us, the national team, for our people – he is the No 10. The captain. He is everything for us.Luis Miguel Echegaray is a writer, analyst and host specializing in soccer and sports content that also appeals to the U.S. Latino audience.

Gone is the early morning scramble to get through to a harassed GP receptionist for help. Patients now contact theirdoctor’s AIto explain their ailments. It quickly cross-checks the information against the patient’s medical history and provides a pre-diagnosis, putting the human GP in a position to decide what to do next.In face-to-face consultations an AI may listen in the background, weigh the facts of the patient’s case against thousands of medical studies, propose a course of drugs based on the full depth of the latest medical research, which the human doctor could never fully digest. It provides a second opinion for the doctor, who can assess its proposals before deciding how to act.The public may not be wholly averse to this change. Thirty-eight per cent of people favour using AI to speed up triage in the NHS although 52% prefer humans, citing trust and wanting personal interaction, polling by Ipsos in October 2025 found.Medical screening becomes highly sophisticated and perhaps a little invasive. Doctors could be sent details of your diet and vital statistics tracked by wearable devices. Smart toilets may even analyse your bowel movements. Medicines could be produced exactly tailored to your body and its needs.If it all works, diseases are spotted quicker and medicines are more accurately prescribed, but the combination of one AI and one human medic creates a new tension. The best doctors become those most adept at interpreting the outputs of the AIs. Medical schools change their teachings to focus more on managing AI medics, and politicians wrestle with how to overhaul medical regulation and ethics.The future of AIThe rivals racing to create super-intelligence.

Solicitors preparing for trial have learned to delegate the legwork of unearthing case law and planning arguments to an AI, which proposes the best approach for a barrister to take in court. The current problems of AIs making up case law, as happened at least 95 times in July and August,accordingto trackers, have been ironed out. The new, more robust artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems compress days of work into hours, leaving the human solicitor only to check the AI’s brief to the human barrister.Next, amid a courts backlog, pressure grows to largely replace barristers too. An experiment is launched allowing adversarial AIs to argue cases in front of a human judge and jury. The results prove compelling. Cases are concluded at a fraction of the cost to the taxpayer and much faster. But numerous miscarriages of justice soon emerge. Campaigners for people wrongly imprisoned begin to demand greater transparency about the inner workings and biases of the AI lawyers.Having unleashed AGI, governments and companies have to constantly surveil the autonomous systems, employing people to sit at banks of screens, shutting down dangerous behaviour, dispatching good AIs to hunt down bad AIs.The morning routineView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianView image in fullscreenAGI Comics—HF-edits Morning-2Illustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianGlasses, wake me up at 7amView image in fullscreenAGI Comics—HF-edits Morning-3Illustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianView image in fullscreenAGI Comics—HF-edits Morning-4Illustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianWAIT! … Were there any eggs in the fridge?!View image in fullscreenAGI Comics—HF-edits Morning-5Illustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianHe’s asleep now, I can’t ask him.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianHe’s clumsy when he hasn’t eaten his breakfast eggs.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianWhat if he drops me?

But then they also start to do things for us – and maybe even worry about not doing a good enough job.“First principle is, you have a bunch of these AI agents that do things for you,” says David Shrier, professor of practice, AI and innovation at Imperial Business School. “These will be specially programmed AIs that have different areas of expertise and are customised – adapted to you and your specific needs. So they learn … what you want and they go and do it for you.”You might start your day with the help of an information agent. “It goes out, it curates the articles and when you wake up in the morning and as you are brushing your teeth, it’s reading out to you summaries and interpretation of the news. It can provide some deeper understanding for you.”This second-guessing based on deep algorithmic familiarity extends to your breakfast. If you have been wearing augmented reality glasses, the AI will have noticed when you opened the fridge that you’ve run out of eggs. When you go downstairs at 7am your phone lights up to say an Amazon drone has delivered you some eggs.Shrier adds that all of this requires consent, meaning “you know what you are allowing the AI to understand and know about you, and you get to easily opt out if you don’t want your data shared.”AI on the farmView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianOld MacdonaldView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The Guardianhad a farmView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianAI-AI-OA farmer’s rounds, checking on the health of livestock, crops, feed supplies and machinery – which can take from dawn to dusk – become far less onerous. With cameras and sensors rigged to trees, barns, fence posts and itinerant robots, every farm delivers a torrent of data to help increase productivity and animal welfare. Already, in 2025, an AI model is under development to detect early infections in cows by tracking subtle shifts in their social behaviour. A herd in Somerset is being filmed around the clock to train a model to predict if an animal is in the early stages of mastitis, which affects milk production and is an animal welfare problem. A decade later and with data harnessed from millions of farms around the world, AGI advises not only what to plant and when, but how to build stronger ecosystems, and improve soil health. AGI-powered robots could stalk the fields rooting out weeds and reducing the need for herbicides.Less work, more playView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The Guardian… and this was called an office …View image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianFilled with people and chairs and phones and desks and carpet and water coolers and paperView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jay Cover/The GuardianThis was a board meeting.Yeah, they look bored!Sports clubs, live entertainment venues and travel agents boom as AGI transforms work, helping millions of white-collar workers whisk through their tasks leaving time for a new life of leisure – at least that is one theory.In the early years of AGI only a few people are made fully redundant by full automation, and most stay in work. For a while people retain the same 40-hour working week and simply get more work done.At work, AI could act like a “buddy” or a coach in meetings, says Shrier. It might advise you to go easy on another attender because they look a little stressed.“During your meeting you’re getting this sort of coaching and augmentation that makes you better at interacting.” As the chat ends, the AI sends you a list of next steps to take following this meeting – and slots it into your project plan. As you get to your desk, your professional AI assistant is bringing you the documents and spreadsheets you need to deliver.AI-augmented economies could grow sharply. But soon people realise they can afford to work less.The 15-hour week, which the economist John Maynard Keynes in 1930 predicted would happen by 2030, becomes a reality. Leisure becomes less about rest and orientates towards creative activities, human-to-human socialising and time caring for children or elderly family members, academics havesuggested.“If you believe the premise that humans are social animals, they’re going to have to do something,” the US sports and entertainment mogul Ari Emanuelsaidin October as he announced new investments in live entertainment. “They can’t just sit at home, so they’ll go to music, they’ll go to sports and they’ll go to my live events.”But the shift to more spare time also creates a new problem: mass boredom. A generation conditioned for the nine to five and which had derived satisfaction from now-automated tasks such as populating spreadsheets or writing reports, struggles to adjust. Some people take to the new leisure like happy retirees and report increased wellbeing, but others struggle with mental health problems."

Nonetheless, it does have a name: the Com.Short for community, the Com is a loose affiliation of cybercriminals, largely native English language speakers typically aged from 16 to 25. Its activities run from crippling the IT systems of British retailers tophoning in bomb threats to schoolsand encouraging teenage girls to harm themselves.Thelatest victims of the Comare premium users of PornHub, one of the world’s largest pornography sites, who have had their search history and viewing habits hacked by a group called ShinyHunters. The gang has emerged from the Com’s sprawling networks, whose constituents also include Scattered Spider, a collective that has been linked withhacks against the British retailers M&S, the Co-op and Harrods.The Com is thought to comprise thousands of people but there is no formal membership and no tightly delineated groups.“The Com ranges from 11-year-olds trying to hack Minecraft to people in their mid-20s targeting vulnerable kids online,” says Aiden Sinnott, principle threat researcher at the cybersecurity firm Sophos.Sinnott describes the Com as operating like a pipeline where older members groom younger recruits into carrying out increasingly sophisticated, and damaging, acts of cybercrime.“Older members of the Com contact kids and try to get them to commit increasingly sophisticated acts of criminality, moving through to what we are seeing Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters do,” he says.Members of the Com communicate on platforms such as Discord and Telegram, sometimes exchanging extreme imagery or boasting about hacks. One such channel on Telegram, its name an amalgam of the ShinyHunters, Lapsus$ and Scattered Spider groups, carried a post this month stating: “We are the supply and demand for the Com.”The Com is well known to law enforcement on both sides of the Atlantic. In July the FBIissued a public warningabout the Com, describing it as a “primarily English speaking, international, online ecosystem comprised of multiple interconnected networks whose members, many of whom are minors, engage in a variety of criminal violations”.The UK’s NationalCrimeAgency has said reports of Com networks have increased six-fold in the UK from 2022-2024. The NCA describes Com members as “usually young men who are motivated by status, power, control, misogyny, sexual gratification, or an obsession with extreme or violent material”.The Com is split into three subsets. The first is Hacker Com, which comprises groups such as ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider and Lapsus$. Scattered Spider activities include crippling company IT systems and extracting private data, then demanding cryptocurrency for its return as part of a process known as aransomware attack. ShinyHunters and Lapsus$ have more commonly stolen data without the ransomware element. Other activities include hacking social media accounts and using them as fronts for crypto scams.Noah Urban, a 20-year-old Florida-based member of the Scattered Spider group, was sentenced to 10 years in jail this year for his part in a cybercrime spree that included cryptocurrency theft.The second subset is IRL, or In Real Life Com, linked to groups such as Bricksquad or ACG. Its activities includecalling out armed law enforcement on US university campusesunder false pretences, in a process known as “swatting”, subjecting schools to bomb threats, or offering violence-as-a-service where contracts to carry out violent acts – often against other Com members – are posted online, with afinancial breakdownfor each act of violence.The last grouping is Extortion Com, which targets vulnerable children and includes a notorious group known as 764. According to the FBI, the victims are typically aged between 10 and 17. They are coerced or extorted into sharing or live-streaming acts of self-harm, sexually explicit behaviour or even committing suicide. The footage is then circulated among network members, so the victims can continue to be extorted or controlled.Manipulating teenagers into carrying out sexual acts and then blackmailing them for money isknown as sextortionand the Com is known to carry this out. But there is also an element of cruel manipulation for the sake of it. The NCAdescribes Com networksthat “manipulate their victims, who are often children, into harming or abusing themselves, their siblings, or pets”.According to Sophos, there are more than 250 active FBI investigations into this branch of the Com alone, with some of its members motivated by a desire to cause “fear and chaos”, according to US law enforcement.In the UK this year, Cameron Finnigan, 19, from Horsham, West Sussex, was given a nine-year prison sentence for possessing a terrorist document and encouraging someone online to take her own life. Counter-terror police said he hadbecome involved with 764, which is described as a “Satanic extremist group” with an “extreme rightwing” ideology.“It’s not three set pillars,” says Sinnott. “There is some movement between the groups.”The Com is a fluid grouping and a growing threat.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeInternetCrimeHackinganalysisShareReuse this content"

The group has been “accused of targeting politicians and groups critical of the Chinese government”, the newspaper said.A government spokesperson told the Guardian: “We have been working to investigate a cyber incident. We take the security of our systems and data extremely seriously.”Although little is known about Storm 1849, it has been linked to a hacking campaign named ArcaneDoor first detected in 2024. Its victims have included government networks, according to the US tech firm Cisco, which had its technology targeted in those attacks.Ciscoissued an updated alertabout ArcaneDoor activity in late September, shortly before the Foreign Office hack reportedly took place. It has said the attacks have shown the hallmarks of a “sophisticated state-sponsored actor”.Toby Lewis, the global head of threat analysis at the UK cybersecurity company Darktrace, said it would be “reasonable” to suggest the ArcaneDoor and Whitehall attacks might be linked.“It would be fair to say these two things happened broadly at the same time and it would be a reasonable hypothesis to suggest they are linked,” he said.Lewis added that Chinese state-backed actors are known to target large sets of data. In 2024 the governmentblamed Chinafor ahack of the UK’s Electoral Commission, in whichaccesswas gained to the personal information of approximately 40 million people.“We do see some Chinese threat groups targeting datasets that might serve a benefit to Beijing in the future,” said Lewis.‘The frontline is everywhere’: new MI6 head to warn of growing Russian threatRead moreBryant said the investigation could take “quite a long time” to identify the attacker.He said: “We managed to close the hole, as it were, very quickly. There was a technical issue in one of our sites, I gather, and we’re fairly confident there’s a low risk of any individual actually being affected by this.“I know that some of the reports have said potentially various things could happen. I think that’s a bit more speculation than is helpful. So I don’t want to scaremonger. We are on top of it. And also, it’s not entirely clear where this has come from. I know everybody’s speculating about that as well.”Asked ifChinawas behind the attack, Bryant said: “That’s not entirely clear.””Explore more on these topicsForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeCybercrimeHackingInternetChris BryantChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The company has consistently denied the allegations.During Joe Biden’s administration, Congress passed legislation prohibiting ByteDance from retaining operational ties with TikTok US. However, the national security law gave the US president the power to decide whether any deal met its requirements.Trump has approved the joint venture that will control TikTok’s US business.Under the new structure Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX will each control 15%. Existing ByteDance investors will take 30.1%, while ByteDance will own 19.9% – the maximum permitted under US foreign ownership laws. The remaining 5% will be held by as-yet-unnamed new investors.The US joint venture will be overseen by a seven-member board of directors, the majority of whom will be American, according to Chew’s staff memo.“Upon the closing, the US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organisation, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” he added.In September, the Trump administration said a framework agreement had been reached after abreakthrough in negotiationsbetween US and Chinese officials.JD Vance, the US vice-president, said at the time that the deal would value TikTok’s US joint venture at $14bn.Under the arrangement, Oracle will oversee the algorithm that recommends videos in US users. The system will be retrained using US data to “ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation”, Chew’s memo states.China will retain control of the algorithm, with the country’s cybersecurity regulator previously saying it had agreed that any TikTok US deal would include “licensing … and other intellectual property rights”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.With white-wired headphones endorsed by celebrities including Lily-Rose Depp, Paul Mescal, Bella Hadid and Apple Martin, a growing number of people are breaking away from wireless listening.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For inspiration, there is the Instagram account@wireditgirls, or a Balenciaga campaignfeaturing the model Mona Tougaard reclining bed, wired headphones in place.Daniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at British Vogue, is familiar with the trend. “[It says] ‘I’m very effortless. I’m very nonchalant,” he says. “It’s become a real styleable accessory.”But in a culture where the forward march of technology is often treated as compulsory, wired headphones represent more than aesthetics. “It’s an analogue way of opting out – of both tech but also life,” says Rodgers. “They’re visible in a way that AirPods aren’t. There is a sense of ‘do not disturb’.”View image in fullscreenRetro tech is making a comeback, with some users of wired headphones embracing tangles as part of the charm.Photograph: Tara Moore/Getty ImagesThat symbolism is on full display on the cover of New York magazine’slatest issue, which features celebrities riding the subway: Debbie Harry with the Geese frontman Cameron Winter, Ben Stiller with the Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns and Macaulay Culkin with the SubwayTakes presenter Kareem Rahma. The real story, however, is not the star power but the shared accessory in each image: wired headphones.The pictures were taken by Hannah La Follette Ryan, the Brooklyn-based photographer behind the Instagram account@SubwayTakes, which documents New Yorkers on public transport. She says: “I see the revival as an extension of digital fatigue. Who wants another glitchy expensive gadget to charge?”Price is clearly part of the appeal of wired headphones – Apple’s EarPods cost £17 compared with £99 for AirPods – but nostalgia is also a factor.“We’re seeing retro tech come back,” says Tom Morgan-Freelander, the deputy editor of the technology magazine Stuff. “And as part of that, brands are starting to bring back wired headphones.”He says some younger consumers are switching to wired for sound quality, which is typically better with cables. “Bluetooth became the norm, and there was an acceptance that, for wireless convenience, you’re going to lose a bit of quality,” he adds.Then there is the issue of tangles. While wireless headphones are stored neatly in a case, wired varieties are often found in a knot at the bottom of a bag.View image in fullscreenDespite the revival of wired headphones, Bluetooth models continue to outsell them.Photograph: Blend Images/AlamyLa Follette Ryan suggests this is part of the appeal. “The tangle is inevitable,” she says. “Think of a headphone knot as a more user-friendly Rubik’s Cube. Relish the opportunity to slow down and solve a little puzzle.”If wired headphones have become the choice of the fashion-conscious despite these inconveniences, that could change soon. AirPods remain the bestseller at Currys but the retailer reports sales ofBeats Solo 4over-ear headphones have risen by 193% since last year.Morgan-Freelander also points to the £20FiiO Snowsky Wind, a design that looks like the earphones worn with a Sony Walkman in the 1980s.Rodgers still believes wired headphones have the edge. “Even though we are constantly being [sold upgrades], there’s a sort of disengagement [with wired headphones], which is always really hot, right?” he says. “You never want to look like you’re too into anything.”La Follette Ryan, however, thinks there is room for every option. “I just bought a Discman and Sony headphones,” she says, “but I will always keep my wired headphones for sharing an earbud with a friend.”Explore more on these topicsAccessoriesHeadphonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When handing down the sentence, the judge said he was responsible for four deaths, yet he never faced charges for supplying the pills that killed Max.“Snapchat never gave this critical evidence, never took action, never stopped the dealer who had been selling drugs on their platform for years before Max’s death and even after,” said Kim Osterman, his mother. “It took three separate requests from law enforcement forSnapchatto even respond, and when they did, they claimed there was no information.”A police report reviewed by the Guardian shows a delay in obtaining data from the dealer’s Snapchat account, which investigators said they needed to definitively link him to Max’s death. The report also states that Snapchat did not provide law enforcement with any content from Max’s account apart from his user information. When Colorado detectives first sent Snap Inc, the app’s parent company, a production of records request for account information on skyhigh.3o3, it took more than two months to receive a reply. When the response did arrive, Snap said it would not comply, citing a grammar technicality in the order. The inclusion of a “/”, the company argued, made the request “ambiguous”, according to a field case report from the Broomfield police department. The company eventually sent detectives information on the drug dealer’s account,skyhigh.303,in response to several separate warrants law enforcement filed in the year after Max’s death. No content from Max’s Snapchat account was ever provided to law enforcement, the police report states.View image in fullscreenNo content from Max Osterman’s Snapchat account was provided to law enforcement, the police report states.Photograph: Obtained by The GuardianThe Guardian has reviewed four cases where Snap Inc andMetahave delayed or declined to comply with warrants and subpoenas requesting information related to serious crimes linked to their platforms. Eight law enforcement officers interviewed have said multiple cases reviewed by the Guardian are emblematic of a wider problem they face with the companies, which often delay or decline to comply with warrants and subpoenas requesting information related to serious crimes on their platforms. According to court records, police reports and interviews with law enforcement officials, these refusals and lags can derail investigations into crimes ranging from fentanyl deaths to child sexual exploitation.A Snap Inc statement reads: “Our deepest sympathies go out to the families who have suffered such heartbreaking loss. A critical part of our efforts to help keep our community safe includes our longstanding and crucial engagement with law enforcement to help bring criminals to justice for the harm they cause our community. In both instances, Snap responded to multiple legal requests relating to the cases, so the suggestion that we did not support these investigations is simply inaccurate.”Meta said in a statement: “We strongly disagree with the assertions made in this story, and our fast cooperation with law enforcement led to arrests in the cases in question. Last year, we received over 9,000 emergency requests from US authorities and resolved them within an average of 67 minutes – and even more quickly for cases involving child safety and suicide. To protect user privacy, it’s important that we follow appropriate legal processes and request clarifications where necessary, but we work to support law enforcement as much as we can.”The spokesperson added that Meta produced data in 88% of the nearly 75,000 requests it received from US authorities between July and December last year.In a statement, the International Centre for Missing and ExploitedChildren(ICMEC) called for clearer rules, faster processes and collaboration between law enforcement, lawyers and tech leaders reaching across the aisle.“Every day of delay puts a child at risk. It can exacerbate damage and even cost lives. We can’t afford to let the delays continue,” said Shawnna Hoffman, chief executive of ICMEC and a former legal technology expert witness. “But the problems now are real, and if cooperation and alignment can’t rapidly make these processes happen faster, then we would in principle support new regulations to force greater urgency.”Crime and no punishmentWhen platforms are not responsive, suspects can go unidentified and arrests can be postponed, giving perpetrators more opportunities to offend and putting the public at risk, said eight federal and state law enforcement officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorised to speak to the media.“These suspects are often transient. They might be at college for a semester, or just crashing with a friend, and by the time we get the data, they’ve already moved on,” said one officer with theInternet Crimes Against Children (ICAC)taskforce, a national network of law enforcement agencies dedicated to combating online child exploitation. “If we’d had the information in time, they would have been arrested. Instead, we show up and hear, ‘They moved out a few weeks ago.’”For ICAC officers pursuing cases of online exploitation, two companies stand out for their lack of cooperation: Meta and Snap. Investigators say some refusals are based on minor technicalities. “It can be something as minimal as a dash or comma,” said another ICAC officer. “It feels like they’re playing legal games. We’ve had objections from companies over clerical details that delay cases for a while.”Such lags can be especially devastating in cases of online child sexual exploitation and the production and distribution of child sexual abuse material, said members of law enforcement specializing in cases of crimes against children.In June, a Boston court sentenced Charlese Horton, a registered sex offender,to at least 25 years in prison for kidnapping and assaulting a boy lured to meet them through Facebook. Investigators say solving the case was made more difficult when Meta did not fully comply with the subpoenas they sent as exigent requests for information they urgently needed to identify Horton.“It can be weeks or months when we send a search warrant for data before companies get back to us,” said a current ICAC commanding officer. “When we are finally able to knock on the door and find the child victim, we determine that there has been additional abuse since we were waiting on that search warrant return.”Tension between police, privacy and platformsSubpoenas and warrants form the backbone of these investigations, allowing law enforcement to obtain evidence from social media profiles. Subpoenas can be issued by a court or government agency without needing a judge’s approval. With regards to social media, these legal orders can compel a company to provide basic account information such as a user’s name, email address or IP login records. They generally cannot access private communications. Warrants, which require judicial approval and a demonstration of probable cause, permit investigators to obtain sensitive material, such as private messages, photos and videos.Part of the tension between police and tech platforms stems from the legal framework that governs digital privacy and access to communications in the United States.The fourth amendment, which prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures” by the government, requires law enforcement officials to show probable cause and secure a judge’s approval before accessing private communications. In practice, that means investigators must obtain a search warrant before companies like Meta and Snap release sensitive material such as private messages.Layered on top of that barrier is the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) and its Stored Communications Act (SCA) provision, which set rules for how companies store and disclose user data. Advocates for digital privacy say this law serves as one of the only federal protections in a country that relies on ahaphazardpatchworkof statutes to govern online behavior.Critics say the law is outdated, as it was written decades before social media or smartphones existed and includes ambiguities that tech companies use to slow-walk or reject requests.“They are looking for reasons not to give information,” said a former commander of a state ICAC taskforce, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Big tech is going to protect their companies first. Their priority it’s not to share information. It’s to protect themselves from any liability.”Officials say this resistance is unique to big tech. Law enforcement officials characterized the response of industries like banking as much quicker, a matter of days rather than weeks or months. While entities that refuse could theoretically be held in contempt, tech firms bank on low appetite from law enforcement to take them on, said law enforcement officials.“You send a grand jury subpoena to them, and they don’t give anything back,” said a lieutenant from ICAC. “Or sometimes they say, ‘We don’t have anything for what you requested, or we can’t find anything based on your request,’ and they won’t tell you why.”Speeding up due processIn May, the Colorado governor, Jared Polis, vetoed astate bill on children’s online safetyin the face of heavy lobbying from across industries. He cited the bill’s potential to “erode privacy, freedom and innovation” as the reason for his veto. The bill included a mandate for a 72-hour deadline for social media companies to respond to police requests, and to provide direct hotlines for law enforcement.Testifying in support of the bill before the state’s senate judiciary committee in April, Brian Mason, the district attorney for Adams and Broomfield counties, where Max Osterman lived, stated that social media companies “regularly” failed to respond to legal documents they had been served in Colorado. Warrants, he said, often vanish into “a black hole”.“They’re massive social media companies that don’t seem to care when they get a valid warrant from a jurisdiction like mine in Colorado,” said Mason.In child sex-trafficking cases, limited access to digital records not only deepens the trauma for victims but also makes it harder to investigate crimes, members of law enforcement said.Law enforcement officials note that when cases involve traumatized victims, their cooperation with investigations can be temporary. To avoid the investigation relying solely on the victim’s testimony, law enforcement focuses on building cases through digital evidence.Even in emergency cases – when police have reasonable grounds to believe someone is in imminent danger and file what they dub an “exigent request”, which is a legal demand meant to trigger immediate compliance – tech companies often pick and choose which requests to honor, according to five members of law enforcement. Investigators say those decisions come at a cost to public safety.Boston police’s investigation into Charlese Horton began after a 14-year-old boy was kidnapped and assaulted at gunpoint in an alley in the city’s Dorchester neighborhood. Four months later, the same boy was kidnapped again. He reported the attacks to police, and two more boys soon came forward with similar accounts. None of the victims knew each other, but all had been contacted throughFacebookaccounts tied to four aliases the attacker controlled, according to court documents.Detectives subpoenaed Meta for data on four accounts. Meta refused to honor the exigency requests for two of the accounts being used, without explanation, said two members of law enforcement. That decision, investigators said, probably allowed additional victims to go undiscovered.“Meta shouldn’t be the arbiter of what is and isn’t exigent,” said one member of law enforcement dealing with the case. “This was the company making its own judgment about whether we had an exigency case.”A statement from Meta asserts the company fully cooperated with the Boston police investigation.“Meta scrutinizes every law enforcement request, asbad actors have been known to use social engineeringto access government email accounts so they can request information from tech companies,” a spokesperson said.In a statement, Meta asserted that the two accounts it did not provide information on were actually duplicate requests. Law enforcement officers interviewed, however, dispute that characterization.Law enforcement has no direct line to communicate with some companies to question decisions or press their case further. For Meta and Snap, requests are routed through a web portal that offers no phone number and no direct access to the employees deciding whether to release evidence, a point of frustration mentioned by almost all members of law enforcement who spoke to the Guardian.“We make it as easy as possible for law enforcement to submit legal requests via an online portal and provide regular training sessions to the FBI and US local law enforcement on how to send in valid requests,” said a Meta spokesperson. “Our dedicated law enforcement response team in the US is also in ongoing contact with law enforcement to support them on live cases as needed, and our legal teams are regularly in touch with prosecutors and investigators to help with legal issues.”Sextortion tragedyWhen Michigan teen Jordan DeMay died by suicide after being targeted by Nigeriansextortion scammerson Instagram in 2022, Meta initially declined the Marquette county sheriff’s detectives’ requests, filed as exigent, for the transcripts of DeMay’s direct messages on the platform. This meant his family had to wait 48 hours for crucial details about why he died, and the sextortionistswere able to continueto target other victims.“Possibly it wasn’t considered an emergency because Jordan was already dead,” said John DeMay, Jordan’s father. “It was only when the FBI got involved that the warrant was accepted.”DeMay, who now has a copy of the transcript of the conversation between Jordan and the sextortionists, said it was obvious from the dialogue how urgent the situation was.“They wrote to Jordan, ‘I’m gonna watch you die a miserable death.’ And, Jordan replies to say, ‘I’m killing myself.’ And they say, ‘Good, do it now,’” said DeMay. “After reading that transcript and knowing that the sextortionist’s account was still active, and somebody had already died, there’s no reason that Meta should have not given that information. There’s zero reason for that.”In its statement, Meta noted that the justice department had publicly praised the company for cooperating with the FBI investigation into Jordan’s sextortionists. The company did not, however, address the early delays in the case, when the investigation was still being handled by local police.Dire circumstances, unreadable filesEven when companies do comply with warrants, the information they provide can be of little use. On 19 December 2024, 16-year-old Avery Ping died in Olympia, Washington, of a drug overdose after buying what he thought was ecstasy over Snapchat. The pills turned out to be a lethal mix of fentanyl, amphetamine and methamphetamine.Avery’s drug dealer had been under law enforcement surveillance since October 2024 in relation to other narcotics cases. Local police sent a warrant for the dealer’s Snapchat account data to Snap Inc on 5 November 2024 and waited 10 days. They did not receive a response from Snap until 25 November, when the company sent a file that law enforcement officials couldn’t open, said Aaron Ping, Avery’s father.View image in fullscreenAvery Ping with his dad, Aaron Ping.Photograph: Obtained by The Guardian“The detective told me they needed specific software to open it, and Snap didn’t give instructions on this,” said Ping. Ultimately, law enforcement officials could not open the file until early December.“Snap impeded on a big investigation on the dealer before Avery died. This guy was a prolific dealer, and had surveillance on his house, and they just were waiting for the Snapchat records,” said Ping. “The guy should have been in jail. Avery should be alive.”Snap Inc did not provide a response to these allegations.“Every day of delay means children remain in danger who could have been rescued, and there’s no legal consequence for dragging their feet,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project. “We need public visibility into how these companies perform. We need mandatory public reporting on response times and compliance rates. Self-regulation has failed – it’s time for lawmakers to act.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyMetaFacebookInstagramSnapchatChildrenDrugsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Can a gimmick turn into a new form of entertainment?Adrian HortonFri 19 Dec 2025 05.03 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 10.22 ESTShareIf you have been anywhere close to the social media blast radius ofThe Summer I Turned Pretty, Amazon Prime’sbreakoutYA series on a tortuous teen love triangle, you may be familiar with the plight of Henley and Luca. The star-crossed lovers of a short-form video series called Loving My Brother’s Best Friend – plot self-explanatory – have made waves on TikTok with yearning stares and “I/we can’t do this” drama that echo the many fan edits of beloved TV couple Belly and Conrad. But whereas The Summer I Turned Pretty explored its central tension over 40-minute episodes on streaming, Loving My Brother’s Best Friend, produced by a short-form company called CandyJar, distilled its appeal to its barest essences: sexual tension hook, escalating line and cliffhanger sinker, all within two-minute “episodes” on your phone. Without even meaning to or really wanting to, I watched the first 10 chapters (of 44) in one 15-minute gulp – and I’mnot the only one.Growing pains: the struggle to make a must-see gen Z TV showRead moreHollywood is hoping that you, too, will be hooked. Though Loving My Brother’s Best Friend may not look like a typical Hollywood product – in fact, it resembles some mix of teen show, soap opera and amateur fan-cam edit – the industry is investing heavily in the future of series like it:low-budget, mobile-only “microdramas”with episodes between 60 and 90 seconds. These shows, also known as “verticals” for their phone orientation, have already become widely popular in China, where mobile screens dominate entertainment even more than in the US. In just three years, revenue for serialized short-form drama in Chinarosefrom $500m in 2021 to $7bn in 2024, and is projected to reach $16.2bn by 2030. The global microdrama market for 2025 is estimated at anywhere from $7bn to 15bn – and booming, with nearlytriple revenue growthfor microdrama companies outside China in the past year.Until recently, major players in Hollywood stood on the sidelines, content to let such companies, which make money via advertising or user gaming app-esque “micropayments”, release risible shows including Fake Married to My Billionaire CEO or Fated to My Forbidden Vampire. But the boom in business – along withcontinuedindustryconsolidationandproduction shiftsaway fromCalifornia – has made cost-efficient microdrama impossible to ignore. “It is the first inning,” said Bill Block, the former CEO of Miramax whose new microdrama venture GammaTime has raised over $14m from such investors as Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. “This is now a firmly established market, in the beginning, with lots to explore in terms of taste.”The 50 best TV shows of 2025Read moreIf ReelShort and DramaBox, as Block said, “defined and won the first round”, Hollywood is looking to win the second. In just a few months, aflurry of dealshave brought industry mettle into the still nascent space, indicating a potential revolution in serialized entertainment. In August, several prominent studio veterans – former WME and ABC entertainment head Lloyd Braun, former Showtime president Jana Winograde, and ex-NBC Universal Television chair Susan Rovner – founded MicroCo, backed by the tech-driven entertainment company Cineverse. In October, Fox Entertainment announced an equity stake investment in the Ukrainian company Holywater, which owns the My Drama app, with a commitment to make more than 200 new shows for the platform in two years.Disneyhas given DramaBox a spot in its selective accelerator program, betting thecompanywill expand beyond werewolves and billionaire romance. Spanish-language company TelevisaUnivision is on track to release 40 telenovela shorts this year on its app ViX, with another 100 for 2026. Paramount Skydance promoted its studio filmRegretting Youvia ReelShort and isworkingwith the company to cross-pollinate material. Lionsgate and Hallmark arereportedly doing the same.This is not Hollywood’s first crack at short-form content. Companies from Netflix to Sundance TV haveexperimented with premium short-form– often, glossy episodes south of 15 minutes – for the better part of a decade. You may recall thespectacular bellyflop that was Quibi, the “quick bite” platform founded by the DreamWorks Animation co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman thatlaunchedin spring 2020 with high-budget series, A-list talent and $1.75bn in funding – only to fold within six months. (Its content sold to Roku for a mere $100m.)But industry veterans are betting that things are different this time. For one, TikTok viewing habits are far more entrenched now than in 2020. And Hollywood, as a place and industry, is “going through a real moment of transition”, said Natalie Jarvey, an entertainment journalist forthe Anklerwho hasclosely trackedthe rise ofmicrodrama production in Los Angeles. From executives to directors, writers to crew, “there are a lot of people who’ve been squeezed out of jobs,” she said. “Everyone is searching for the silver bullet – what’s going to save Hollywood? What’s going to bring jobs back?”The answer could be a $75,000 short-form filmed over a couple of days and released within weeks. “A lot of people who’ve worked for a long time in movies and TV to start to consider, well, maybe I could go work for a microdrama or I could make one myself,” said Jarvey. “It’s offering a glimmer of hope for a lot of people in this town right now.”I hate this TV series I’m binge-watching, yet I’m on track to complete all 177 episodes. Why am I doing it? | Imogen West-KnightsRead moreThe barren labor landscape in Los Angeles was one major consideration for Anthony Zuiker, the creator of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, to begin writing microdramas for Block’s GammaTime. “I have a lot of people that I love that can’t find work,” he said. Microdrama production is entirely non-union, swift and cheap – the budget for most shows hovers around $100,000 total – but it is work and it can be lucrative, with some actorsminting six-figure careersvirtually overnight. (Last month, Sag-Aftra, the major actors’ union,proposeda contract to allow microdrama companies to employ union actors for rock-bottom minimum rates – $250 a day for lead performers, $164 for everyone else – plus provisions for overtime, pension and health contributions, and standard protections for stunts and sex scenes. The deal has not been finalized.)Zuiker is betting on microdramas’ potential to circumvent some longstanding structural issues with traditional entertainment. For one, the protracted timelines of film and TV production, which often stretches into the years even when things go smoothly. With microdramas, “you can write an hour movie in a couple of days, shoot for five days, and then have it on a platform in 10 days.” Zuiker has already written four bite-ified movies for GammaTime, which launched this fall with 20 titles spanning true crime, thriller and romantic melodrama.And as traditional film and TV continues to lose younger viewers to YouTube and TikTok, microdramas could court new audiences with its “freemium” model – a chunk of episodes for free, then additional ones unlocked from a few cents to a few dollars via in-app “coins” like money in a slot machine. As a writer, “I have to understand where this is going and not just ignore it,” said Zuiker. “I see the failed broadcast model. I know the challenges of streaming and cable. This is becoming something that’s getting some momentum. Why wouldn’t I want to be in this space?”That space comes with a host of pitfalls, not least of all the bare-bones budget. Though Zuiker has embraced the challenge of taking “high-end scripts and figuring out a way with paltry budgets, thin access to top-tier talent, thin access to top-tier directors, and making that all work for someone to say, ‘this is worthy of me paying for it,” he’s still working on the question: “how do we do premium so it’s not so awful?” A writer has less than two minutes to establish characters, stakes and a reason to keep watching. “Organically, I’m trying to figure out the rhythm of the writing, because I think that’s the only way this will sustain,” said Zuiker. “The more we flip on TikTok, the more we’re going to want to watch movies like that on TikTok. But there has to be constructive narratives.”There’s also the challenge of audience, somehow at once vast, fractured and siloed. Though mobile-friendly suggests a youthful customer base, the current US microdrama audience skews heavily female and over 45. Thus it’s still an open question whether the US microdrama business will expand beyond, as Bloomberg’s Lucas Shaw put in on industry insider podcastThe Town, “soft-core porn” for young women, or whether higher-budget shorts, a la Quibi, can compete with the quick and cheap and free. “Everyone who’s making microdramas is looking to raise the bar,” said Jarvey. “The question is how to balance increasing the production value a little bit, bringing on some more well-known talent with not kind of losing what makes them microdramas. Because if suddenly you’re increasing the budget significantly, then it starts to look a lot more like a Quibi.”As in Hollywood at large, some are betting on generative AI, which GammaTime uses to suggest storylines based on viewer habits, though not to actually write the material — “the hook writing, we have a respect for and appreciation of. And cliffhanger writing, too, is human-led,” said Block, but “the concepts of decision making can be AI, demand-driven.” (The company counts Slava Mudrykh, former head of Google Gaming, as a co-founder, along with Quibi’s Alex Montalvo as chief content officer.) Others, such as Zuiker, as more hesitant – “I think when that data drives the creative, it can be problematic,” he said.‘Less high school, more horror film’: why is teen drama so miserable now?Read moreBlock foresees microdramas as a mode of entertainment unto themselves, with their own star ecosystems. (Fairly or not, Cosmo has alreadydeclaredNick Skonberg, of Loving My Brother’s Best Friend, to be the first “superstar” of the “vertical movie industry”.) He likened his efforts with GammaTime to those of Samuel Z Arkoff, the 1960s pioneer of independent, low-budget, youth-focused genre films – Beach Blanket Bingo, I Was A Teenage Werewolf and the like – as the old Hollywood studio system collapsed.Hollywood again finds itself at a moment of significant upheaval – shifting viewer tastes and habits, increasingly mobile audiences,rapidly consolidating corporate power. In these shifting sands, microdramas could fundamentally alter how western audiences consume serialized storytelling. Zuiker predicted that in a matter of years, microdramas will “be every bit at the forefront of consumption that streaming once was, that cable once was, that broadcast once was”. Short-term, it’s “bad acting, salacious, hokey titles, billionaire’s mistress”, but “in the long term, it’ll be premium content written for the device, where the optimal experience of the flip is so enticing you can’t stop.”Jarvey was more measured. “I think of it as what soap operas are to prestige entertainment,” she said. “I don’t think anyone who works in microdramas would say that they’re trying to compete with a Sunday night HBO drama.” (Indeed, Block does not.) “But they are trying to find that sliver of time in your day where maybe you want something that’s a little bit faster to consume, or something that’s going to hook you and keep you scrolling.”What microdramas are still missing is a true, bona fide hit – something that escapes social media containment and reaches the majority of US audiences who probably still have not heard of the format. Something that gets and keeps the attention of skeptics. A show like Loving My Brother’s Best Friend that actually becomes aviral successlike The Summer I Turned Pretty. But those in the space assure that it is still too early to judge whether microdramas are a sea change or, like many short-form initiatives before it, a passing, tech-hyped fad. “If you want to go in with a critical eye and tear apart these vertical shorts at this stage, you’ll have a field day. It’s easy to do that,” Zuiker cautioned me. They’re not going to be good, breakout hits, he said, without some more R&D, money and, perhaps, institutional support. “This is a new thing – we need to get behind this and find this so we can employ more people, tell better stories, and have an industry.”“We are learning so much more every movie,” he added. “It’s all very TBD.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionUS televisionUS television industryTelevision industrySocial mediaDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The rest of the crew died on impact. So to keep the mission going, and escape an imminent sunrise that will fry him out of existence, he must clone himself to create a crew. After twenty-ish hours split between exploring a hostile planet, managing the base’s resources and managing the squabbles between all the alternate Jans, you will be left with a lot to ponder about how our life choices shape who we are.11DespelotePanic, PC, PS4/5, Switch, XboxSet at the time of Ecuador’s journey to the 2002 World Cup finals, Despelote is a beautifully designed semi-autobiographical adventure about a young boy and his obsession with the beautiful game. Focusing on families, childhood and the uniting power of fandom, it’s a unique take on the idea of a sports sim.10Two Point MuseumView image in fullscreenA lot to manage … Two Point Museum.Photograph: SegaTwo Point Studios/Sega, PC, PS5, Switch 2, XboxThe Two Point series of management sims has consistently combined humour and deep strategy to compelling effect, and the latest is no exception. Your role as museum manager is to gather exhibits from around the world then display them in an attractive setting to pull in visitors. Meanwhile there are staffing issues to contend with, and is your cafe serving nice enough snacks? It’s an engrossing challenge and the cartoon-style visuals provide plenty of amusing asides.9Ghost of YoteiSucker Punch/Sony, PS5A deliciously easy to enjoy and arrestingly beautiful samurai action game about a female warrior, Atsu, on a revenge quest, which unselfconsciously reproduces every possible trope of the genre, with panache. We have tense sword stand-offs under falling leaves. We have enemies eyeing each other menacingly from either side of a burning bridge. We have hot springs, shrines and quiet moments playing theshamisenor wielding asumi-eink brush. We have wolves and foxes leading us to secret spots in nature. And we have a selection of delightfully fun weapons and a seemingly endless horde of bandits and villains to use them on. Uncomplicated, beautifully made entertainment.8Death Stranding 2Kojima Productions/Sony, PS5Troubled delivery man and resistance hero Sam Bridges returns in Hideo Kojima’s visually astonishing, eccentric and engrossing sci-fi sequel. Moving the action to an apocalyptic Australia provides landscapes of stark beauty – and the odd kangaroo. And while the story is often indecipherable, the realisation of Kojima’s ghostly universe is incredible. This is a wasteland you can wallow in for months.7Clair Obscur: Expedition 33View image in fullscreenExtravagantly French … Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.Photograph: Sandfall InteractiveSandfall/Keplar, PC, PS5, XboxAn extravagantly French role-playing game in which a band of depressed people from a ravaged Paris set out to kill a supernatural painter, who wipes out a generation of people with a few strokes of her brush each year. It is surreal, exciting, melodramatic, sometimes self-indulgent, and strangely hopeful – a breath of fresh air even in a genre that’s hardly starved of stylish, thematically ambitious games.6Consume MeHexecutable, PCA satirical slice-of-life game about life as a dieting-obsessed teen in the 00s, Consume Me is extremely funnyandhas a point to make. Juggling studies with social time and walking the dog, Tetris-ing food on to your plate and and enduring excruciating conversations with your parents, all makes you properly relive the overwhelm and pressure of adolescent life. The presentation, meanwhile, is exuberantly, lovably absurd.5Mario Kart WorldView image in fullscreenDelightful … Mario Kart World on Nintendo Switch 2.Photograph: NintendoNintendo, Switch 2The showcase title for the Switch 2 is another glorious addition to the Mario Kart universe, boasting a delightful cast of characters and 30 varied circuits joined by a network of highways that provide the chance to explore a wide open landscape for the first time in the series. Add in the wonderful soundtrack of electronic lounge jazz pop bangers and you have another family gaming staple that will remain on rotation for years.4The Seance of Blake ManorSpooky Doorway/Raw Fury, PCIt’s the late 19th century and you’ve just arrived at a remote hotel in the west of Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. But as you dig for clues, the dead emerge from their graves – and they’re really not happy. Part Agatha Christie detective sim, part folk-horror opus, this is a fascinating and engrossing experience that has things to say about class, belief and colonialism.3Silent Hill fView image in fullscreenSpectral nightmare …Silent Hill f.Photograph: KonamiNeoBards/Konami, PC, PS5, XboxIn 1960s Japan, a young girl’s fury at her bullying father becomes a spectral nightmare that consumes a whole town. Written by acclaimed visual novel author Ryukishi07, the game puts you in familiar Silent Hill territory, which means foggy streets, fiendish puzzles and truly horrible monsters. But by infusing the uncanny, mythology and superstition with feminist themes, it is an intriguing slant on a much loved (and feared) series.2Hollow Knight: SilksongTeam Cherry, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, XboxEven the most tenacious player will feel like giving up at some point while trapped in Pharloom, a decaying realm full of desperate little bugs that was once a gleaming religious capital. Here lie some truly wretched places: former farms now fetid swamps, dank underground caverns overgrown with moss and misery, grand halls now dust-covered and reverberating with foreboding. And of course there are the guardians of these places, from mind-rotted beast-tamers to corrupted pilgrims and bug-automatons, silk-poisoned creatures and the realm’s former rulers, who stand in the way of your progress. Silksong’s most forbidding foes take hours to overcome. Its worst places will entrap you in despair. But it is worth it, because of the awe-inspiring moments that you will experience along the way: the hard-won victories, those first steps into previously locked-off realms, the secret revelations that seem so personal it’s hard to believe that any of the game’s millions of other players could discover them the same way. An extraordinary game whose sometimes extreme difficulty is both a strength and a weakness.1Blue PrinceView image in fullscreenUnforgettably clever … Blue Prince.Photograph: Raw FuryDogubomb/Raw Fury, PC, PS5, XboxA young man inherits a mysterious mansion from his uncle: a sprawling pile whose layout changes every day. He needs only to find the secret 46th room, and the place is his for ever. The mansion turns out to be an education: on the personal history of the family that owned it, the mysterious forces that shaped it and the political climate of the wider world in which it is situated. But before you get anywhere near Blue Prince’s deeper mysteries, you must master its blueprints. Behind every door is a choice: do you draft a library? A hallway with several exits? A security room, a laboratory, a pool, a bedroom, a nursery, a drawing room? Each will have its own secrets to discover, a useful item or a key or a new piece of information that gets you ever closer to that elusive 46th room. And each might offer you a new path to the rest of the mansion, or locked doors that you haven’t the means to pass. Every day, with every new route that you carve through these rooms, every dead end you meet, your knowledge accumulates. By the time you do reach that final destination, you’ll have so many unanswered questions, you won’t be able to resist continuing. Blue Prince turns out to be an almost bottomless mystery, leaving you with pads full of notes, theories, numbers and names, lines from books that you want to remember and drawings of strange mechanisms. It is among the best puzzle games ever made: atmospheric and understated and unforgettably clever; still somehow able to show you something new even after tens of hours of patient exploration.Explore more on these topicsGames2025 in cultureNintendo Switch 2PlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

John Roberts, the current US chief justice, has always been praised – even by liberals – as a staunch advocate of the court’s image as a neutral arbiter. For decades, Americans believed the court soared above the fray of partisan contestation.No more.InDonald Trump’s second term, the supreme court’s conservative supermajority has seized the opportunity to empower the nation’s chief executive. In response, public approval of the court hascollapsed. The question is what it means for liberals to catch up to this new reality of a court that willingly tanks its own legitimacy. Eager to realize cherished goals of assigning power to the president and arrogating as much for itself, the conservative justices seemingly no longer care what the public or the legal community think of the court’s actions. Too often, though, liberals are responding with nostalgia for a court that cares about its high standing. There is a much better option: to grasp the opportunity to set right the supreme court’s role in US democracy.Attention to the body’s legitimacy surged in the decades after the extraordinary discussion on the topic in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey–the 1992 case that memorably preserved the abortion rights minted in Roe v Wadedespite recent conservative additions to the court. “The Court’s power lies in its legitimacy,” former justices Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day O’Connor and David Souter explained in their joint opinion, “a product of substance and perception that shows itself in the people’s acceptance of the Judiciary as fit to determine what the Nation’s law means and to declare what it demands”. The fact of popular acceptance of the institution’s role was itself a constitutional and legal concern.Compared with the prior quarter-century, when they angled for just one justice (often Kennedy) to swing to their side, it was already clear as Trump’s first term ended how much was going to change with Amy Coney Barrett’s conservative substitution for Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Yet liberal justices generallyproceededas if their conservative peers would continue to take their own institution’s legitimacy seriously. They focused on warning conservatives against further eroding it. Thedissent in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which removed the federal right to abortion, is a classic example. The liberal justices lionized Kennedy and other conservatives for refusing to overturn Roe v Wade out of the need they cited in Caseyto maintain the supreme court’s image.That was then. In Trump’s second term, the court has ceded to him near total control over federal spending, even as the president is now openly threatening to withhold funds from “blue” states and projects not aligned with administrative “priorities”. Authorized by the court to engage in racial profiling, masked federal agents continue to descend upon “Democrat-run” cities, subjecting Latinos and now Somalis to ongoing abuse.Most recently, the court hinted at its plan to declare most, if not all “independent” agencies unconstitutional, allowing Trump to fire members of the Federal Trade Commission and the National Labor Relations Board – though Chief Justice Roberts did suggest that the Federal Reserve might be different, drawing sighs from legal commentators (and sighs of relief from investors). The conservative justices appear wholly unbothered by the howls that the court is no more than a partisan institution, turning their destructive attention next to what remains of the Voting Rights Act.Yet with the conservative justices shattering the supreme court’s non-partisan image during Trump’s second term, liberals are not adjusting much. The liberal justices –Ketanji Brown Jackson,Elena KaganandSonia Sotomayor– have become much more aggressive in their dissents. But they disagree with one another about how far to concede that their conservative colleagues have given up any concern for institutional legitimacy. Encouragingly, Jackson pivoted to “warning the public that the boat is sinking” – as journalist Jodi Kantor put it in a much-noticed reportedpiece. Jackson’s fellow liberals, though, did not follow her in this regard, worrying her strategy of pulling the “fire alarm” was “diluting” their collective “impact”.Similarly, many liberal lawyers have focused their criticism on themannerin which the supreme court has advanced its noxious agenda – issuing major rulings via the “shadow” docket, without full-dress lawyering, and leaving out reasoning in support of its decisions.What appears to matter for such respectful institutionalists, most prominently the liberal professor StephenVladeck, is that the errant, reactionary justices rationalizetheir disastrous rulings. But aside from the fact that few Americans read their opinions in the first place, the objection presupposes that a more enlightened despotism ought to be the goal – that the justices trashing the respect Americans once had for them merely need to explain themselves, instead of giving up their power to inflict so much ongoing harm.Some liberals worry that concluding the supreme court is beyond redemption is too close to “nihilism” about the constitution, or even about law itself. In the aftermath of Trump’s re-election, Professor Kate Shawremarked: “I don’t think abandoning the constitution in the course of abandoning institutions is the right way forward or is something that we can survive.” Vladeckcautionedsimilarly against “doomerism”, warning the “rule of law” in the United States might “struggle to survive” the “emergence of any kind of popular consensus that law increasingly doesn’t matter”.Such qualms suggest some can’t imagine an alternative to a legitimate supreme court even once the institution itself has abandoned that role. Much like in theearly 20th century, Americans today are responding to a series of institutional failures with an extended period of constitutional rethinking. Tracing many of those failures to the undemocratic features of our written constitution – the electoral college and the Senate, most notably – reformers are proposing creativesolutionsorworkaroundsthat might move us in the direction of an actual democracy.Similarly, progressives are increasingly converging on the idea of both expanding and “disempowering” federal courts. Attentive to the reality that the supreme court especially is not and rarely has been their friend, left-leaning advocates are finding ways to empower ordinary people, trading the hollow hope of judicial power for the promise of popular rule.To label as “nihilists” those sketching an alternate, more democratic future is, in other words, not only mistaken but outright bizarre. Rather than adhere to the same institutionalist strategies that helped our current crisis, reformers must insist on remaking institutions like theUS supreme courtso that Americans don’t have to suffer future decades of oligarchy-facilitating rule that makes a parody of the democracy they were promised.In Trump’s second term, the Republican-appointed majority on the supreme court has brought their institution to the brink of illegitimacy. Far from pulling it back from the edge, our goal has to be to push it off.Ryan Doerfler and Samuel Moyn teach law at Harvard and YaleExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtOpinionUS politicsJohn RobertscommentShareReuse this content"

The way to regain it lies in Syria, Iraq and LebanonNathalie TocciSidelined by Trump, preoccupied with Ukraine and damaged by its immoral stance on Gaza, Europe can still help stabilise its eastern Mediterranean neighboursFri 19 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 12.11 ESTShareAyear after theoverthrow of Syria’s dictator, Bashar al-Assad, the former jihadi fighter turned Syrian presidentAhmed al-Sharaaaddressed the Doha Forum earlier this month, deftly parrying questions about his controversial past and outlining his country’s complex journey toward a participatory, rules-based system. As I listened, it struck me that, while Europe’s role in the Middle East has been severely damaged by its immoral stance on the Gaza war and its self-inflicted exclusion from Iran nuclear diplomacy, Europeans still have a role to play when it comes to its neighbours in the eastern Mediterranean.Europe’s world has been turned upside down by Washington’s alignment with Moscow in the Ukraine war and the transatlantic rift as the Trump administration treatsEuropeas an adversary. Another dimension of this upheaval is Europe’s growing irrelevance in the Middle East. Only if Europeans accept that the past is behind them can they hope to regain a constructive independent role in the region.After theSuez crisisin 1956, which marked the end of European colonial dominance in the Middle East, Europeans resigned themselves to playing second fiddle to the US. Yet, Washington called the shots, and European governments and public opinion did not always agree – most notably during the2003 Iraq war. Still, the US usually invited Europe to support its initiatives and, ultimately, Europe would comply.The social contract underpinning the transatlantic relationship, with Europe sheltered under the US security umbrella, made the bargain worthwhile. This did not mean European governments lacked agency in the Middle East. They played crucial roles during theOslo peace process, supporting the Palestine Liberation Organization as the embryo of a state in the making. More impressively, European diplomacy patiently advanced multilateral efforts eventually leading to the Iran nuclear deal. On every occasion, however, Europe’s role – even when at odds with Washington’s – was aimed at supporting US leadership in the region while tempering its hegemonic excesses. Sometimes Europe succeeded; often it failed. But the political framework remained unchanged.That framework no longer exists. Europe has withdrawn from the Middle East, consumed by war on its own continent. The Ukraine conflict has not only absorbed most of Europe’s foreign-policy bandwidth but also distorted its political perspective on the Middle East. Securing US support on Ukraine, especially under Donald Trump, has required uncritical acceptance of Washington’s regional policies, including theillegal bombing of Iran. Iran, long viewed as problematic due to its human rights abuses, proxy forces and nuclear programme, suddenly became an adversary in European eyes because of its strategic alignment with Russia.For its part, the US no longer looks to Europe as its primary partner in the Middle East. With the rise of regional actors – particularly the Gulf states and Turkey – Washington now engages directly with Riyadh, Doha, Abu Dhabi or Ankara. Europe’s sidelining was already evident during Joe Biden’s administration, largely due to its self-inflicted irrelevance. Under Trump, this exclusion has become reflexive, as his administration seeks to push Europe further to the margins.Regional players are not clamouring for Europe’s return. Most significantly, its stubborn and immoral refusal to leverage its influence to end Israel’s devastating war in Gaza has shattered what little credibility it had left. When the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, candidly remarked that Israel was doingEurope’s “dirty work”in attacking Iran, the pretence fell away. Europe was no longer accused of double standards; with few exceptions – such as Spain, Norway, Ireland and occasionally France – it was seen as having no standards at all. There was neither leverage nor principle: Europe had simply been erased from the map.Today, any hope of a durable ceasefire in Gaza, or even progress toward a Palestinian state, does not stem from European efforts. European leaders continue to hide behind Trump’s peace plan, avoiding any leverage they may exert overIsrael.It’s not just Gaza. From the West Bank to Syria and Lebanon, Israel’s onslaught continues | Nesrine MalikRead moreThe limited hope that exists comes fromQatar’s mediation, with Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Egypt playing critical roles. Similarly, if US-Iran diplomacy resumes in the future, European governments will not lead the process. The E3 grouping – France, Germany and the UK – undermined its own position by triggering the “snapback” of UN sanctions on Iran,effectively endingthe nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, they had helped broker.Any progress now depends on convergence between the Gulf states and Iran, particularly Saudi Arabia’s potential role in facilitating talks between Washington and Tehran. In short, on the Middle East’s most pressing issues – the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iran – Europe’s governments can, at best, support Gulf efforts to influence Trump. That support matters, especially inGaza, where a fragile ceasefire could collapse if Trump’s plan stalls. But Europe’s role in the region has been reduced to a third-tier status.Yet the Middle East remains Europe’s neighbour, and it would be naive to assume Europeans can remain indefinitely disengaged. With its room for manoeuvre shrunken, Europe should focus on the wider Levant – specifically Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. All three countries are extremely vulnerable. Lebanon is navigating a complex reform process, with the constant threat of war looming as Israel continues tooccupy five outpostsin the country. Iraq has managed to stay out of the region’s recent convulsions, striving for a delicate balance as it seeks greater autonomy without antagonising Tehran. Syria remains fragile as it attempts to reconcile justice and social cohesion while facing an expansionist and aggressive Israel.With the exception of Syria, where Trump has shown some interest – culminating inal-Sharaa’s visit to Washington– the US is not particularly engaged in Lebanon or Iraq. And while regional actors are essential, whether for their security influence (such as Turkey’s in Syria) or economic support (such as the Gulf’s), there is a vacuum that Europe could help fill. With the international liberal order in disarray, governance support may no longer be in vogue, but it is in demand in the Levant. This is where Europe can still make a constructive contribution.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistExplore more on these topicsMiddle East and north AfricaOpinionEuropeSyriaDonald TrumpIranIsraelGazacommentShareReuse this content"

It is actually a weakness and poor political leadership. In these distressing times, it is dangerous.The Minns government is givingextraordinary powers to the police commissionerto dictate when and how our community responds to incidents that impact us all.Bondi has long been the spiritual home of Sydney’s Jews. Now it will be a place of remembrance and grief | Michael VisontayRead moreThe antisemitic attack in Bondi was an attack on the Jewish community primarily, but it was also an attack on all of us.Treasured members of our NSW communitywere taken from us in an act of hate-filled violence. But at times like this, the community is best placed to decide how we should assemble and communicate with each other – and we have seen great examples of this following the attacks, such as thesurfers who paddled outin Bondi. Stances like these are a protest against hate and those who try to divide us.Who is the police commissioner, or indeed even the premier, to tell us which assembly can take place? It undermines the commissioner’s role in leading the police response to have them make political decisions about the community’s response. It also creates further division.Thebanning of protestswill not stop antisemitism, and the premier is wrong to disgracefully link years of peaceful protest to such a horrific and unrelated event. The attack was antisemitic. The protests have not been. To suggest otherwise is to wilfully conflate antisemitism with legitimate criticisms of the actions of the government of Israel. This act alone is inflammatory, but the provocative, partisan andfrankly disgraceful language of the premierin announcing this proposal was an act of wilful political vandalism that cuts at the very fabric of the social cohesion the premier purports to promote.How can we do the work of healing divisions when our premier characterises so many of our actions like this?This is nothing new. The premier has repeatedly attempted to curtail protest rights over the past two years, such as with the Places of Worship Act that would have banned protest rights across NSW. This law was rightfully found unconstitutional by our supreme court. The proposed laws are sure to attract another challenge, and this alone confirms the proposal is ill-considered and ill-timed.Suggesting that the peaceful protests we have seen in the city of Sydney “sow division and hatred” and suggesting it can “unleash violence” is outrageous rhetoric that itself sows division in our community and is unbecoming of his office. How can we as a community do the work of healing divisions when our premier uses his position to characterise so many of our actions like this?The premier and his government are using a moment of anger and grief to rush through new laws that attack our democratic rights. This is a despicable display of political opportunism that undermines our democracy. In seeking to protect NSW citizens this way, the premier is undermining the legitimacy of the democracy that put him in power. To me, this shows he does not understand what social cohesion is or how to grow it.Timothy Roberts is the president of the NSW Council for Civil LibertiesIn Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, andGrieflineon 1300 845 745.

Among them, my own custom of devoting the last column before Christmas to reasons to be hopeful. In recent years, amid war and bloodshed, that task has been especially challenging – and this week was no exception.It began with the news from Bondi beach, where 15 people were gunned down and dozens more injured, most of them Jews celebrating the festival of Hanukah. That came just two-and-a-half months afterthe deadly attack on Heaton Park synagoguein Manchester, on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur. To be a Jew at the end of 2025 is to fear that to gather together, whether at moments of joy or sorrow, is to take a mortal risk. That even to do relatively ordinary things together has become a matter of life and death.But Hanukah is not over, and its defining theme is finding light in the darkness. And so, in that spirit, I’ll keep up my own little tradition – and, as it happens, the massacre in Sydney is the ideal place to start. For there, in the pitch black of a murder spree fuelled by hate, were multiple points of light.The global imagination has been captured, rightly, by the heroism of Ahmed al-Ahmed, the passerby who, with no weapon of his own,tackled one of the two attackers, even wresting his gun from him. In an instant, al-Ahmed disproved the very case the gunmen were doubtless trying to make: that Muslims are somehow commanded to see Jews as their enemy, a foe to be destroyed. In an act of mind-boggling courage, he showed that the human urge to save the life of a fellow human being is more powerful.Al-Ahmed was not the only one to feel that urge. Footagehas emergedof a retired couple, Boris and Sofia Gurman, both in their 60s, making a similar move, tussling with one of the gunmen and grabbing his rifle. For a moment Boris seemed to succeed, wrestling the man to the ground. But the attacker apparently had another gun, and he used that to shoot Boris and Sofia dead.Meanwhile, 14-year-old Chaya Dadongave up the place of shelter she hadfound – hiding under a bench as the bullets flew – to heed the plea of a mother desperate to save her children. Chaya came out from her spot under the bench and lay her own body on top of the little ones, shielding them from the gunfire until, a few moments later, she herself was shot in the leg.In each case, and during a moment of absolute terror, these people demonstrated immediate, instinctive and unfathomable courage. If there is a reason for hope this year, this might just be it: that courage is to be found, even in the bleakest places.So it’s easy, when following thediplomatic twists and turns, to forget that the people of Ukraine have been enduring persistent Russian bombardment for nearly four straight years. Just to keep living, as deadly drones circle overhead, requires a bravery those of us who live in a country that last came under attack 80 years ago can scarcely imagine.Or think of the people of El Fasher, the Sudanese city where huge piles of bodies areheaped on the streets, from where more than 150,000 residents are missing, feared dead – with as many as 60,000 believed to have been killed in three weeks. Humanitarian observers say El Fasher now looks “like a slaughterhouse”, even as the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces are hard at work destroying the evidence of the massacre they committed. Think of the strength it must take to keep going, day after day, in Sudan, where this latest round of bloodletting has gone on since April 2023 but which has known brutal conflict for decades.The same is true of the Palestinians of Gaza, many of whom have spent the past two months returning to homes utterly destroyed by an Israeli bombardment that went on for two years, after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel of October 2023. Just to endure, to put one foot in front of the other amid so much grief, with as many as 70,000 killed and whole neighbourhoods obliterated, is an act of bravery.Imagine, then, the courage of those who have not only withstood the Israeli onslaught, but have dared to protest against their Hamas masters. According toan Amnesty International report in May, hundreds if not thousands of Palestinians demonstrated against Hamas rule, only to face “interrogations and beatings by Hamas-run security forces”. After the Hamas-Israel ceasefire and partial Israeli withdrawal in October, the punishment became more severe: footage emerged of Hamasstaging public executionsin a Gaza City square. And yet, there are still Palestinians in Gaza who dare stand up and say no.I think of someone I have got to know these last two years. On 7 October 2023, Sharone Lifschitz learned that her parents had been seized from their kibbutz, Nir Oz. Her mother, Yocheved, then 85, was held hostage until she was released 16 days later, famously parting from her Hamas captors witha handshake and the word “shalom”: peace. In February of this year, Sharone received confirmation that her father, Oded, had been killed.Throughout, Sharone campaigned for the return of the Israeli hostages – but she also campaigned, tirelessly, for an end to the war. You would find her outside Downing Street, standing among those Israelis holding photographs of Palestinian children killed by Israeli airstrikes. Her family has been stricken by terror conducted in the name of the Palestinians; but she has never stopped demanding justice and statehood for the Palestinians, even when that puts her at odds with many of her fellow Israelis. She is brave.And I think of those not confronted by war, but who nevertheless find the strength to face down the mighty. It could be the Indiana Republicanswho dared defy Donald Trumpby refusing to go along witha gerrymandering schemethat would have handed him a partisan advantage. Or the Scottish couple, Ros and Mark Dowey, now taking on one of the world’s most powerful corporations,suing Metafor the alleged wrongful death of their 16-year-old son, Murray, who took his own life after falling prey to a “sextortion” gang on Instagram. The Doweys know what they’re up against. But they are determined that a seemingly all-powerful body finally be held to account.This week and last, I saw what that kind of courage looks like. I sat in on several sessions of the public inquiry into undercover policing, watching as one of the women deceived into a long-term relationship with a man who turned out to be a cop told her story – and as that former police officerwriggled and wormed his waythrough his own testimony, repeatedly confronted with the hard, documented evidence of his deception. Full disclosure: the woman, known as “Alison”, is an old friend of mine. Even so, I was awed all over again by the courage she and the other women have shown for decades in refusing to be cowed by the Metropolitan police, insisting instead on hunting down the truth and demanding that a police force that countenanced this sex by deception – which the women involved regard as rape by the state – explain itself.For much of the past three years, I have been immersed in the story of a handful of anti-Nazi Germans who dared resist the tyranny of the Third Reich, several of them paying for their defiance with their lives. I’ve told their story in a book, The Traitors Circle. Many readers, daunted by the jaw-dropping bravery of those long-ago men and women, have assumed such courage exists only in the past. But that’s wrong. It lives on now, all around us. It’s there if we look for it – lighting up the dark.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist and the author ofThe Traitors Circle: the Rebels Against the Nazis and the Spy Who Betrayed ThemDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The destructive right wing of the Labour party should know that this is a new eraFri 19 Dec 2025 14.00 ESTShareIstarted my working life as a low-paid children’s residential care worker supporting vulnerable children, and I am still a registered social worker today. I discovered the labour movement through the powerful women who mentored me and showed me that working-class people will only win the dignity we deserve if we join together in our workplaces.On Wednesday,I was electedgeneral secretary of Britain’s biggest union, Unison. Trade unions are meant to be vehicles for workers to collectively organise, represent and lead ourselves, so my election should be an unremarkable event.Yet I will be the firstordinary memberto lead my union in its history. This represents a huge opening for the democratic renewal of the labour movement. The fact that my election is so unprecedented tells its own tale.It is the blows inflicted upon us by Thatcherite politicians and employers over the decades that explain the enduring weakness of trade unions – clear to see in our industrial impotence and stubbornly low member engagement.But some at the top of our movement have contributed to its decline, too, by creating cultures where workers, ordinary members, are consistently disregarded by their own organisations. Defending our class interests, the core work of unions, has been an afterthought, at best. Careers and cosy Westminster clubs have come first.Not any more. That’s the one simple reason I was elected by such a decisive margin to lead Unison: members want our union to put our people first.Ordinary members are taking control. With my clear mandate, I will work relentlessly to implement the industrial, political and organisational changes necessary to turn our union into the incredible, member-led force it should be. That’s the hopeful project we need the whole union to unite around.Industrially, I am putting all the employers we bargain with – from Reform UK-run local councils to Wes Streeting’s Department of Health and Social Care – on notice: Unison will be fighting without hesitation to win for members. Our size and resources are without parallel among trade unions in this country. From this point on, those great assets will be geared towards transforming the lives of public-sector workers.That begins with building on and properly scaling up the “organising to win”strategy introducedin 2021, after a motion by ordinary members at Unison’s conference. This was a member initiative, from the grassroots. Now I will work for it to be fully supported and resourced at the centre.I will, on top of this, strive to reverse Unison’s industrial underachievement. We are thebiggest and best-resourcedunion in the country; there’s no reason for us not to be among the most industrially formidable.This will include a wide-ranging strategic review of taking strike action across the labour movement, leading to our adoption of the best methods to win. I will also launch a new strike-ready conference, convening workplace reps from across Unison to forge new organising approaches in the fight for better pay.Politically, with ordinary Unison members giving a clear mandate for change, our union will defend the interests of the working class as a whole without apology and without exception. I am in no doubt – that requires being unbowed in our support for thePalestinian people’sfreedom struggle, and proud of our internationalism and opposition to war. I am also clear that Unison on my watch will not sit idly by while this Labour government allows imprisoned Palestine Solidarity Campaign activists tostarvewhile protesting for their basic rights. Keir Starmer must act now.View image in fullscreenHealthcare assistants picket in Middlesbrough, in March 2024.Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty ImagesSo it should be clear that putting members first doesn’t mean relegating or turning away from politics. That would be an abdication of responsibility. But it does mean bringing Unison’s support for the destructive right wing of theLabourparty to an end.We will call time on our union’s inexcusable habit of propping up politicians who act against our interests, undermine our fundamental values and make our lives worse. Like colleagues across the movement, I have, in recent weeks, been appalled by Streeting’sattacks on resident doctorsand their union. It is simply unacceptable for a Labour politician to describe striking workers as “morally reprehensible”.I will, of course, engage open-mindedly with the health secretary as I would with any other employer or government minister. But given the likelihood of a Labourleadership election in 2026, it’s important for me to be clear: swapping Starmer out for Streeting or anyone else from the right wing of the party would be no solution to the gigantic challenges facing the country. What’s needed is a radical change in approach based on the labour movement’s core values.My victory is no individual matter. It is a collective triumph for ordinary Unison members who have voted to take charge of their own union at long last. Public sector workers keep this country running. We are disrespected, overworked and underpaid. That must change. It will change. With everyone from members to branch reps and our union’s staff pulling together, Unison under my leadership will make sure of it.Andrea Egan is the general secretary-elect of UnisonExplore more on these topicsTrade unionsOpinionIndustrial actionLabourKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

This is whyAmu GibOur demands are simple – and they start with stopping the flow of arms to IsraelAmu Gib is an activist currently being held at HMP BronzefieldFri 19 Dec 2025 09.37 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 09.43 ESTShareAmu Gib is one of several prisoners on hunger strike who are awaiting trial for alleged offences relating toPalestine Action. Gib is being being held at HMP Bronzefield. Their charges relate to an alleged break-in at RAF Brize Norton this year. This article is based on interviews with Ainle Ó Cairealláin, host of the Rebel Matters podcast, and the writer and researcher ES Wight on days 18 and 33 of the strike.We began our hunger strike on 2 November: the anniversary of theBalfour declaration, when Britain planted the seeds of the genocide that we are witnessing today.Palestinians are now facing another winter without any of the things that anyone needs to survive. To reach the point we have, where Israel can weaponise starvation, you have to confront who enables that. Who arms them? Who allows Zionist settlers to steal and occupy Palestinian land? Who allows Israel to target farmers andpeople harvesting their olives?I first learned about Palestine in sixth form – not from the teachers, but from other students, young Muslim women. I didn’t understand the historical context back then, but the bombing of civilian populations was so obviously wrong. Then seeing the routine nature of it, the same thing happening from one year to the next, was just so stark. This will keep going unless people put a stop to it. And the more I learned about Britain’s role in enabling these atrocities, the more I was unable to deal with simply doing nothing.Our demands are simple. One: shut down the weapons factories that are supplying arms to Israel. Two: deproscribe Palestine Action. Palestine Action is a direct action protest group and should never have been labelled a terrorist organisation. Three: end the mistreatment of prisoners in custody. Four: set immediate bail. There are people whose parents are really ill or dying, people who have missed major life events. And five: provide a fair trial, including the unredacted release of the correspondence about activists betweenBritish and Israeli officialsand arms dealers.What prompted our hunger strike was partly the understanding that while we’re in here, the prison authorities can do whatever they want. They give us bogus non-association orders so we can’t spend time with each other; they move our lives around at will; they mess with our visits and gym slots, and censor our post. I was barred from the crafts group because they said I was a security threat after I embroidered “Free Palestine” on a cushion – ironically, that was on the day the UKrecognised the state of Palestine.While on a material level it doesn’t always look like we’re “winning”, the habit of resistance – as opposed to the habit of compliance – is something we instil in each other through trust, care and solidarity. And it’s that habit which reminds us that we always have choices, we always have our imaginations. This keeps us alive. There is no rhyme or reason to our imprisonment. But when you decide to take action despite being in prison, you’re free.There’s also the ongoing responsibility to the liberation of Palestine that landed us here – and that we are all still committed to. So our hunger strike is a way of declaring that the state can’t stop you even when it has you in prison, that we are not going to give up the focus and the responsibility to people, whatever conditions we’re in.Pro-Palestine activists daub MoJ building with red paint in protest over hunger strikersRead morePhysically I have lost 11kg now and am moving in slow motion. My blood sugar is really low and my ketones – which is the way you measure the amount of toxins that your body produces by eating itself, burning through fat and muscle instead of calories – are really high. Two fellow hunger strikershave been hospitalisedalready. The response from other prisoners has been incredible. Everyone’s checking in on me, making sure I have hot water, coming to socialise in my cell, lending me clothes to keep warm. This is despite one of the screws telling the other prisoners that they would get negative behaviour points if they help us.So the hunger strike has sharpened the reality of prison: the shouting and screaming from the screws, and the arbitrariness of the rules they enforce. But in another way the hunger strike also makes the prison fade into irrelevance. We’re focused on the world beyond these walls, and it seems much more real. We’re fuelled by every act of resistance we hear about. The prison demands that we be alive on their terms – but now it’s on our terms, and we have the power that they hold over us in our hands, in our bodies and in our empty stomachs. I wish I could convey how much energy resistance brings you.We have the power, agency, responsibility, creativity, resourcefulness and love it takes to be fuelled and moved to action not just once, but every minute of every day – now 46 days for some of us. It doesn’t ever feel like what we’re doing is enough, but in another way it feels like the best thing in the world.An HMP Bronzefield spokesperson said: “We cannot provide information about specific individuals; however, we can confirm that all prisoners are managed in line with the policies and procedures governing the entire UK prison estate. This includes specialist multi-agency processes, led by the government, to assess individual risks and security status. However, if any prisoner has specific complaints, we encourage them to raise them directly with the prison, as there are numerous channels available for addressing such concerns.”Amu Gib is an activist currently being held at HMP BronzefieldDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And my mother? She’s the matriarch of mistletoe.Every December, our home transformed into a living snow globe. We didn’t just buy ornaments, we made them. We didn’t watch Christmas movies, we lived them. We’d cut down our own trees, hand-string popcorn garlands and spend full afternoons debating the correct angle of the angel on top of the tree.But nestled inside all that holiday joy was one tiny annual trauma: the family photo.Why did I ever buy my kids refillable advent calendars? | Zoe WilliamsRead moreThis wasn’t just a casual snap on the stairs. No, no. This was a professional photoshoot. With outfits. And a booking. At Sears.For those unfamiliar with American suburban customs in the 1990s, let me set the scene. Once a year, children across the country were dressed in matching red sweaters, dragged to department stores and forced to smile in front of beige backdrops while a man named Gary – who most definitely had a ponytail – snapped away with a camera the size of a microwave.My mother took this annual production very seriously. We were her Christmas card, naturally. And her card was an artform. She coordinated outfits like a Vogue stylist on a budget. She barked hair instructions like Anna Wintour. If Anna Wintour was a hair stylist. There were props, poses, image references and a level of emotional intensity normally reserved for Oscar campaigns.My sister cried. My brother complained. As the eldest (10, but emotionally already 40), I begged them both to just smile so we could all go home. My father, in the most traditional of father fashion, played court jester behind the photographer, waving stuffed animals and making fart noises to try to elicit joy from our dead-eyed little faces. Mom would rush in to fix a cowlick, whisper “chin down!” through gritted teeth and sprint back behind the lights like a woman possessed.It probably lasted an hour. Maybe less. But to us? It felt like eternity.View image in fullscreenSean Szeps and his siblingsPhotograph: Sean SzepsBy the time I was 10, I knew what was coming. As soon as Mom uttered the words “It’s photo time,” you’d hear synchronised groaning from the backseat and I’d begin my breathing exercises. We’d arrive at the studio in funereal silence, negotiating bribes for good behaviour. The shoot would end with at least one of us in tears, often my mother, and my dad stress-sweating through his Christmas jumper.Now, look. I get it. I’m a parent now. I understand the panicked need to capture everything. To freeze time in pixels before your children grow out of their footie pyjamas and into someone else’s wardrobe. I want the memories, too. I ache for them, honestly.And I do, genuinely, love those old Christmas pictures. I display them proudly. I included a few in my memoir. I even sent one to my Aussie therapist once to give her “an idea of what we were dealing with”.But there’s a certain type of generational healing that comes from saying: “That ends with me.”So I made a decision a few years back. In our house, the Christmas photo still exists. But it follows a very different set of rules: keep it quick, keep it casual, and if it’s not funny … what’s the point?My husband and I don’t hire fancy photographers. We don’t stage anything and we certainly don’t pay for props. We put on reindeer antlers, naturally. We bribe the twins with marshmallows, of course. But we take three photos max. If no one smiles, then we reframe the image as Victorian. If the kids are unsure, my husband and I pretend to burst into tears. Two years ago, we tried to take a family photo and the kids just weren’t in the mood. What did we do? We bailed. There’s no photographic evidence of Christmas that year. Shockingly, life went on.Our most “liked” family photo features my husband and I fake-sobbing next to a mall Santa Claus while the twins look on with utter confusion. We printed it out, framed it and emailed it to the family … with the subject line:Season’s Greetings from the Hot Mess Express.Because that’s us. We’re not trying to win Christmas. We’re just trying to survive it with our sense of humour intact.Somewhere sitting in America, I imagine, my mother is proud. Not because I’ve continued her tradition. But because I understand it now. I understand the desperate, aching love behind every forced smile. The longing to hold on to something, anything, that proves you were all together, and happy, and safe.So maybe it did scar me. Just a little. But only the tiniest stain on an otherwise perfect holiday jumper. And honestly? That’s the stuff that makes the best stories anyway.Sean Szeps is a writer, content creator and father of twins.

The suburb is the spiritual home of the community, a hub where Jews from all generations gather to eat, meet and schmooze.On any given morning, as young walkers pound the promenade in gym gear to get their steps up, you can see groups of older men and women padding along while they discuss bypasses and hip replacements, East European and South African accents wafting behind them. Their children, now middle-aged and with better bodies, march along talking about property and school pick-ups.Above the beach, at the Bondi Pavilion, Russian Jews play chess and backgammon with each other throughout the day.Albanese announces new laws cracking down on hate speech and preachers of hate after Bondi beach attackRead moreIn the aftermath of the second world war a king tide of Holocaust survivors, desperate to get as far away from Europe as possible, rolled into Australia. Hungarians, Czechs, Germans and Austrians joined their fellow émigrés in Sydney (the Polish Jews flocked to Melbourne).In those days, Bondi was more grubby than glamorous, a working-class area in Sydney’s east where migrants lived cheaply in cheek-by-jowl apartment blocks. The Bondi tram would take them to the city, where many set up businesses in the rag trade or food, where the whole family could pitch in.View image in fullscreenLubavitcher elders of the Flood Street, Bondi synagogue, circa 1988.Photograph: Rob Walls/AlamyOn weekends, they mingled in restaurants and cafes by the sea to enjoy good coffee and continental food from the old country while savouring the innocence and beauty of their new environment.Yet the magnet that drew Jews to Bondi in the first place, generations earlier, was not the sun and surf, nor the coffee. It was the opportunity to pray and congregate as Jews. Sydney’s first synagogue, the York Street Synagogue, was consecrated in 1844; the Great Synagogue was built in 1878. But in the years leading up to the first world war, the Jewish community gravitated towards the east.A congregation was formed in Bondi in 1918 and a few years later (1921) they acquired land in the area and built what was named the Central Synagogue, which later moved to a larger nearby premises in 1960.Between those dates, several other synagogues sprouted, including a Mizrahi (Middle Eastern) and ultra-Orthodox (Adath Yisroel) congregation. A Jewish kindergarten, school and ritual bath (mikvah) followed.It laid down the religious and cultural architecture for Jews to live and gather in Bondi, all the way down to the beach. This was the world where my own parents lived when they migrated to Australia; my father’s family crammed into a small apartment on Penkivil Street, Sydney’s equivalent of Brick Lane in London’s East End, except that the accents were more Hungarian than Fagin.View image in fullscreenBondi Pavilion card players in 1973.Photograph: Major Johnston Photographs/Waverley Council LibraryBondi evolved into the natural home of Jewish cultural and sporting clubs. The Maccabi Jewish sports club took root, along with a football club, Hakoah, named after the original in Vienna, which was formed by some Jewish players after a kickaround in a local park.The football club morphed into a cultural hub when the Hakoah Club centre opened in 1975, just up from the beach, and became a go-to for older Jews to play bridge and canasta, while younger ones socialised at discos on Friday and Saturday nights (it was cultural, not religious). In 1982, the club and the Israeli consulate in the city were both bombed, on the same day, in an act of terrorism masterminded by a bomb maker of Middle-Eastern origin. No one was ever charged.When the next influx of Jewish refugees to Australia from the Soviet Union started in the 1970s and peaked in the 1990s, Bondi was the first obvious port of call. Russian delicatessens, congregations and schools followed. Sadly, their attachment to the suburb was the reason that several died in the massacre last weekend.A number of the dead were members of the Friends of Refugees of eastern Europe (Free) Chabad Centre in Bondi. The two rabbis who were killed were also members of Chabad, the ultra-Orthodox Jewish movement started by Rabbi Mendel Schneerson in New York. It comes as no surprise that Bondi has also been home to a significant portion of Sydney’s Israeli community.The park above Bondi beach was an obvious location for the Chabad congregation to mount a giant menorah for a public celebration of Hanukah. In Jewish eyes, it looked familiar and reassuring, a sign that Jewish life was alive and well.That is, until an act of sheer evil turned an afternoon of celebration into a tragedy of bottomless grief.Michael Visontay is commissioning editor of the Jewish IndependentThis article was amended on 20 December 2025. It was not the Great Synagogue but the York Street synagogue, which was consecrated in 1844.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackAntisemitismBondi beachfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Often they are more trouble than they are worthFri 19 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 10.49 ESTShareNigel Farage is storing up trouble by welcomingyet another tranche of Conservative defectors to Reform UK’s ranks. I should know. When I was chief whip, nothing united a party quite as much as a defection. Old enemies call a truce from their daily hostilities to turn all the available ire on the traitor in their midst. Ask Shaun Woodward, the former Conservative MP for Witneywho legged it to Labour in 1999while making all sorts of rather grand demands in the process. He was blackballed by his original party for such a flagrant act of opportunism, and hated by his new family as someone never to be entirely trusted.I remember the shock and anger when entering the chamber in April 2024to see Dan Poulter seated uncomfortably behind Keir Starmerfor PMQs. Not only had we had no warning, but as he had barely even attended parliament in anyone’s recent memory, we weren’t quite sure whether Labour would know who he was. Only weeks later, Dover diehard Natalie Elphickepulled the same stuntand also promptly disappeared from view. How she could have left friends and whips a few hours earlier with the impression that she was voting with the government that day, I am not quite sure.It seems that such niceties matter little to the “defector community”, any more than loyalty to the party, volunteers, voters and supporters who gave them such a privileged position in the first place. Why should Reform expect any better?It was those two “left-field” defections that caused us the jitters over in No 10. Were there more? We had heard rumours, but there were always rumours. To be safe, we ran a check on every single colleague, ranking them green, amber or red and sending in the charm police for anyone in the most dangerous category. Losing two colleagues was annoying; lose three and it might start looking careless. Although the date of the election was at that stage still undecided, we all knew that if anyone else went, any plan would go with them.Looking at the names of those who have made the journey to Reform is also revealing.When we suspended the whip from Lee Anderson, he was at pains to assure me that he was going nowhere, and we therefore planned a session within days to map out an elegant return. But something happened over that weekend, and he was gone.Andrea Jenkyns,Jake Berry,Nadine Dorries,Sarah Atherton,Maria Caulfield: all have trodden the same path, all humming to the same old tune that “the Conservatives no longer represent my values blah blah”. This is despite most of them signing up to, and even voting for, the very immigration policies put forward by their hero, Boris Johnson, that they now suddenly find so indigestible. Then,Danny Krugerjoined the list as the first sitting Tory MP to defect, completing the least surprising collection of the disgruntled it would be possible to find. And recently it’s been the turn of the little-knownMalcolm Offordfrom the House of Lords and former MPBen Bradley, who had to make a hefty charity donationafter defaming Jeremy Corbyn.Can defectors be identified before the act? That’s not easy, but there is a common link, a symptom that might be hard to pick up without a political stethoscope. First, this is a group of people who have always found it hard, impossible even, to operate as a collegiate force. They were loners, the sort of people neighbours describe as “keeping themselves to themselves” hours after discovering that they have committed some misdeed. Some of them, Kruger being one, are driven by such an unbreakable ideological vision that they cannot fully grasp that politics is a numbers game and is annoyingly reliant on consensus and compromise. Second, they often think there will be payback; they may even have been promised it. Perhaps a key seat at the next election, a place on the list for the Senedd elections next May, a mayoral nomination or even a peerage.View image in fullscreenReform UK’s Richard Tice with Lee Anderson, who defected from the Conservatives in March 2024.Photograph: Carl Court/Getty ImagesOne thing is certain: these defections are acts of opportunism and therein lies the trouble for Farage. Usually, defectors want something. If they don’t get it, they will react in much the same way as they did when we turned down their similar demands. There will be a petulant outburst, often timed somewhat vindictively to cause the greatest embarrassment for the people whose trust and support they had hitherto relied upon.The recent flurry of defecting councillors and former MPs is a case in point. Each and every one of them owes their well-funded existence to the Conservative party, and its financial and volunteer resources, not to mention voters. If they must defect, couldn’t they at least do it with a bit of class, and retreat quietly into the background after a brief but considered message? Or better still, trigger a byelection, just to make sure that voters are as enthusiastic about their new brand as they were one that actually got them elected?As ever, there are some honourable historical exceptions. Churchill was elected a Conservative but within a few years joined the Liberals on the back of his opposition to a bill to reduce the flow of Jewish migrants fleeing the Russian empire, only to return to the Conservatives about 20 years later. In the more recent political earthquake of 1981, four heavyweight Labour MPs (David Owen, Shirley Williams, William Rodgers and Roy Jenkins) formed the “gang of four” to start the Social Democratic Party (SDP)in protest againstMichael Foot.Kemi Badenoch would be wise to stick to her guns, encouraging other wobblers to step away now. As for the rest of us, it pays to see these moments for what they really are.Simon Hart was government chief whip from 2022 to 2024, and is author ofUngovernableExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionConservativesNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

Yes, the polls look bad – but these days they reflect little more than voters’ passing whimsFri 19 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 12.44 ESTShareMerry Christmas, Sir Keir, and a happy new year. Or as they say in Downing Street these days, make merry for tomorrow you may die. At your drinks for lobby correspondents last week there was reportedly one topic alone. How long had you to go: months, weeks, hours?We all know bad news sells. Political reporters cannot handle prime ministers sleeping soundly at night. But the terminal gloom around Keir Starmer’s position is absurd. Not a morning passes without rivals being declared, and not an evening without the BBC’s Chris Mason dragged from his supper to stand in the cold. He just frowns and forecasts Armageddon.Starmer is variously described as theleast popular, most rebelled against, most loathed prime minister of all time. Asked for a prediction, the Westminster lobby grasps the most stinging nettle it can find. It currently rates Starmer as finished. It did the same to Margaret Thatcher after two years in 1981.First the polls. A recentin-depth study of themin the Economist was gripping. It showed that when a party’s share falls below 30%, predicting the outcome of first-past-the-post in any constituency is near worthless. In lobby terms, you can use it to back any story you want to write. Atlast year’s general election, the surging Reform party got 14% of the total vote but won just five MPs; the Liberal Democrats got 12% and 72 MPs.The Economist’s own pollhad Reform winning “between 112 and 373 seats” and Labour winning “between 36 and 295 seats”. This is no use to anyone. Put another way, Starmer needs only to recover seven points to make Labour the largest party in parliament again. Meanwhile, an MRP poll leaked last month had Kemi Badenochwinning just 14 seats.The fact is that when five parties all have between 15 and 30% of the poll, as is roughly the case at present, first-past-the-post makes any election a lottery. As for the leaders, when party affinities are no longer tied to ideology or class loyalty, “popularity” can swing wildly. It goes with charisma or the last appearance on television.I find it hard to “loathe” or “hate” Starmer. Not knowing him personally, I find his decisions inept – but he seems likable and harmless. He sounded most plausible onMichael Berkeley’s Private Passionson Radio 3 in October. He admitted he became prime minister having not made the grade in music college on the flute. I keep seeing him as a failed flautist.Labour is in Downing Street by the wildest of flukes. In 2024, Starmer actually won half a million fewer votes than his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, did in 2019. It also won a smaller share of the poll, 34%, than the Tories and Reform combined at 38%. Last year the British electorate turned right, not left.In other words, Labour’s record majority had nothing to do with democracy. It was first-past-the-post at its wildest. With five parties looking like contenders next time, and a hung parliament most likely, you might as well roll a dice as to who gets to Downing Street.Starmer’s performance as prime minister has not been outstanding, but it’s hardly been disastrous. His devotion to his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has alienated employers,farmers, publicans, landlords, planners and the countryside. He has got little thanks for hisoutrageous generosityto HS2,housebuildersand the green energy lobby. But these are hardly hanging offences.In fact, in two important policy areas, Starmer has been in the right. He has restrained public borrowing, which should give him room for manoeuvre down the line. According to the IMF, next year the UK will be thesecond strongest growing economyin the G7 after the US, and that is worth a real boast. The prime minister has also started down the vital route to reversing the Brexit disaster, most recently inreopening the Erasmus student exchange. That is also good news. Otherwise his foreign policy may be measured only in air miles – but overseas nowadays is mostly about show. He has deftly handled the warmongering of the defence spending lobby.This has simply not been a Liz Truss/Boris Johnson disaster binge. Starmer has made bad appointments and has a ropey Downing Street machine; but if backbenchers are restive, Starmer has enough of them to get by. He performs confidently with Badenoch in the weekly pantomime at the dispatch box.The idea that Angela Rayner or Wes Streeting or even Andy Burnham is massing armies of eager supporters at Starmer’s door is ridiculous. There is no obvious leader of the party yet identified as superior to Starmer. I cannot believe Labour really wants to fall on its sword.The next election is utterly impossible to call. The polls are useless predictors, as will be next May’s local elections. They will be a sign of passing whim, not of who the voter most wants as prime minister. Starmer may not be exciting, but that is hardly new in Downing Street. He has time – and in politics, time is power. He should take a leaf out of Thatcher’s book. Just stay there. Just survive. I predict he will.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

This week, the UK announced it is rejoining theErasmus+ youth exchangeprogramme. This will open the door beyond the many young people who attend university – its remit includes FE students, apprentices, and youth and school groups. A whoop of excitementgreeted the announcement, with opportunities for those involved in education, training, culture and sport, and a commitment to maximise take-up by disadvantaged young people. Widening experience, encouraging adventure: Erasmus+ may help cure Britain’s monolingual handicap and the catastrophic decline in language courses. Last year in the UK, less than3% of A-levelswere in languages.This all eludes Europhobes such as Andrew Neil,who postedon X that “extra taxes now being inflicted on working people will be used to finance some ‘study’ in Barcelona for gap-year yahs from affluent families”.Our expensive experiment with isolation from Europe is unwinding. Forget Labour’s embarrassingly futile slogan of “make Brexit work”, its insistence on “red lines” and fear of doing anything that might reignite Brexit passions. Now it is accelerating from tiptoe to trot towards Europe. Last month,Keir Starmer wrote: “We must confront the reality that the botched Brexit deal significantly hurt our economy.” Listen to other ministers’ language.Rachel Reeves: “The cuts to capital spending and Brexit have had a bigger impact on our economy than was even projected back then.” Wes Streeting said Labour should undo “the economic damage done by Brexit”, whileDavid Lammy refused seven timesin one interview to rule out reversing a Brexit that had “badly damaged our economy”. This is the new mood music, as Liberal Democrats and Greens eat Labour’s pro-European lunch, withtwice as many Labour votersconsidering fleeing to them as to Reform UK.The Europhobe response to rejoining Erasmus has been as demented as you would expect. The Mailwent for the Turksagain (Turkey is an associate member of the programme), with the headline “Thousands of Turkish students could come to UK” – a reprise ofreferendum-era scare storiesabout Turkey joining the EU.The Tories and Reform hope Labour is falling into their trap on Europe, reawakening deep Brexit “betrayal” passions. But they sound out of step: the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, says: “Labour continue to betray Brexit … dragging Britain back under the control of Brussels.” YouGovfinds65% support for rejoining Erasmus with only 12% opposed. Even back in 2020, as the Brexit axe fell, 61%wanted to stayin Erasmus.The Tories and their media attack the £570m cost of Erasmus. But if they bandy around numbers they have to answer for the whole cost of Brexit. The National Bureau of Economic Research finds that the UK’s GDP is between6% and 8% smallerthan it could have been. The House of Commons library estimates that leaving the EU is costing the Treasury up to£90bn a yearin lost tax revenue. Here’s how. Unless lorries are backed up outside Dover, the unseen blockages and deterrents to trade usually go unnoticed, yet an estimated 16,400 companieshave abandoned EU trade.Here’s an example of the obstacles, reportedin Farmers Weekly. Four refrigerated lorries carrying £650,000 worth of Scottish lamb to Europe were stopped at Calais; the meat was rejected by French inspectors despite being stamped as fit for consumption by the UK’s Food Standards Agency. Worse still, the lorries were not allowed to return, either. “They hold all the power. We’re completely helpless,” said West Scottish Lamb. As the meat neared its viable time limit, they said that standoff was “crippling our business”, adding: “The UK government has effectively handed the French authorities the power to control our goods.” Yes, that’s what the disastrous Brexit deal did. They can reject our exports, now we have given up any say. It was sorted last week, at the last minute. Though not accepted into the EU, the meat was finally allowed to return to the UK, after whatFarmers Weekly sayswas a three-week standoff.I spoke to the National Sheep Association’s Phil Stocker, who said: “In the last six months there have been more problems. Our standards have become misaligned. They change some rules and we aren’t told.” This matters as more than a third of lamb is exported, and 95% of thatgoes to the EU. “We urgently need that trade agreement on food,” he adds. Thegovernment’s responseis that it is negotiating anSPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) agreementthat will boost trade and remove border checks. Stocker says he’s optimistic it may get done within 18 months, cutting red-tape costs. This example, he says, shows how Brexit makes costs rise and GDP contributions fall.No doubt when that SPS deal is made, Brexiters will protest that we have become rule-takers, obeying Europe’s standards. But that’s what Brexit did, obliging exporters to conform while removing our seat at the table to decide on standards and rules. There will be more trouble ahead, warns Liz Webster of Save British Farming, for as long as the government tries to keep strategic ambiguity with the US. The UK has agreed to allow up to13,000 tonnes of US beefper year (if it conforms to our standards, and is not hormone-fed), to the distress of beef farmers such as her. Donald Trump is pushing Britain for a full food trade deal, chlorine-washed chicken and all, yet that would kill off any deal with Europe. Given Trump’s erratic behaviour over existing deals, and ministers’ and senior MPs’ warning that all agreements with him are only “built on sand”, the time is rapidly approaching when Britain will have to choose. Forget the “bridge across the Atlantic” fantasies: on trade, on defence and in terms of our identity, we are Europeans.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBrexitOpinionEuropean UnionLabourEuropeTrade policycommentShareReuse this content"

Also in the race was Lullaby from the charity campaign Together for Palestine, which reached No 5.“It’s hard to put into words how special this feels,” Kylie told Official Charts. “BeingChristmasNo 1 really is the most wonderful gift.”It’s Kylie’s first No 1 in 22 years, after Slow in 2003, and only her second solo Top 10 hit since 2010’s All the Lovers. Xmas makes her the first woman to secure UK No 1 singles in four different decades, and she’s a rare Australian Christmas chart-topper – Nicole Kidman was the previous one, with her Robbie Williams duet Somethin’ Stupid in 2001.In a way, Kylie has been at Christmas No 1 once before, but only as a small part of the 1989 version of Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas?, performing alongside Cliff Richard, Bananarama and many more – the song doesn’t count as an official Kylie hit on the charts. She had nearly reached the top spot the previous year with her ultra-sappy Jason Donovan duet Especially for You, but Richard kept them off No 1 with his arguably even sappier Mistletoe and Wine.Kylie’s Xmas was helped along by sales of CD and vinyl versions, but its success is all the more remarkable because it isn’t available on most streaming services: she recorded it as an exclusive track forAmazonMusic.The online retailer has identified Christmas music as a big draw for customers in recent years, using exclusive songs as a way to tempt them into signing up to its music streaming offering (the songs can also be heard on YouTube). These exclusives are also often played when Christmas music is requested on Amazon’s Alexa devices, helping to increase their chart success.It’s the first time an Amazon-commissioned song has reached Christmas No 1, though previous efforts have nearly managed it. Last year Tom Grennan’s It Can’t Be Christmas reached No 3, and in 2023 Sam Ryder reached No 2 with It’s Christmas to Me. Ellie Goulding’s Amazon-exclusive cover of Joni Mitchell’s River, released in 2019, reached No 1 just after Christmas that year. Katy Perry, Olivia Dean, Laufey, Jorja Smith and George Ezra are among the other artists to have recorded Christmas songs for Amazon.Speaking to Music Weekas the Kylie campaign kicked off, Amazon Music’s Alex Nutton heralded “significant investment and promotional support in commissioning new Christmas tracks these past few years … A great Christmas track has the power to stand the test of time. When commissioning these songs, our goal is always to create a new holiday favourite that customers will return to year after year.”In terms of pure sales,Together for Palestinecame out on top, but Lullaby was relatively little streamed. The song is an adaptation of Palestinian lullaby Yamma Mwel El Hawa, featuring a mix of the original Arabic lyrics and new ones written by Peter Gabriel. It is performed by Palestinian artists such as Nai Barghouti alongside British ones including Neneh Cherry, Celeste, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Together for Palestine co-creator Brian Eno.Earlier this month, Enotold the Guardianhe was “not gonna be completely disappointed” if the song didn’t reach No 1, because “Christmas singles are a thing unto themselves.” Proceeds from the song will be distributed to Palestinian causes via the Choose Love charity.The rest of the chart is predictably stuffed with Christmas songs: 27 of them in all. Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas is You and Brenda Lee’s Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree are at No 3 and No 4, and the Pogues, Kelly Clarkson, Elton John and Bobby Helms’s Christmas songs all feature in the Top 10 (Dave and Tems’ Raindance is a non-Christmassy outlier at No 7).‘Harder work than almost any album we ever did’: Pink Floyd’s Wish You Were Here turns 50Read moreIn the album chart, Pink Floyd’s 50th anniversary reissue of Wish You Were Here is at No 1, ensuring they break an obscure record: the longest time between an album’s first No 1 appearance and its most recent. Previously this had been the Beatles’ Abbey Road, which topped the chart in 1969 and then again in 2019, a slightly shorter gap of 49 years and 252 days.Wish You Were Here is Pink Floyd’s second UK No 1 album of the year, after the live album Pink Floyd at Pompeii – MCMLXXII. They have also scored a Christmas No 1 single in the past, with Another Brick in the Wall in 1979.Kylie was last week’s album chart-topper with Kylie Christmas (Fully Wrapped), a reissue of her 2015 Christmas album.Explore more on these topicsUK chartsPop and rockKylie MinogueChristmasAmazonE-commercenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s just what Le Carré would have wantedMichael HoganFri 19 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 15.33 ESTShareFor screenwriter David Farr,The Night Manager’s return is a dream come true. Literally. “Having not thought about the show for five years, a vivid image came to me in bed one night,” he says. “I saw a boy in a Colombian monastery, waiting for a black car to come over the hill. For some bizarre reason, I knew who those characters were. Suddenly, I was half-awake and the rest came flying out of me. I wrote it all down in case I forgot. In the morning, I looked at my notes and thought: ‘This is good, actually.’”He’s not wrong. It’s a special drama that can leave a decade-long gap between series but still be welcomed back with widespread excitement. It’s testament to The Night Manager’s quality that its comeback is the first must-watch show of 2026.The2016 debut run, based on John le Carré’s 1993 novel – the first he wrote after the collapse of the Soviet Union – followed hotelier turned spy Jonathan Pine (Tom Hiddleston) as he went undercover to bring down arms dealer Richard Roper (Hugh Laurie), AKA “the worst man in the world”. Farr’s lavish adaptation became event TV, pulling in 10 million viewers and selling to 180 countries. Hiddleston, Laurie and Olivia Colman all won Golden Globes for their performances. But there was a small problem: there wasn’t another book.“I’ve been a Le Carré fan since watchingSmiley’s Peoplewith my Dad when I was 10,” says Farr. “When I was asked to adapt The Night Manager, I was scared. But I had clear ideas, like relocating it to the Arab spring, and Le Carré loved that. There was never a discussion of more. It was one-and-done. When it became a huge hit, there was appetite for a sequel. I wasn’t feeling it. People probably thought I was mad but I didn’t want to mess it up by knocking up a second one.”View image in fullscreen‘More chiselled and manly’ … Tom Hiddleston as Jonathan Pine in The Night Manager, season two.Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Ink FactoryYears later came that fateful dream. “Le Carré died in 2020 but he’d given his blessing to a second season, which was important,” says Farr. “Tom [Hiddleston] was a bit like me. Quite rightly, he didn’t want to destroy a beautiful thing by doing something less beautiful. When he came onboard, we were away.”“I’d always hoped I might return to the role,” says Hiddleston. “David’s vision made that possibility real. Ten years have passed and they haven’t been easy – in the world, in this country, for all of us. Imagine how much more complex they’ve been for those working in the security and intelligence services. To return to the character of Pine, while carrying my own experience of the last decade, was a thrilling prospect.”We meet Pine again in flashback, reuniting with former handler Angela Burr (Colman) to identify a body. In present-day London, he’s director of MI6’s covert “Night Owls” unit. “I knew Pine wouldn’t go back to ordinary life,” says Hiddleston. “The errant knight, on fire with moral fury, would need to stay in active service. Once he’d seen behind the curtain, there would be no going back.”His team specialise in nocturnal surveillance – mainly of Mayfair hotels and casinos, which provide a way into terror cells and hostile networks. He’s still a night manager, just a different type. “We’re watchers,” says his sidekick Sally (Hayley Squires). “We’re not the show.” Their work is “not the most glamorous or dramatic”, a superior says smugly. Just you wait.Pine’s past remains buried until he spots one of Roper’s former footsoldiers somewhere unexpected. Investigating off the books, the team learn he’s now a fixer for South American cartels – notably Colombian arms dealer Teddy Dos Santos (Diego Calva). Using a charitable foundation as cover for his criminality, just like Roper did, Dos Santos is following in his predecessor’s destructive footsteps.View image in fullscreen‘Working with Olivia again was a joy’ … Hiddleston with Olivia Colman in The Night Manager.Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Ink FactoryAs the past is weaponised against him, Pine begins to feel like he’s chasing ghosts. When a confidante is murdered and an operation goes tragically wrong, Pine doesn’t know whom to trust. Is there a leak in his team? Are the intelligence services illegally selling British weapons abroad? With the aid of glamorous businesswoman Roxana Bolaños (Camila Morrone), he sets out to infiltrate Dos Santos’s operation.With a reported £20m budget, the first series was a location-hopping epic. The new run, co-produced by deep-pocketed Prime Video, is equally globe-trotting. The opening two episodes alone take us to Egypt, Barcelona, Miami and Medellín. “The action builds significantly,” says Farr. “We’re more Bourne than Mission: Impossible or Bond, more human than superhero, but there are spectacular sequences in beautiful places. Basically, escapism to keep us warm on wintry Sunday nights.”Hiddleston also spends a lot of time running. Is he the new Tom Cruise? “I can’t speak for the other Tom,” he laughs. “I stand only in awe and admiration. But we spoke about Pine’s need to run as a kind of somatic catharsis. There’s a deep well of pain and trauma at the centre of him. His running clears his head, cools his heart, stills his racing mind.”View image in fullscreen‘Addicted to danger’ … Hiddleston as Jonathan Pine in The Night Manager.Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Ink FactoryHe relished reuniting with Colman. “Working with Olivia again was a joy,” he says. “A lot has happened in both our lives – she won an Oscar and has become a national treasure – but we kept in touch along the way. Le Carré described the relationship between agent and handler as so intimate, it almost feels familial.”A welcome dose of down-to-earth humour is added by Squires’s Sally, whose London street-smarts contrast with Hiddleston’s smooth Etonian charm. “I really enjoyed writing Sally,” says Farr. “She lends Britishness which it really needs. A bit of old-fashioned Le Carré.”“Me and Tom are an unusual pairing,” says Squires. “But it works. From the off, Sally senses there’s something more to Pine. When she finds out the truth, she makes a conscious decision to follow him into the field. The journey she goes on is terrifying but allows her to understand her own capabilities. I’d be useless at spying in real life. My nerves wouldn’t take it. That made it particularly fun to act.” She grins. “I underestimated the amount of running I’d have to do, though. I wish I’d been warned about that.”Series one starred Elizabeth Debicki as Roper’s girlfriend Jed. The sequel has a more kickass femme fatale in Morrone. “I love this new version of the female lead,” Morrone says. “Roxana is something fresh in espionage fiction. She’s a hustler, smarter than the men give her credit for. Constantly playing both sides but really, the only side she’s on is her own. Whenever you think she’s going to be the classic love interest or damsel in distress, she flips that on its head. She’s a real equal. She loves the game in the same way these men do. And she has a backstory which makes her a firecracker character.”The 2026 Pine is older and wiser but no less lethal. As Hiddleston puts it, “He has a few more scars on the outside and on the inside.” Farr agrees: “He’s vowed that the havoc he wreaked in people’s lives isn’t going to happen again. He’s slightly addicted to danger and totally addicted to false identities – that’s why we love spies, right? – but he’s opted to live a safe, quiet life. But for Pine, that’s a half-life. When he unleashes that suppressed side of himself, it’s explosive.”View image in fullscreen‘I’d be useless at spying in real life’ … Hayley Squires as Sally in The Night Manager season two.Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Ink Factory“We take you on a rollercoaster ride,” promises Hiddleston. “Pine puts himself in extraordinary danger. We watch him risk, sacrifice, seduce and betray to unravel the mystery. I hope audiences will be thrilled by the chase.”For Farr, the decade between series had its creative advantages. “It’s a timescale you rarely get in film or TV, which was a real gift. The past is quite distant but it haunts Pine. Tom found that fascinating. He looks different, too. More chiselled and manly. Rewatch the first series and he looks like a puppy!”Pine himself has changed but so has the world. Farr appreciated the chance to reflect 10 years of global upheaval. “This show is about arms deals and how they’re used as geopolitical leverage, sometimes in truly terrible ways. It happened with the al-Yamamah contracts [under which the UK government sold arms to Saudi Arabia], which were shameful. More recently, when it looked like Ukraine might have a peace deal, share prices of defence firms across Europe plummeted. Since Iraq, everyone is wise to the fact that war makes money for certain people. There’s an infrastructure of power which is messy and dirty. Richard Roper was the embodiment of that. Now it’s become manifest. Look at the bombs dropped on Gaza in the last two years. The other thing that’s changed is the rise of populism and the chaos that brings.”The backdrop of Colombia is accidentally timely. “It’s become more topical than we imagined. South America is now an unbelievably hot area, especially Venezuela. This show is not in any sense about Donald Trump but Le Carré would absolutely be casting a scabrous eye over how Britain and America are using certain levers of power in foreign policy.” The new setting also loops back to the source material. “The novel is actually set in Central America,” says Farr. “I shifted it to the Arab world but Roper’s lair was originally in Panama and he dealt arms to Colombian drug runners. Now we’ve come full circle.”View image in fullscreen‘We’ve come full circle’ … Tom Hollander, Elizabeth Debicki and Hugh Laurie in season one of The Night Manager, 2016.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThe first series hit headlines for Hiddleston’s bare-bottomed sex scenes with Debicki. This time, he’s torn between Calva and Morrone. “That gets very hot,” says Farr. “The intelligence world has always been a sexually fluid place. Le Carré explored it in his books, going right back to Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. I’d argue that in the first series, Pine and Roper’s relationship was slightly homoerotic. I wanted to explore the new sexual fluidity and Diego Calva was perfect for that. He has this innate openness and availability. So yes, there’s a steamy triangle going on.” Can we expect Daily Mail outrage again? Farr laughs. “If I don’t get the Daily Mail in a lather, I’ve done something wrong!”“It’s a complicated throuple,” says Morrone. “A power game in which they’re all on top at different times and all have guns pointed at each under the table.” The three actors grew so close, there’s now a Night Manager WhatsApp group. “Tom created it and it’s called Mi Amigos,” says Morrone. “It’s him, Diego and I, so your dream throuple! What gets sent around? If I told you, I’d have to kill you!”The Night Manager is on BBC One on New Year’s Day at 9.05pm and everywhere else on Prime Video on 11 January.Explore more on these topicsThe Night ManagerTelevisionTom HiddlestonOlivia ColmanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As Willa, the teenage daughter of former revolutionaries, she was called on to do shoot-outs, car chases, karate, and to hold her own against heavyweights like Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Benicio del Toro and Regina Hall. “My whole life has literally changed in the last six months,” she says.Tell ushow you got this role? Was there a giant karate tournament where you had to defeat all your rivals?No, thank God. I did six months of auditioning for the film while I was working on my first project, Presumed Innocent. So I was in California when I sent in my first self-tape. And about a month after that, the casting director called me and was like: “Hey,Paul Thomas Andersonwould love to do an in-person callback, and it’s going to be a chemistry read with Leonardo DiCaprio and Regina Hall.” And so after that, I had in-person auditioning, callbacks, chemistry reads and camera tests, and then I had four days of intensive karate training, private lessons and group classes. Paul came to watch the final one, and then after that, he told me I’d got the part.Were you fazed at all to be acting opposite such established names?I was definitely freaking out the first time that they told me. And I called my parents right away, and I was like: “Mom, I’m about to meet Leo DiCaprio and Regina Hall tomorrow.” So they were freaking out too, even more than me. Once I got there, on the day, I was like: “OK, I came here to do my job, and I’m gonna make sure that I’m doing right by myself and my scene partners.” Standing in front of DiCaprio, the facade kind of fades the second that they call “Action”. Also he’s such a kind person, and really funny. So even the first time I met him, it was really easy to drop in from the start.View image in fullscreenInfiniti in One Battle After Another.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyA lot of themen in this story are pretty dysfunctional, and a lot of the women are incredibly powerful. Didthey look out for you?Even before we started filming, Regina was like: “If you ever need anybody here, let me know.” I took her up on that. She’s just such a special person and such a genuine human being, and I love her very much.You get to do so much in this movie – shoot-outs, car chases – what was your favourite bit?Getting to do all those sequences has been one of my dreams for so long because I love action films. So I was so excited to race a car and to do a little fight sequence and to use firearms on camera. But one of the scenes I was the most excited to do reading the script for the first time was when Lockjaw [Sean Penn] and Willa first meet in that church at the Sisterhood of the Brave Beaver. I was so excited to do that scene, and then getting to see it on the big screen, I felt nothing but pride.The story deals with themes of racism and racial hatred. Was that difficult to negotiate, as a mixed race person?Unfortunately, they’re not themes that are so strange to me, given the state of the world – who I am, where I am, and how I look. But thanks to Paul, and also to Sean and the entire crew, I was given a space where I could feel comfortable to face it head-on and not be fearful. I was bringing from my personal experience, and a lot of it, [Anderson] was like: just bring what you think of Willa, because youareWilla. He completely entrusted her over to me, which I’m so grateful for now.She’s pretty fearless for a 16-year-old. What were you like at that age?Me at 16? I was scared. I had a really hard time figuring out where I fitted in. But the only place I really felt like I belonged was in theatre and performing. That was one place where I could completely lose myself and feel at home and at peace in a way that I never had felt before. I went to a school for musical theatre [in Indianapolis]. That’s where I really started to learn the importance of an ensemble, and working as a team, because no performance is individual.You must get asked to explain your name a lot.I love explaining it! I love my parents very much, and they spent a lot of time on my name. My first name comes from Batman Forever – I’m named after Nicole Kidman’s character Chase Meridian. And then my middle name, because Infiniti is my middle name [her surname is Payne], that comes from Toy Story, when Buzz Lightyear says: “To infinity and beyond.” My parents definitely love the movies.What’s next for you?I just finished filming the sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale called The Testaments [she plays Agnes, daughter of Elisabeth Moss’s character June]. So I got to dive into Gilead, which is really cool, but you’re seeing a new corner of it.What wasyourfavourite film of the year – apart fromOne Battle After Another?I absolutely loved Sinners. I am going to go rewatch it around Christmas. I think that movie is so special, getting to see people that look like you on the screen with an incredible story like that, and you just feel how much love and effort Ryan Coogler put into it.This article was amended on 19 December 2025. An earlier version said One Battle After Another stars Regina King; this should have said Regina Hall.Explore more on these topicsOne Battle After AnotherLeonardo DiCaprioPaul Thomas AndersonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sources cited by the Telegraph said that, after the inquiry, steps were taken to limit contact between Walliams and some employees. Measures reportedly included ensuring some staff did not work directly with him, advising them to attend meetings in pairs and discouraging visits to his home.The decision to sever ties came after HarperCollins’ former chief executive, Charlie Redmayne, suddenly stepped down in October and was replaced on an interim basis by Kate Elton.In a statement to the Guardian, a HarperCollins spokesperson said: “After careful consideration, and under the leadership of its new CEO, HarperCollins UK has decided not to publish any new titles byDavid Walliams.”Walliams has “strongly” denied the publisher’s allegations, with a spokesperson saying: “David has never been informed of any allegations raised against him by HarperCollins.“He was not party to any investigation or given any opportunity to answer questions. David strongly denies that he has behaved inappropriately and is taking legal advice.”Walliams rose to prominence in the early 2000s as the co-creator and star of BBC’s Little Britain, which became a cultural phenomenon and made him one of the most recognisable comedians in the UK. He later became a familiar television personality through roles as a presenter and as a judge on Britain’s Got Talent. From 2008, Walliams reinvented himself as a children’s author, achieving huge commercial success. He has authored more than 40 books and short story collections – in 2019, it was estimated that he had sold £100m worth of books.However, Walliams, 54, has come under fire in recent years. Critics have challenged aspects of his writing, including the use of stereotypes. In 2021, a story titled Brian Wong, Who Was Never, Ever Wrong, about a Chinese boy,was removedfrom Walliams’ book The World’s Worst Children.Walliams left his role as a judge on Britain’s Got Talent in 2022 after 10 years, when the Guardian reported on a leaked transcript showing him making crude remarks about contestants during auditions in 2020. He referred to one contestant as a “cunt” and said “she thinks you want to fuck her, but you don’t”, about another. Walliams apologised for the comments.Explore more on these topicsDavid WalliamsnewsShareReuse this content"

Recordings of it have leaked online – but many questions still remainFri 19 Dec 2025 10.15 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 10.16 ESTShareIs anything real any more? For the last few weeks there have been rumours that Marvel is about to drop the first official footage for its forthcoming superhero epic Avengers: Doomsday, ahead of screenings ofAvatar: Fire and Ash. And it makes a sort of sense: the latest instalment of James Cameron’s 3D mega-project about blue aliens and colonial shame is clearly a visual spectacle, so why not lure fans of Captain America and Thor into cinemas by dangling the promise of a Doomsday trailer in front of them? In a world in which everyone expects everything to be online instantly, could the most radical experiment be to put this thing in cinemas?If it once seemed like a good idea, it increasingly looks less so. There are rumoured to be multiple Doomsday trailers in circulation, to be ushered in ahead of select screenings of Fire and Ash. But several appear to have leaked online already, which means most Avengers superfans are now getting their first glimpse of the new movie through a prism of phone footage and compression artefacts. Audiences at early showings of Cameron’s film, meanwhile, havereported not seeing any Avengers trailer, though some insist they definitely saw something, briefly.The trailer trailed … casting announced in March this yearThe first leaked trailer appears, according to multiple eyewitness accounts and fragments of poor-quality footage, to show Steve Rogers once again positioned as a central heroic presence, framed with unmistakably sentimental weight. On-screen text reportedly confirms that the character will return in Doomsday. Whether this is meant to be a tease, a misdirect or a deliberate provocation is unclear, but the implication alone has been enough to send fandom into overdrive.This immediately creates a small mountain of problems.Marvelhas already introduced a new Captain America in the form of Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson, and has spent several years – including an entire Disney+ series and this year’s Captain America: Brave New World – establishing him as the future of the role. Chris Evans’ Rogers, meanwhile, was given a very public, very deliberate farewell in Endgame, as an old man who had slipped back through time to live out his remaining years with Hayley Atwell’s Peggy Carter. Are we really meant to believe that he is now returning, inexplicably youthful and combat-ready, to beat up Robert Downey Jr’s Doctor Doom? And how much narrative sleight of hand is Marvel prepared to deploy before the idea of consequence finally collapses under its own weight?There are, of course, ways the studio can explain all this weirdness without openly setting fire to Endgame. Perhaps Doomsday will introduce us to a variant Steve Rogers, one who was jettisoned from the main timeline before he even considered giving it all up for the love of a good woman. Maybe this is a Steve who has been dragged back into service by multiversal collapse. Or possibly this is simply what happens when a franchise wobbles at the box office and decides it needs Evans back. Another leaked trailer appears to focus on Chris Hemsworth’s Thor, suggesting that Doomsday really will see the old Avengers gang getting back together, even if Downey Jr is now in a very different suit.For Marvel fans, it is hard to understand what’s going on. You can go and see Avatar and you might just catch an Avengers: Doomsday mini-trailer. But also, you might not. The best you can get online at the moment is a shaky phone clip that looks as if it was filmed from inside a pocket (or a completely legit bututterly pointless countdown video, telling you it’s going to be nearly a year before the film actually turns up in cinemas).Is this what building hype and anticipation looks like in 2025? If so, Marvel has finally perfected a marketing strategy that feels appropriate to the age: a blockbuster launched as rumour, sustained by nostalgia, delivered via confusion, and headlined by two men who have already had their endings, now summoned back anyway.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSuperhero moviesMarvelcommentShareReuse this content"

Both film and man changed my lifeI had watched the coming-of-age weepie over and over growing up so it was an overwhelming experience to sit down with its creator and see it again. It was a magical day and he was just as warm-hearted as his movieJamie GrahamFri 19 Dec 2025 09.44 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 11.53 ESTShareRob Reiner beams as he greets me. “You’ve seen Stand By Me 100 times?” he asks. I nod sheepishly. “Then you probably know it better than I do.” It’s August 2006, 20 years after Reiner’s coming-of-age weepie was first released, and I’m sitting in his office at Castle Rock Entertainment, the LA-based production company he co-launched in 1987. On the walls hang posters of Reiner’s beloved movies – This Is Spinal Tap, When Harry Met Sally, The Princess Bride, Misery, A Few Good Men – but our attention is fixed on a modest TV as Stand By Me begins.I’m here in Beverly Hills to write an anniversary article for a film magazine, but it’s also a pinch-me moment. As a teen, I’d watched Stand By Me on loop, identifying with the four protagonists – fragile, wannabe-writer Gordie (Wil Wheaton), tough-but-sensitive Chris (River Phoenix), wildcard joker Teddy (Corey Feldman) and put-upon Vern (Jerry O’Connell) – as they share their grief, insecurities and mistrust of adults.OK, I never hiked up miles of railway track to eyeball a dead body, but my friends were everything to me, plugging the ragged hole left by my parents’ divorce. Like Gordie, I felt lost at home, and like Chris, I was looked down upon because, in my village in the 80s, families did not break up. But my closest circle of pals made everything all right. Together we watched Stand By Me, and like the kids in the film, we never stopped with the banter but could also, when needed, put an arm around each other’s shoulders.View image in fullscreen‘Stand by Me means more to me than any of my other films’ … Rob Reiner with River Phoenix on the set of Stand By Me.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyWe start to watch the film. “Gordie feels so disconnected,” says Reiner as the slight, doe-eyed boy endures a conversation with his father. “It’s a theme that runs through the whole film. It’s all about him feeling that his father doesn’t love him.” Reiner turned the thought personal as he spoke of his own father, Carl Reiner. “He was a big force. I felt that he didn’t see me.”For the younger Reiner, who had previously played Meathead in sitcom All in the Family and directed comedy features This Is Spinal Tap and The Sure Thing, Stand By Me was a conscious move to escape his father’s shadow. Though peppered with one-liners and ripe with adventure, it was the bassline of melancholy that runs through Stephen King’s source novella, The Body, that vibrated through Reiner’s core. Like Gordie, Reiner was 12 years old in 1959, when the action takes place, and he too was “the invisible boy” at home. “Stand by Me means more to me than any of my other films,” he murmured.As we watch, a curious thing happens. Our running commentary begins to dry up, and we have to repeatedly force ourselves to begin speaking again. Partly it’s because we’re pulled into the movie we’ve both seen so many times before, but also it’s down to the personal memories stirred.“It makes me look back at my own childhood with nostalgia,” says Reiner, and he seems relieved to snap back to speaking about production on the film: shooting for 60 sun-soaked days in Oregon during the summer of 1985; running workshops for his young leads; taking the boys river rafting to encourage genuine bonds of friendship.View image in fullscreen‘It makes me look back at my own childhood with nostalgia’ … Stand By Me.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamyAt the end of the film, Gordie and co have escaped junkyard dog Chopper, outrun the train on a vertiginous trestle, and plucked off some pesky, alarmingly bloated leeches after an ill-advised dip in a forest swamp. Together we watch in respectful silence as the dead kid is found and Gordie at last cries over the loss of his big brother, Denny (John Cusack). Now the boys are back in their small town of Castle Rock (yes, Reiner named his production company after it) and going their separate ways, innocence lost, friendships soon to be torn asunder.Reiner is visibly moved when Chris waves goodbye and fades out of the frame. He listens to middle-aged Gordie (Richard Dreyfuss) explain how his best friend grew up to be a lawyer and was last week stabbed for trying to calm an argument between two strangers. “We had no idea that River was going to die [of an overdose, in 1993],” he says. “When you look at the scene now, it’s really chilling.”That afternoon, we watched Stand By Me until the credits finished rolling to the tune of Ben E King’s title track, and then Reiner, who was every bit as genial as legend has it, said his own goodbyes. I think of that magical day often.The next day I put on Stand By Me again, in honour of the director who helped define my generation, and whose film nursed and shaped me. It was my 119th time watching it – but the first time I didn’t make it through the opening scene without weeping.Explore more on these topicsRob ReinerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Surveying them does not reveal much in the way of obvious musical trends. There’s very little similarity between Rosalía’s heady classical approach to pop on Lux and Lily Allen’s conversational disclosures on West End Girl. You could broadly group CMAT’s Euro-Country, Bon Iver’s Sable, Fable and the Tubs’ Cotton Crown together as alternative rock but they don’t sound anything like each other. And the year’s best-of lists are sprinkled with albums that brilliantly defy classification: Blood Orange’s Essex Honey leaps from old-fashioned indie to Prince-y funk; on Black British Music, Jim Legxacy sees no reason why UK rap can’t coexist with distorted guitars, pop R&B and acoustic bedroom pop.But it’s hard not to notice how similar they are thematically: a large swathe of the Guardian’s albums of the year seem consumed by loss. There are straightforward explorations of failed relationships: for all its religious imagery, there’s a prosaic breakup at the heart of Rosalía’s Lux, while West End Girl’s lurid detailing of the collapse of Lily Allen’s marriage kept the tabloids in headlines for weeks. There are albums about more literal grief: a mother’s death informs Blood Orange’s Essex Honey and the Tubs’ Cotton Crown; Jim Legxacy references his late sister, while the brothers in august rap duo Clipse have seldom sounded as vulnerable as they do describing the deaths of their parents on their rightly heralded comeback Let God Sort ’Em Out. Euro-Country both memorialises a close friend on Lord, Let That Tesla Crash, while its title track examines the wave of suicides provoked by the Irish financial crisis of 2008.Pulp’s triumphant comeback album More, meanwhile, makes a great deal of capital out of examining a lost past from the perspective of middle age, a point in life when you’ve “gone from all you can be to all that you once were”. You get a similar sense of time passing from Bon Iver’s Sable Fable: the album that Justin Vernon has claimed will be his last under that name spends a lot of time looking back and letting go. It isn’t entirely clear whether Anna von Hausswolff’s monumental Iconoclasts is mourning something personal, or the state of the world – “full of shit and full of evil” in one song’s estimation – but clearly something has changed dramatically, and not for the better: “The life we had has vaporised into the sky,” she sings on Stardust. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”Death, collapsed relationships, the passing of youth and the inexorable passage of time: these are sombre themes that fit a quite spectacularly grim year. But in the broader context of what’s happening to music, these albums about loss are, oddly, cause for optimism. Among 2025’s panoply of reasons to be fearful for the future lurked the ongoing advance of AI: certainly, this was the year the technology really made an impact on popular music. In July came the Velvet Sundown, a gently psychedelic Americana band that amassed millions of streams and were eventually revealed to be “a synthetic music project guided by human creative direction and composed, voiced and visualised with the support of artificial intelligence”.The same month, an AI-generated facsimile of a Brazilian disco track, Predator de Perereca by Blow Records, went viral on TikTok, amassing nearly 50m streams. In September, a US label reportedly paid $3m to sign Xavia Monet, an AI-generated R&B singer; Timbaland’s latest project is AI pop star TaTa Taktumi. By November, two AI-generated tracks had topped different US charts: Breaking Rust’s Walk My Walk made No 1 on the country digital song sales chart, while the equivalent gospel chart was topped by Solomon Ray’s Find Your Rest. The UK singles chart has also fallen victim. I Run by Haven began life with an AI-generated vocal seemingly designed to mimic that of R&B star Jorja Smith. It was banned by streaming services and removed from the UK chart after a weekwhen record industry bodies issued takedown notices, but a new version with a re-recorded vocal was No 14 in the UK Top 40 at the time of writing.Musicians are deeply concerned about AI. So why are the major labels embracing it?Read moreThis is all clearly the thin end of the wedge: there’s evidently plenty more to come. But if AI can make a fair copy of an old disco track, or a country record or a Jorja Smith song, the one thing it can’t do is experience the kind of human emotions that power the albums above. (The notion of an AI gospel track in particular seems to spectacularly miss the point.) These were not albums that people listened to just because they sounded nice, or had catchy hooks, but because they bought into the stories behind them, or felt moved by the feelings they expressed and the evident passion that had gone into making them, or saw their own lives reflected in the lyrics. They’re proof that music is about something more than just attractive tunes or big choruses purely designed to cash in on previous hits, that it’s not just “an alternative to silence”, a perfectly ghastly phrase apparently bandied about by streaming services as justification for filling their playlists with inoffensive slop. That feels like stating the blindingly obvious. It also feels like a point worth reiterating at this particular juncture in pop history.Explore more on these topicsCultureBest music of 2025Pop and rockRosalíaLily AllenDev HynesBon IvercommentShareReuse this content"

For major ballet companies it’s usually their biggest spectacle of the year, with huge casts, lavish sets, all stops pulled out. So how do you make a Nutcracker for a small company such asNew English Ballet Theatre, with a dozen dancers? NEBT are an admirable outfit. Director Karen Pilkington-Miksa consistently commissions new choreography, in this case from Royal Ballet first soloist Valentino Zucchetti, whose work has been seen on the Royal Opera House stage and elsewhere.View image in fullscreenLots to enjoy … Rebecca Arias, top, and Zhaklin Gudeva in The Nutcracker by New English Ballet Theatre.Photograph: Andrej UspenskiNow, this isn’t the Royal Opera House. In an intimate venue such as this, you don’t get the instant magic and suspension of disbelief a grand stage brings, just real people dancing in front of you. And a ballet like the Nutcracker needs magic because it’s a confection, and the dance’s main job is to decorate its fantastic Tchaikovsky score (here in a recorded version).Zucchetti’s setting is contemporary: a Christmas party at Clara’s luxe home. The backdrop shows floor-to-ceiling windows, the kids at the party do the running man in between theirpetit allegro. There is a nice central conceit, that the Drosselmeyer character is a hypnotist, swinging his pocket watch, mesmerising guests into dancing, or Clara into dreaming up a battle between soldiers and pirates (instead of mice) and off into the land of snow. This all needs a bit more personality to really pop: more energy in the characters, more gusto in the fight scene. It needs to be less polite.With a small cast, Zucchetti has to be inventive. And he is, creating a balance between flow and tableau, setting his 10 snowflakes into ever-changing formations, giving sweeping shape to Clara’s choreography in her pas de deux (with Nutcracker Luca De-Poli). Clara is guest dancer Liudmila Konovalova, longtime principal at Vienna StateBallet. Her years of experience are evident, everything is danced with finesse, she never drops a stitch.The young, hard-working cast dance well (Marcos Silva has spirit and technical vigour; Audrey Nelson is a bright, sparkling Flower Queen). They’re very likable and there’s lots to enjoy. You have to take this production for what it is – a boutique company like this can’t compete with the big guns. They could inject more vitality into the first act, but what they do, they do well.

These are my top 10 lists for best film, director, actor and supporting actor, actress and supporting actress, directorial debut, cinematographer, screenplay and film most likely to be overlooked by the boomer mainstream media (or MSM).As we look back over the last 12 months, there can be no doubt of the villain of 2025:Tilly Norwood, the female AI star. Launched in October, she is a smilingly bland and really very convincing non-human being who will work uncomplainingly and cheaply without ever storming off to her trailer. Like everyone else, I deplored the horrible simulation and opined that she is part of the AI-isation of movies that has been happening for some time now – without AI.The AI ‘actor’ Tilly Norwood is a symptom of blandified film culture. We need a return to reality | Peter BradshawRead moreYet the thing is, we can complain all we like. Critics and journalists can behave as if our droll or commonsensical putdowns will somehow shame the industry into ignoring AI. But as one producer patiently pointed out to me, it is not that there is no discernible gap between AI fakery and the real thing. If you look carefully then, yes, sure, fine, you can see the tiny gap. But the point is the vast cost gap. The difference in price between generating AI and shooting reality is becoming difficult to ignore. The resolution of the writers’ strike was supposed to have provided for guardrail restrictions on AI. But AI is still coming.Elsewhere, in the Homo sapiens world of film-making, many of the big-hitting auteurs have given us some wonderful work, and some have grievously let us down. Iranian film-maker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d’Or this year for his drama-thrillerIt Was Just an Accident, which took aim at the climate of fear in which the Iranian government operates. At Venice, veteran indie director Jim Jarmusch got the Golden Lion for his ensemble drama anthologyFather Mother Sister Brother, which elegantly explored the notion of narrative. The Gaza horror has been addressed with some fierce Palestinian-themed movies such as Kaouther Ben Hania’s angryThe Voice of Hind Rajab.But others have tried everyone’s patience and presumed outrageously on fan loyalty. The estimable Noah Baumbach and the similarly estimable George Clooney laid a massive egg with their self-regarding sentimentalJay Kelly, a kind of preening lap-of-honour which outstayed its welcome from the moment the house lights dimmed. Almost as bad was Luca Guadagnino’sAfter the Hunt, a muddled, incoherent and dodgily acted #MeToo drama.But alongside them there were tremendously exciting sorties from Kelly Reichardt, Paul Thomas Anderson, Josh Safdie, Kathryn Bigelow, Joshua Oppenheimer, Lucile Hadžihalilović and Lynne Ramsay. And Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible swan song was a terrific thrill ride. It goes to show that despite the chattering class alarmism on the subject, the cinema (compared to opera or theatre or Premier League football) is still a fantastically competitive, low-cost experience, and we should do our best to keep it alive.So here are my lists, and readers are of course invited to vote on what they think is best and point out omissions.Best filmOne Battle After AnotherYoung MothersThe Ice TowerLittle Trouble GirlsMarty SupremeThe EndDead of WinterNickel BoysA Real PainThe BrutalistView image in fullscreenHit man … Timothée Chalamet plays a ping-pong player in Marty Supreme.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyBest directorPaul Thomas Anderson for One Battle After AnotherKathryn Bigelow forA House of DynamiteKelly Reichardt forThe MastermindJesse Eisenberg for A Real PainRaMell Ross for Nickel BoysMike Leigh forHard TruthsDea Kulumbegashvili forAprilJafar Panahi for It Was Just an AccidentLynne Ramsay for Die My LoveBrendan Canty forChristyBest actressJennifer Lawrence forDie My LoveRadhika Apte forSister MidnightShahana Goswami forSantoshFiona Shaw forPark AvenueandHot MilkTeyana Taylor for One Battle After AnotherEmma Thompson forDead of WinterEmma Stone forBugoniaCynthia Erivo forWicked: For GoodMarion Cotillard forThe Ice TowerSally Hawkins forBring Her BackView image in fullscreenDead-eyed … Emma Stone in Bugonia.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyBest actorEthan Hawke forBlue MoonEthan Herisse for Nickel BoysBrandon Wilson for Nickel BoysTom Cruise forMission: Impossible – The Final ReckoningKieran Culkin for A Real PainTimothée Chalamet forA Complete Unknownand Marty SupremeRalph Fiennes forThe ReturnandThe ChoralJosh O’Connor for The Mastermind andWake Up Dead ManRobert Aramayo forI SwearandPalestine 36Cillian Murphy forSteveBest supporting actressAunjanue Ellis-Taylor for Nickel BoysElle Fanning for A Complete Unknown andPredator: BadlandsGeeta Agrawal Sharma for SantoshMina Svajger forLittle Trouble GirlsJudy Greer for Dead of WinterEmily Blunt forThe Smashing MachineLexi Venter forDon’t Let’s Go to the Dogs TonightMia Threapleton forThe Phoenician SchemeChase Infiniti for One Battle After AnotherFala Chen forBallad of a Small PlayerBest supporting actorGuy Pearce forThe BrutalistJoe Pesci forDay of the FightHugh Grant forBridget Jones: Mad About the BoyPaul Rudd forFriendshipSaša Tabaković forLittle Trouble GirlsJesse Plemons for BugoniaRussell Crowe forNurembergBenicio del Toro for One Battle After Another and The Phoenician SchemeDelroy Lindo forSinnersWilliam H Macy for Train DreamsView image in fullscreenWittily cast … Russell Crowe as Hermann Göring Nuremberg.Photograph: Kata Vermes/APBest cinematographyLol Crawley for The BrutalistDavid J Thompson forWarfareHélène Louvart forMotel DestinoJames Friend for Ballad of a Small PlayerDan Laustsen forFrankensteinRobbie Ryan for BugoniaAutumn Durald Arkapaw forThe Last ShowgirlAdolpho Veloso for Train DreamsJonathan Ricquebourg for The Ice TowerBruno Delbonnel for The Phoenician SchemeBest documentaryHung Up on a Dream: The Zombies DocumentaryPepeBlue Road: The Edna O’Brien StoryI Am Martin ParrErnest Cole: Lost and FoundOcean: With David AttenboroughA New Kind of WildernessGrenfell: Uncovered2000 Meters to AndriivkaColossal WreckBest screenplayAlan Bennett forThe ChoralPaul Andrew Williams forDragonflyEmbeth Davidtz for Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs TonightSteven Soderbergh forBlack BagNicholas Jacobson-Larson and Dalton Leeb for Dead of WinterPaul Thomas Anderson for One Battle After AnotherKelly Reichardt for The MastermindJustin Piasecki forRelayWilliam Gillies forHallow RoadAndrew DeYoung forFriendshipView image in fullscreenRelatable … Emma Thompson in Dead of Winter.Photograph: Lorcano film festivalBest debutLaura Carreira forOn FallingKaran Kandhari for Sister MidnightLeonardo Van Dijl forJulie Keeps QuietNadia Fall forBridesSaulė Bliuvaitė forToxicJulien Colonna forThe KingdomHarris Dickinson forUrchinEmbeth Davidtz for Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs TonightNadia Latif forThe Man in My BasementHarry Lighton forPillionMost likely to be overlooked by the boomer MSMGazerExplore more on these topicsFilmBest films of 2025Awards and prizesJafar PanahiDrama filmsDocumentary filmsWorld cinemaAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Split into four distinct movements and sung in 13 languages, Lux is a head-spinning, classical music-adjacent opus exploring feminine mystique, religious transcendence and corporal transformation, often via the prism of various female saints. The dissolution of a relationship – grounded and laid bare onLily Allen’s West End Girl, 2025’s other dissection of heartbreak – is shot heavenwards here, buffeted by the constant presence of the London Symphony Orchestra and the input of Pulitzer prize-winning composer Caroline Shaw among a scroll-sized list of collaborators. Its audacity alone makes the efforts of Rosalía’s pop peers look pretty laughable.The fact that Lux manages to transcend scholarly chin-stroking and dry Wiki deep dives is near miraculous, and the credit is solely Rosalía’s. While this isn’t her first album to alchemise the past and present – see 2018’sEl Mal Quererand its heady flamenco-R&B hybrid – the stakes are far higher on Lux, and the balancing act more pronounced. What elevates her fourth album, outside its multilayered melodies, rich compositions and engrained drama, is the playfulness at its heart. Like Björk during her 90s peak, there’s a sense of wonderment to Rosalía’s voice that sweeps you up into its tornado. Even when she’s tearing your heart in two, as on La Yugular’s blossoming balladry, or the ascension to heaven on the closing Magnolias, you want to be right there with her.The best example of this exuberance comes towards the end of Italian piano ballad Mio Cristo Piange Diamanti. Inspired by Saint Clare of Assisi, it luxuriates in its string-drenched whirlpool of sadness for more than four minutes. Suddenly, however, everything falls away and we hearRosalíagiggle “that’s gonna be the energy” before a comically OTT string crescendo thuds like a cartoon anvil. The song then segues quickly into batshit single Berghain, which gallops over the horizon on a gale of Vivaldi-esque strings, an imposing German choir and a cameo from Björk playing agony aunt.Rosalía: Berghain – videoThat you never quite know – or want to know – where you are with Lux is part of a charm that burrows deeper the more you listen. Nearly every song ends somewhere completely different to where it started. Reliquia explores the trappings and transience of fame over a featherlight symphony before disintegrating entirely into an electronic cacophony. On Porcelana, which tracks closest to2022’s sweaty Motomamiand its trap-adjacent pop collage, things starts off moody, Rosalía prowling around sinister drum fills and chopped-up male vocals, before fluttering flamenco handclaps are joined by an angelic choir to smooth out the song’s jagged edges.‘It’s impossible not to have contradictions in a contradictory world’: Catalan pop visionary Rosalía on critics, crisis and being ‘hot for God’Read moreAnother of Lux’s balancing acts is one between experimentation and accessibility. It’s no coincidence that Lux has become Rosalía’s first album to break the Top 5 in both the UK and the US: at its heart is a suite of undeniable pop songs. Divinize, the only song featuring Rosalía singing in English, is built around a chorus that feels as if it’s collecting more and more nagging hooks as it spins skywards. It’s a feat repeated by La Yugular, which expands and constricts as it weaves together layered melodies like a tapestry. The waltz-like La Perla seduces with its jaunty, Disney-adjacent musical drama and chant-along chorus, while lyrically it aligns itself with the pop culture-shifting honesty of West End Girl as it eviscerates (in Spanish) an “emotional terrorist” of an ex whose only “masterpiece is his bra collection”. Throughout, Rosalía sings with a painted-on smile, like Cinderella hiding a knife: “Gold medal in being a motherfucker / You’ve got the podium of disappointment.”Lux is pop on a maximalist scale, a hungry reach for capital-A Art in the face of impending AI blankness. It eschews solipsism in favour of glorious transcendence, creating an OTT drama that controls the parameters of its own ridiculousness. It’s a deep well of hidden treasure that takes time to fully mine but never feels like hard work. While some of 2025’s big pop albums felt like feasting on scraps, Lux is a banquet where the characters around the table, some tipsy on holy wine, flit from conversations about historical saints to the galvanising feeling of soul-shattering sadness, to shared gossip about useless men. It’s a modern-day musical from pop’s most restlessly creative practitioner.Explore more on these topicsRosalíaBest music of 2025Pop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We were all swept up, from teens to the retired, magistrates and retail workers, even non-gameshow fans. The show became the national conversation in a way TV pundits no longer thought possible. It was lightning in a bottle. Which would be a cool way of murdering someone.Why was it perfect TV? On the face of it, it’s a simple format that balances banter and tension, fun games and insidious group dynamics. Bucking the streamer “dumping” model, the BBC drip-fed episodes until we were slavering. Their ace, of course, isClaudia Winkleman– impeccable outfits, iconic hair, sly presenting style. I saw so many Winklemen at Halloween parties this October it was like Being John Malkovich with bangs. But this year the show surpassed even its own standards.The faithful were, objectively, the worst. They made it their mission to evict anyone useful or loyal, and never missed. But you can’t blame them, given the eccentric nature of the group. There was twinkly, two-faced Celia Imrie – flirting with Jonathan Ross, parping from nerves, talking about putting pussies in wells. Giggling assassin Alan Carr was delicious, gliding merrily along even while unable to pretend to be a faithful with any seriousness. Kate Garraway used the word “flabbergasted” at one point, which no one in any conversation in history ever has. (In response, Tom Daley gave her a side-eye which would take gold in the suspicion Olympics.)View image in fullscreenDelicious … Alan Carr in The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryThe faithful had their heroes, though. Puzzle-ninja Nick Mohammed, purer of heart than Harry Potter. And his “hundy”, rugby player Joe Marler. They were like David and Goliath teaming up. Roundtables, especially when stuffed with luvvies, are often conflict-aversion dances. (There’s only so many times you can hear “I’m voting for you because you’re clever and would make a brilliant traitor and I love you.”) There was none of that from the Harlequins loosehead prop, who took Traitor-catching personally. If he thought you were one, he would stare at you like Bane. For explanation, he might drag a finger across his throat.Marler’s “Big Dog” theory – as well as being bang on – was a fascinating insight into patriarchy. There does seem to be something about being a tall, white man in his late 60s that means people defer to you. It takes a lot to lose your seat at the table – see Jonathan Ross. One couldn’t help but think about our political life. It was like watching the group choose a prime minister. “It’s like playing chess against five-year-olds,” was Ross’s own assessment. A trickster to the end, his final speech was brilliant.View image in fullscreenTricksters to the end … Jonathan Ross, Alan Carr and Cat Burns on The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: BBCOne must give Stephen Fry his due, too. Often with reality shows, I wonder how clever the “clever people” really are. Are they just showbiz smart? But having judged the strategies of the faithful ineffective, Fry put forward an original theory: that the nocturnal traitors would be the most tired members of the group. Cat Burns, the traitor he levelled this at, had to stop yawning and think fast. She disclosed her neurodivergence, and the exhausting necessity of masking it. A risky card to play, but timed perfectly.You can tell a lot about people by what they respond to in the show. For example, as compelling as the double-bluffs and counterstrategies were, what I like best is that contestants spell each other’s names wrong. Roundtables are brutal enough – imagine having to listen to your friends explain why they think you’re shifty and a liar. Then imagine looking down at their slate, and they’ve called you “Meina” or “Nather” or “Charlot” or whatever. It’s 10 times funnier when the mangled name is “Tom Daylee”.Unlike me, TV audiences are sophisticated these days. They understand narrative, casting decisions and can tell when a player is being given a “hero edit”. There are podcasts examining the nuances of every interaction on the show. Given such scrutiny, the fact that the producers were able to deliver a gripping finale, and a result that felt shocking, inevitable and completely satisfying, is nothing short of astonishing. They are masters of psychological manipulation. You’d have to say, that’s traitor-ish behaviour.Explore more on these topicsCulture2025 in TVTelevisionReality TVCelebrityClaudia WinklemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A rare naysayer is screenwriter and film-maker Paul Schrader, whocommentedtersely online: “Film-making at level A+, but try as I might I couldn’t muster up an ounce of empathy for Leo DiCaprio or Sean Penn. I kept waiting for them to die.”But that’s why the film is gripping: there is indeed no empathy for its two unlovely leading males, and their mortality and vulnerability has a kind of unwinding, entropic energy. They are heading for disaster. And yes, the film-making is A+ or A++; it is supercharged with pleasure at its own audacity and expertise. It is moviemaking with a late-Kubrick elegance and a knowing theatricality, culminating in an exhilarating but also eerily strange car chase on an undulating freeway. This isn’t the same as style without substance, but it’s certainly a movie that can’t help but promote its self-aware style to equal status with its subject matter: a petty-tyrannical America of the present and future, and those who will grow old in resisting it from within.The question that can’t quite be answered is of when and where it is supposed to be set. The US of 10 or 20 years ago? Or an alt-reality imagined version of America in the present; a bizarro-world America? This knight’s-move it takes away from a recognisable contemporary world is partly a function of adapting Pynchon, with his playfully cartoonish imagination, and moreover updating his novel, whose present-day action was supposed to be taking place in the Reaganite 80s, with flashbacks to the freaky 60s. The story is now moved forward to some time between the Obama and Trump years – or diagonally out to some new narrative zone. The title envisions endless crises and the forever culture war of modern life.Leonardo DiCaprio is Bob, a former revolutionary who was once part of an activist cell attacking migrant-holding prisons on the Mexican border. He has aged gracelessly into a grumpy, boozy, dishevelled loser. His partner in his glory days was Perfidia, played by the radioactively charismatic Teyana Taylor. Perfidia succeeded in sexually entrancing the bullnecked blowhard in charge of counter-insurgency intelligence, Col Steven Lockjaw, played with reptilian fanaticism by Sean Penn.Lockjaw’s infatuation with her, in which racist fetishism fuses with a poignantly abject rapture, is something that Perfidia tries to toy with, to control military opposition. But it all goes terribly wrong, she gets pregnant, and her daughter Willa, played by Chase Infiniti, is to be subject to the movie’s paternity-claim crisis. Who is America’s authentic parent: the reactionary or the radical?DiCaprio, Penn, Taylor and Infiniti are all commandingly brilliant and the score byJonny Greenwoodis superb. One Battle After Another is a protest song of a film, whose lyrics are about cruelty and despotism and the heroism of dissent.Explore more on these topicsCultureBest films UK 2025Paul Thomas AndersonLeonardo DiCaprioSean PennBenicio del ToroJonny GreenwoodThomas PynchonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We pick our best momentsThe best classical recordings of 2025More on the best culture of 2025Andrew Clements,Erica Jeal,Flora Willson,Martin Kettle,Rian Evans,Clive PagetFri 19 Dec 2025 10.06 ESTLast modified on Fri 19 Dec 2025 10.24 ESTShare‘One of the most remarkable operatic premieres I’ve ever heard’I was only able to get to live music for less than three months of this year, but among the few events that I did attend was one of the most remarkable operatic premieres I’ve heard in more than 40 years. Commissioned by the Royal Opera, and based on the movie and stage play of the same name by Thomas Vinterberg,Festenwas Mark-Anthony Turnage’s fifth large-scale opera, and showed vividly how the sure dramatic instincts revealed in his earliest stage works, Greek and The Silver Tassie, have matured into an operatic language of immense power and flexibility. Not a word of Lee Hall’s libretto is wasted in revealing the dark family secrets that are exposed at a 60th birthday party, while Turnage’s wonderfully varied, unsparing score never makes a false step. The horror of the drama was remorselessly focused by Richard Jones’s production, with a cast in which every role was made horribly believable. The best British opera in half a century? Probably.Andrew ClementsBeethoven with a riot of colour and freshnessSome highlights are more predictable than others. The Australian Chamber Orchestra has now been wowing audiences for half a century, with Richard Tognetti its maverick leader for 35 years. But not even that track record could prepare me for the raw vitality of theACO’s latest UK outing at the Barbican in Marchwith a programme of Bach, Shostakovich and Gubaidulina. The concert began as these world-class string players were still walking on, their balance of technical control and creative freedom utterly gripping from the first contact of bow on string. A few months later, the Aldeburgh festival provided my year’s most memorable discovery, when the Gildas Quartet premieredColin Matthews’ String Quartet No 6alongside Bridge’s Three Idylls and Beethoven’s third “Razumovsky” quartet. It’s the latter that has stayed with me above all – such a riot of colour and intense freshness that it felt like another first performance.Flora WillsonInvigorating Janáček and spellbinding WagnerView image in fullscreenMagical touches: Die Walküre, in Barrie Kosky’s staging, at the Royal Opera House.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianI’ve had some great evenings in the Royal Opera House this year. By the time I caught up with Festen I had heard glowing things about it from all directions, and I was not disappointed. Katie Mitchell’s production ofJanáček’s The Makropulos Casewas not so universally well liked, but to my eyes her reimagining of the story was invigorating: I found myself firmly rooting for the centuries-old anti-heroine, as sung by Ausrine Stundyte, and thrilling to the orchestral sound – Jakub Hrůša’s tenure as the company’s music director is off to a good start. And in May the orchestra played wonderfully for their previous boss, Antonio Pappano, when he returned forDie Walküre, the second instalment of Wagner’s Ring cycle. There are magical touches to Barrie Kosky’s staging, not least the spellbinding omnipresence of elderly Erda, the earth goddess. I can’t wait for Siegfried in March to see what will happen to her next.Erica JealHonouring Palestrina and PärtPictures of violinist Carolin Widmann, recently forced by airline staff tofly clutching her precious Guadaganini wrapped in a sweateron her lap, its empty case in the hold, were hardly credible. They were nevertheless a potent reminder for me of Widmann’s stunning playing – on this very instrument – of her brother Jörg’s violin concertoin the BBCNOW concertthat he conducted. A truly exhilarating performance.At St George’s, Bristol, theTallis Scholars’concert celebrating Palestrina’s 500th anniversary and Arvo Pärt’s 90th birthday, a model of clarity and elegant line, was one of two standout choral programmes.I Fagiolini, in the other, honoured Orazio Benevoli, wonderfully resonant and maximising the venue’s lovely acoustic.Pianist Tamara Stefanovich’s virtuosity in contemporary and 19th-century repertoire is unquestionable, so her Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama recital of music by the Bach family – Johann Sebastian, Carl Philipp Emmanuel and Johann Christian – was unusual, and authoritative and memorable.Rian EvansBlistering ShostakovichView image in fullscreenThe finest orchestra on the planet? Iván Fischer conducts the Budapest festival orchestra at this year’s BBC Proms.Photograph: Andy ParadiseThere was a real sense of freshness and innovation in the air this year. Southbank Centre’s inauguralMultitudes festivalproved a stimulating mix of artistic cross-fertilisation. The London Philharmonic Orchestra collaborated with Australia’s Circa for a death-defyingacrobatic take on Ravel’s Daphnis et Chloé, while Vasily Petrenko’s blistering account ofShostakovich’s Leningrad Symphonywas complemented by thought-provoking imagery from art director Kirill Serebrennikov and video artist Ilya Shagalov.On stage, Annilese Miskimmon’s searingly honest production ofJake Heggie’s Dead Man Walkingwas, remarkably, the work’s first full professional staging in the UK. English National Opera fielded an outstanding cast led by Christine Rice who brought enormous emotional reserves to Sister Helen Prejean, the nun at the centre of this tale of truth, love, compassion and redemption. Finally,Iván Fischer and the Budapest festival orchestrademonstrated why they are perhaps the finest orchestra on the planet playing, Beethoven and Bartók at this year’s BBC Proms.Clive PagetSomehow, the genius for creativity in performance survivesSimon Rattle says classical music is in “a long-term fight for existence”. It certainly is. Yet despite Arts Council England’s war on excellence in the name of its curdled theory of anti-elitism, the genius for creativity in performance somehow survives. In February, Regents Opera staged acompelling Wagner Ring cyclein an east London boxing hall with reduced forces and a slashed back orchestra of 22 under Ben Woodward. In November, the no less indomitableGothic Operarescued Offenbach’s Die Rheinnixen, containing much music that would resurface in the Tales of Hoffmann. Both were triumphs of talent, commitment and resourcefulness. Both overcame endless practical challenges. Neither of them got a penny from ACE coffers. “We’ll do it because we’re compelled to do it,”wrote Woodward. Heroic words. Musicians across the UK continue to create marvels amid the prevailing political and societal philistinism. But they – and the universal need for live music– deserve so much better.Martin KettleExplore more on these topicsClassical music2025 in cultureMark-Anthony TurnagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

From this simple premise comes a joyful game of mindfulness and social interaction, as Alta learns how to serve up witty conversation and decent hot drinks. Colourful and highly stylised, it is a thoughtful study of burnout and recovery.19Expelled!View image in fullscreenClass conscious … Expelled!Photograph: InkleInkle/Nintendo Switch, iPhone/iPad, Mac, PCAn attempted-murder mystery set in an a 1920s all-girls private school reveals itself to also be an eviscerating takedown of British class politics. Witty and beautifully drawn, it is full of amusing boarding-school stereotypes, from self-interested prefects to a terrifying matron, whose motivations and personal grievances must be slowly unpicked. It has the feel of a really excellent graphic novel.18Hades 2SupergiantGames, PC, SwitchA stylish return to Greek mythology for developer Supergiant Games, this time starring daughter of the underworld Melinoë, who is trying to prevent the titan Chronos from destroying everything. You are aided in your attempts to kill Time by a range of absurdly attractive fellow immortals and vicious familiars. Repeated runs bring gradual mastery of Melinoë’s spells and weapons, tipping the scales of fate ever so slightly in your favour.17GrunnSokpop Collective, PCA gardening sim that’s also a horror adventure, Grunn is a weird, often unsettling experiment in game design, set in a Dutch village inhabited by ghostly figures and intriguing secrets. Trim the lawn, collect photos, but be extremely careful when visiting the church or exploring that weird bunker beyond the hedgerow.16Lonely Mountains: Snow RidersView image in fullscreenPristine … Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders.Photograph: Megagon IndustriesMegagon Industries, PC, XboxAll is well with the world as you carve beautiful lines down pristine mountain snowscapes – until you smack into a rock or fly off a cliff, that is. Minimalist in both its aesthetic and its simple, stripped-back play, this is one of the best games ever made about skiing. Playing with other people adds a little enjoyable chaos to the experience, but Snow Riders is best when it’s just you and the mountain, and you’re testing your perseverance against a particularly challenging trail.15Donkey Kong BananzaNintendo, Switch 2Nintendo’s favourite ape returns in a wild take on the classic platform adventure, accompanied by series regular Pauline, who is able to attain shapeshifting magical powers. Instead of pixel-perfect jumps, you punch, crunch and blast your way through exotic locations, collecting power-ups and pulverising bosses, tearing up the Super Mario level design book as you go. Smashing.14Monster Hunter WildsCapcom, PC, PS5, XboxCapcom’s spectacular monsters, from fluffy pink snarling apes to elder dragons that command lightning, have long been waiting for a world big enough to contain them. Wilds is that world: an expanse of desert, volcanic plains, jungle and icy peaks that provides the perfect habitats for an extraordinary, dangerous menagerie – and perfect arenas in which to fight them. The story is a thrill ride of escalatingly epic face-offs, but afterwards it opens up a vast menu of more challenging hunts.13Split FictionHazlelight Studios/Electronic Arts, PC, PS5, Switch, XboxTwo aspiring writers become trapped in each others’ stories in this eminently likable interactive take on buddy comedy. Except they’re not buddies: they’re polar opposites. Standoffish sci-fi writer Mio and happy-go-lucky fantasy writer Zoe come to understand each other better as they are forced to cooperate their way through the bizarre realms of their imagination Play transforms unpredictably every 20 minutes - one level could be all-action space-blasting, the next will have you puzzling through a fantasy jungle as transforming animals, and an unexpected diversion will have you working together to wriggle sentient hotdogs into buns. You’ll be brought closer to your player two as well, as navigating these collaborative scenarios requires communication, patience, and a sense of humour.12The AltersView image in fullscreenLooks familiar … The Alters.Photograph: 11 bit studios11Bit Studios, PC, PS5, XboxAfter crash-landing on a planet supposedly rich in a valuable mineral, Jan Dolski finds himself all alone.

After twenty-ish hours split between exploring a hostile planet, managing the base’s resources and managing the squabbles between all the alternate Jans, you will be left with a lot to ponder about how our life choices shape who we are.11DespelotePanic, PC, PS4/5, Switch, XboxSet at the time of Ecuador’s journey to the 2002 World Cup finals, Despelote is a beautifully designed semi-autobiographical adventure about a young boy and his obsession with the beautiful game. Focusing on families, childhood and the uniting power of fandom, it’s a unique take on the idea of a sports sim.10Two Point MuseumView image in fullscreenA lot to manage … Two Point Museum.Photograph: SegaTwo Point Studios/Sega, PC, PS5, Switch 2, XboxThe Two Point series of management sims has consistently combined humour and deep strategy to compelling effect, and the latest is no exception. Your role as museum manager is to gather exhibits from around the world then display them in an attractive setting to pull in visitors. Meanwhile there are staffing issues to contend with, and is your cafe serving nice enough snacks? It’s an engrossing challenge and the cartoon-style visuals provide plenty of amusing asides.9Ghost of YoteiSucker Punch/Sony, PS5A deliciously easy to enjoy and arrestingly beautiful samurai action game about a female warrior, Atsu, on a revenge quest, which unselfconsciously reproduces every possible trope of the genre, with panache. We have tense sword stand-offs under falling leaves. We have enemies eyeing each other menacingly from either side of a burning bridge. We have hot springs, shrines and quiet moments playing theshamisenor wielding asumi-eink brush. We have wolves and foxes leading us to secret spots in nature. And we have a selection of delightfully fun weapons and a seemingly endless horde of bandits and villains to use them on. Uncomplicated, beautifully made entertainment.8Death Stranding 2Kojima Productions/Sony, PS5Troubled delivery man and resistance hero Sam Bridges returns in Hideo Kojima’s visually astonishing, eccentric and engrossing sci-fi sequel. Moving the action to an apocalyptic Australia provides landscapes of stark beauty – and the odd kangaroo. And while the story is often indecipherable, the realisation of Kojima’s ghostly universe is incredible. This is a wasteland you can wallow in for months.7Clair Obscur: Expedition 33View image in fullscreenExtravagantly French … Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.Photograph: Sandfall InteractiveSandfall/Keplar, PC, PS5, XboxAn extravagantly French role-playing game in which a band of depressed people from a ravaged Paris set out to kill a supernatural painter, who wipes out a generation of people with a few strokes of her brush each year. It is surreal, exciting, melodramatic, sometimes self-indulgent, and strangely hopeful – a breath of fresh air even in a genre that’s hardly starved of stylish, thematically ambitious games.6Consume MeHexecutable, PCA satirical slice-of-life game about life as a dieting-obsessed teen in the 00s, Consume Me is extremely funnyandhas a point to make. Juggling studies with social time and walking the dog, Tetris-ing food on to your plate and and enduring excruciating conversations with your parents, all makes you properly relive the overwhelm and pressure of adolescent life. The presentation, meanwhile, is exuberantly, lovably absurd.5Mario Kart WorldView image in fullscreenDelightful … Mario Kart World on Nintendo Switch 2.Photograph: NintendoNintendo, Switch 2The showcase title for the Switch 2 is another glorious addition to the Mario Kart universe, boasting a delightful cast of characters and 30 varied circuits joined by a network of highways that provide the chance to explore a wide open landscape for the first time in the series. Add in the wonderful soundtrack of electronic lounge jazz pop bangers and you have another family gaming staple that will remain on rotation for years.4The Seance of Blake ManorSpooky Doorway/Raw Fury, PCIt’s the late 19th century and you’ve just arrived at a remote hotel in the west of Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. But as you dig for clues, the dead emerge from their graves – and they’re really not happy. Part Agatha Christie detective sim, part folk-horror opus, this is a fascinating and engrossing experience that has things to say about class, belief and colonialism.3Silent Hill fView image in fullscreenSpectral nightmare …Silent Hill f.Photograph: KonamiNeoBards/Konami, PC, PS5, XboxIn 1960s Japan, a young girl’s fury at her bullying father becomes a spectral nightmare that consumes a whole town. Written by acclaimed visual novel author Ryukishi07, the game puts you in familiar Silent Hill territory, which means foggy streets, fiendish puzzles and truly horrible monsters. But by infusing the uncanny, mythology and superstition with feminist themes, it is an intriguing slant on a much loved (and feared) series.2Hollow Knight: SilksongTeam Cherry, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, XboxEven the most tenacious player will feel like giving up at some point while trapped in Pharloom, a decaying realm full of desperate little bugs that was once a gleaming religious capital. Here lie some truly wretched places: former farms now fetid swamps, dank underground caverns overgrown with moss and misery, grand halls now dust-covered and reverberating with foreboding. And of course there are the guardians of these places, from mind-rotted beast-tamers to corrupted pilgrims and bug-automatons, silk-poisoned creatures and the realm’s former rulers, who stand in the way of your progress. Silksong’s most forbidding foes take hours to overcome. Its worst places will entrap you in despair. But it is worth it, because of the awe-inspiring moments that you will experience along the way: the hard-won victories, those first steps into previously locked-off realms, the secret revelations that seem so personal it’s hard to believe that any of the game’s millions of other players could discover them the same way. An extraordinary game whose sometimes extreme difficulty is both a strength and a weakness.1Blue PrinceView image in fullscreenUnforgettably clever … Blue Prince.Photograph: Raw FuryDogubomb/Raw Fury, PC, PS5, XboxA young man inherits a mysterious mansion from his uncle: a sprawling pile whose layout changes every day. He needs only to find the secret 46th room, and the place is his for ever. The mansion turns out to be an education: on the personal history of the family that owned it, the mysterious forces that shaped it and the political climate of the wider world in which it is situated. But before you get anywhere near Blue Prince’s deeper mysteries, you must master its blueprints. Behind every door is a choice: do you draft a library? A hallway with several exits? A security room, a laboratory, a pool, a bedroom, a nursery, a drawing room? Each will have its own secrets to discover, a useful item or a key or a new piece of information that gets you ever closer to that elusive 46th room. And each might offer you a new path to the rest of the mansion, or locked doors that you haven’t the means to pass. Every day, with every new route that you carve through these rooms, every dead end you meet, your knowledge accumulates. By the time you do reach that final destination, you’ll have so many unanswered questions, you won’t be able to resist continuing. Blue Prince turns out to be an almost bottomless mystery, leaving you with pads full of notes, theories, numbers and names, lines from books that you want to remember and drawings of strange mechanisms. It is among the best puzzle games ever made: atmospheric and understated and unforgettably clever; still somehow able to show you something new even after tens of hours of patient exploration.Explore more on these topicsGames2025 in cultureNintendo Switch 2PlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The cameras follow every near breakdown and small win as the staff prepare.HRAll Her Fault9pm, Sky AtlanticA whole episode of flashback explains exactly what the deal is with Carrie (Sophia Lillis) and why she’d want to kidnap the Irvines’ child.

For the residents of a Seoul apartment complex, that means a race to the highest floor before tsunamis hit them all. This frantic end-of-the-world thriller may have you working out how long you can hold your breath, as Kim Da-mi’s scientist Gu An-na and her young son Jan-in (Kwon Eun-seong) struggle through the waters. But the presence of her AI tech firm’s security operative Son Hee-jo (Park Hae-soo) hints at a weirder plot twist to come.Simon WardellShell (Max Minghella, 2024),Paramount+In between seasons of The Handmaid’s Tale, Max Minghella directed his co-star Elisabeth Moss in another dystopian drama – this near-future horror about the pitfalls of chasing the perfect body. Moss plays Samantha, an actor who signs up for an anti-ageing skin treatment (derived, ominously, from lobsters). It’s run by a company owned by 68-year-old – though you wouldn’t know it – Zoe Shannon (Kate Hudson). In true The Substance fashion, it all goes badly wrong, as the film gives in to its B-movie sensibilities and becomes increasingly, entertainingly silly.SWMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning (Christopher McQuarrie, 2025),9.40am, 8pm, Sky Cinema PremiereIf this is the last we see of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt, then it will prove a fine farewell. The eighth adventure for the undercover agent returns him to the seemingly impossible battle against AI force the Entity, which has gained control of most of the world’s nuclear weapons. But the ins and outs of the plot are beside the point when you get to witness exhilarating action sequences such as Ethan’s dive into a sunken Russian submarine or a vertiginous fight on a biplane. Arguably the best scene is earlier on, when US military and political bigwigs are given an increasingly comical recap of Ethan’s rule-breaking exploits down the years, plus all his colleagues who have died in the process. It’s a superb encapsulation of the absurdity of the whole M:I enterprise – and why we love it so.SWLive sportChampionshipfootball: Swansea v Wrexham,7.30pm, Sky Sports Main EventA Welsh derby.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The planet-sized movie franchise of Avatar continues to spin massively in the cosmos – yet without affecting the tides in any other world. Maybe Avataristhe cosmos and its originatorJames Cameronis the new L Ron Hubbard; the creator, or rather prophet, of a new belief system involving big blue creatures with pointy ears that flap and twitch when they talk, to whom we will all one day be required to bow down when they float past. And while the rest of the cinema industry has quietly abandoned 3D without ever quite admitting it, theatres showing James Cameron’s giant new three-hour hunk of nonsense are still handing out the 3D specs to the customers.The first film was about human invaders seeking to exploit and colonise the weird tall blue Na’vi people in another galaxy for their mineral resources by piloting “avatar” replicants into their midst. One of these pilots was Cpl Jake Sully, played by Sam Worthington, who fell in love with Neytiri, played byZoe Saldaña, and stayed behind as a Na’vi – thus infuriating his commanding officer, Col Miles Quaritch, played by Stephen Lang, who since then has died in battle but is now resurrected as a Na’vi avatar, looking scarily as if Vinnie Jones had joined the Blue Man Group. Quaritch’s teen son Spider (Jack Champion) has turned against him and lives with Jake and Neytiri as their adoptive child. In the second film, the Na’vi people found a new world of water. Now in this third film they face the new element of … fire. For the proposed fourth and fifth films, they will presumably tackle earth and wind.View image in fullscreenWitchy … Varang (Oona Chaplin) in Avatar: Fire And Ash.Photograph: 20th Century Studios/PASo the Na’vi have come into contact with a new and apparently quite unexpected leader: Varang, played by Oona Chaplin, who provides the film with a kind of witchy sex interest. She is the leader of the Mangkwan clan, who live in a volcano and are possessed by the spirit of fire and ash, a fierce destructive belief that survival can only be achieved by dominance. The bullish Quaritch makes common cause with Varang in his need to divide and subdue the Na’vi and gain revenge over Jake, whose treachery he can’t forgive, and so he gives Varang weapons. The film makes it clear with a post-coital shot that they are having bedroom relations, to which the only response is a mixture of “wow” and “eww”.As ever, the look of this film is impressive and yet strange. Billions upon billions of pixels have been crunched to create its huge, infinitesimally detailed digital world. Like Middle-earth, it is probably the key to the franchise’s great success but, presented as it is in motion-smoothed high-definition, it looks to me like a “making of” featurette projected on to the white cliffs of Dover. And when ordinary human faces appear, they seem bizarrely out of context, as if Photoshopped in, like seeing American movie stars’ faces on a poster advertising a panto.Edie Falcoagain plays the general, her face set in an unvarying expression of pop-eyed annoyance at everything that presents itself to her senses. As an actor, she probably thinks it’s the only way to get through this. Jemaine Clement has a cameo that oddly humanises the film.What we are heading for is yet another mighty struggle between the Na’vi and the evil human invaders, the “pink-skins”, and (as ever) it needs to be conveniently resolved by calling on the assistance of huge undersea creatures whose presence certainly levels the playing field. There are, admittedly, some dramatic moments that prevent this thirdAvatarfrom being quite the bland screensaver the second one was: we get an Abraham-and-Isaac-type crisis that makes Jake question what leadership really is, and also a Holmes-v-Moriarty-at-the-Reichenbach-Falls-type confrontation. Yet audiences may find Quaritch’s decision-making a touch eccentric, and the beginning of the fourth film is now going to be bogged down with a long and contrived explanation about what happened to him. Avatar is as gigantically uninteresting and colossally impervious to criticism as ever: a vast, blank edifice that placidly repels objection.Avatar: Fire and Ash is out on 18 December in Australia and 19 December in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekAvatarJames CameronScience fiction and fantasy filmsAction and adventure filmsZoe SaldañaEdie FalcoreviewsShareReuse this content"

In a fertile underground rap scene, the Jamaican-Irish, Cambridge-via-Nottingham artist has cut through thanks to her command and vulnerability, as well as a sharp eye for bullshit. The track Main Characters (featuring Big Zuu), also from her recent mixtape Happiness from Agony, is a critique of the fake love and hollow posturing that saturates the music industry.She has the talent to cut through that kind of noise: on Happiness … she’s equally at ease going head-to-head with grime veteran Frisco on Hideout or trading verses with Keeya Keys on the hypnotic Yoga. And her genre-bending sound shifts nimbly from the urgent tension of State of the World to the UK garage pulse of The Bank. It’s a mixtape that refuses to settle, giving Jaya space to flex her versatility.There’s a softer side to her, too, one that marries the personal with the political. At the Abbey reflects on memory and identity over a shadowy MF Doom-like instrumental: “Poverty is relative, UK hoods looking dirty / One thing I gotta claim’s a mindset that’s sturdy.” Meanwhile, Nothing’s Changed closes the mixtape with unresolved yearning: “Shame that I don’t really know what I’m searching for / But still I keep searching.” It’s a snapshot of an artist still navigating her ascent – and a gripping trip to join her on.Sik FrydasThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenKeyah/Blu.Photograph: Publicity imageKeyah/Blu – RudolphChristmas’s blearier side comes through in the south Londoner’s sad-EDM thumper, which interpolates and updates Dancing on My Own as she observes “hot girls in the rave … he used to call me bunny”.LSKali Uchis – MuéveloAfter a demo of this uptempo dembow dancefloor hit-in-waiting went viral, Uchis has gone and done a full version: sure to bring a jolt of tropical heat to any woozy, boozy Christmas party you find yourself in.BBTMore Eaze – Bad FriendThe first taste of Mari Rubio’s forthcoming LP is about alienation and inappropriate crushes – but the beatific warp of her processed pedal steel guitar and the fizzing, milky chimes offer a welcoming embrace.LSNiontay – Mark William Lewis FlowThe underground US rapper unexpectedly namechecks the British dream-pop singer-songwriter on this track from new mixtape Soulja Hate Repellant: relentless bass is offset with delicate Lewis-style guitar.BBTSleaford Mods – No Touch ft Sue Tompkins“Do you miss me?” sings the Life Without Buildings frontwoman on an extremely rare musical outing.

Everyone chips in, too, even the kids – well, they’ve got to earn their dinner somehow. Rather than shooing them off to watch cartoons while the adults do all the work, we make sure they’re hands-on in the kitchen alongside us, especially with the annual yule log. Not only is this a valuable life lesson, it also helps develop and strengthen our family culture. The children get to share in that sense of pride at a job well done, too, and everyone feels a part of the occasion. And isn’t that whatChristmasis all about?Red chicory with Cashel Blue, honey and walnutsView image in fullscreenAnna Haugh’s red chicory with Cashel Blue, honey and walnuts.Nibbles and canapes are Christmas essentials, but they don’t need to be fiddly or time-consuming. As with so many things in the kitchen, the best course of action is often just to keep things simple.Prep5 minCook10 minMakes12-18 canapesAbout 12 shelled walnuts2 headsred chicory100gCashel Blue, or other creamy blue cheese2 tbsp honeyCelery leaves, or flat-leaf parsley, to garnishHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then toast the walnuts in a baking tray for three minutes. Reove, leave to cool a little, then roughly chop.Cut the root off the end of each chicory, and separate the leaves. You want one leaf per canape, and sometimes they can be on the big side, so, for neatness’ sake, you may want to trim the leaves so they’re all roughly the same size. Well, it is Christmas, isn’t it?Arrange the chicory leaves cupped side up on a platter or wooden board, then crumble the cheese evenly between them. Scatter over the chopped walnuts, drizzle over the honey, then garnish with a few celery leaves and serve.Caramelised swede and honey soup (AKA Christmas Day soup)View image in fullscreen‘Definitely on the menu’: Anna Haugh’s Christmas Day soup (caramelised swede and honey soup).My sisters and I usually start planning Christmas from about August, and one summer I asked my sister Sarah what she was making that year. She responded: “Christmas Day soup, obviously!” I was intrigued as to what this magical soup might be, but she looked at me oddly: “Anna, it’syoursoup. You made it years ago, and your niece says it isn’t Christmas Day dinner without it.” It’s my turn to host this year, and this will 100% be on the menu.Prep15 minCook50 minServes41 medium swede(about 500g)2 tbsp vegetable oil, or other neutral oil3 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped40g honey, or to taste500ml milk100ml double cream20g hazelnuts, chopped, to garnish10g poppy seeds, to garnish10g black sesame seeds, to garnishSea salt1 heaped tbsp room-temperature butter½ small bunch each flat-leaf parsley and chives, choppedPeel the swede, then chop it into roughly even 5cm chunks. Heat a large pot, add the oil, then fry the swede, stirring often, for about five minutes, or until it’s golden brown all over. Add the garlic, cook, stirring for a minute, then add the honey and stir until it bubbles and starts to go golden brown.Add 500ml just-boiled water, simmer for 10 minutes, then pour in the milk and cream, and bring slowly to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer and cook for about 15 minutes, until you can squash the swede with the back of a spoon.Meanwhile, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the nuts and seeds on an oven tray, roast for four minutes, then remove, roughly chop and leave to cool.It’s now time to blend the soup – you want it to be as smooth as possible, so a jug blender is your best bet. Once the soup is pureed, taste it for salt and the sweetness of the honey, and adjust as required. Pour the soup back in the pan and reheat to a bare simmer.To serve, rub the room-temperature butter over the base of four soup bowls, and sweep it up the sides with a pastry brush or thumb. Sprinkle the toasted nuts and seeds into the bowls and add a scattering of parsley and chives. Pour the hot soup into a big jug and pour into the bowls at the table.Turkey wellingtonView image in fullscreenThat’s a wrap: Anna Haugh’s turkey wellington.Build this the day before you want to cook it, so on the day the only job is to pop it in the oven. If you’re not a turkey fan, some sausagemeat sandwiched between two chicken breasts is a good alternative, though it might need an extra five to 10 minutes in the oven.Prep20 minBrine2 hrMarinateOvernightRest1 hr+Cook1 hr 30 minServes4For the mushroom mix60g butter2 shallots, peeled and finely diced5 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped200g chestnut mushrooms(use a mixture, if possible), chopped400g tinned butter beans,drained and crushed1 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon1-2 dashes soy sauce, to taste, or saltFor the wellingtonSalt and black pepper400g piece turkey breast(about 11cm long x 8cm wide)2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushedFinely grated zest of 1 lemonA few thyme sprigs, leaves picked3 tbsp vegetable oil, or duck fat for extra flavour2-4 cooked pancakes, homemade or shop-bought2320g rolls puff pastryPlain flour, to dust2 egg yolks, beaten, for sealing and glazingThe day before you want to build the wellington, give the turkey breast a quick brine. Make a 5% salt:water solution in a big pot, drop in the turkey, making sure it’s completely submerged, and leave for two hours.Drain the turkey and pat it dry with kitchen paper. Put the garlic, lemon zest and thyme in a medium non-reactive dish or tray, then put in the turkey breast and rub all over to coat. Cover and pop in the fridge overnight.The next day, get the mushroom mix made as early as you can, because you want it fully cooked and dry. Melt the butter in a large frying pan on a low heat, then gently saute the shallots for about five minutes, until soft but not coloured. Add the garlic, cook for a minute or two, until it no longer smells raw, then add the mushrooms and a pinch of salt, and cook low and slow, stirring occasionally, for about 25 minutes, until all the moisture has gone from the pan. Take off the heat, leave to cool, then stir in the crushed butter beans and tarragon, and season with soy sauce to taste.Heat the oil or duck fat in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat, then sear the turkey breast, turning often, for a couple of minutes on each side, until nice and golden all over, and set aside.Arrange the pancakes in an overlapping line on a chopping board, then spread the mushroom and butter bean mix all over the top. You’re going to roll everything up a bit like a big burrito, so, depending on the size of your turkey breast, you may not need all four pancakes. Lay the browned turkey on top of the mushroom mixture, then roll up in the pancakes so it’s fully enclosed. Wrap in clingfilm and put in the fridge for 40 minutes, to rest and firm up.Lay out one sheet of the puff pastry on a well-floured worktop. Unwrap and discard the clingfilm around the pancake-wrapped turkey, lay it in the centre of the pastry, then cut the pastry to leave a 3-4cm exposed border all around the turkey; save the offcuts. Brush the exposed pastry with egg glaze, then lay the second sheet of pastry on top of the turkey and use floured hands to slide it down and tuck it in neatly between the turkey and the pastry base. Roll to wrap up completely, then press all around the joins, ideally with the back of a floured fork, to seal. Neatly trim away any excess pastry, then re-roll all the pastry offcuts and cut out pretty little Christmas designs to stick on top of the wellington (another job for the kids). Egg wash the outside of the wellington, transfer it to a greased and lined oven tray, and put in the fridge to rest and firm up.Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½. Bake the wellington for 45-50 minutes, keeping an eye on the colour of the pastry; if it starts browning too much too soon, turn down the oven accordingly. The wellington is ready when the centre of the turkey reaches 65C, so, if need be, cover it loosely with foil and keep roasting until it hits that core temperature. Remove and leave to rest for 10 minutes, by which time the centre of turkey should have reached 70C.To serve, I usually just cut the wellington into four large, showstopping slices.Red wine gravyView image in fullscreenSomething for everyone: Anna Haugh’s red wine gravy – don’t add any meat roasting juices until you’ve set aside some gravy for the vegetarians and vegans at your table.This is definitely something you could make ahead of time and freeze. Defrost in the fridge overnight, then gently reheat and bring to a boil just before serving. This gravy is vegan up to the point when you add the meat juices, so it’s very useful when you’ve got a whole crowd to keep happy. As a side note, if I ever handed my family a red wine gravy without mushrooms and onions in it, I’d be frogmarched out of the house.Prep10 minCook30 minServes4-62-3tbsp vegetable oil2 onions, peeled and chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 large glasses red wine(about 500ml)1 vegetable stock cube3-4 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked2tbsp plain flour200g chestnut mushrooms, cut into quartersSalt and black pepper, to tastePut two tablespoons of oil in a frying pan on a medium heat, add the onions and saute, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until golden brown. Add the garlic and fry for a couple of minutes more. Pour in the red wine, then leave to bubble and reduce by two-thirds.Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock cube in 800ml boiling water. Add the stock and thyme to the onion mix and bring to a boil.In a small bowl or cup, mix the flour with two tablespoons of water to make a paste, then stir this into the gravy to thicken. Don’t add any salt just yet: when you add the meat juices later, they might already be salty, so always wait until you’ve added them before adjusting the seasoning of the gravy. Blitz the gravy until smooth, then leave to cool, (at this stage, if you’re making it ahead, freeze in a suitable container).Just before serving, slowly reheat the gravy to a gentle boil. Meanwhile, heat a little oil in a frying pan, then add the mushrooms and fry on a high heat, stirring, for about five minutes, until nicely browned all over. Stir the fried mushrooms into the blitzed gravy, then set aside enough of it for the non-meat eaters at the table. Pour any resting juices from the meat into the meat-eaters’ gravy, then taste and adjust the seasoning, and serve hot.Cranberry relishView image in fullscreenEasy does it: Anna Haugh’s cranberry relish.Listen, this sounds as if it’s so easy that it can’t be that good, but it is.Prep10 minCook20 minServes4-62 banana shallots, peeled and finely chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed200g dried cranberries, roughly chopped1 pinch sugar1 pinch salt2-3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked, to servePut the shallots, garlic and dried cranberries in a pan, add 200ml water, bring to a boil, then leave to simmer for 10-15 minutes. Add a pinch each of sugar and salt to taste, leave to cool and it’s ready; I like to stir in some fresh thyme leaves at the end. Decant into a bowl and serve at room temperature.Sprout and hispi cabbage slawView image in fullscreenShredded treat: Anna Haugh’s sprout and hispi cabbage slaw.This is simplicity itself, and even better on Boxing Day in an epic sandwich with leftover turkey and ham.Prep15 minServes41 tbsp honey50ml white-wine vinegar200glarge brussels sprouts(the biggest you can find, ideally), very finely sliced or grated½ headhispi cabbage(about 250g), very thinly sliced50ml olive oil½ tsp sea saltFinely grated zest of ½ orange1 tsp caraway seeds, or cumin seeds, or chilli flakes or finely sliced fresh red chilli1 tsp pink peppercorns, crushedMix the honey and vinegar in a small cup, until smooth. Put everything else in a big bowl and toss to mix – the salt will start to break down the cabbage and sprouts, giving them a lovely, just-wilted texture. Drain off any liquid from the bottom of the bowl, then pour over the honey dressing to taste, toss again to coat and serve.Yule logView image in fullscreenRoll up, roll up: Anna Haugh’s yule log.The kids love this at Christmas, so I usually make the chocolate swiss roll and icing ahead of time, then leave them to design it themselves without any adults breathing down their necks. They never disappoint.Prep10 minCook40 minServes4250g unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing500g icing sugar85g cocoa powder, plus extra to finish45g room-temperature milk4 eggs100g caster sugar65g self-raising flour1 pinch saltI like to make the butter cream first, so that when I’m ready to roll, I don’t have to rush it. In a medium bowl, beat the butter and half the icing sugar until light and fluffy,then add the rest of the icing sugar, 40g of the cocoa and the room-temperature milk and stir very well to combine.Now for the sponge. Grease and line a lipped baking tray, and heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the eggs and caster sugar in a bowl, and beat vigorously until very well combined. Sift in the flour, salt and the remaining 45g cocoa powder, and fold in gently but thoroughly.Scrape the batter into the lined tray, spread it out evenly with a spatula and bake for nine minutes, until risen, evenly baked and a skewer poked into the centre comes out clean. Remove, leave to cool slightly, then turn out on to a large sheet of greaseproof paper and leave to cool a little more. While it’s still just warm, roll the sponge into the classic swiss roll shape, then, once it has cooled almost to room temperature, unravel it, spread it all over with the butter cream, then roll up again carefully.Keep any leftover butter cream for decorating the top – we like to spread some on the log and drag a fork through it to recreate that traditional bark effect. I like to serve this topped with a nice dusting of extra cocoa powder, too.Anna Haugh is chef/patron ofMyrtle, London SW1, and co-presenter of MasterChef on BBC OneExplore more on these topicsFoodChristmasChristmas food and drinkStarterMain courseSide dishesDessertrecipesShareReuse this content"

So, to help you navigate the festive feasting, we asked 16 top chefs and cooks to tell us what they buy or make to give to the people brave enough to invite them over.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Reassuringly, it turns out that even the most decorated chefs love a Ferrero Rocher, a nice glass of sherry, a good mince pie and a decent cheeseboard at this time of year. And everyone is attached to their own traditions, whether that’s the apple tart Matthew Ryle’s family loves in place of Christmas pudding, the hot chocolate-and marshmallow kit Yotam Ottolenghi’s kids can never resist, or Sabrina Ghayour’s favourite truffle-infused cheddar.‘In Italy, smoked salmon without Russian salad wasn’t Christmas’Giorgio LocatelliView image in fullscreenLocatelli’s smoked salmon with Russian salad and olive oil.“From a very young age, I helped out in my family’s restaurant in Lombardy every Christmas Day,” says Giorgio Locatelli. “And when we finished at five o’clock in the afternoon, everyone would go to the local pastry shop, because it was the biggest place and we would all have a meal there.” There was always smoked salmon. Today, if Locatelli is asked to bring food to a Christmas gathering, he takessalmon made by the Smokin’ Brothers(£8.90,smokin-brothers.com). “It is unbelievably good – the three brothers are very careful about sourcing quality fish.” He likes to serve it withRussian salad. “In Italy, smoked salmon without Russian salad wasn’t Christmas.” His base ingredients are always cooked potatoes, peas and carrots dressed in mayo. “But it’s versatile: you can add chicken, you can make it with pumpkin, you can make it vegan. I like to drain large gherkins to get rid of the vinegar, and then dice them into it.” He would never go to someone’s house without a bottle of his ownolive oil(£25 for 500ml,shop.nationalgallery.org.uk)for the host. “Olive oil is such a good present, because it lasts. When they’re using it in February, they will remember you.”Giorgio Locatelli’snew restaurantis at the National Gallery in London‘Jamon is my tradition – my mum is 92 and has a slice every day’José PizarroView image in fullscreenPizarro’s leg of jamon.“It is my tradition to take awhole leg of jamonto my mum’s house,” says chef José Pizarro, who grew up in Extremadura, Spain. “My mum is 92 and she has a slice of jamon every day. A leg weighs about 8kg, and in five days, between the 13 of us, it will be gone.” It’s £690.50 for a whole leg (£26.50 for 70g,shop.josepizarro.com); try Waitrose’s Jamon Iberico de Bellota (£14.55 for 100g,waitrose.com) for a budget option.View image in fullscreenTurrón (left) and Matusalem.Photograph: Steven Joyce/The GuardianView image in fullscreenValdespino Inocente (left) and Tio Pepe fino.Photograph: Steven Joyce/The Guardian“Another thing I always, always take to Christmas,” says Pizarro, “is sherry. As an aperitif I love,Tio Pepe fino(£12.75,thewhiskyexchange.com), or for something a little more expensive,Valdespino Inocente(£20.95,leaandsandeman.co.uk), which is also a fino and is aged for 10 years under a layer of yeast called flor, so it’s very dry. And then I loveMatusalem(£28.95,thewhiskyexchange.com), which is a blend of pedro ximénez sherry and oloroso. Since it is sweet and nutty, it goes very well with turrón, a Spanish version ofnougat made with almonds(£9.25 for 125g,brindisa.com).”Jose Pizarro’s latest restaurant isLoloinLondon SE1‘My sons make a beeline for hot chocolate’Yotam Ottolenghi“It’s helpful to have easy-to-rustle-up snacks and treats over the holidays that still feel special,” says Yotam Ottolenghi. “For a quick canape, I brushcocktail sausages with mysticky date and tamarind sauce(£4.75,ottolenghi.co.uk). It makes them glossy and tangy. I always make a big batch ofspiced nuts: 100g cashews, 100g macadamias, 120g pecans, 60g skin-on almonds and 80g pumpkin seeds roasted at 170C (150F fan)/325F/gas 3 for 15 minutes with a tablespoon of sunflower seeds, two of nigella seeds, three of sunflower oil, two of honey, a teaspoon of fine salt and the leaves from two sprigs of rosemary.

While they’re busy with that, I’ll be experimenting with a cocktail fromAlice Lascelles’ bookThe Cocktail Edit (£18.98, Quadrille) – her recipes have just the right mix of classic and playful. Once I have had my fill, a glass ofBotivo(£27.50,widely available) and soda with a wheel of orange is there for a non-alcoholic moment.”‘A brine mix to give turkey a flavour boost’Julie Lin“I like to take something people will use,” says Scottish-Malaysian chef Julie Lin. “I’ve been making adry turkey brine mixto give to friends in advance: three tablespoons of salt, one tablespoon of MSG, one tablespoon of sugar, one tablespoon of black pepper, one teaspoon of garlic powder, one teaspoon of onion powder, a sprig of rosemary, chopped finely, and one teaspoon of smoked paprika. Then I put it in little jars with instructions for how to use it: pat the turkey dry, rub the brine under the skin and over the entire bird, including the cavity (you may not need it all). Set it on a rack and refrigerate, uncovered for 24–48 hours. (Do not rinse.) Then roast. Salt and MSG penetrate deeply, boosting moisture and flavour while the uncovered chill dries the skin for superior crispness.”View image in fullscreenFrom left: Lin’s turkey brine mix, Fettercairn whisky and Sama Sama tamarind and lemongrass sour.Lin also makesSichuan pepper chocolate truffles: tweak your favourite recipe by stirring in one teaspoon of finely ground Sichuan pepper and a pinch of salt while the mixture is still liquid. Allow to cool until just firm, then use a small spoon to scoop out bitesize servings of the ganache. Working quickly, shape into balls then roll in cocoa powder, chocolate flakes or toasted sesame. Chill. “Pop them in a tin and it’s a lovely gift to arrive with.”To drink, Lin is all about whisky and beer. “Much of the Scottish whisky industry is made up of men saying you must drink your fiery drams straight, but I’ve been giving friendswhisky from Fettercairn(£52,fettercairnwhisky.com), which is delicious and not horribly peaty. I created a tamarind and lemongrass sour with Drygate in Glasgow, calledSama Sama(£2.50 for 330ml,drygate.com).”Sama Sama: ComfortFood fromMy Malaysian-ScottishKitchenby Julie Linis out now‘This black truffle cheddar is like crack’Sabrina Ghayour“I like giving panettone, but making them from scratch is hell in a hand basket – I did it once and never again,” says chef Sabrina Ghayour. “I usually buypandoro(Muzzi, £30.99,souschef.co.uk), which don’t contain candied fruit – not everyone likes it – and, like panettone, they’re great because they last for ages and don’t steal the limelight if someone has made a wonderful cake or pudding. As a chef, the last thing I want to do is arrive with something that outshines anything else.

If you want to spend a bit more, go forBillecart-Salmon leRoséchampagne(£75,majestic.co.uk). I never used to like blue cheeses much, but now I’m addicted toColston Bassett’s blues(from £4, widely available), and I bloody love Godminster cheeses, both the normal cheddar and theirblack truffle cheddar(from £7, widely available). I usually veto anything with truffle added to it, but this is like crack.”Sabrina Ghayour’s latest book isPersiana Easy‘A gorgeous trifle that’s super easy to make’Georgie Mullen“I like to give people things they can eat pretty much immediately,” says Georgie Mullen. “ I do apomegranate and blood orange trifle with a white chocolate custard: the colours are beautiful so it looks gorgeous, but it’s super easy because I use shop-bought custard. At Christmas, especially if you’re making something as a gesture for someone else, you don’t want to cause yourself too much faff.”View image in fullscreenFrom left: Mullen’s pomegranate and blood orange trifle, tawny port and cheese scones.First, make the jelly by boiling together 710ml pomegranate juice, two tablespoons of caster sugar, the juice of half a lemon and 12g (two sachets) of Vege-Gel. Remove from the heat and cool for 15 minutes. Slice 400g madeira cake into thin pieces, then brush with 35ml Cointreau. Use the cake to line a glass bowl big enough for the whole trifle and pour over any remaining Cointreau. Peel and slice four blood oranges, removing any pips. Arrange the slices against the glass above the cake; any that don’t fit around the sides can lay on top of the cake. Ladle the jelly over, letting it come up around the sides of the orange slices. Set in the fridge for three to four hours. Combine 750ml good-quality custard with 300g melted white chocolate then pour it over the jelly and smooth over the top. Return to the fridge for at least an hour, or until serving. When ready to serve, whip 500ml of double cream into soft peaks. Spread roughly over the custard and sprinkle with pomegranate seeds and a small handful of chopped pistachio.If she’s not cooking, Mullen pairs drinks with food as Christmas contributions, such as10-year-old tawnyport(from £25, widely available) with good-quality dark chocolate. “It’s nice to bring something as a set: I givecheese sconeswith a hunk of cheddar, some butter and a jar of quick pickled apples.” For the pickle, boil together 125ml white vinegar, two tablespoons caster sugar, a bay leaf, a cinnamon stick and 10 peppercorns, then pour over one large eating apple, peeled and thinly sliced.

This is her mum’s recipe: “In a large bowl, beat 175g caster sugar with 275ml olive oil and 250g soft butter or vegan margarine. Stir in 100ml brandy together with the juice and zest of two oranges and one lemon. Sift 1kg self-raising flour with three teaspoons of baking powder and add it to the oil mixture a cupful at a time, beating well after each addition, until the mixture becomes firm and manageable. Preheat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Take a tablespoon of mixture and shape into an oval. Using your index and middle fingers, make a slight ridge along the length of each shortcake. Place on to lightly greased baking sheets spaced 2.5cm apart. Bake for 30–35 minutes (in two batches) or until risen and golden brown. Leave to cool. Place 275ml water, 75g sugar, 250ml honey and one teaspoon of whole cloves into a saucepan and boil for five minutes, removing any froth. Discard the cloves. Mix 75g chopped walnuts with two teaspoons of ground cinnamon on a large plate.

Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the lentils are tender, cooked through and pass into total mush. As they cook, stir them pretty constantly to encourage them to further break down into a coarse paste (not watery or soupy). This should take 20–25 minutes. Once the lentils are the perfect dip texture, remove from the heat. Add two tablespoons of lemon juice, two tablespoons of olive oil and two cloves of garlic, grated. Season with salt, plus more lemon juice if you want. Let cool. Fry two finely sliced cloves of garlic and 10 sage leaves in two tablespoons of olive oil until crisp. Spoon the toasted garlic-herb mixture over to serve.The full lentil dip recipeappears inSomething from Nothingby Alison Roman, out now‘Chocolate salamis are perfect to snack on while watching a Christmas movie’Ixta Belfrage“I often bring things I’m well known for making,” says Ixta Belfrage, who has Mexican and Brazilian heritage. “Likepink pickled onions, which have a zingy crunch and can jazz up vegetables or go on a crostino, and work well with smoked salmon, eggs and meats.

Add 90g unsalted butter, 100g mint dark chocolate and 130g milk chocolate, all chopped, and cook, stirring now and then, until melted and combined. Remove from the heat and stir in 75ml whole milk and one tablespoon of espresso coffee until smooth. Fold in 200g ginger nut biscuits, chopped, and 100g roasted salted and chopped pecans, then transfer to the fridge for 25 minutes, until cooled but not set. Get a large sheet of greaseproof paper ready, and spoon the cooled chocolate mix on to it. Use the paper to help you roll out the chocolate into a 30cm x 6cm log or salami shape. Twist the ends of the paper to enclose the mix, then put on a tray and refrigerate until set – about five hours. Remove from the fridge a few times during that period, and roll again in its wrapping, so it keeps its shape. Sift one tablespoon of icing sugar on to a large piece of greaseproof paper, then unwrap the log directly on to it. Sift another tablespoon of icing sugar on top of the salami, then rub the icing sugar all over the sides. Arrange on a wooden board, cut into slices and serve.

Peel six pink lady apples, cut in half and remove the cores, then leave to dry at room temperature for an hour, if you have time. Put 100g soft butter in a nonstick, ovenproof 20cm frying pan and sprinkle 100g caster sugar on top. Place a cinnamon stick in the centre and two star anise on either side. Neatly arrange the apples on top, standing them up to pack them all into the pan. Roll 500g of puff pastry to the thickness of a pound coin. Cut a disc out of the pastry about an inch bigger than the pan. Lay over the apples, and tuck in the pastry edges around them. Prick all over with a fork and cut a small hole in the centre. Put the pan over a high heat for 5-10 minutes. This starts the cooking process; you are making the caramel in the pan, so should be able to see through the small cut in the pastry when the caramel is brown and ready. Place the pan in the oven for 50 minutes. Once cooked, leave to rest in the pan for 30 minutes before turning out.View image in fullscreenRyle’s tarte tatin and baked whole vacherin with pigs in blankets.“Another great centrepiece is to give someone avacherin(£25,paxtonandwhitfield.co.uk), which they can bake and can treat like a fondue,” says Ryle. “I like to dip leftover pigs in blankets in it.”Matthew Ryle’s new cookbook,French Classics:Easy andElevatedDishes toCook atHome, is out now;maisonfrancois.london‘It has to be pavlova’Helen GohView image in fullscreenGoh’s pavlova with poached pears.“I didn’t even know there was such a thing as Christmas until we moved to Australia when I was 11,” says Helen Goh, who is from Malaysia. “But when we caught on, we celebrated with all the trimmings.

Make one by baking a large meringue, about 23cm across, in a low oven for a couple of hours, then top with 400ml double cream that has been whipped together with 100g mascarpone. “For my Iranian friends, I top it with pears poached with saffron, and I’ll spike the cream almost imperceptibly with rose water, and scatter with pistachios and pomegranate.”Helen Goh’s latest book,Baking and the Meaning of Life, is out now‘Don’t want to cook?
