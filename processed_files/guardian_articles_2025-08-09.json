And now she’s gone’: how one mother lost her daughter to mental illnessStudying in London before taking up a high-flying job in New York, Naina Mishra seemed set for a bright future – until she began retreating from friends and family into a paranoid spiral even her mother couldn’t break. What does her story reveal about the dangers of young adult estrangement?Jenny KleemanSat 9 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTShareNaina Mishra seemed to turn up at the yoga studio in Euston, north-west London, out of nowhere. She wasn’t referred by anyone; she didn’t come with a friend. A 21-year-old woman of Indian heritage with an American accent who grew up in Hong Kong and had recently arrived in London, Naina just “fell in” off the street in January 2022, say her yoga teachers, Hamish Hendry and Louise Newton. But it became part of her daily life. Every morning, she returned to practise there.Chatting after class, they learned that Naina had just graduated from university in the US and had been interning at the investment bank Goldman Sachs and the consulting firm McKinsey. She was studying in London before beginning a high-flying job as a business analyst at McKinsey in New York in the autumn.“She was really focused,” Newton remembers. “She would say, ‘My goals are to be a CEO,to have three children, to be married.’ She was really clear on what the future was going to hold for her.” By May 2022, she had left London to embark on her next chapter.But 18 months later, in November 2023, Naina was back – and she was a different person. “She’d do her posture, then zone out,” Hendry says. When he asked if she was having intrusive thoughts, she told him she didn’t know. “She was like a shadow of herself,” Newton says. “She was here, but out of it, just very slightly.”Throughout 2024, Naina kept changing address. She began to say strange things. “She was determined she was going to live in a specific house on Highbury Fields and said she’d contacted the owner to say that she wanted to live there,” Newton tells me. After a conversation with Hendry about a high-end yoga-wear brand, she told them she had bought every item in the range. One day, Naina announced she’d bought the entire range of Jellycat stuffed toys.Then, in August 2024, Naina messaged Hendry to say people were following her and she had changed her phone number and was going to have to change her name. “I don’t know anyone outside the shala [yoga studio],” she wrote, “so on the rare occasion someone you don’t know asks about me, they should be sent away.”Hendry and Newton say they “signposted” her to mental health services, but Naina kept changing her phone number, and after the second or third time, they lost contact with her. Just as Naina fell into the studio out of nowhere, she seemed to disappear into thin air.But somebodywastrying to track Naina down: Vandana Luthra, the mother Naina had told Hendry and Newton was dead. The story of Naina Mishra’s final year in London is one of family estrangement and mental health crisis. It shows how ill-equipped we are at recognising the signs of mental illness, and how powerless parents can be if their young adult children say they want to be left alone. For months, Vandana had been going to extraordinary lengths to find Naina, desperately clutching at every straw because she believed her daughter’s life was at risk. And she was right. By October 2024, Naina was dead.Vandana speaks to me for many hours, over several days, from her sister’s home in Connecticut, US. She’s on sabbatical from a finance job in Hong Kong while her son has psychiatric treatment here. There’s a history of mental illness in the family, Vandana says – Naina’s grandmother is schizophrenic; her great-grandmother and great-aunt lived with mental health problems.“Naina always wanted to do things on her own,” Vandana says. “She was someone who did everything herself.” As a child, Naina loved baking cookies, reading books, pretending to be a ninja with her younger brother. But she spoke very little. A teacher at her primary school in Mumbai once called Vandana in to discuss why Naina was so quiet. “She said, ‘You should really quit your job and be there for your child.’” Vandana pauses, ruminating on this memory. “These things stay in my head now, because I don’t have her any more.”The family moved from Mumbai to Singapore in 2011, then Hong Kong in 2014, by which time Vandana was divorced and bringing up her children as a single mother. She and Naina used to be very close, Vandana says. “By the time she was in high school, she was taller than me. She used to call me Little Mommy.” Gauri Nafrey, a family friend, had known Naina since she was a baby. “As a teenager, Naina was a kind of A-lister: the dress, the makeup, the hair, everything was beautiful,” she tells me. “A complete go-getter: strong, smart, doing really well academically – the works.” After spending summer camp in the US aged 13, Naina decided she was going to settle in New York. At 16, she’d set her mind on a job with McKinsey. She got a place at Northwestern, a competitive university on the outskirts of Chicago, majoring in economics and business entrepreneurship.View image in fullscreenNaina in 2011, the year her family moved from India to Singapore.Photograph: courtesy of Vandana LuthraIn January 2019, during her first year of college, Naina rang Vandana to tell her she had been sexually assaulted by someone the previous September, when she had just arrived in her dorm. “Obviously it was shocking.” Vandana’s eyes are wide. She was at work when she took the call. She walked away from her desk to try to get some privacy. Questions began tumbling out. Were there condoms? Could she have caught diseases? Naina said she managed to escape before it got that far. How could this have happened, Vandana asked.“Those questions fell badly,” she concedes. “She said, ‘You’re accusing me.’ I was not – I was in a state of shock, just processing that sequence of events.” But Naina hung up and they didn’t speak for a few days. (Naina made a formal complaint about the student who was suspended from college for a year.)After that, Vandana says, Naina began to change. “She was much more depressed. She kept talking about rape on campus – she wanted me to read everything about it.” Vandana was used to regularly exchanging messages and having calls with her daughter, but now Naina would sometimes go silent for days on end. From halfway across the world, Vandana tried to stay in her daughter’s life. She got one of Naina’s flatmates to help coordinate a surprise birthday party for her 21st in 2021, ordering champagne and food from a restaurant Naina liked. She and Naina still spoke, but not as much.The trip to London in 2022 was a bit of a jolly that allowed Naina to maintain her student visa before starting work at McKinsey in the autumn. She deliberately picked a literature course that required very little academic work. She did a wine course and a Thai cooking course, as well as all the yoga. “Rich people things,” her mother says, drily. Vandana didn’t mind funding it all – Naina was getting to enjoy her youth and freedom – but wishes she’d paid for it directly. “Then I would have known the places she went to.”Nafrey and her family had been living in London since 2016, and she invited Naina over one night. “I had not seen her for six, seven years. She was completely different from the Naina I remember: soft-spoken, self-deprecating, nothing fancy about her clothing, no makeup,” she says. “I was, like, what happened to you?”Naina didn’t mention it to Nafrey, but she had been having sessions with a London-based psychotherapist. In February 2022, she created a Google Drive account and asked Vandana to send over all the pictures she had of her as a very young child. Once they had been received, Naina told Vandana she didn’t want to talk to her for a while. “I am undergoing a difficult treatment for my PTSD and chronic pain. Due to the difficult nature of the treatment, I’m unable to speak with you at this time,” she texted. It was the first time Naina had mentioned PTSD to her mother. (The therapist Vandana says Naina saw in London did not want to participate in this piece, neither confirming nor denying that Naina had seen her, citing patient confidentiality.)When they finally spoke, it was May 2022. In a three-minute phone call, Naina told Vandana that, when she was three years old, two strangers had raped her in the bathroom of her grandparents’ house in a suburb of Delhi. Vandana was bewildered by this. “My children have never been left alone. There are no strange men coming into my mother’s bathroom. The whole thing was just not plausible.” She knew she’d alienated Naina the last time her daughter had confided in her, and tried to handle things differently. “I said, ‘I’m sorry this happened. How come I didn’t know about it?’ And she said, ‘I couldn’t tell you because you were a bad mother.’” When Vandana asked more questions, Naina hung up.I was in full panic mode, trying to find her: if Naina can leave her dream job, her dream city, something’s very wrongThey kept in touch, mainly over WhatsApp and email, but the abuse was never mentioned again. “My plan was whenever I saw her next, I was going to sit her down and talk to her about it … ” Her voice trails off. She didn’t see Naina again until four days before her death.After leaving London in 2022, Naina had to sort out the rental agreement for her New York apartment. She insisted she didn’t want anyone to act as a guarantor and begged her father, who was living in Mumbai,and her mother to put enough money into her bank account to reassure her landlord. By this point, Naina’s brother was in mental health crisis, disappearing for 10 days at a time. “There was so much on my plate, so much shit going on all around me,” Vandana says, bitterly. “She’s never blown her money. So I was, like, all right, just give it to her.” About $140,000 (£103,000) went into Naina’s account. “That’s the mistake I made.” Vandana screws up her eyes. “Once she had that huge amount of money in the bank, she cut contact.”Naina changed her phone number. She stopped replying to her mother’s emails, then changed her email address altogether. Vandana tried to message Naina’s friends on Facebook and LinkedIn, only to find almost all of them had blocked her. One replied, saying Naina was thriving in New York. The books Vandana read on family estrangement and the psychologist she consulted in Hong Kong all said the same thing: give her space and she might reconnect.For a year and a half, Vandana tried to let Naina be. But it went against every fibre of her being. When a friend was due to visit New York in early January 2024, Vandana asked her to reach out to Naina and take her for coffee. Naina replied saying she wasn’t in New York any more – she’d left McKinsey and moved back to London. “Then I was in full panic mode,” Vandana says. “If Naina can leave her dream job, her dream city, and go to London, something’s very wrong. That was when I unleashed everything possible I could think of to try to find her.”Naina did not see a mental health professional during the last year of her life. She had no documented mental health issues, beyond the PTSD diagnosed in New York in 2022. But Vandana’s experience with her son’s psychosis left her convinced Naina must be in crisis. Reluctantly, Vandana says, she hired three London-based private investigators (she estimates she spent at least £6,000 on their services). She tried to reach out to Naina’s closest friends once again, emailing them at their work addresses, or appealing to their parents to pass on her messages. The mother of one of Naina’s high school friends refused, saying if her daughter had chosen to block Vandana, she would “respect her boundaries”. The only friend still willing to speak to Vandana revealed that Naina seemed to have cut herself off from everyone. She had quit social media; she wasn’t in any of the pictures from a close friend’s wedding.Through an acquaintance at McKinsey, Vandana learned that Naina had spent half the year she’d been working at the company signed off on disability leave. She contacted McKinsey’s director of HR, explaining that she was estranged from Naina but concerned for her mental wellbeing, and asked if they could share the reason Naina was on leave, and anything about her current whereabouts. Vandana was told privacy laws prevented them from giving her this information. (McKinsey declined to comment for this piece.)Only one of the three private investigator agencies could find out anything about Naina’s life in London. By mid-January 2024, they had provided an email address, a UK phone number and an address in Walthamstow, east London. Vandana immediately packed a suitcase with a change of clothes and food she knew Naina loved – paneer, pesto, sun-dried tomatoes – boarded a flight and headed straight there.It was a small house. “Such a dingy place,” Vandana says. She learned the rooms were all rented on Airbnb, and Naina was no longer there. She checked into a nearby hotel, lay on the bed, and had a panic attack. “The walls and the ceiling were collapsing on me. But I just had to keep trying.”View image in fullscreenVandana Luthra at her home in Hong Kong …View image in fullscreen… and a photograph there of Naina. Photographs: Chan Long Hei/The GuardianA hotel receptionist let Vandana borrow her phone to ring Naina’s number. Naina answered, but hung up when she heard Vandana’s voice. The receptionist suggested asking the police to do a welfare check. They were reluctant, Vandana says, but she begged them. “I said, ‘As a mother, I know something is wrong with my daughter. Please hear me out.’” When an officer contacted Naina, she informed them her mother was dead. “That’s what they told me,” Vandana says. “I said, ‘No, that’s not right – I have my passport with me, her birth certificate, you can see my name on it.’” Vandana returned home, her bags still packed with food.In a statement, the Metropolitan police said, “When officers attended Ms Mishra’s address she told them she did not wish to have any contact with the person who had reported the concerns. As she was an adult and officers had no concern for her welfare, her wishes were respected.” It was a rationale Vandana would hear again and again: Naina was over 18, she was not in obvious crisis, she had a right to privacy.A missing people’s charity told Vandana they couldn’t do anything without a police report. The two lawyers she consulted said there was no chance of her getting any kind of guardianship over Naina without firm evidence that she was unable to take care of herself. The Indian consulate could not help. The therapist Naina had seen in London in 2022 refused to speak to her family without Naina’s consent. Vandana emailed two sisters the private investigator said were subletting a different flat to her daughter, enclosing a photo of her and Naina together. “Even if she does not want to talk to anyone, at least I should know she is safe,” Vandana wrote. The women replied saying Naina had left some time ago, they had never met her and were unnerved to have been tracked down like this. Increasingly desperate, Vandana returned to London and visited a nail salon Naina had recently reviewed online, asking staff to alert her if her daughter ever made another booking. They never did.How did nobody who interacted with Naina pick up on the fact that she was very unwell? You could see she was not OKVandana recruited old friends from India now living in the UK to be her eyes on the ground. As well as Nafrey, she reached out to Karuna Kapoor, whom she’d known for over 30 years but who had never met Naina. Every time the private investigator supplied a new address, Nafrey would travel from her home in Fulham, south-west London, to walk her dog around the property and see if she could spot Naina; Kapoor would travel from her home in St Albans in Hertfordshire to do the same. Naina’s father travelled to London and spent hours waiting outside one address, only to learn Naina was no longer there. Vandana paid a domestic worker £20 an hour to keep another property under surveillance.If Naina was in a paranoid state of mind, she had good reason to be: shewasbeing followed and tracked. Vandana accepts this, but feels she had little choice. “I wanted to see what she was doing in London. If she was all good – if she had a job, a social network – I’d have let her be.” Vandana shakes her head: “2024 was a year I did not sleep. There was so much stress and helplessness. I was constantly thinking, what more I can do?”Then, on 19 October, when Vandana was at her parents’ home just outside Delhi, her phone rang. The name on the screen said Naina. “I had a number saved, which the private investigator had given me.” Vandana shuts her eyes. “It was 4am UK time. I picked up.” For the first time in years, she heard her daughter’s voice.“Mum,” Naina said, “will you help me? I’m in danger.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She wanted her mother to verify her identity. “Tell me something only you would know,” Naina said.“I told her where she was born, when we moved to Singapore. I actually said, ‘You were sexually assaulted when you first arrived in college,’” Vandana remembers.Identity confirmed, Naina told her the street outside her flat was filled with black cars, and people dressed in black were waiting to kidnap her. Her mother told her to call the police. “They won’t help me,” Naina said.“All I wanted to do was make sure she stayed inside her apartment until Gauri could come and pick her up,” Vandana says. She tried to contact Nafrey and her husband but, at 4am, they weren’t responding. Naina suddenly wanted to speak to everyone: her brother, her grandmother, old friends. “These girls decided not to have any contact with me,” Vandana says, bitterly, of Naina’s friends. “When Naina messaged them to say she was in danger, did any of her friends rush to help her?” By 9.30am UK time, Vandana had bought a ticket to fly to London. By 6.30pm, she was on a plane.“I woke up and saw six missed calls from Vandana – and then I saw missed calls from Naina,” Nafrey tells me, still in disbelief. There were texts from Naina, too, saying she wasn’t safe and asking Nafrey to pick her up “as soon as you are able”. Nafrey rang Vandana, who advised her not to ask Naina any questions. “I literally got up, put my jeans on and ran. I was overjoyed – it was what we’d been wanting to happen,” Nafrey says.Vandana, too, felt joy and relief – but it was mixed with fear about her daughter’s mental state. She reassured herself that she already knew the psychiatrist in Hong Kong who was treating Naina’s brother. “I knew what to do. I had to just remain calm and get her home.”Nafrey drove to Naina’s address. There was no fleet of black cars outside, nor people dressed in black. When Naina came to open the door to Nafrey – a woman she’d known since she was a baby – her face was completely blank. “No recognition, no hint of emotion at all.” Nafrey tried to hug her: “It was like hugging a statue.”Naina had been packing. Her organisation was meticulous: each individual sock was carefully folded, then placed in a specific bag. The kitchenette was full of expensive Japanese ingredients and obscure wholegrains. It took an hour for her to be satisfied that everything had been correctly packed. “Where are we going? Am I going to be OK?” Naina asked in Nafrey’s car. “She was like a lost child,” Nafrey says.She had plans that meant she could only look after Naina in the morning, so Kapoor agreed to collect her and look after her until Vandana arrived in London. “My first impression was that she wasveryquiet. There was almost a translucent quality to her, ethereal. You felt like holding her gently,” Kapoor remembers. “But within a minute, I could tell she was not OK. She was so within herself, and absolutely frightened.”View image in fullscreenNaina in St Albans in October 2024, just days before she died.Photograph: courtesy of Vandana LuthraWhen she arrived at Kapoor’s home in St Albans, Naina told Kapoor her daughter was an impostor. “She said, ‘I know she’s not 13 and I know she’s a spy. You’ve trained her really well. She’s a really good actor.’” She said that the dog – a soppy, sandy-coloured cockapoo called Ziggy – was also a spy. She inspected the corner of every room for hidden cameras. She told Kapoor that she knew there was a camera concealed in her necklace. Kapoor went upstairs and took all her jewellery off.At bedtime, Naina asked Kapoor to hug her to sleep. “She was like a seven- or eight-year-old,” Kapoor says. “I held her tight. She was lying down and I was just stroking her hair. Then she said, ‘Why do you keep touching me all the time?’ I said, ‘I’m really sorry.’ I didn’t want to say, ‘But you just asked me to hug you 10 minutes ago.’” At 3am, Naina tried to open the patio doors and walk into the garden. She asked Kapoor if this really was a neighbourhood and not some kind of film set. They fell asleep together on the sofas in the living room. In the morning, Kapoor’s husband discovered Naina had come upstairs with her pillow and blanket, and fallen asleep next to him.“How is it that anybody who interacted with Naina had not picked up on the fact that she was very unwell?” Kapoor shakes her head. “You could see that this person was not OK.”Vandana arrived at Kapoor’s the next morning. She was struck by how fragile her daughter looked. “Her skin was like glass. She was so thin, so fair, so shining – like bone china.” Vandana went to hug her, but Naina looked at her in disgust. “She said, ‘Are you going to take my teeth out? Are you going to take my eyes out?’” Naina demanded Vandana open her mouth so she could check her teeth, running her finger over her mother’s molars: “I just followed her instructions and stood there.” Somehow reassured, Naina sat down on the sofa with her mother. “I said, ‘I’m so happy to see you, Naina. I’ve come to take you home, and you will be safe.’”They went for a walk in a park near Kapoor’s house. “Suddenly she said, ‘Mum, you’ve not even hugged me!’ So I just stood still, and Ihuggedher and Ihuggedher.” Vandana’s eyes shine at this memory. “People are walking past us, and the two of us are just hugging in the middle of the park. It waslovely.”Naina didn’t want to return to Hong Kong without her college diploma. It was in a box in the storage unit she’d been renting, she explained, but it was Sunday and it wasn’t open until the next day. The following morning, when Naina pulled up the door to her unit, Vandana’s heart fell: there were dozens of huge cardboard boxes, stacked from floor to ceiling, taking up every inch of space. One contained 100 dishcloths, neatly folded, labelled and placed in Ziploc bags. Another held six different Longchamp shoulder bags. There was a vacuum cleaner, dozens of ice-lolly moulds, expensive storage jars, an air fryer, designer boots and yoga wear, and boxes and boxes of Jellycat toys.Vandana stared in disbelief, but Naina told her not to worry: everything was labelled. She had a spreadsheet documenting everything she owned – down to every nail file and pair of tweezers – the box it was stored in and the room in her future home where it would finally be unpacked. Throughout 2024 she had spent tens of thousands of pounds on things to fill her dream home in London. They found her diploma, gathered clothes appropriate for the Hong Kong heat and left the rest.They landed safely in Hong Kong the next morning, a Tuesday. On the train from the airport, Naina seemed lucid. “What will I tell people?” she asked. “That you’re taking care of your mental health,” Vandana replied. An appointment with a psychiatrist was booked for Saturday morning, and Naina had agreed to go. She started talking about how great her résumé was – she’d worked at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey, after all, so she should easily be able to get a job in Hong Kong. Vandana tells me this between deep sighs. “She was planning her life. She was not suicidal.” On the Thursday night – during a few seconds when Vandana was in the bathroom and not with her – Naina ended her life.“My daughter is gone, despite everything I did,” Vandana says now. “I don’t know how bad her situation would have been if she had remained alive, but I had her right in front of me. I had her in my hand. And from my hand, she’s gone.”In the days after Naina’s death, Vandana’s brother and brother-in-law managed to log into her computer. They were looking for any documentation to demonstrate to the authorities that Naina had been mentally ill when she died. They found her psychotherapy bills, and text messages she had sent to her former friends – texts Vandana shared with me. What Naina said in them, and how her friends reacted, show both her state of mind and how ill-equipped they were to deal with it.“I’ve gone mad,” Naina messaged a close friend in February 2022, around the time she was asking Vandana for baby pictures from London. “I keep talking to the imaginary friends who came into my head when I was 12 and now my therapist tells me it’s not normal.” One of the voices was telling her to kill herself, she said.“Just remember how strong and loved you are. You can get through this!!” the friend replied. “Get rid of all the negative voices by replacing them with a million ‘I love you’s okay???”The people making a difference: the mental health campaigner on the truth about personality disordersRead moreThere were texts to three friends in May 2022 in which Naina said the sexual abuse she remembered suffering in early childhood had been perpetrated by family members. But she gave different accounts of who was responsible to each of them. She told one she could remember being abused when she was six months old.I approached four of Naina’s friends; only one – a close friend from college – agreed to speak to me, on condition of anonymity. She told me she and another college friend had done what they could to support Naina when she spoke to them about her memories of abuse. “We were doing our best. I don’t think we were doing a bad job, but we were having to therapise for something we were not trained for. And she was seeing a therapist, so it felt like she was being taken care of,” the friend says. Naina had been planning to cut herself off from her family for six months, she adds. “Naina had asked me not to talk to her mom, and I agreed – from what I heard, they had done terrible things to her.”The friend saw Naina for the last time when she visited her in New York in spring 2023. Naina was on medical leave from work, but was feeling optimistic, her friend says. “It was a fun visit. We did tourist things together. At the end, she told me that when she started her job, it was possible that she might be busy with work, and that I shouldn’t take it personally if we lost touch – she’d love and cherish me for ever. I wanted to respect her boundaries. I wished her well and we texted here and there but we didn’t speak again.” When she first heard the news, she didn’t believe Naina was gone. “I think about whether there are things I missed. I wonder whether she was in the right type of therapy. She needed someone to notice something that the rest of us didn’t.”I feel sorry for Naina’s friends. They were young and clearly wanted to help Naina and respect her wishes. When I put this to Vandana, her voice turns to ice. She says she can only “have sympathy for their ignorance”.In the end, Naina had no friends; her messages in 2024 were only to the people who taught her yoga. “Naina fell through our fingers,” Newton tells me, her palms pressed together, her fingers splayed. “I wish I’d tried to meet up with her, or find out where she lived, or who her parents were. IwishI had tried a bit more.”No one at the yoga studio knew how to recognise psychosis. “I’d never been in contact with it before,” Newton says. “Even now, I’m not clear what services I have access to. Where do I go? Who do I go to?” She sighs.Nafrey and Kapoor arranged for Naina’s boxes to be shipped from the storage unit in London to Hong Kong. They are now stacked up in her bedroom. Vandana has no idea what to do with them.“People have to know what mental illness is. I want to make sure high schools all over the world teach kids to recognise psychosis,” Vandana says. “At every point, somebody or other came in contact with her who could have helped. I want Naina’s story to go far and wide. She died because the people around her were ignorant.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthYoung peopleParents and parentingHealthFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It will also be British officials.Six months into his second term as US president, a period in whichDonald Trumphas pirouetted on just about every big international issue, mandarins in Whitehall have realised they need to focus less time on trying to tame him, and more on looking at his wife.Trump’s recent golfing visit to the UK underlined the feeling that the first lady is the single biggest influence on her husband – and intend to adapt accordingly. They believe Melania was behind Trump’s recent volte-face declaring Palestinians in Gaza were starving; and thepresident acknowledged it was his wifewho had said Vladimir Putin may not have been sincere about wanting a peace deal in Ukraine.It is not just what the president says about the first lady in public, but the deferential reference to her views in private, according to sources who have spoken to the Guardian. One said: “Starmer has earned Trump’s respect and will tell him in the right way if he disagrees. But she is the one that matters.”For Whitehall officials to reach such a conclusion about Melania’s influence requires quite a reassessment. The first lady has made a virtue of refusing to divulge the secrets of her political partnership. The more he talks, the less she tends to say.Her banality-packed, bestselling memoir,Melania, revealed, according to one critic, “an extremely superficial, politically disengaged human being, the last kind of person who you would think of as a political wife”.View image in fullscreenMelania Trump’s bestselling memoir revealed, according to one critic, ‘an extremely superficial, politically disengaged human being’.Composite: Getty, EPAMoreover, the first lady often vanishes from view, mainly to New York to be closer to her son. The disclosure in late May that she may have spent less than a fortnight in the White House since her husband’s second inauguration did not reveal a woman desperate to be “in the room where it happens”.There has been no repetition of hersolo visitto Africa in 2018, a visit preceded by a reception on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in which she spoke of her pride in the work of the USAID programme tackling disease and hunger among children.USAID has now beendismantled.Earlier this year, Melania gave a glimpse of the role she now plays. In aninterviewwith the chatshow Fox & Friends, she spoke about her life and the hardships she had endured when she first came to the US. And then she spoke of her life now.View image in fullscreenMelania Trump visits the Nairobi national park in Kenya in October 2018.Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters“Maybe some people, they see me as just a wife of the president, but I’m standing on my own two feet, independent. I have my own thoughts. I have my own ‘yes’ and ‘no’. I don’t always agree [with] what my husband is saying or doing, and that’s OK.”She continued: “I give him my advice, and sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn’t, and that’s OK.”She clearly clashed with him over Covid and, according to her memoir, over abortion – the first ladyhas defended abortion rights. The bulk of her formal work has been linked to helping orphans or children at risk of online exploitation. But it has had little cut-through.In February 2025,a US polllisted Melania as the 10th emost influential person in the Trump administration behind evenStephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, and the US attorney general,Pam Bondi.At the time of the poll, the nowjettisoned Elon Muskwas seen as the figure the president most heeded. Since that fallout, Trump says he trusts no one. All of which has made the work of diplomats, who spend their lives trying to work out who in the president’s inner circle they need to cultivate, all the harder.View image in fullscreenPeter Mandelson has said he’s never been in a political system that is so dominated by one individual.Photograph: Leah Millis/ReutersThe British ambassador Lord Mandelson, who has to track Trump’s unpredictable and last-minute decision-making, has said: “I’ve never been in a town or a political system that is so dominated by one individual. Usually, you’re entering an ecosystem rather than the world of one personality.”A European diplomat added: “Working out who and what influences him, and the relative value of flattery or firmness, has become every diplomat’s preoccupation.”And yet the answer to reading the president, British officials have come to conclude, was under their nose. Trump himself has encouraged this thinking.They note he once described his wife as his best pollster, and in his second term he has been increasingly open that his wife affects his thinking – possibly a helpful admission for a leader trailing in the polls especially among independent women alienated by Trump’s machismo deal-making and coarseness.View image in fullscreenMelania and Donald Trump greet attenders at the congressional picnic at the White House in June.Photograph: Alexander Drago/EPABy projecting Melania, the president gets a chance to appeal to different voters. The first lady also provides him with an excuse, if needed, to change course, as may have happened when in 2018 Melaniapublicly criticisedas “heartbreaking and unacceptable” the administration policy of migrant children being separated from their parents.She claimed she had been “blindsided”, a phrase that revealed an assumption she would be consulted.Children were also in her thinking on Gaza, according to Trump. He explained: “Melania thinks it is terrible. She sees the same pictures that you see and we all see. Everybody, unless they are pretty cold-hearted or worse than that, nuts, [thinks] there’s nothing you can say other than it’s terrible when you see the kids.” In thinking this, the first lady was not alone: 72% of female voters, according to a YouGov/Economistpoll, think there is a hunger crisis in Gaza.On 27 July, when Israel insisted starvation was not occurring in Gaza or is manufactured by Hamas propagandists, Trump thenpushed back, saying the pictures could not be faked.This would have been music to the ears of the British, who have been urging the president to give the issue his attention.But the follow-through has been weak. Trump claimed the US had provided $60m (£45m) in food aid to Gaza, a claim that has been debunked in the US media. He vaguely hinted at restructuring the food centres run by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Fund, themuch-criticisedreplacement for the UN-administered food programme. Yet a fortnight later, despite the continuing deaths, Trump’s ambassador in Israel, Mike Huckabee, insisted on Tuesday thatGHFwas fundamentally working, while Fox News was given a tour of a GHF distribution centre to show food was reaching Palestinians. Trump said it was up to Israel if it wished to occupy Gaza permanently.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin and Melania Trump attend a state banquet at a G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, in July 2017.Photograph: Michael Ukas/EPATrump has also creditedthe first lady’s scepticismwith sharpening his partial rethink about Putin. At a meeting with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on 15 July he said: “I go home. I tell the first lady: ‘I spoke with Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.’ She said: ‘Oh really? Another city was just hit.’”Is Trump building a political dynasty? – episode twoRead moreLater the same day at another White House event, he said: “I’d get home, I’d say: ‘First lady, I had the most wonderful talk with Vladimir. I think we’re finished.’ And then I’ll turn on the television, or she’ll say to me one time: ‘Wow, that’s strange because they just bombed a nursing home.’”Melania’s observations led him to muse: “I don’t want to say he is an assassin, but he is a tough guy, it’s been proven over the years.”Asked if the first lady was an influence on his thinking, Trump said: “Melania is very smart. She’s very neutral. She’s very neutral, in a sense she’s sort of like me. She’d like to see people stop dying.”In saying she is neutral, and wants the killing inUkraineto stop, Trump may be gently realigning these views with the latest version of his own.1:14Trump suggests first lady's role in changing his view of Putin over Ukraine – videoAt the time of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 28 February 2022, Melania ended a long silence on X, sending her prayers to the people of Ukraine and conspicuously not to those ofRussia.In February 2022, when her husbandcalled Putin’s invasion of Ukraine “genius”, Melania tweeted: “It is heartbreaking and horrific to see innocent people suffering. My thoughts and prayers are with the Ukrainian people. Please, if you can, donate to help them@ICRC.”In that appeal she apportioned no explicit blame for the conflict, and Trump insisted his wife had liked Putin when they hadmet brieflyat a summit in 2017, but it is a stretch to describe Melania as neutral on Ukraine.The relatively wealthy daughter of a textile worker and a car trader, Melania, with her older sister Ines Knauss, was educated in the communist-run capital of Slovenia, Ljubljana. But Slovenia in the 80s was always seen as the most liberal part of Tito’s Yugoslavia, and the first lady has said she always felt more connected to Austria and Italy than to the communist bloc. If her father was a member of the Communist party, self-advancement not ideology was the motive.View image in fullscreenDonald and Melania Trump meet Charles and Camilla in June 2019 at the London residence of the US ambassador to the UK.Photograph: Chris Jackson/PAThe assessment that Melania is important to Trump’s decision-making is double-edged. It provides faint hope that the humanitarian perspective still holds some sway in the White House. But the theory is also frustrating as it is difficult to know how engaged she is.It is symptomatic of a wider problem faced by many western countries. With the US state department hollowed out by cuts, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, having decamped to the White House in a temporary posting as national security adviser, western diplomacy, traditionally structured around relations with the state department, is struggling to adapt to Trump’s free-wheeling style where power is centred on the president, his instincts and informal conversations, including those with his wife.Political monitoring teams are being revamped into near 24-hour operations to try to adapt to Trump’s continuous statements, often dropping policy clues into impromptu press conferences, doorsteps and on social media.It is ironic that it will be the royal family who will test the theory that Melania could become Britain’s secret ally at court."

The fast walking pace should be fast enough that you are not able to speak in long sentences.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianFitnessJapanese interval walking: the viral exercise trend that could put a spring in your stepAlternating between fast and slow walking is particularly suited to people who do not do much regular exerciseNicola DavisScience correspondentSat 9 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTShareIf the thought of pumping iron or holding a plank doesn’t put a spring in your step, maybe the latest exercise trend to dominate social media will: Japanese interval walking.The idea is simple: alternate between three minutes of fast and three minutes of slow walking, ideally for 30 minutes at a time.“The fast walking pace is typically fast [enough] that you are not able to speak in long sentences,” said Dr Kristian Karstoft, an associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, who has studied the method. “And then the slow intervals are so slow that you are able to recover.” He added that people could often find it challenging to walk slowly enough during these intervals.Putting the approach to the test, I hit the area around King’s Cross in central London.I began striding out, as though late for a train. Three minutes later my watch beeped and I slowed down, pottering along as if searching for a dropped earring. Another beep and I sped up once more, arms swinging.I was slightly worried what passersby might think of my erratic pace – I suspect I looked as if I needed the loo but dared not risk a jog. Already I was regretting attempting this without my two flat-coated retrievers: if they were in tow I could at least have blamed my dawdling intervals on their lamp-post sniffing.After 30 minutes I felt warm, but not exactly out of puff.Karstoft said the approach was particularly suited to people prone to running injuries, as walking is less hard on the joints, or middle-aged or older adults who do not do much regular training. People who were already pretty fit, he said, would need to jog or run for intervals to experience similar benefits.View image in fullscreenThe regime is similar to high-intensity interval training. People who are less active should start with regular walking and then try interval walking.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe regime is similar to high-intensity interval training (Hiit). Dr Shaun Phillips, a senior lecturer in sport and exercise physiology at the University of Edinburgh, said: “High-intensity exercise can give similar benefits to moderate-intensity exercise but in a shorter time frame [or] with a lower volume of exercise. The use of high-intensity places a bigger stimulus on the body to adapt.”But not everyone can keep up a furious pace, even when walking. Phillips said people who were less active or fit should start with normal walking to get into the swing of it, and then try interval walking.“A way to maximise your ability to do high-intensity training is to do it with the alternating intensities, meaning the interval-based training,” Karstoft said.While high-intensity interval walking has recently become popular on TikTok, where enthusiasts share videos of themselves earnestly striding around town parks, the idea goes back more than 20 years whenscientists in Japanbegan studying it in middle-aged and older adults.According toone Japanese study, involving an analysis of data from 139 healthy participants with an average age of 63, people who did high-intensity interval walking on four or more days a week over a five-month period increased their peak aerobic capacity, indicating an improvement in physical fitness. What’s more, these improvements were greater than for participants who had undertaken a walking regime of continuous, moderate intensity or who did no walking training.The study also suggested high-intensity interval walking may reduce blood pressure and increase the strength of the knee joint.Asmall randomised control trialby Karstoft and his colleagues found the approach could also benefit people with type 2 diabetes, including by improving their glycaemic control.Four months of high-intensity interval walking was associated with greater benefits than continuous walking, even though the overall energy expenditure and mean training intensity were the same.“Typically with interval walking, we’ve seen a gain in fitness level of around 15% to 20% compared to trivial or no improvements in fitness levels when subjects are doing the continuous walking [or no walking],” Karstoft said. “We’ve seen improvements in body composition with an average weight loss during four to six months of training of around three to five kilograms, mainly due to fat mass.”A review on the topicpublished by Karstoft and his colleagues last yearconcluded that Japanese interval walking was a feasible and effective training regimen for older, fragile people. “It significantly enhances fitness, muscle strength, and health markers,” they wrote.But, Phillips acknowledged, while some people like the challenge of higher intensity periods of exercise, others hate it.“We’re certainly never going to come to the ideal exercise protocol that everybody loves,” he said. “It’s about trying to give as many workable and beneficial options as possible that people can pick from.”Explore more on these topicsFitnessJapanWalkingHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Brian Kirk directs from a script by screenwriters Nicholas Jacobson-Larson and Dalton Leeb, and Thompson turns up the accent dial to play a neighbourly and good-naturedMinnesotawidow. With her recently deceased husband, she ran a fishing supplies store and like him was keen on ice-fishing: venturing out on huge freezing lakes, drilling a hole in the ice, setting up a phone-box sized ice shelter for warmth and lowering the bait and lure. Her late husband sweetly took her on an ice-fishing trip on a certain remote lake for their first date – bittersweet flashbacks bring home the memory – and it is to this lake that she comes on a mission to scatter his ashes.Having not quite arrived at this beautiful but subzero spot that she hasn’t visited for some years and got a bit lost, Thompson finds herself pulling in to a very strange property to ask directions; she hears disquieting sounds from the interior and sees a peculiar man (Marc Menchaca) chopping wood in front of a sickeningly vivid splash of blood on the snow. The man curtly explains, in response to her tactless inquiry, that this is due to “a deer” and tells her where to find her lake. But it is only on leaving him that Thompson is to discover the awful truth: this man is keeping a teenage girl (Laurel Marsden) prisoner and apparently intending to kill her. Thompson is also to come across the man’s even scarier wife, played by Judy Greer.So has Thompson’s widow chanced upon the local equivalent of psycho hillbillies? Is this to be The Minnesota Chain Saw Massacre? Or perhaps The Minnesota Ice Drill Massacre? In fact, these people’s personalities and motivations are more complicated. Thompson’s character also has more to show us: she is a tough, resourceful woman used to the outdoors, used to the extreme cold, scared but not utterly discomposed at the sound of gunshots, and armed with a sense that, in an extreme situation, she might have less to lose than these people. And she also has a touch of ruthlessness: she knows how to trap people, how to use the lethal cold against them.The story rattles along, entertaining and alarming, until it reaches its guignol horror on the ice. Thompson’s relatable presence and likability-aura make a very good solvent for the concentrated nastiness of Greer’s desperate villain and what she has in mind for her teen prisoner. There’s a distinct chill.The Dead of Winter screened at the Locarno film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersMinnesotaEmma ThompsonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Will they judge us for buying ready-made coleslaw? Will they notice how excessively charred the drumsticks are?

Then I make a dressing: either whisk together tahini, a bit of yoghurt, lemon juice, garlic and water to make a creamy sauce, or simply use some creme fraiche with lemon juice and garlic stirred though. I spoon this over the cabbage and finish it off with whatever chilli oil or chilli sauce happens to be around, and a sprinkle of fresh herbs (only if I have them).Yotam Ottolenghi, chef, restaurateur and food writerThrow a few prawns on the grillView image in fullscreenTom Kerridge’s prawns with harissa mayoBarbecued prawns with harissa mayo make a perfect barbecue starter: place 1kg of raw shell-on tiger prawns in a bowl with two teaspoons of crushed cumin seeds, two tablespoons each of rose harissa paste and olive oil and the zest of two limes.

It was a world away from this summer’s heatwaves, which have pushed Britain to the brink of drought.But Tester’s choice of heat pump design has meant that his three-bedroom 1930s semi in West Sussex has remained at a comfortable temperature despite Britain’s increasingly volatile weather. The air-to-air heat pump provides heating in the winter but acts like an air conditioner in the summer months.“The heat pump has worked very well in both seasons and because I run it on electricity from my solar panels, it basically provides cooling for free,” he said.Heat pumps remain rare in Britain, but the recent spells of hotter than average temperatures may have the unexpected consequence of boosting the government’s ambition to replace Britain’s boilers.The government recently set out plans to include air-to-air heat pumps, which can act as air conditioners, in the same grant scheme that offers £7,500 to households that replace their gas boiler with “wet system” heat pumps.Two ‘misleading’ heat pump adverts banned by UK watchdogRead moreSo far, the government has prioritisedpromoting “hydronic” heat pumps, in large part because they make use of the existing central heating pipes and radiators, which most households currently use to warm their homes.They work like a fridge in reverse by using electricity to capture and amplify even small amounts of heat outside a home to raise the water temperature of the central heating system. The warmed water travels through pipes and radiators to heat a home in the same way as water heated by a gas boiler.But these are far from the most common choice in homes across Europe, according to Jan Rosenow, an academic and a programme director at theRegulatory Assistance Project(RAP), which regularly analyses heat pump systems.“In most homes across Europe air-to-air heat pumps are the most popular option. We see the same thing in China, and the same in the US. It may seem new for UK homes, but really it is the dominant technology,” he said.Cold comfortIn Britain air-to-air heat pumps are already beginning to roll out across public buildings, offices and shopping centres. Andrew Sissons, a deputy director at Nesta, a charity that undertakes research into home heating innovation, believes that smaller homes and flats in particular could soon benefit from combined heating and cooling too.Air heat pumps use the same basic principles as hydronic system heat pumps, but instead of heating water that is pumped through the home, they heat the air. In the summer a refrigerant is used to provide cooling.“Demand for air-to-air heat pumps could be significant,” Sissons said. “They provide cooling – which is more in demand as our summers get hotter – and the cost of units is far lower too. They are also relatively simple to install because they are usually wall mounted so they don’t require as much outdoor space.”The catch? They don’t usually provide hot water, meaning a separate low-carbon solution would be needed to replace a traditional gas boiler system entirely.In West Sussex, Tester has kept his gas boiler to heat the water used in his underfloor heating system on the first floor – but uses it sparingly for a few hours in the morning and evening during the winter months, while the air-to-air heat pump tackles the majority of the heating requirements. In summer, the pump runs on solar power to provide cooling.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Home air conditioning is rare in Britain, unlike in southern Europe, and there are growing concerns over the impact of cooling on the UK’s energy demand and carbon targets as the climate crisis intensifies.The InternationalEnergyAgency has warned that growing demand for cooling could put a strain on electricity grids and climate goals. Cooling accounts for about 10% of global electricity demand today, but it is set to double by 2050 as the climate gets hotter.The global energy watchdog noted that in 2023 one power plant in China burned about 800 tonnes of coal in just one hour to help keep Shanghai residents cool during a summer heatwave.But British households should have no reservations about installing an air-to-air heat pump to use for cooling purposes too, according to Sissons.There are two main reasons for this: first, the number of days when cooling would be required are far lower than the number of days when the heat pump will make significant carbon savings by providing warmth in place of a gas boiler. These carbon savings would easily outweigh the extra carbon demand from cooling a home in summer, he said, not least because the UK’s electricity grid is increasingly green.Second, there is a strong correlation between the days when cooling will be in high demand, and the days when the UK is generating large amounts of solar power, Sissons said. Winter evenings are still likely to be the most taxing for the UK electricity system, even if there is a significant uptake in summer air conditioning in the years ahead.These calculations already form part of the extensive forecasts produced by the National Energy System Operator to determine how much energy Britain will need in the future – and how it can meet this requirement.The system operator’s modelling accounts for a huge increase in electricity use by the end of the decade, including demand from electric vehicles, heat pumps and data centres. It also forecasts more energy-efficient buildings and appliances combined with batteries which can provide extra electricity at times of peak demand.The modelling shows that a virtually zero carbon electricity grid could power Britain by the end of the decade – even with growing demand – and be used by the industry and government policymakers to help the UK achieve its clean power goals.Even so, homes can take steps to dull the effect of a surge in demand for cooling. The Energy Saving Trust recommends using passive cooling methods before fitting either an air conditioning unit or a heat pump with a cooling function to dampen the impact of higher energy demand. These include using window shades and improving ventilation to minimise the amount of energy used to cool a home.Explore more on these topicsHeat pumpsEnergyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As of 9pm, 466 people had been arrested for showing support for Palestine Action.“There were a further eight arrests for other offences including five assaults on officers.”The Met said the total of 474 was the most arrests it had made related to a single operation in at least the past decade.Before the planned event in the capital, the Met said it had drawn officers from other forces to help form a “significant policing presence”. It was anticipated the event would result in large numbers of people being detained.By Saturday afternoon, hundreds of people had gathered in Parliament Square for a demonstration organised by the campaign group Defend Our Juries, who said “approximately 1,000 sign-holders” had turned up.The Met said it estimated 500-600 people were in Parliament Square when the demonstration began, but “many” were not partaking.A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries said earlier: “The fact that unprecedented numbers came out today risking arrest and possible imprisonment shows how repulsed and ashamed people are about our government’s ongoing complicity in a livestreamed genocide, and the lengths people are prepared to go to defend this country’s ancient liberties.”View image in fullscreenPolice arresting a woman in Parliament Square.Photograph: Gary Calton/The Guardian“The police have only been able to arrest a fraction of those supposedly committing ‘terrorism’ offences, and most of those have been given street bail and allowed to go home. This is a major embarrassment to Yvette Cooper, further undermining the credibility of this widely ridiculed law.”On Saturday evening, the home secretary thanked officers and reaffirmed the government’s decision to ban Palestine Action.“Many people may not yet know the reality of this organisation, but the assessments are very clear – this is not a nonviolent organisation. UK national security and public safety must always be our top priority,” Cooper said.The demonstration began at 1pm but officers made a small number of arrests beforehand. Soon after, officers began arresting people outside the green holding signs that referenced Palestine Action. One woman, while being dragged away by police, said: “All of you have loved ones, you’re arresting the wrong people. Arrest the people over there [pointing towards parliament], arrest the people complicit in the genocide.”From 1pm to 2pm, demonstrators holding signs that read “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action” were silent. “It’s all very sedate, peaceful and moving,” said Suzan Broom, who clapped and cheered for those being taken away by police. “I’ve been following them and saying thank you because I’m too scared.”Two women taking part in the action, one in her mid-70s, were arrested by police midway through their interview with the Guardian. One said of the turnout: “I think it’s great, people are absolutely sick of seeing genocide on their screens.”She said the vandalism of RAF aircrafts by Palestine Action members was a “protest action, it’s not at all terrorism”.“Those planes are the terrorists. They’re going over and shooting and killing children,” she said.View image in fullscreenAn arrested protester is driven away in a police van.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianZoe, one of those taking part in the demonstration, said: “I along with hundreds of ordinary people have had enough of our government’s collusion in genocide.“You can hear the claps and it’s got like a family-friendly environment here. You’ve seen it with your own eyes. It’s completely peaceful and there’s nothing vaguely terrorist right now. We’re just being ordinary peaceful people saying we oppose genocide,” she said.She wore a large patch with the words “Jews Against Genocide”. She said: “I wear it clearly and with pride to make sure that other people recognise that there are many many Jews who do not support genocide of any nature.”“I’m holding a piece of paper for goodness sakes, that’s not a terrorist act. A terrorist act is intentionally starving 2 million,” she said. “I don’t know what to say to [Palestinians], I’m so sorry it’s come to this. I wish we could do more but we’re trying our best.”Officers searched the bags of those arrested. In one backpack handled with blue forensic gloves, they uncovered some bread and a milk carton filled with water.Robert Del Naja, from the band Massive Attack, joined the sign-holders and said: “UK civil liberties are trapped in a manufactured crisis. Peaceful citizens of conscience – including pensioners – have become terrorists, at the will of a human rights lawyer turned authoritarian who now lunges at opinions that expose the moral vacuum of his unrecognisable government.”Some of those arrested were publicly processed on the street outside Scotland Yard, near the main demonstration, where crowds gathered and shouted “‘shame on you” at officers.Amnesty International called the mass arrests “deeply concerning”.“The protesters in Parliament Square were not inciting violence and it is entirely disproportionate to the point of absurdity to be treating them as terrorists,” said Sacha Deshmukh, the organisation’s chief executive.“We have long criticised UK terrorism law for being excessively broad and vaguely worded and a threat to freedom of expression. These arrests demonstrate that our concerns were justified.”View image in fullscreenA woman is arrested during the demonstration.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianBefore the protest, a Home Office spokesperson said: “The home secretary has been clear that the proscription of Palestine Action is not about Palestine, nor does it affect the freedom to protest on Palestinian rights.“It only applies to the specific and narrow organisation whose activities do not reflect or represent the thousands of people across the country who continue to exercise their fundamental rights to protest on different issues. Freedom to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy and we protect it fiercely.”The firstthree peopleto be charged with supporting the group in England and Wales were named on Thursday.Jeremy Shippam, 71, Judit Murray, 71, and Fiona Maclean, 53, have been charged with displaying an article in a public place, arousing reasonable suspicion that they are a supporter of a proscribed organisation after their attendance at a previous demonstration last month.Palestine Action was banned in June, days after activists from the group broke into RAF Brize Norton and defaced two military aircraft with spray paint. The ban means that membership of, or support for, Palestine Action is a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison under the Terrorism Act 2000.In a separate development, the government announced on Saturday it would send an additional £8.5m of aid to Gaza via a UN agency, a day after Keir Starmer said Israel’s expansion plans were “wrong” and “will only bring more bloodshed”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It holds the Royal Navy’s supply of nuclear warheads for its fleet of four Trident submarines, which are based nearby.map graphicFiles compiled by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), a government pollution watchdog, suggest that up to half the components at the base were beyond their design life when the leaks occurred.Sepa said the flooding at Coulport was caused by “shortfalls in maintenance”, resulting in the release of “unnecessary radioactive waste” in the form of low levels of tritium, which is used in nuclear warheads.In one report in 2022, the agency blamed the leaks on the navy’s repeated failure to maintain the equipment in the area devoted to storing the warheads, and said plans to replace 1,500 old pipes at risk of bursting were “sub-optimal”.The leaks are revealed in a cache of confidential inspection reports and emails given to the investigative websitethe Ferretand shared with the Guardian, which Sepa and the Ministry of Defence fought to keep secret.They were released on the orders of David Hamilton, the Scottish information commissioner, who polices Scotland’s freedom of information laws, after a six-year long battle by reporters for access to the files.The UK government insisted the files had to be kept secret for national security reasons, but in June Hamilton ruled that most had to be released. He said their disclosure threatened “reputations” not national security.They were released in August following a further delay after the MoD asked for more time to review them, citing “additional national security considerations”.Nuclear warheads are fitted on to the UK’s supply of Trident missiles at Coulport where the missiles are loaded on to Vanguard class submarines before they head to sea for secret patrols as part of the UK’s nuclear deterrent.The UK’s nuclear weapons fleet has been based at Faslane on a neighbouring loch called Gare Loch since the early 1960s. Tritium is regularly replenished in the warheads to maintain the performance of the weapons.The Sepa files show there had been a pipe burst at Coulport in 2010 and a further two in 2019. One leak in August 2019 released “significant amounts of water” that flooded a nuclear weapons processing area, where it became contaminated with low levels of tritium and passed through an open drain that fed into Loch Long.While Sepa said radioactivity levels in that incident were very low and did not endanger human health, it found there were “shortfalls in maintenance and asset management that led to the failure of the coupling that indirectly led to the production of unnecessary radioactive waste”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It accepted that its lack of preparedness had caused “confusion”, “a breakdown in access control” and a “lack of communication of the hazards”.However, there were two further pipe bursts in 2021, including one in another area that also held radioactive substances, prompting another inspection by Sepa in 2022. Progress on completing the 23 remedial actions “had been slow and delayed in many cases”, Sepa said. “The events have highlighted shortcomings in asset management across the naval base.”David Cullen, a nuclear weapons expert with the defence thinktank Basic in London, said the repeated pollution incidents were shocking and the attempts to keep them secret were “outrageous”.He said: “The MoD is almost 10 years into a nearly £2bn infrastructure programme at Faslane and Coulport, and yet they apparently didn’t have a proper asset management system as recently as 2022. This negligent approach is far too common in the nuclear weapons programme, and is a direct consequence of a lack of oversight.”Coulport is exempt from civilian pollution controls because it is a military base, but Sepa said it was committed to ensuring the base operated “in accordance with standards equivalent to those in environmental regulations, to protect both the environment and the public”.Sepa said it was “satisfied” that Coulport and Faslane had made “substantial improvements to asset management and maintenance” since these incidents, which had not been repeated.It published data on radioactive discharges from Coulport and Faslane every year, along with assessments of the environmental impacts. It insisted those discharges were “of no regulatory concern”.An MoD spokesperson said it placed “the upmost importance on our responsibilities for handling radioactive substances safely and securely. There have been no unsafe releases of radioactive material into the environment at any stage.”Explore more on these topicsNuclear wasteNuclear weaponsScotlandWaterNuclear powerEnergyWastenewsShareReuse this content"

Two years ago, he donated to the Egyptian Red Cross to help fund its relief efforts in the region.A fixture in the Palestinian national side after his debut in 2007, Obeid gained 24 caps and scored twice, the PFA said last week, most memorably with a scissor-kick against Yemen during the 2010 West Asian Football Federation championship.‘‘During his long career, al-Obeid, 41, scored more than 100 goals, making him one of the brightest stars of Palestinian football,” it said.His talent on the pitch earned him the nickname of “the Palestinian Pelé” – a nod to the legendary Brazilian widely hailed as one of the greatest players of all time.Obeid’s death added to a growing toll of athletes lost in Gaza since the war began, with at least 662 sportspeople and their relatives reported to have been killed.“The number of footballers killed or who died from starvation has reached 421, including 103 children,” the PFA said.According to the PFA, 288 sports facilities have been damaged or reduced to rubble across Gaza and the West Bank, from stadiums and training grounds to gyms and clubhouses. The majority, 268, were in Gaza, while 20 were in the West Bank, with about half serving football directly.Among the sites hit was the PFA’s headquarters in Gaza, struck during an Israeli air raid.More than 1,300 Palestinians are reported to have been killed in the vicinity of aid distribution points managed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation since the US- and Israeli-backed logistic group’s launch in late May.Explore more on these topicsMohamed SalahIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Protesters chanted “send them home” and “we want our country back”.View image in fullscreenAnti-immigration protest in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianOne man standing on a stage in front of about 400 people said: “England is doomed. You cannot stop it by protesting, the far right must unite.”He called upon the separate far-right organisations to come together in a group that should include Tommy Robinson, a far-right agitator whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.Robinson is on bail suspected of assaulting a man in St Pancras station.The protest, Nuneaton says No!, was organised by the extremist nationalist group Homeland party, whose activists unfurled a banner reading “Remigration NOW”, referring to the mass deportation of immigrants and those born in the UK with heritage from overseas.Many who attended said they were from the area and denied being far right.Meanwhile, Nazi imagery could be seen on T-shirts worn by a handful of people.Music blared from a loudspeaker, including Rule, Britannia! with the chorus loudly sung along to. The protest wound down by mid-afternoon as the music was switched off and many protesters, including most of the women, left.Some remained, drinking cans of beer and working themselves up against the police, whom they accused of covering up crimes by asylum seekers.When one officer agreed with a protester that the alleged rape of the child was a “horrific crime”, in an attempt to calm some agitated protesters, one shouted: “Horrific crime? Well let us protest then.”The officer responded: “We are letting you protest.”By late afternoon, the crowd had entirely dispersed. Later, some protesters could be seen taking turns to sing karaoke on the street outside the Wetherspoon’s pub.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

HerInstagram posthas been watched more than 1.7m times and is captioned with a plea: “Please share so a lot of women will see it!”In the tearful video, Mina said pictures she had put on Vinted had apparently been copied and then posted on “porn sites”. She said a Google search of her name now brought up links to that content, just as she was applying for jobs.The Guardian could not independently confirm her account. In the Instagram video, she said she had reported the matter to Google and the German police, who do not comment on individual criminal complaints.This week the German news outlet Der Spiegel published an interview with Mina, saying she was 22 years old, lived in Cologne and wished to keep her surname private. It said she had used Vinted for “several years”.“The idea of a secondhand platform for clothes is super and important, also considering climate change,” she said. But she lamented Vinted was no longer a “safe space” for her, calling her experiences there “creepy”.She said she had received a barrage of abusive messages via Vinted’s messaging system including: “Hello, I’d like to buy this item of clothing but I’d like you to try it on without underwear first”, and: “Can I also buy you?”Others demanded “more intimate” pictures than the ones she posted.Mina said even more disturbing was the fact photos in which she posed in clothing she was trying to sell including bikini tops and summer dresses had resurfaced on other websites depicting her as an “erotic model” and saying she was a “naked OnlyFans star”.She said she had never posted nude photos online and had no account on the amateur pornography site. Spiegel said it found her name and images on sex-focused German-language forums, with links back to her Vinted and Instagram accounts.Several investigations have turned up similar complaints.In April, a joint report by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and public broadcasters NDR and WDR exposed a public Telegram channel called Girls of Vinted launched in June 2024, and featuring more than 1,000 pictures taken from the marketplace platform and placed in a sexualised context.The report said the Telegram channel featured women who appeared to be selling sexual services based on information included in their profiles, while most were there as legitimate Vinted users and showcased involuntarily.Several of the more than 130 women shown, many of them from Germany, Italy andFrance, reported then receiving lurid messages on their Vinted accounts. Before the Telegram channel was shut down earlier this year, it had accumulated 2,000 mainly male subscribers.In October, the UK broadcasterChannel 4revealed a comparable website called Vinted Sluts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In its updated online help centre, it allows usersto report inappropriate behaviour and content.This was an option used by Bella and Sonja, who said Vinted then shut down the offending accounts after about a week. They soon received new offensive messages from other accounts, however.Vinted said if users found their photos on third-party sites, it would contact those platforms to request removal “where possible”.“We have already reported such cases to Telegram via various channels and, in connection with the Channel 4 documentary, achieved the shutdown of a named website,” a company spokesperson said.Vinted advises its members in its community standards not to share photos in which their face is visible and to keep personal information such as full names, addresses and bank details out of private messages, while minimising data included on shipping labels.“We are aware of the challenges online platforms face in addressing inappropriate behaviour and take our members’ negative experiences very seriously. Safeguarding our members is an ongoing priority,” the spokesperson said.“We will continue to review and evolve our systems to prevent incidents and to respond swiftly whenever issues arise.”Legal experts advise users whose images have been hijacked for sexualised content to report it to the authorities in their country as well as the websites where they are posted. The EU’sDigital Services Acthas required online platforms since February 2024 to delete illegal content that is flagged to them.Explore more on these topicsSexual harassmentE-commerceAppsGermanyFranceItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

His soft-touch approach isn’t working.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceShabana MahmoodLabourImmigration and asylumCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Sadly, teenagers in the UK and around the world have taken their own lives because of it.”The NCMEC data is significant as it is based on reports from online platforms and internet providers – such as Snapchat,Instagramand TikTok – rather than victims, who can be reluctant to disclose the abuse.Tech firms are obliged under US law to flag suspicious material to NCMEC. The figures show that Snapchat reported about 20,000 instances of concerning material – including sextortion and child sexual abuse images – in the first half of last year.This is more than the combined number of reports from Facebook, Instagram, TikTok,X(formerly known as Twitter), Google and Discord. It is understood that Snapchat revised its policies for reporting this content last year and that as a result, subsequent figures will be lower.Rani Govender, of the NSPCC, said sextortion and other financially motivated sexual crimes had a “devastating” impact on youngsters, affecting their ability to trust or seek help and in some cases leading to suicide.NCMEC said it was aware of “more than three dozen” teenage boys worldwide who had killed themselves after falling victim to sextortion since 2021.Govender said some tech firms were “inadvertently turning a blind eye to the abuse occurring on their watch” by introducing protections such as end-to-end encryption, which make it harder to spot harmful content.Unlike some other platforms, Snapchat does not have end-to-end encryption on its text-based chats.Police forces are increasingly concerned that predators are turning to ever more sophisticated attempts to target children online.The Guardian has uncovered a 101-page manual giving detailed instructions on how best to exploit young internet users, including advice on the best phones, encryption, apps and alter egos to use.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Martin claims it has been “the catalyst for thousands of extortions”, according to the US Department of Justice.According to researchers, the sextortion manual was distributed on a number of “Com networks” – online communities where mostly young men share sadistic and misogynistic material and encourage each other to commit crimes.Milo Comerford, of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) thinktank, said: “The continued accessibility of this kind of chillingly detailed sextortion guide points to the growing risk posed by toxic online communities that exploit and abuse children.”TheFBIhas identified scores of online gangs who collaborate to identify vulnerable victims before targeting them using a feigned romantic interest to obtain compromising photos.Those are then used to blackmail the victim to either provide further explicit images, self-harm, or carry out another act of violence or animal abuse.Comerford, of the ISD, said “robust multi-agency” safeguards were urgently required to build awareness of the risks of sextortion among young people, parents, guardians, teachers and others.He added: “These transnational networks are comprised of a constantly shifting landscape of groups that use social media platforms to identify, groom, and harm their victims, and in some cases engage in mass violence.”Snapchat and Facebook have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsOnline abuseChildrenSnapchatFacebookXSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

Here is alink to the videoinstead.Ehab Nuor comes under gunfire near GHF food sites – videoThe Guardian studied more than 30 videos of gunfire near food distribution sites run by the US and Israeli-backedGazaHumanitarian Foundation (GHF). More than 2,000 Palestinians were injured during the 48 days investigated, mostly by gunshots.In the footage, machine-gun fire can be heard on at least 11 days near the food distribution sites. Bullet casings recovered from patients, and patterns of fire analysed by weapons experts, suggest they were Israeli munitions.Palestinians, like Nuor, who travel to GHF sites have come under systematic and indiscriminate Israeli gunfire.Doctors at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis and the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah described treating an unprecedented number of gunshot wounds. Almost all responsive patients arriving at the field hospital say they were shot by the Israeli military while trying to reach a food distribution site.The gunfire at us was randomMohammed Sleiman Abu LebdaThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said the casualty numbers were higher than the combined number of patients they had treated during mass-casualty incidents over the entire previous year. In data seen by the Guardian, more than 100 of these patients were declared dead on arrival.Just last week, Nuor dodged bullets again: “This is how we get flour in Gaza. We just want to live – enough is enough.” In one video, an Israeli tank is clearly visible, and gunshots can be heard.According to the UN, at least 1,373 Palestinians have been killed since 27 May while seeking food, with 859 killed in the vicinity of GHF sites and 514 along the routes of food convoys.The bullets on the roadA long road runs near the GHF food site in northern Rafah, where crowds gather that are so large they can be seen from space.It is here that Palestinians trying to get food have come under intense fire.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.

Here is alink to the videoinstead.Gunfire near aid site and a survivor's testimony – videoOf the 21 days of shootings at food distribution sites in June in which about 2,000 Palestinians were injured, the Israeli military acknowledged opening fire on “suspects” or firing “warning shots” on eight occasions, but repeatedly denied targeting civilians. In some of these cases, it said it was aware of reports of injuries, and seven cases were “under review”. In several cases, the GHF denied there had been “an incident” in the immediate vicinity of its sites.The British weapons expert Chris Cobb-Smith, commenting on the footage in which gunshots pepper the sand, said the action was “reckless and irresponsible”, adding: “There is no tactical reason to employ small-arms fire to that degree near crowds of non-combatants. It is utterly outrageous.”Trevor Ball, an American weapons expert, said: “If this is intended as warning shots, it is an unsafe practice. Aiming that close to people creates a significant risk of harm or death. Bullets can ricochet, as well as have their trajectory affected by the wind and other non-human, as well as human, factors. These risks increase with distance.”Images of eight bullets removed from people shot near GHF sites were shared with the Guardian by doctors from Nasser hospital.View image in fullscreenBullets taken from patients treated at Nasser hospital who were shot near GHF aid sitesThe weapons experts analysed two of the bullets, using measurements.Ball said: “These bullets are consistent with 7.62x51mm, a standard IDF [Israel Defense Forces] calibre. The other is .50 cal, which is used by IDF machine guns, and some Hamas sniper rifles.”Cobb-Smith found the same calibres and concurred with Ball. He added it was difficult to be specific about the calibre of the other six bullets and attribute them without exact measurements, but that they were all high-velocity rounds, implying probable military issue.‘A deadly scheme’Prof Nick Maynard, a consultant surgeon at Oxford university hospital, has been visiting Gaza since 2010, and has completed three missions to Nasser hospital in Khan Younis since the start of the war. Speaking between surgeries, he said that since the GHF sites opened he had predominantly seen gunshot wounds.The clustering of similar injuries … suggests this is a targeting activity at particular body partsProf Nick MaynardMaynard said he had seen a clustering of similar injuries that coincided with the days when food was distributed – between six and 12 patients coming in with the same injuries – gunshots to the neck, head or arms. “The clustering of similar injuries in one day suggests this is a targeting activity at particular body parts.”He added: “The other night, we admitted four teenage boys, all of whom have been shot in the testicles.”Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.

At the end of May, the Israeli government promised to lift its siege of Gaza so the GHF could set up its centres. Veteran aid groups were denied entry.From the start, the GHF distribution was violent, with more than 400 Palestinians injured in the first week alone, and more than 30 patients dead on arrival at the ICRC field hospital. The first food distribution site was in a zone in west Rafah flagged by Israel for evacuation. To collect food, Palestinians had to defy the orders.Four days later, in June, sporadic machine-gun fire was heard near the GHF site in the early morning hours.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.

His family said he was shot and killed in the same area two days later while trying to collect food.“There is no arrangement, no order, no humanitarian conditions or anything that respects a human being,” Khalifa’s brother said in an interview from a camp for displaced people in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza.Israel’s military admitted firing “warning shots” toward individuals who approached its forces, and the GHF said food was handed out that day without incident.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.

Damn this aid … Either we get them while maintaining our dignity, or we don’t want them. My mother is gone,” he cried outside Nasser hospital while waiting to collect her body.The IDF said its forces had opened fire on a group of people they viewed as a threat but denied targeting civilians, adding that it was investigating the events. The GHF said the incident occurred in an area beyond their secure distribution site and control.Ehab Nuor visited four food sites run by the GHF in June and July, and faced gunfire near all four. All of these sites were within areas the IDF designated for evacuation, placing Palestinians in direct danger.Map showing location of GHF aid sites, IDF military zones and areas under evacuation orders in the Gaza Strip on 13 July 2025Between 16 and 20 June, as the world focused on the war between Israel and Iran, the shootings intensified, injuring 600 Palestinians near food sites.Videos show floodlights cutting through the dark around GHF sites, as an endless stream of Palestinians carry away white flour bags and gunshots ring out.

By comparison, Hamas had some machine guns and captured IDF weapons but these were rarely seen except on ceremonial occasions.All survivors and patients treated by doctors said they had come under Israeli fire.The Israeli military released a video of an IDF spokesperson, Nadav Shoshani, standing near a GHF food site, saying: “The idea is to give aid directly to Gazan civilians and bypass Hamas’s hands … This is a new solution that brings aid directly to the people of Gaza … They have been going in and out peacefully …… They feel safe”.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.

A soldier may argue that they acted reasonably to defend themselves or others. However, it is neither reasonable nor proportionate to fire on unarmed civilians at a distance.”Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam’s policy lead for thePalestinian territories, who has family members trapped in Gaza, believes this is not a humanitarian system. “It’s a deadly scheme,” she said.Recent reportsindicated that some members of the Israeli military had been ordered to open fire on civilians collecting food, whileUS contractors said their colleagueshad fired live ammunition at Palestinians collecting food in Gaza.An IDF spokesperson told the Guardian: “The IDF unequivocally denies the false allegation that it deliberately targets Palestinian civilians. The army’s binding orders prohibit forces operating in the area from intentionally firing at minors. The IDF operates according to international law and upholds the highest ethical standards in its operations.”The IDF said it operated near the new distribution areas to “facilitate the aid efforts while continuing IDF operational activity in the Gaza Strip”, but did not confirm details of the review into incidents of civilian harm. It said that after an examination by its southern command, “instructions [were] issued to field forces following lessons learned”. It added that IDF forces had conducted “learning processes aimed at improving the operational response … and minimising possible friction between the population and the IDF” and this had been achieved through “the installation of fences, signage placement, the opening of additional routes, and other measures”.A GHF spokesperson accused the Guardian of aiding a terrorist organisation and said: “The false and exaggerated statistics used in these reports seem to directly align with the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry … GHF has communicated to the UN and other humanitarian groups that we remain flexible and willing to sit down and address their concerns to find a path forward to collaborate and coordinate to securely deliver the maximum amount of aid possible.”Earlier this week, the US ambassador to Israel called the GHF food distribution “phenomenal”, dismissing reports of IDF fire killing Palestinians as “nonsense”. He announced the possibility of opening 12 more food sites, and commencement of a 24 hour operation.For Nuor, there is no respite. He now starves in a tent along with his family.Additional reporting by Hoda Osman and Zarifa Abou Quora"

I was fond of my school and friends and enjoyed a warm family life filled with laughter. That all vanished whenIslamic State forces invaded our area.When we heard of their approach [IS took control of large areasof northern Iraq and its second biggest city, Mosul, in 2014], we tried to escape but were surrounded by five IS vehicles. The men were separated and they took my father and one of my cousins and shot them in front of us.At the time, aged nine, I was far too young to witness such a scene. I vividly remember crying bitterly out of fear, feeling as though this wasn’t reality but a dream. Even now, I cannot rid myself of the shock and the sound of bullets as my father and cousin were killed. We have never found their bodies.We were taken away and held captive until IS fighters came to our prison looking for young girls. One of them pulled my hair, beat me and pointed a gun at my head in front of everyone, threatening to kill me. My grandmother intervened, pleading with him to let me go, until I fainted from fear.When I regained consciousness, she told me that many girls had been taken to Syria, but not me. We continued to be moved along with large numbers of abducted girls. The older women used to hide us in wooden boxes or refrigerators whenever IS fighters stormed the place searching for us.We were soon moved to a nursery school, where we were forced to learn the Qur’an, pray and wear the niqab, despite our young age. The group holding us started conducting a lottery for the girls to determine their fate between enslavement, rape or domestic service.I was chosen to serve in the house of Abu Aisha, a senior IS leader, where I was subjected to torture and beatings. I was forced to clean his four houses and care for his children. His wife would complain about me and sometimes they would deprive me of food for days. He would beat me with chains and leave me shackled in the rain.Every night, Abu Aisha would choose a Yazidi girl to rape, and I could hear their screamsAbu Aisha used to kill captives with knives and cleavers, and he trained his children to do the same. Every night, Abu Aisha would choose a Yazidi girl to rape, and I could hear their screams as it happened. Their voices ring in my ears to this day. Because I was so young, I was not raped.We were forbidden from speaking Kurdish, our mother tongue, or even Arabic. Communication was strictly in Turkmen because Abu Aisha and his family spoke Turkmen, a dialect of Turkish. “You must speak like us,” they said.When the situation for IS in Mosul began to deteriorate [Iraqi forcesretook the cityin 2017], the group claimed they would allow us to return to our families, but there was a plan to kill us all. They gave us explosive belts and ordered us to wear them to blow ourselves up when we met our families. Luckily, my friend and I managed to cut the wires of the belts.It was a daring move because we had heard a lot about explosive belts and car bombs. To this day, I don’t know how it didn’t explode. Everything was a miracle. I can’t believe how we escaped or endured all that torment. We had no emotions left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That was how Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, described the latest upgrade to ChatGPT this week.The race Altman was referring to was artificial general intelligence (AGI), a theoretical state of AI where, by OpenAI’s definition, a highly autonomous system is able to do a human’s job.Describing the new GPT-5 model, which will powerChatGPT, as a “significant step on the path to AGI”, he nonetheless added a hefty caveat.“[It is] missing something quite important, many things quite important,” said Altman, such as the model’s inability to “continuously learn” even after its launch. In other words, these systems are impressive but they have yet to crack the autonomy that would allow them to do a full-time job.OpenAI’s competitors, also flush with billions of dollars to lavish on the same goal, are straining for the tape too. Last month, Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook parentMeta, said development of superintelligence – another theoretical state of AI where a system far exceeds human cognitive abilities – is “now in sight”.OpenAI takes on Meta and DeepSeek with free and customisable AI modelsRead moreGoogle’s AI unit on Tuesday outlined its next step to AGI by announcing anunreleased modelthat trains AIs to interact with a convincing simulation of the real world, while Anthropic, another company making significant advances, announced an upgrade to its Claude Opus 4 model.So where does this leave the race to AGI and superintelligence?Benedict Evans, a tech analyst, says the race towards a theoretical state of AI is taking place against a backdrop of scientific uncertainty – despite the intellectual and financial investment in the quest.Describing AGI as a “thought experiment as much as it is a technology”, he says: “We don’t really have a theoretical model of why generative AI models work so well and what would have to happen for them to get to this state of AGI.”He adds: “It’s like saying ‘we’re building the Apollo programme but we don’t actually know how gravity works or how far away the moon is, or how a rocket works, but if we keep on making the rocket bigger maybe we’ll get there’.“To use the term of the moment, it’s very vibes-based. All of these AI scientists are really just telling us what their personal vibes are on whether we’ll reach this theoretical state – but they don’t know. And that’s what sensible experts say too.”However, Aaron Rosenberg, a partner at venture capital firm Radical Ventures – whose investments include leading AI firm Cohere – and former head of strategy and operations at Google’s AI unit DeepMind, says a more limited definition of AGI could be achieved around the end of the decade.“If you define AGI more narrowly as at least 80th percentile human-level performance in 80% of economically relevant digital tasks, then I think that’s within reach in the next five years,” he says.Matt Murphy, a partner at VC firm Menlo Ventures, says the definition of AGI is a “moving target”.He adds: “I’d say the race will continue to play out for years to come and that definition will keep evolving and the bar being raised.”Even without AGI, the generative AI systems in circulation are making money. The New York Timesreported this monththat OpenAI’s annual recurring revenue has reached $13bn (£10bn), up from $10bn earlier in the summer, and could pass $20bn by the year end. Meanwhile, OpenAI is reportedly in talks about a sale of shares held by current and former employees that would value it at about $500bn,exceeding the price tag for Elon Musk’s SpaceX.Some experts view statements about superintelligent systems as creating unrealistic expectations, while distracting from more immediate concerns such as making sure that systems being deployed now are reliable, transparent and free of bias.“The rush to claim ‘superintelligence’ among the major tech companies reflects more about competitive positioning than actual technical breakthroughs,” says David Bader, director of the institute for data science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From a technical standpoint, we’re seeing impressive improvements in specific capabilities – better reasoning, more sophisticated planning, enhanced multimodal understanding.“But superintelligence, properly defined, would represent systems that exceed human performance across virtually all cognitive domains. We’re nowhere near that threshold.”Nonetheless, the major US tech firms will keep trying to build systems that match or exceed human intelligence at most tasks. Google’s parent Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon alone will spend nearly $400bn this year on AI,according to the Wall Street Journal, comfortably more thanEU members’ defence spend.Rosenberg acknowledges he is a former Google DeepMind employee but says the company has big advantages in data, hardware, infrastructure and an array of products to hone the technology, from search to maps and YouTube. But advantages can be slim.“On the frontier, as soon as an innovation emerges, everyone else is quick to adopt it. It’s hard to gain a huge gap right now,” he says.It is also a global race, or rather a contest, that includes China.DeepSeekcame from nowhere this year to announce the DeepSeek R1 model, boasting of “powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviours” comparable with OpenAI’s best work.Major companies looking to integrate AI into their operations have taken note. Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, uses DeepSeek’s AI technology in its main datacentre and said it was “really making a big difference” to its IT systems and was making the company more efficient.According to Artificial Analysis, a company that ranks AI models, six of the top 20 on its leaderboard – which ranks models according to a range of metrics including intelligence, price and speed – are Chinese. The six models are developed by DeepSeek, Zhipu AI, Alibaba and MiniMax. On the leaderboard for video generation models, six of the top 10 – including the current leader, ByteDance’s Seedance – are also Chinese.Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, whose company has barred use of DeepSeek, told a US senate hearing in May that getting your AI model adopted globally was a key factor in determining which country wins the AI race.“The number one factor that will define whether the US or China wins this race is whose technology is most broadly adopted in the rest of the world,” he said, adding that the lesson from Huawei and 5G was that whoever establishes leadership in a market is “difficult to supplant”.It means that, arguments over the feasibility of superintelligent systems aside, vast amounts of money and talent are being poured into this race in the world’s two largest economies – and tech firms will keep running.“If you look back five years ago to 2020 it was almost blasphemous to say AGI was on the horizon. It was crazy to say that. Now it seems increasingly consensus to say we are on that path,” says Rosenberg.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingOpenAIChatGPTSam AltmanMetaAlphabetanalysisShareReuse this content"

I was 21, I’d just finished university and my family had been through a rough period. It was time for a new adventure, even if I was mildly anxious about leaving behind all my loved ones. When my best friend, Tegan, suggested a night out, it sounded exactly what I needed, but first she wanted to show me around her new lodgings on Enoggera army base.Tegan had told me stories about the other soldiers she was living with, but there was one guy who kept coming up – an artillery officer named “Gorgeous”. Obviously, he had another name, but when Tegan introduced us, his nickname made a whole lot of sense. He was still in his cams (hello!) and despite never being interested in men in uniform before, my curiosity was piqued.View image in fullscreenEmma and Gorgeous in Melbourne in 2018We shared a cab into town and it became apparent that Gorgeous was easy to talk to, didn’t hoard his smiles and liked to (kindly) tease his friends. Tick, tick, tick. After a few drinks and lots of flirting, we ended the night with several kisses.A few nights later, Gorgeous asked me to dinner. Soon it became clear I wasn’t the only one with travel plans. While mine consisted of picking up casual jobs and making enough money to explore Europe for as long as I could, in a few months Gorgeous was deploying to Afghanistan. Even though whatever we might be starting came with a time limit, we began seeing each other multiple times a week. It didn’t take me long to realise how much I liked him but I pushed those feelings aside because I had a plan – and catching feelings was not part of it.When Gorgeous asked if I’d like to go to Melbourne as his date to a fancy formal dinner for his unit, I said yes even though I knew it was a bad idea; I was already in too deep. After picking me up at the airport (he’d flown down a few days earlier), Gorgeous told me he had news: his deployment had been postponed and now he wouldn’t be leaving until the end of the year.View image in fullscreenEmma and Gorgeous on their wedding day in Brisbane in 2009I was so relieved and at the same time devastated because he would remain in a place where I could be, yet my departure was only two weeks away. It felt impossible to keep denying what we had become to each other and how far we’d strayed from keeping things casual. I then met his parents, and his aunt and grandmother who were visiting from England. He showed me where he’d grown up and then we drove to Puckapunyal, an army training base, for the Regimental Dining In.Once the dinner was finished and we were back in his room in the barracks, I couldn’t contain my feelings any longer. Through tears, I confessed I didn’t know how I was supposed to leave him. And Gorgeous responded just like I could’ve predicted: calmly and gently. He held me as we talked everything through. I’d spent so long telling everyone it was time for me to have an adventure overseas that I’d almost ignored the adventure right in front of me. It didn’t matter that we hadn’t been together long. I didn’t want to go. So I didn’t.View image in fullscreenFamily dogs on a walk in Melbourne in 2022We’ve now been married for 16 years and have two beautiful children, and three of the best dogs have been part of our family. Gorgeous did eventually go to Afghanistan – twice, in fact – but we were able to meet up in Japan on his ROCL (relief out-of-country leave) during his first deployment. We spent two weeks skiing, visiting Disneyland and exploring Tokyo, Kyoto and Shiga Kogen. Since then, we’ve travelled together to the United States, the UK, Europe, New Zealand, Samoa and Fiji.Our story is by far the best adventure I’ve been on and I can’t wait to see what happens next.Emma Mugglestone is the author ofIn the Long Run(Penguin Random House Australia; $22.99), out 12 AugustTell us the moment you knewShare your experienceDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

But it’s not some ‘fancy kennel club’ – this is a serious industryByStephanie Converyin BendigoSat 9 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 9 Aug 2025 21.51 EDTShareIt’s a scant 12C in Bendigo, but scores of fans whirr through the showground’s pavilion. The stars of this weekend’s proceedings hope to shine, but it’s important they don’t sweat too much before their time in the limelight.“They need to keep their hair nice and well done,” says Lee Sadler, vice-president of the Australian Alpaca Association. “We’re all hoping for a good hair day.”The Australian Alpaca National Show is fashion week for local camelids. Throughout the pavilion, pens filled with straw, feed and fans are set up to house the fluffiest, silkiest and shaggiest of the nation’s herd.Some alpacas have made the trip to ruralVictoriafrom as far as Western Australia, and some farmers have travelled from Germany to see the best of Australia’s young but thriving alpaca industry over the three days.View image in fullscreenColoured suri alpacas from Tularosa Stud in the Strathbogie Ranges, Victoria.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The GuardianIt’s an important event: a good hair day here can mean a blue ribbon, a trophy, a business advantage. “When you participate, you take the best of your herd,” says Sadler. At the end of the weekend, the most outstanding of all the classes is crowned Supreme Champion.It’s hard not to be enchanted by the alpacas, with their fluffy coats, long necks, big eyes and eyelashes that would make a supermodel jealous. Not to be confused with their llama cousins, alpacas are smaller, have longer, softer hair, and are generally less spitty and stubborn – though some of the animals strutting their stuff in the ring at Bendigo might give the bossiest llama a run for its money.Friday’s competitive circuit features six- to 12-month-old juniors – alpacas, not handlers – and 12- to -18-month-old intermediates. Pressing closely up to each competitor, one after another, are the judges, identifiable by their white armbands (against which they inspect the details of sample hairs) and that they’re wearing coloured jackets and ties while everyone else is rugged up in black puffers.View image in fullscreenLee Sadler with her Huacaya alpacas from Fleur de Lys Alpacas, South Australia.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The GuardianView image in fullscreenSydneysider Peter Egglestone has a cuddle with a fuzzy-haired alpaca.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The GuardianThe details of a good fleece are only visible up close: things like staple length and fineness, sheen and lustre, even distribution across the animal. A videographer follows the judges and zooms in, the footage livestreamed to a huge screen behind the trophy table so the audience can see what the judges do.Some alpacas loop the ring and pose calmly. Others are recalcitrant, pulling at their halters, refusing to be led in any direction, leaping about – even launching themselves on to their handlers, who try desperately to settle them, acutely conscious that there is no dignified way to wrestle an alpaca.View image in fullscreenMonique Cameron of Desiderata Alpacas coaxes Meleah towards the ring.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The GuardianThere are two distinct types of alpaca: most of those in Australia are Huacaya, which look like fluffy long-necked teddy bears; between 10% and 20% are the longer-haired Suri. Suri look shaggier but their fleece is finer, shinier and sought after in couture and high-fashion suiting.There are about 350,000 alpacas in Australia, though numbers may be higher aftera baby boom a couple of years ago. Australia has the largest herd outside South America – no mean feat for a species that was only introduced here 35 years ago. A 2021 Agrifutures report estimated that more than two-thirds of alpacas were used to produce fibre for sale, and surmised the industry to be worth $19.5m at the time.Herd community: Australian Sheep and Wool Show – in picturesRead moreRon Condon was one of Australia’s first alpaca farmers, and he’s still going. A founder of the alpaca association, he was one of a handful of players integral to the importation of about 400 high-quality Peruvian alpacas between 2000 and 2005, a project that involved not insignificant political manoeuvring, altitude sickness and a particularly bad case of food poisoning – leading to a significant increase in the quality of fleece produced by Australia’s herd. Prior to that, all the alpacas in Australia had come from Chile.“[The Peruvian breeder] said to me in Spanish, ‘You can have anything but my soul,” Condon says. “We had access to his best animals … We were very lucky.”View image in fullscreenEvent co-conveners Jonathon Provis-Vincent and Maddy Bissels.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The GuardianShow convener Jonathon Provis-Vincent has been shearing alpacas for 12 years and breeding them for 10. He met his partner Maddy Bissels through alpacas, and the couple have a herd of about 80 at their farm in Ararat, about 180km west of Melbourne.“They actually do have personality. They each have their own character and little social hierarchy,” Provis-Vincent says.He has fond memories of one of his first alpacas, a female named Galaxy, who he says helped him fall in love with the breed. “You could just walk up to her and hold her and she’d actually lean into you for pats,” he says. “And then if you’re standing there holding her, if you look at her, she then moves her nose up to like give you kisses.”View image in fullscreenAn alpaca exhibits the ‘Flehmen response’, which allows the animals to better analyse scents, especially pheromones.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The GuardianEvery farmer has an alpaca they remember, though farm stories are always flavoured with a particular kind of humour.Ros Davis, from Elimbari Alpacas outside Canberra, tells me about a naughty alpaca named Monet that had a penchant for escaping – an unacceptable hazard for both alpaca and human. “We found him out on the road one night,” Davis says. “We ate him after that.”Soon after Monet had been taken to the butcher, however, she and her husband went into Canberra only to find the town bedecked with banners advertising an exhibition of works by the great (human) artist and their late alpaca’s namesake. “We felt so awful!” she says. “We’d just put him in the freezer!”Most alpaca farmers have only smallish herds, and often have a second income source. That’s changing, though, as the industry ages and some farms become intergenerational. Max Mathews, for example, works at the alpaca farm started by his grandparents. His grandmother, Fay Wilson, holds the halter of his animals in waiting as he and his partner Taryn lead each competitor into the ring.The fashion, arts and crafts community is becoming an increasing presence at the show, as for most alpaca farmers these days, the focus is on breeding for fibre quality rather than stud stock. The market for alpaca meat in Australia is only very niche and limited by infrastructure – namely a scarcity of abattoirs with credentials to work with camelids.Alpaca yarn behaves differently to sheep’s wool, which can take some crafters by surprise, especially if they’re familiar with the bounce and elasticity of merino or corriedale. While the alpaca craft show is modest in size compared to the vast multi-shed spread of Bendigo’s annual Australian Sheep and Wool Show, interest here has also grown. Conveners of the craft competition say they received just 15 entries a few years ago, but had 130 this year.View image in fullscreenFay Wilson with granddaughter-in-law Taryan Mathews of Precision Alpacas, from Baynton in Victoria.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The GuardianIt took some work for alpacas to be seen as a legitimate, viable livestock industry in the eyes of big ag, Sadler says, but she believes they have finally made space for themselves at the table. “We’re not a hobby. This is not a fancy kennel club. We are a sustainable, viable fibre industry.”She is a deep enthusiast for alpaca fibre. “Alpaca is the most insulating natural fibre in the world. It’s light and warm and comfortable. It’s very comforting to wear and it’s difficult to convey that until people actually put it on and they go, ‘oh, it feels so nice’.”Explore more on these topicsAnimalsVictoriaFarmingRural AustraliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

So, as it were,previously on Mektoub My Love…The first film in the series from Tunisian-French directorAbdellatif Kechiche, who had won the Cannes Palme d’Or forBlue Is the Warmest Colour(for which he was famously required to share the award with his two acting leads Adèle Exarchopoulos and Léa Seydoux), arrived in 2017.This first MML (called Mektoub My Love: Canto Uno)turned out to be an epic erotic summer romance set in the early 90s about a guy called Amin (Shaïn Boumedine) who comes back from Paris to his hometown of Sète, having abandoned his medical studies to follow his dream of being a screenwriter, and finds himself immersed in his friends’ intrigues; Ophélie (Ophélie Bau) is engaged to a guy away doing military service, but having an affair with Amin’s cousin Tony (Salim Kechiouche).But the follow-up,Mektoub My Love: Intermezzofrom 2019 was one of the most gobsmackingly weird films ever shown at Cannes: a 212-minute drama featuring a mind-bending continuous three-hour sequence set over one evening in a nightclub. It also showed more of Kechiche’s new softcore sex enthusiasm and obsession with female buttocks. Was this experimentalism deliberate? Was Kechiche, likeWalerian Borowczykbefore him, a serious director pivoting to arthouse-erotica for good? Aghast audiences wondered if they were witnessing a midlife male breakdown in real time.Now the third film is here and … well, it’s shorter at least – just two and a quarter hours, and the only explicit sex is at the end. As with the previous films, the characters’ most serious personal problems seem to co-exist with a dreamily laidback attitude from one and all. But then there is a staggering finale, which had the Locarno audience gasp and splutter with incredulous shock.The situation now is that big-shot Hollywood producer Jack (Andre Jacobs) has improbably come to town with his poutingly discontented young TV star wife Jessica (newcomer Jessica Pennington). He claims that Jessica tried out for the Taxi Driver role that went to Jodie Foster and it’s not clear if this transparent untruth – Pennington and Foster are patently not the same generation – is deliberate. The couple show up at Tony’s family restaurant demanding service, and Amin and Tony wind up delivering couscous to their luxury villa. Amin shows Jack his screenplay – which Jack apparently loves – and Tony does a lot of very dangerous flirting with Jessica. The scene is set for a monumental farcical meltdown.And where on earth are we going with this, given that the last shot of Amin running appears to leave the way open for yet another baffling episode of Mektoub My Love? Could it be a surreal film project that will continue to evolve on an almost improvisational basis? Maybe so.Mektoub My Love: Canto Due screened at the Locarno film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsAbdellatif KechichereviewsShareReuse this content"

Rubber wellingtons from Chanel, kitten heels with visible spongy insoles, embellished Crocs, ghillies-style dancing shoes and various cross-pollinated ballet flats including “sneakerinas” and “jellyrinas” were also in abundance.But it was the toe-spreading styles from Vibram, which start from £105, that were most favoured. Fia Hamelijnck, a Dutch-based creative director, originally bought hers for a hiking holiday. Now she wears them to the supermarket, gym and fashion shows. “I can see people’s eyes widening as they spot them,” she says. “They are ugly. But I like that. It is unexpected.”The catalyst of the divisive trend can be traced back to Maison Margiela’s split-toe tabi shoes, inspired by 15th-century Japanese thong footwear and first launched in 1988. After a viral TikTok in 2023 about a woman’sTinder date stealing hers, the style entered mainstream conversation. Now it is as ubiquitous as a pair of Converse trainers.“Part of the original charm of a tabi-style shoe was to freak people out,” Chodha says. “Today they don’t really repulse any more. So people are looking to push that needle even further.”Twenty years after the Italian company Vibram first launched its barefoot styles, searches for secondhand pairs on Depop are up 296% since April.Balenciaga’s Zero shoeconsists of a 3D-moulded sole with a logoed big toe enclosure.Khaite’s backless mulesinclude a peep hole that exposes the wearer’s big toe, while Tory Burchsells sliderswith an inbuilt metal big toe ring.

Hugo Ekitiké! Milos Kerkez! Jérémie Frimpong! And soon, possibly, Alexander Isak! It’s vital, Bob Paisley always said, to build from a position of strength, andLiverpoolthis summer have certainly done that.If Isak does join, Liverpool’s transfer spending this summer will be approaching £400m, which would be the second-highest figure paid by any club in a single transfer window (behind only Chelsea in summer 2023) – the lack of signings last summer coupled with some canny sales has given them significant profitability and sustainability rules headroom.Liverpool should be title favourites but not because of spending, insists SlotRead moreIf there is a giddiness on Merseyside at the prospect, it’s understandable. Liverpool suddenly have a range of attacking options the like of which no Premier League club has had since perhaps the early days of Roman Abramovich at Chelsea. If pre-season games are anything to go by, it would seem there will be a shift from the 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 hybrid of last season to something more overtly 4-2-3-1, with Mohamed Salah, Wirtz and Cody Gakpo operating behind a centre-forward – at the moment Ekitiké but maybe later Isak.There is a clear sense ofArne Slottaking full command, as Jürgen Klopp’s rejig of the forward line is swept away. Which itself must be thrilling to Liverpool fans: if he could win the league, have them play as they did last season, with somebody else’s players, what could he do with his own? And it is exciting, there is a sense of a new era for the Premier League, of the battle ceasing to be Manchester City against Liverpool or Arsenal and becoming Liverpool against perhaps three challengers, if Chelsea’s performance in the Club World Cup final was indicative of the heights they could reach.But football is an endlessly complicated game; nothing is ever as straightforward as it appears it might be. With any change, there is doubt. In this era when so many coaches have a philosophy, a platonic ideal of the game towards which they are striving, it is one of football’s ironies that often the most successful sides are those that embody a tension.View image in fullscreenArne Slot will be looking to lift the Premier League trophy again, this time with many of his own players, rather than those inherited from the previous manager.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images for the Premier LeagueSlot won with Klopp’s players. Arsène Wenger constructed some of his best football at Arsenal on the foundations left by George Graham. Pep Guardiola finally won the Champions League after the arrival of Erling Haaland, whose reluctance to involve himself in midfield represented a significant point of difference to previous Guardiola centre-forwards. A pure manifestation of a theory without friction seems often less effective, perhaps more predictable, than a system built through compromise.That’s a vague, abstract concern, of greater relevance to future historians than the here and now; it would, after all, be absurd to criticise a manager for fashioning a team to their model of football. But there are more immediate worries. Firstly, by making possibly five major signings, have Liverpool changed too much at once?Every transfer is a risk, but changing almost half a team at once magnifies that risk. This probably isn’t what Liverpool planned. Uncomfortable as it may be to discuss Diogo Jota’s death in terms of its ramifications for squad-building, that is something the club have had to face. Liverpool seem to have acted very sensitively in helping players deal with their grief, but they also suddenly needed to buy a centre-forward.It may be that the new signings gel instantly but it’s entirely reasonable to expect that process of integration to take a few weeks. The more players come in, the longer that is likely to take and that could cost Liverpool a few points that, in a tight title race, could prove crucial. Liverpool perhaps benefited from the reverse last season, getting off to a fast start, winning 11 of their first 13 league games under Slot in part because their lack of summer signings meant nobody (apart from Federico Chiesa) was having to adjust to new surroundings and teammates.Then there’s the question of balance. Jarell Quansah has been sold and while Joe Gomez remains at the club, his injury problems mean he cannot be relied upon. Ibrahima Konaté doesn’t have the best injury record and Virgil van Dijk is 34. That suggests a squad possibly short of a central defender, something highlighted by the fact Wataru Endo, Andy Robertson and Ryan Gravenberch have played in central defence at times in pre-season.Perhaps the plan is at times to use a midfielder in the back four, using possession as a defensive tool in the way Barcelona did with Javier Mascherano, but that would seem a ploy only really applicable to games against cautious opponents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps that’s saying not much more than that Wirtz is a more attacking figure than Dominik Szoboszlai, but that will place additional defensive responsibility on the midfield pairing of Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister. Where Szoboszlai fits in is another question; as well as offering cover for Wirtz, he could perhaps player as one of the deeper midfielders against opponents who sit back and allow Liverpool possession.View image in fullscreenScarves bearing the faces of Liverpool’s new signings Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Hugo Ekitike alongside the late Diogo Jota are seen for sale ahead of the pre-season friendly against Athletic Club.Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty ImagesBut that’s not the only tweak. Salah’s role could change quite significantly. He has always been at his best with a centre-forward who vacates the space for him to sweep into from his position on the right. Ekitiké and Isak are both mobile players, but they are both centre-forwards. They are not facilitators with the instinct to drop deep or pull wide in the way Roberto Firmino or Jota, or even Luis Díaz, did. Nor, in truth, with Wirtz seemingly likely to operate as a No 10, is there even obvious space for Ekitiké or Isak to drop into. That means an adjustment for Salah.It’s not an enormous issue. He’s played perfectly well with Darwin Núñez. There’ll be another tweak with Frimpong overlapping from full-back, going on his outside more frequently than Trent Alexander-Arnold did in later seasons. That should in theory help create room for Salah to dart inside, distracting the full-back, but it’s another element of uncertainty.And that’s the concern for Liverpool. The thrill of the signings is rooted in the pristine possibility, untarnished by experience, of what they could achieve together, but an inevitable accompaniment to that projection is the possibility of failure. The uncertainty of five new signings allows Liverpool to dream, but it also exposes them to doubt.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolInside footballFootball tacticsArne SlotcommentShareReuse this content"

For John Mitchell’s team, Marlie Packer’s suspension and the head injury absence of Emily Scarratt were compensated for by the returns of Ellie Kildunne and the captain, Zoe Aldcroft.The hosts had been keen to avoid the kind of lethargic start that has often cost them dear against elite teams.

The Six Nations champions eventually made the most of their numerical advantage, though, with another driving maul pushing Maud Muir over the line.As has often been the case in recentLe Crunchclashes, France emerged for the second half with a newfound urgency. Bourgeois added another three points within minutes of the restart, after an impressive drive through the heart of the England defence by Teani Feleu.England soon added a fourth try to dash any hopes of a comeback, though, with Megan Jones running in after a quick penalty from a five-metre scrum. The final half-hour was nevertheless a more balanced affair, with France stretching the opposition defence several times but undermining their efforts with repeated handling errors and poor discipline.Momentum swung back in England’s direction in the final 10 minutes. After being held up by excellent France defence a couple of times, Lark Atkin-Davies eventually went over for the visitors’ fifth try five minutes from time. The Bristol front-rower soon scored her second in similar fashion, completing an evening of forward supremacy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The resulting penalty was taken quickly but a long kick straight into touch dashed any hopes of a score to get the 7,500-strong crowd back on their feet.While both sets of coaches had insisted before the match that the final result would not be their primary concern, a 16th consecutive win for England over France (and their biggest in 15 years) will provide vindication of the work done over their summer-long training camp.“It’s a privilege to have this pressure,” Mitchell said, when asked about the expectations for England before their home World Cup. “We’ve earned it over this three-year cycle, it’s not something we’re going to walk away from. We’ve worked hard to be in this position.”For the hosts, their lone warm-up match offered something of a reality check. “We’re disappointed, because clearly we didn’t show what we’ve worked on this summer,” France’s coach, Gaëlle Mignot, lamented. “But we’re a resilient team, we’ll get back to work.“We wanted to play against England to get an idea of how we were doing, and that’s definitely what happened tonight. We know that if we don’t improve in every sector, we’ll have a hard time during the tournament.”The two sides are expected to meet again in five weeks’ time, this time in Bristol for a blockbuster World Cup semi-final.

Having spent much of the past four years struggling to string together wins, she is now as match-tough as she has ever been.She said: “You always feel a little bit of nerves before the first round, but I think that overall, I’m approaching everything in a lot more calm way, mature, and I think I’m trusting a lot more the work I’m doing behind the scenes. I know I’m putting a lot of hours in, and it takes some of the pressure off of the results.”Raducanu puts in hard yards as she targets rankings rise under Roig’s ruleRead moreA far greater test awaits Raducanu, who had received a first-round bye owing to her status as a seeded player, in round three. A Wimbledon rematch is guaranteed as she will either face the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, her conqueror in the third round, or the 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova, whoRaducanu defeated in round twothis summer.Raducanu was supported from the crowd by Roig, who consistently offered tactical advice from his position next to the baseline. Although their partnership is still less than a week old, she believes Roig has already made a positive difference to her game. “I think the way I’m playing, the movements of my shot, improving the quality of my shot,” she said. “There were four or five points where I did something that we were working on, and it’s always really satisfying and rewarding when you hit a shot and you’ve worked on it in practice. So I think I’m going to improve a lot, hopefully doing the work day in, day out.”After their first conversations about her game, Raducanu and Roig quickly agreed that the main focus of their work is improving her overall level. “It’s just, like, the level needs to be better. In a good way, not in a negative way. It’s just calling it how it is,” she said. “And I’m very like that. I’m very kind of factual and I don’t necessarily like fluffing something up. I think that’s where we get on really well and we understand each other. Just in general, everything is like: ‘We need to improve. We need to get every shot better.’ And that’s exciting, because I feel like there’s a lot of potential to go and I don’t think I’m near it.”During her one previous appearance in Cincinnati two years ago, where she dismantled Serena Williams in the final month of her career and Victoria Azarenka in consecutive matches, Raducanu showed that the faster courts here suit her well. This time, however, she had the oppressive heat to deal with. The temperature on Champions Court rose to 30C (85F) with considerable humidity.Raducanu opened the match poorly with three loose unforced errors and a double fault to drop her opening service game to love. Constant aggression from Danilovic, an ultra-offensive lefty with a big serve and forehand but poor movement, allowed the Serb to dictate the majority of the early exchanges. In the opening games, Raducanu was forced to scrap behind the baseline, chasing down balls while trying to elicit unforced errors from her opponent for much of the first set.View image in fullscreenFrancisco Roig has been brought in as Emma Raducanu’s new coach.Photograph: Frey/TPN/Getty ImagesHowever, Raducanu’s depth of service return was brilliant from the beginning, consistently refusing Danilovic the short balls she was looking for behind her first serve. Raducanu also defended well, maintaining her depth and patiently looking for opportunities to take the ball early and attack.

From her uncertain position behind the baseline, she ended a composed, efficient performance striking the ball early and putting Danilovic’s laboured movement under constant pressure as she eased into the third round.One year after missing most of the North American swing, including the Cincinnati Open, before her first round loss at Flushing Meadows, Raducanu is in quite a different position. Her run on the hard courts began with two positive showings, reaching the semi-finals of the WTA 500 event in Washington before winning two matches last week in Montreal. Now she will have another opportunity to test her level against one of the world’s best.Elsewhere, Iga Swiatek, the Wimbledon champion, continued her excellent form by easing into the third round with a composed 6-1, 6-4 win over Anastasia Potapova. Jannik Sinner, the men’s No 1, returned to competition for the first time since his Wimbledon triumph with an easy 6-1, 6-1 win over Daniel Elahi Galán.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

A year after being humbled in the final of the biggest invitation event to be played in Australia, the 18-year-old this time made no mistake, winning all three of his matches convincingly on Saturday night to lift yet another big title.He also crushed Damon Heta’s homecoming dream as he hammered Australia’s top player, the world No 10, in the quarter-finals. After defeating Heta 6-3 in the last eight and Stephen Bunting 7-4 in the semis, Littler outplayed Belgian Mike de Decker to win the final 8-4.Luke Littler beats James Wade to claim World Matchplay crown for first timeRead moreIn 2024, Littler had lost in the showdown 8-1 to former world champ Gerwyn Price, so was determined to put on a show for his Australian fans on his second visit.“It feels very good. It’s another one I can tick off,” Littler said after winning a World Series event for the first time in six attempts this year. “I played very well tonight. I didn’t play so well last night in the first round but tonight is when it really matters.“It’s not gone to plan this year in the World Series but there are plenty of opportunities to win and I’ve finally picked one up,” added Littler, who’s been in superlative form in other events, particularly with his victories in the Premier League and recent World Matchplay.Now he’s after a trans-Tasman double when he moves on to the New ZealandDartsMasters. “A few days off and then Auckland, I can’t wait,” he said of next weekend’s event.The frightening thing for his opponents is that Littler prevailed at the WIN Sports and Entertainments Centre without ever quite hitting his very best form.Perth ace Heta, who had held high hopes of toppling Littler after averaging nearly 110 in his first-round match on Friday, just couldn’t hit those heights again, and the teenager made him pay by reeling off three straight legs from 3-3 to move into the semis, including a 104 checkout in the penultimate game.In the semis, there was some more magic from Littler as he pulled off the biggest finish of the tournament, a maximum 170 “big fish” checkout on the way to beating Bunting.In the final, Littler was always in control once he produced two fantastic legs, one featuring a 143 checkout and the next an 11-darter. It all left De Decker sighing with a rueful smile: “He needs to retire because it’s not fun any more.”Explore more on these topicsDartsLuke LittlerAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The goalkeeper’s departure at the end of the 2022-2023 season epitomises the club’s self-inflicted problems, the sort of business ineptitude that has scarred United and Sir Jim Ratcliffe will demand is a thing of the past.When André Onana, a goalkeeper well-known to the then manager Erik ten Hag, was available for nothing, United allowed De Gea to run down his contract and then spent £40m on the Cameroonian a year later. The logic was lost on everyone, missing out on a fee for the Spaniard, despite a subpar final season, and then splashing out on an inferior replacement.Manchester United seal £73.7m deal for Benjamin Sesko from RB LeipzigRead moreDe Gea took a season off and returned to become the best in class in Serie A. He was the firstFiorentinaplayer sent out to warm up 45 minutes before kick-off at Old Trafford and was given a standing ovation. After all, he won the club’s player of the year on four occasions.Things need to be different with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. They are replacements for high-quality individuals who, for various reasons, are not wanted by Ruben Amorim. Few can doubt Marcus Rashford, now at Barcelona, is a world-class forward and Alejandro Garnacho has the potential to be one of the best wingers on the planet.Chelsea are keento sign him.United’s new front three has cost more than £200m, a sum they will not recoup in sales this summer. Rashford’s wages are being covered, Jadon Sancho is proving difficult to shift and Antony is awaiting offers but a loan is likely.With Sesko in the stands after the confirmation of his transfer on Saturday morning, Mason Mount was, surprisingly, given the false No 9 role, with Mbeumo and Cunha behind to begin with. There was a flow in the final third as the players swapped positions, although that is unlikely next weekend against Arsenal when Sesko is available and Amorim acknowledged United “struggled without a reference as a striker” in his rigid 3-4-3 formation. Rasmus Højlund stayed on the bench, as United went 90 minutes without a traditional No 9, an indication of the Dane’s prospects.View image in fullscreenDavid de Gea acknowledges the applause of the Manchester United fans.Photograph: Molly Darlington/Getty ImagesIt is difficult to learn much about United on this showing. Amorim said he should be judged after a full pre-season with the squad. Come the start of the Premier League, United will be different, as Sesko will be demanding crosses and passes in behind, tactics not possible with Mount as the most advanced forward.The focus on Saturday was on Mbeumo and Cunha, to see what they bring to a team that lacked ideas, creativity and clinical finishing on their way scoring 44 goals in 38 Premier League games and finished 15th. Mbeumo brought a collection of neat touches, bringing teammates into play, but Amorim said United had a “lack of fluidity”. That said, the Cameroon international’s lightness of touch and thought was enough to give optimism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion‘No excuses’: Manchester United admit new £50m training hub must spark successRead moreAttitude is imperative for Amorim, and Mbeumo showed dogged determination to win the ball and chased everything, even if it was forlorn. The manager wants players to set the tempo, that the bare minimum required is 100% effort and Mbeumo has that. In a game played at nowhere near full speed, United still lacked mobility from their central midfield duo of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes.Cunha, on the other hand, is known for walking around the pitch when the ball is not at his feet. When it is, however, he comes alive. He can carry it through defensive lines, turning opponents. Excitement has been lacking at Old Trafford and a player like Cunha can inspire the crowd. Replica Cunha shirts are already popular with fans with the names of Cantona, Beckham and Ronaldo on their backs, because supporters love a maverick. During a break in play, Amorim beckoned Cunha to offer detailed instructions, an indicator that the Brazilian still has plenty to learn.For Sesko to be served, United’s wing-backs will be important. One the right, Amad Diallo brought his own brand of dribbling to attack but without the telling final ball reaching a United player.While the front three has been overhauled, everything behind remains unchanged, so the ease with which United conceded the opening goal was concerning. Two Fiorentina players were left unmarked at the back post from a corner, allowing Simon Sohm a simple finish from 12 yards.View image in fullscreenNew signings Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon and Matheus Cunha are presented to the fans before kick-off.Photograph: Matt West/ShutterstockIt was not the confidence-boosting start United’s defence or Altay Bayindir desired. After a Robin Gosens own goal brought the equaliser, the shootout was settled when Fabiano Parisi’s penalty was saved by the stand-in goalkeeper before Kobbie Mainoo scored to make it 5-4 and United the winners.Fiorentina are United’s only European opposition this season, allowing plenty of time for bonding on the training ground between the new arrivals. Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko may hope to one day receive a send-off like De Gea, who was substituted with minutes to go, receiving his third ovation of the day. United’s hierarchy will be hoping they were waving goodbye to a past era as they look to ignite a new one.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedFiorentinaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Even the presence of Ruud Gullit at sweeper in a visiting side featuring Mark Hughes in attack could not deny Boro a 2-0 win as an exciting decade peopled by, among other luminaries, Juninho, Fabrizio Ravanelli, Nick Barmby, Gareth Southgate, Gaizka Mendieta and Bolo Zenden dawned.Manning and Stephens’ late show earns Southampton dramatic win against WrexhamRead moreAlong the way Boro would reach three League Cup finals, winning one, while also losing FA Cup and, most excitingly, Uefa Cup finals. Not to mention bouncing back from a one-season second-tier sabbatical.Teesside was firmly on not just the UK but the European map. Or at least it was until the economic profile of football ownership changed and Steve Gibson’s club struggled to compete at the very highest level.These days the Riverside rarely rocks to capacity crowds and, after eight seasons out of the Premier League, a relatively modest 26,286 congregated to see how their club’s latest manager, Rob Edwards, shaped up.The good news for Boro fans is that the answer is so far, so good, after Dael Fry’s winning header secured three points. “I’m really pleased,” said Edwards. “It was a tough game but lovely to keep a clean sheet and score from a set piece. Swansea’s strikers had very few touches of the ball and we played some good stuff at times.”Edwards is big on connectivity and has taken the admirable step of attending a plethora of supporters’ events over the summer, canvassing opinions while attempting to tap into the local psyche.Norwich 1-2 Millwall, Boro 1-0 Swansea and more: Championship clockwatch – liveRead moreThe former Luton manager has switched formation to 3-4-2-1 while endeavouring to wean his squad off the increasingly slow possession-heavy approach favoured by Michael Carrick.Edwards wants to see his team in high-tempo, hard-pressing mode but here Boro’s players sometimes seemed to forget Carrick had been sacked and reverted to their old habits.If they experienced a fortunate defensive reprieve when Ronald’s half-volley flew fractionally wide, Swansea’s Lawrence Vigouroux did extremely well to fingertip Morgan Whittaker’s shot on to the barLike Edwards, Alan Sheehan was anxious to endear himself to a newish public in his first competitive match after being promoted from Swansea’s caretaker manager to the real thing.

Snoop Dogg is also scheduled to visit the Liberty Stadium this season and has been forgiven for an unfortunate incident in 2011 when he performed in south Wales wearing a Cardiff replica shirt.Fry headed Boro into an early second-half lead with a stooping connection with Whittaker’s corner. It proved the cue for the home side to take control and only a timely headed interception on Cameron Burgess’s part prevented Hayden Hackney shooting Boro further ahead.View image in fullscreenMiddlesbrough’s Hayden Hackney (left) has plenty of admirers but manager Rob Edwards is relaxed as to whether the player stays or leaves.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAHackney’s eye for a pass dictates that the 23-year-old midfielder does not lack admirers. Indeed Boro recently accepted a £20m bid for Hackney from Ipswich only for a player who has been watched repeatedly by Newcastle, among others, to reject that move. “It’s a win-win situation,” said Edwards. “If Hayden’s here, great; he’s a brilliant player. But, if he’s not, the funds will be available to spend.”Sheehan, too, is presiding over a stylistic shift as Swansea transition from a possession-monopolising approach to a more direct one. “We didn’t create anywhere enough; they made sure we played down the sides a bit too much,” said Swansea’s manager. “No excuses, just disappointment.”The suspicion, though, is that Sheehan’s will be far from the only team to stumble in the shadow of the Cleveland Hills as, 30 years after the Riverside’s doors first opened, Edwards aims to return the good times to Teesside.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipMiddlesbroughSwansea Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

However, the anxiety levels among the fans returned against Steven Pressley’s side, who took the lead in the 51st minute through a Ryan Astley header.The Rangers defender Nasser Djiga was then sent off for a last-man challenge on Finlay Robertson but as the game moved into added time James Tavernier, who came off the bench, levelled from the spot, after Drey Wright pulled down Djeidi Gassama. To add to the consternation of the home support, Cyriel Dessers had the ball in the net in the seventh minute of added time only to be ruled offside.Martin said: “Every club I have been at, it’s a bit of pain and when you get through that pain, it’s so worth it. I don’t think I expected anything less coming here, it’s not going to be a quick fix. This club has not had success for a long, long time.

So it’s not a quick fix and this is not me coming out and making excuses.“I think we change the manager from year to year and nothing really changes. So now it’s about really changing the culture and the feel of the club day in and day out. That will end up in a good outcome. Good process, good people, will always end up in a good outcome. But maybe not so quickly as everyone wants.”Martin was surprised by the boos that rang round the stadium when he brought on Kieran Dowell, along with Nicolas Raskin, to replace Lyall Cameron and Mohamed Diomande. He said: “Yeah, that surprised me. I’m not on any social media or anything like that, so I don’t really know what the narrative is around Kieran. I don’t think it helps him, I don’t think it helps the rest of the guys. That’s how I feel about it really.”David Martindale is excited by the “gamechangers”Livingstonnow possess after Lewis Smith scored a stunning goal to help defeatFalkirk3-1 in the battle of the two promoted teams.

I feel from maybe the previous years in the Premiership, the last season especially, we’ve probably now got gamechangers on the park. There’s boys with real moments of quality.”Stephen Robinson saidSt Mirreninitially showedMotherwelltoo much respect in the their 0-0 draw in Paisley. The visitors dominated for long spells during the opening hour before Robinson adjusted his team and tactics to quell the threat.Robinson said: “We complicated the press a little bit against them, maybe gave too much respect to them and that’s my responsibility. We rectified that, but had we maybe done that right from the start perhaps we could have won the game. So that’s my fault.”His Motherwell counterpart, Jens Berthel Askou, was similarly satisfied at taking something after an opening-day home draw with Rangers. The Dane said: “We had our moments. They also had a few, especially on set pieces, when they brought some balls in the box. But having a clean sheet here is OK.

The 25-year-old Sweden international is training by himself after taking no part in the club’s Sela Cup fixtures against Espanyol and Atlético Madrid, having missed the trip to Singapore and South Korea amid Liverpool’s interest in him.Liverpool’s new era promises excitement – but have they changed too much? | Jonathan WilsonRead moreNewcastle have rejected a £110m offer for Isak, who has three years remaining on his contract, from the Anfield club out of hand, but his situationremains shrouded in uncertaintyas the Premier League opener at Aston Villa approaches. Asked after Saturday’s 2-0 defeat by Atlético at St James’ Park if he may have to let the player go, Howe said: “That’s a decision that I won’t make, that will be for other people to make.“For me, I’m just trying to manage the situation and manage the team, most importantly manage the group of players that I’m working with day to day, that I love coaching and helping. We’re focusing on Aston Villa. Everything else, to a degree, from my perspective is not in my control, so it’s not my focus.”Asked further about a report that Isak had been told he will not be sold this summer, Howe added: “That’s not something I’m aware of. Of course, there’s discussions going on all the time that I’m not party to. I have no knowledge of that.”Newcastle, who signed Isak from Real Sociedad for £63m during the summer of 2022, have placed a £150m price tag on him in an effort to ward off potential suitors, but face a major task to persuade the player to continue his career at St James’ Park. Asked if he believed he could talk his star forward round, the head coach, Howe, said: “If it was that easy, I’d have done it yesterday.”View image in fullscreenEddie Howe has been frustrated in the transfer market this summer.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesThe Isak saga has added greater urgency to Newcastle’s transfer window mission, which has encountered repeated setbacks in recent weeks with Benjamin Sesko, Hugo Ekitiké, James Trafford and João Pedro havingslipped through their fingers.They were already looking to recruit another striker to replace the departed Callum Wilson, and Howe will hope Anthony Gordon does not add to his problems after limping off during Saturday’s friendly.The 47-year-old said: “It’s an ankle problem. We initially maybe thought it was a muscle problem, but the good news is I think it was just a twist, so the initial feeling is he should be OK.”In better news for Howe, Newcastle are understood to be closing in on a deal for Milan’s Germany international defender Malick Thiaw, although he said: “I’ve been preparing these two games the last two days, so I’m not updated on anything that’s happened.” The move would be a breakthrough for Howe in his search for a defender, having missed out on Dean Huijsen earlier in the transfer window,when he moved to Real Madridfrom Bournemouth.Another Newcastle target, Yoane Wissa, did not feature again for Brentford in their training ground friendly against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday following Friday night’s 2-2 draw at the Gtech Community Stadium against the Bundesliga club.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedTransfer windowLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

And more specifically, those who qualify as fit and healthy should be asked to serve in a new national service, offering some free days to a nationwide programme, designed locally, to boost the economy.When awealth taxis ruled out andcouncil tax reformtoo difficult, leaving boomer incomes intact, No 10 should consider such a scheme, especially when it could help to mend a society splintered by almost two decades of austerity; not as a punishment for being the lucky generation, but to reuse and repurpose valuable skills, tackle loneliness and build community cohesion.Young people are often the target ofthose who believe in national service, and that too could be an important initiative when there are about 1 million 16- to 24-year-olds neither in work, education or training.But in 2025, asking boomers to put their shoulder to the wheel (one more time) matters because there could be more than half of the UK’s 12 million retirees, many of themafter taking early retirement, with good health, few outgoings and decent pots of money who could be part of a national programme tapping into their skills and benefiting local services.This would be a voluntary scheme and there should be some obvious grounds for exemption. Anyone who can show they regularly look after grandchildren, work in a community organisation or for a charity can opt out. Poor health would also provide a reason to withdraw.This is not Rishi Sunak’smilitaristic vision of national service. Army uniforms will be kept in the warehouse.There would be a range of options that pensioners – anyone who wants to give something back, or give more back after a lifetime of public service – should find enticing and want to join.The only element of coercion would be the need to actively opt out by attending a government office and saying no, thank you. Plenty of people will tick an opt-out box without a second’s thought. But plenty of people might sign up if they could join a scheme where they could enjoy the company of others and were properly managed.It won’t be easy to set up or to run. Ask National Trust staff about how they handle the many volunteers who turn up to garden or show visitors around the charity’s many properties and they will say it’s a challenge.Many of the jobs that need doing are in services that councils can no longer afford to provide. And before anyone says these should be paid jobs for young people, in most cases council funds will always be too stretched.Pensioners often complain that they are the target of intergenerational fairness campaigners who fail to understand how long they have worked and how diligently they have saved. It’s true that the British pension system is unfair and was made much worse when it was largely privatised in the 1980s. Pensioner inequality is worse than the inequality we see in the working population.And there is the way the state pension age fails to acknowledge when people started work, unlike Spain’s, which gives credit to those who started paying national insurance at 16 or 18.Poverty and inequality is a subject to be addressed by the newPensions Commission.National service is more about achieving outcomes for the community by bringing people together as part of a government-supported programme. Lots of older people who report being lonely are also suffering from physical and mental health problems. A national service of support workers could help them to recover some joy in later life.In Japan, older people are encouraged to look after their peers in their community who are not so fit and healthy. It is a recognition that feeling well and being active in your 60s, while partly a result of good lifestyle choices, is mainly the outcome of good genes.A broken housing market is driving inequality right across Europe – and fuelling the far right | Kirsty MajorRead moreLikewise, healthy pension pots are a matter of good luck: luck that you were born in an era when employers promised generous occupational retirement schemes or when stock markets soared, usually from the sheer weight of baby boomer cash deployed in equity investments.Many have enjoyed tax relief at 40% when building their pensions and pay tax at 20% in retirement, while poor pension savers have the same tax on the way in and on the way out of the pension system.Luck is not something many boomers like to admit is the reason for their comfortable financial situation. They prefer to pat themselves on the back for all their good decisions. They shouldn’t.Better-off boomers will be wary of proposals for a wealth tax. They will vote against council tax reform, which would clobber them for living in large, high-value properties. So if they are not donating their money, let’s encourage them to devote some of their time.An ageing population means that the very notion of retirement needs to be reconsidered. Raising the retirement age is one approach. A national service could be a more palatable alternative.Explore more on these topicsBusinessPensionsTax and spendingcommentShareReuse this content"

Bad political decisions made it soDaniel TrillingIn the frenzy of racism and culture warring, the issue of why hotels are used gets overlookedSat 9 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 9 Aug 2025 03.58 EDTShareAbroad section of Britain’s right has spent the summer behaving as if it would like a repeat of last year’s racist riots. As politicians and commentators cry “tinderbox Britain” – are they warning us, or willing it on? – far-right extremists have been actively trying to stoke violence. This year, they have pinned their hopes on asylum hotels, an issue where public fears over crime, immigration and the welfare state conveniently converge.In some places, far-right activists have piggybacked on protests prompted by local grievances. The most significant this year wasin Epping, Essex, after an alleged sexual assault by an asylum seeker led to demonstrations that turned violent when they were joined by members of various far-right groups. A similar pattern has unfolded in London’s Canary Wharf,after untrue rumoursthat some of the Epping hotel residents were being moved there. In other cases, far-right activists have themselves organised the protests. A call has gone out among their online networks for gatherings this weekend in several parts of England.It is unlikely – though not impossible – that the end result will be on the scale of the riots we saw last summer, since that was triggered by a shocking act of murder followed by widespread misinformation and conspiracy theories about the identity of the killer. But anti-fascist campaigners I’ve spoken to believe it may cause lower-level disturbances like those seen in Epping and inKnowsley, Merseyside, in 2023, and it will certainly help ensure that asylum hotels remain a contentious topic for many months to come.One question, however, often goes unanswered: why are asylum seekers being accommodated in hotels in the first place? Before 2020, the phenomenon hardly existed, yet by its peak in 2023 there weremore than 55,000 peoplein hotels, waiting many months to have their asylum claims processed. (Today the number has dropped to about 30,000.)For some, the answer will be: “because there are too many people seeking asylum in the UK and we don’t have the resources to support them”. This is misleading. Although Britain has seen higher numbers of asylum applications in recent years, according toOxford University’s Migration Observatorythey are not exceptional when compared with those of other European countries. Yet the UK relies on costly hotel accommodation far more heavily than any of its neighbours.A series of actions by both Labour and Conservative governments since the turn of the century has brought us to this point. The first was the decision by Tony Blair’s government to make people seeking asylum heavily reliant on state support. Until mid-2002, asylum seekers could take up jobs if they had to wait more than six months for an initial decision on their asylum claim. Much of the press disliked this, saying it allowed asylum seekers to take other people’s jobs. So the government in effectbanned them from working. (In many other European countries, people seeking asylum are still allowed to work after a waiting period.)If a government bans people from working then it needs to provide them with essential support, unless it is happy for them to starve to death on the streets. At first, accommodation waslargely providedby local councils’ housing departments. But politicians took a second decision, which was to privatise the accommodation. This began in the late 2000s, but the really important step was taken by David Cameron and Nick Clegg’s coalition government.In 2012, as part of the coalition’s wider austerity drive,asylum accommodation was outsourcedto the same profit-driven contractors that now run many of our public services. The contractors often failed to provide decent housing or value for money and the government had torewrite the contracts. Even then, problems persisted: by the end of the decade, it was becomingincreasingly commonto house asylum seekers in “contingency accommodation” such as short-term lets and hotels.The third decision, taken by the governments of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, was to sabotage the asylum system itself. During the first Covid lockdown in 2020, people seeking asylum were placed in hotels – which, at the time, were largely empty anyway –for public health reasons. This coincided with a rise in the number of people crossing the Channel by small boat, as opposed to stowing away in lorries as they had largely done previously. (Many people who choose such routes do so because they do not have the option of a safe resettlement scheme, such as the one the UK has offered to Ukrainian refugees.)The Conservative government encouraged hostility towards small boat journeys,describing themas an “invasion”. Instead of moving asylum seekers out of hotels and into more suitable accommodation when the pandemic subsided, it kept them there while it builtprison-likeencampmentsas an alternative. (These schemes mostly never got off the ground.) At the same time, it allowed abacklog of asylum applicationsto grow – and thentried to banmany asylum seekers from claiming asylum at all, saying it would instead deport them permanently to Rwanda. (That scheme never got off the ground either.)All the above has led to more asylum seekers living in more hotels for longer, in more parts of the country. At its root, it is a story of public penny-pinching and market forces causing a problem that is then made worse by politicians promising a quick fix or finding a convenient scapegoat. If that sounds familiar then perhaps it’s because it’s a story we also find in our hospitals, schools and wider communities.This could be an occasion to ask what has gone wrong with the state more generally, and to talk about what could be done to make it work better for everyone. Keir Starmer’s governmenthas promisedto end the use of hotels by 2029, by investing in the asylum system and reducing small boat journeys. But if it is unwilling to have that wider conversation, then the right is ready with its own seductive, destructive answers.Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe and Bloody Nasty People: The Rise of Britain’s Far RightDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Information aboutJoe Biden’s police funding planhas been restricted, along with a post about anup-and-coming political party. Gamerssay theyhave been unable totweak colours in gamessuch as Minecraft. And it’s all because of a new age verification law.Since the child safety provisions contained within theOnline Safety Actcame into effect on 25 July, web service providers have been forced to institute “highly effective” age verification measures to prevent children from accessing “harmful” or “adult” content. The penalty for failing to adequately comply with the act includes hefty fines and potential criminal action.But while the law and others like it claim to be narrowly focused on pornographic content and material that promotes suicide, self-harm, eating disorders or abusive and hateful behaviour, the subjective nature of the restrictions has led to mass censorship, with the de facto removal of vast swaths of content from the web. Tech companies find it easier and cheaper to simply remove mass amounts of information than have something slip through and be deemed non-compliant.The Online Safety Act is just the latest in a troubling global trend towards a more censored internet, within which governments and data harvesters have obliterated privacy and everything you do online is logged, tracked and monitored.AustraliaandIrelandhave passed similar age verification measures. Denmark, Greece, Spain, France and Italy havestarted testing a common age‑verification app, paving the way for potential mandatory EU-wide use.In the US, 11 states areseeking to passage verification laws. In 2022, Louisiana passed a law requiring age verification on all websites on which at least a third of the content is of an adult nature. Since then, states including Ohio, Arizona, Wyoming, Pennsylvania and New Jersey , among others, have pursued similar legislation, mandating age verification to access “harmful” or “adult” material. On a federal level, theKids Online Safety Act, which would prevent all underage users fromaccessing certain content, was revived last year in Congress and could move forward any day.While preventing kids from allegedly harmful content online sounds like a great idea, these laws set the stage for authoritarian censorship, violate young people’s core civil liberties, forcibly expose users to significant privacy risks and utterly fail at their goal of “protecting kids”.Many people mistakenly believe that only children will have to verify their identities online under such laws, but that is false. In order to determine who is a child, all users, no matter who they are, will be forced to turn over vast troves of valuable biometric data and for ever link their offline identity to their online behaviour. The data collected could then be weaponised by the government or bad actors, and put internet users at significantly higher risk of crimes such asidentity theft and fraud.Age verification is a massive gift to big tech. Persona, the leading third-party identity verification platform, recently announced a$2bn valuationafterits latest funding roundco-led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. Additionally, only the largest and most powerful tech platforms have the resources to enact age verification at scale, meaning smaller indie social networks and non-profit driven platforms for services such as patient support groups or online communities for addicts and disabled people could be forced to shut down. The loss of these communities, which are a lifeline for people struggling, will be devastating. “Alcoholics Anonymous has gone,”one Reddit user postedafter the UK’s age verification laws went into effect. “As a non tech savvy recovering alcoholic this is a bummer as I used to get some hope and support from the subs.”Age verification laws are also preventing people in the UK from accessing news and journalistic content. Immediately after the child safety rules came into effect, platformsbegan classifyingbreaking news footage, war coverage, investigative journalism and political protest material as harmful content. Even some content onWikipedia could soon be blocked. The platform ischallenging the law due to concerns its anonymous volunteers and readers could have their privacy violated.This mass gating of information prevents young people from accessing independent reporting and community analysis of breaking news. It removes opportunities for critical thinking and civic understanding, and isolates young people from global perspectives and connections. It ensures we have a less informed public and that young people are fed a steady diet of sanitised, government‑approved narratives until the age of 18.None of this keeps kids safe or away from harmful material. Use of VPNshas rocketed, raising even more privacy risks and shuffling kids into evenmore extreme, less regulatedcorners of the internet.Despite the disastrous British rollout, US lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle are giddily seeking to replicate the act. Democrats and Republicans are completely aligned on restricting free speech and anonymous use of the internet. Last year, at a summit for content creators at the White House attended by Biden, the then president, his adviser Neera Tanden spoke about the administration’s goal of removing all anonymity from the web. She asked content creators to raise their hands if they wanted to “unmask every troll”.Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, has partnered with Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, to co-sponsor the Kids Online Safety Act, which Blackburn said was necessary toprotect kids from “the transgender”in society. The Heritage Foundation, the hard-right thinktank that authored Project 2025, has said openly that the Republican party will use the Kids Online Safety Act to getLGBTQ+ content removedfrom the web, and suggested itcould be influenced to promote “pro-life values” under the guise of child safety.The public cannot afford to be complacent. We need to do everything in our power to fight for free speech, privacy and open access to information while we still can. Once the infrastructure for online censorship is built, it will be impossible to dismantle it. The era of a free, open and diverse internet that fosters creativity and connection and incubates social justice movements will be over.We must refuse to allow the government and the media to normalise mass censorship in response to amanufactured moral panicabout technology and social media. We need to root out opportunistsmaking the false and hyperbolic claimsabout the internet that these laws are predicated on. And we need to use our voices to fight back, loudly, against these “child online safety bills” that erode our civil liberties and will destroy the internet as we know it. These laws are not about protecting kids. They are about censorship, control and authoritarianism.Taylor Lorenz is a technology journalist who writes the newsletterUser Magand is the author of the bestselling book Extremely Online: The Untold Story of Fame, Influence, and Power on the Internet.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyOpinionInternetChild protectioncommentShareReuse this content"

Weird!Sat 9 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 9 Aug 2025 05.01 EDTShareHere’s a sentence I never thought I’d write:Marjorie Taylor Greene, a far-right conspiracy theorist and bigot who also happens to be a Republican congresswoman, has suddenly started to speak (a small amount of) sense. It’s unclear what exactly precipitated it, but the Georgia congresswoman has declared war on her fellow Republicans.“The course that [the Republican party] is on, I don’t want to have anything to do with it,” Greene told the Daily Mail last week.Greene went on to complain that her male colleagues treat their female peers badly, referencing the Trump administration pulling Elise Stefanik’s nomination for United Nations ambassador in favor of Mike Waltz. To refresh your memory, just a couple of months before getting confirmed as US ambassador to the UN, Waltz wasousted as national securityadviser after it was revealed he had mistakenly added a journalist to a private Signal chat used to discuss strikes in Yemen. Weird how some people – and by “people” I mean well-connected white men – have a way of always failing up.“[Stefanik] got screwed by the White House,” Greene told the Mail. “I think there’s other women in our party that are really sick and tired of the way men treat Republican women.” Which is interesting wording: Greene doesn’t seem to care about how Republican men treat women in general, just the ones in the party. Still, baby steps and all that. It’s certainly amusing to see Greene suddenly have a revelation that a party led by alegally defined sexual predatormay have some disturbing views about women.Greene seems to be having a lot of revelations lately: sherecently becamethe first Republican lawmaker to say that there is a genocide happening in Gaza. She also criticized the Florida representative Randy Fine for dismissing a report about Israel’s forced starvation in Gaza as propaganda and writing“starve away”on social media.Fine, by the way,has previously saidGaza should be nuked andposted thatPalestinians are “demons that live on Earth … they only deserve death.” There’s always very little outrage from lawmakers,or media coverage, about his hateful remarks because anti-Palestinian racism is a bipartisan position in the US.To be clear, I don’t think Greene’s comments about Gaza have anything to do with empathy for Palestinians. Unfortunately, I also don’t think her comments were prompted by an analysis of thegrowing consensusfrom respected experts that a genocide is under way. Rather, it’s more likely that Greene, a Christian nationalistwho has a history of promoting Islamophobic and antisemitic conspiracy theories, is motivated by antisemitic impulses here. Let me be unequivocal about this: while she may occasionally be making more sense recently, Greene is no friend to the Palestinian cause specifically or progressive issues more generally.Nevertheless, it’s still fun to watch the congresswoman sow discord in the Republican party by calling for a release of theEpstein files,criticizing US strikes in Iranand denouncing Fox News. On Wednesday, for example, she took aim at the Fox News personalityMark Levin, who called the congresswoman a “lunatic”, by calling Fox News irrelevant.“[M]ost of the people that watch Fox News are very much up in age, the baby boomer generation, who I love … but that’s their biggest audience. That’s not the future of America,” the congresswoman said. That statement echoes comments shemadeto the former Florida Republican lawmaker Matt Gaetzin June, when she called Fox News and the New York Post “propaganda” and “neocon network news”.In that same conversation she said: “We have propaganda news on our side, just like the left does, and the American people have been brainwashed into believing that America has to engage in these foreign wars in order for us to survive, and it’s absolutely not true.”Keep going, Marjorie! While I can’t stress enough that MTG is no ally, that doesn’t mean she’s not an accidental asset when it comes to destroying the Republican party. I’ve lost any hope that the Democrats, a party that largely consists of self-interested careerists who don’t believe in much other than their own advancementandarehappytohelp fund a genocide, will mount any sort of meaningful fight against the worst instincts of Trumpism. When Maga eventually collapses it will be frominfighting, not Democratic opposition.Trump names registered sex offender to lead children’s sports initiativeLawrence Taylor, a former New York Giants linebacker and registered sex offender has been appointed to a council that willadvise on mattersincluding youth sports. I can’t wait to hear fromall the anti-trans “feminist” writerswho declared Trump a “feminist hero” and “feminist icon” after he used an executive order to “protect” women by ensuring trans women couldn’t compete in women’s sports.Why are people throwing sex toys at US women’s basketball games?“The dildo is a weaponized farce,” writes Lee Escobedoin the Guardian. “It’s thrown not just to interrupt but to dominate the narrative, to remind players that their gender, their careers and their stage remain vulnerable to mockery.”Sexism and misogyny drive record levels of abuse at English football gamesIt’s not just basketball that has amajor misogyny problem.I regret to inform you that there is ‘breast milk ice cream’ nowAnd of courseit’s going viral.Women shouldn’t hold office, says Republican woman running for officeArizona state senate hopeful Mylie Biggs, the daughter of Republican representative Andy Biggs, told a podcast last year that she wouldn’t “vote for any female [and] I don’t know if females should be in office”.Musk’s Grokgenerates fake Taylor Swift nudeswhen you put it on ‘spicy’ modeMusk once offered toimpregnate Swift.

It would be nice if we didn’t have to depend on the largesse of billionaires for women’s health funding.Reportreveals abuse of pregnant womenand children at US Ice facilitiesYet more evidence that the “pro-life” crowd, who have little to say about this, are not “pro-life” they are simply pro forced birth.What is the real death toll in Gaza?In acolumn this week, I argued the 60,000 figure is a major undercount. Responding to my column, Rachel Taylor, executive director ofEvery Casualty Counts, an international NGO that works to document casualties of armed violence, pointed out the following: “The Gaza population register is managed by theIsraeli ministry of interior– they certify all births and deaths in Gaza. The Israeli authorities could immediately dispel all doubts about the number of deaths in Gaza by releasing the registered fatality figures from the past two years. But they choose not to. Why?”Sandra Domínguez fought against femicide in Mexico, then became a victim herselfDomínguez and her husband were found dead earlier this year and, while it’s not clear who killed them, her family believe her murder was tied to her feminist activism in Oaxaca.“Oaxaca is the most dangerous state in Mexico for activists,” the Guardianwrites in a piece about Domínguez. “Since 2018,58 people have been murderedand six more are missing.”Meta illegally collected data from period and pregnancy app, jury findsI know, I know: hard to believe that Meta would bedoing something dodgy with people’s sensitive data.

Or so it seems, considering how often that word is thrown around in public life these days.This year alone, Zarah Sultana, the former Labour MP and founder of a new left party with Jeremy Corbyn, called the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, a “billionaire-backed grifter” (perhaps borrowing from thelanguage of Coutts staffwho referred to him as a “disingenuous grifter” when his bank account was closed two years ago). Sultana, in turn, was accused of being a“grifter” duping “honest socialists”by the journalist Paul Mason.When giving evidence at the Covid inquiry, the Spectatoreditor and former cabinet minister, Michael Gove, called the lawyer Jolyon Maugham, whose Good Law Project campaign group pursued PPE contract cases, a “politically motivated grifter”. Meanwhile, the journalist and author James Ball accused the New York University history professor Ruth Ben-Ghiat of“resistance grift”for suggesting the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, is trying to control the population by spreading disease.In a recent podcast, the Atlantic writer David Frum called Donald Trump’s presidencythe “grift machine”, while the US president was alsocalled “grifter-in-chief”by Florida congressman Maxwell Frost. Two years ago, it was the Sussexes who were memorablycalled “fucking grifters”by Spotify’s head of podcast innovation, Bill Simmons, after their multiyear deal with the platform ended after just 12 episodes.From 2017-24, the written use of the word “grifter” has more than doubled, according to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). But over the past few months in particular, it has been striking how often the term – both grifter and grift – is cropping up in our political discourse. In April this year, it made its debut in parliament: it wasused in a House of Commons debateon the impact of digital platforms on democracy by the Liberal Democrat MP for Cheltenham, Max Wilkinson. “You find a mad and hateful narrative. You tell everyone it is free speech, and before you know it, you might be lucky enough to become a successful online grifter with your top off,” he said. “Perhaps you will be an MP, or maybe even the president of America.”“Grifter”, according to the OED, is a variant of the US slang “grafter”: someone who “makes money by shady or dishonest means; a thief; a swindler” – or “one who practises ‘graft’, especially in public life; a politician, official, etc, who misuses his or her position in order to reap dishonest gain or advantage”. That second meaning has clearly captured the political zeitgeist. “It’s a kind of shorthand for inviting suspicion about the methods and motivations of someone with an opposing viewpoint,” Fiona McPherson, an executive editor at the OED, told me.Why is it that we’re not only disagreeing with our political opponents, but assuming they are con artists somehow profiting from what we deem to be their bad opinions, policies and rhetorical style? Spivs who are in it for nefarious ends rather than simply wrong-headed?When you search the term “grifter” on sites such as Reddit and TikTok, it is often used in relation to influencers – wellness gurus, pickup artists, life coaches, crypto bros. So many online subcultures now dabble in essentially the same business model: sowing insecurity and then charging people with the promise to rid them of it. Wherever the algorithm leads you, from sleep coaches for knackered new mums to gym rats for lonely boys, you are likely being exposed, day in, day out, to some form of grift.When politicians themselves mimic such influencers – Farage and the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, for example, now trade into-camera vertical videosthat gain millions of views – it is hard to ignore the similarities. Suspicions of British politicians’ motives in general are high, sparked by the 2009expenses scandaland intensifying over the past few years ofcrony Covid contractsand ministersbagging freebies.View image in fullscreenRobert Jenrick engages with a man he claims has dodged a fare in a video made for social media at King’s Cross station.Photograph: @RobertJenrickThe rise of the “true scam” genre also reveals our morbid fascination with grift. From theTinder SwindlertoFyre festival, andTheranosto theCaptain Tom Foundation, stories of the hubris and humiliation of people perceived to be on the make with our money dominate TV documentaries, long-form journalism and investigative podcasts. All this and you can barely open your banking app today without warnings about the nefarious means used by scammers to winkle money out of you. Fraud is themost common crimein England and Wales, with the highest number of casesrecorded last year.In the resulting atmosphere of ambient paranoia, perhaps it’s little wonder we’re on the lookout for “grifters” – and why the insult appears to resonate. So welcome to the Age of Grift: if you’re not spotting it, you’re probably on the end of it.Anoosh Chakelian is Britain editor of the New StatesmanExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionSocial mediaDigital mediaScamsConsumer affairscommentShareReuse this content"

Blood is on his handsMohamad BazziAt several points during his presidency, Biden could have stopped starvation from spreading in Gaza. He didn’t do thatSat 9 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 9 Aug 2025 06.01 EDTShareIn March 2024, the global authority on food securitywarned that Palestinianswere experiencing “catastrophic levels of hunger”, and famine was imminent in northern Gaza as Israel continued its siege of the territory.That reportwas one of the most direct warnings from the UN and international relief groups, which had been raising alarms about the potential for widespread starvation in Gaza since December 2023.Joe Biden was in the White House at the time, and his administration not only failed to heed those repeated warnings, but it worked to undermine UN agencies and humanitarian groups that tried to focus attention on Israel’s use of starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza. Today, Donald Trump and his administration are deeply complicit in the human-madefamine unfolding in Gaza, but it’s important to remember that US complicity predates Trump – and it’s another stain on Biden’s legacy as president.At several points during his presidency, Biden could have stopped starvation from spreading inGaza, if his administration had listened to warnings from the UN and aid groups and used them as an impetus to limit unconditional US military support for Israel. Biden’s record is not only shocking for the multiple missed opportunities he had to change course, but for his callousness toward the suffering of Palestinians.When will we finally admit: the Gaza death toll is higher than we’ve been told | Arwa MahdawiRead moreTop Israeli officials made no secret of their intention to starve Gaza’s population of 2.2 million, within days of the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. Two days later, Israel’s then defense minister,Yoav Gallant, declared: “I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed.” He added: “We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.” By December 2023, the UN’s hunger monitoring group, Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC),warned in a reportthat more than 1 million people in Gaza were facing widespread starvation within several months unless Israel eased its restrictions on aid.The IPC, which includes the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization and other agencies, was set up in 2004 to sound the global alarm on food shortages and starvation that could lead to famine. (Itdeclared faminesin Somalia in 2011 and South Sudan in 2017, although a formal declaration of famine is retroactive and often lags behind deteriorating conditions on the ground.) Last month,the IPC warnedin an alert that the “worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out” in Gaza, although the group still has not officially declared a famine.In February 2024, Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, warned of the speed and scale of Israel’s mass starvation campaign. “We have never seen a civilian population made to go so hungry so quickly and so completely,”he told the Guardian, echoing reports by UN agencies and humanitarian groups showing that Israel wasdeliberately blocking foodand other aid from entering Gaza, and usingstarvation as a weapon– a war crime under international law.With such detailed warnings, the Biden administration and Israel’s other western supporters could not claim that they didn’t know the severity of hunger in Gaza, and the extent of Israel’s policy ofintentionally starvingPalestinians. As the alarms of imminent famine intensified in the spring of 2024, Biden could have acted by pressuring the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to allow more food into Gaza and enforcing US laws which ban weapons shipments to US allies that obstruct humanitarian aid.Biden did not have to become so deeply complicit in Israel’s war crimes – his administration had the political leverage and legal mechanisms to restrain Netanyahu and end the war, saving thousands of Palestinian lives and many of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Instead, Biden and his aides contorted themselves to keep sendingbillions of dollarsin US weapons that enabled Israel to continue its genocidal war.And in the process of justifying his ineffective and morally bankrupt policies, Biden not only ignored warnings over the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza, he flouted US law and his own administration’s rules. In February 2024, Biden issued a new national security memo that required the state department to certify that recipients of US armswould abide by international lawand allow the delivery of humanitarian aid during active conflicts. The memo relied on existing US laws, especially the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act, which forbids the US government from providing weapons to a country that blocked American humanitarian aid, as Israel haddone repeatedlyduring the Gaza war.By May 2024, the Biden administration had a chance to use that law to restrict its weapons shipments to Israel and pressure Netanyahu into ending the war. Instead, the state department sent a 46-page report to Congress full of bureaucratic double-speak, which avoided concluding that the Israeli militaryhad violated international lawwhile using US weapons or that Israel had obstructed aid from reaching Gaza. If the administration had reached those conclusionsin its report, Biden would have been able to suspend most arms deliveries to Israel, arguing that he was upholding US law. But Biden decided to continue enabling Netanyahu to kill thousands of Palestinians and to expand his siege of Gaza.In October 2024, the Biden administration had another opportunity to change its policy when two of its top officials – then secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and defense secretary, Lloyd Austin –sent a letter to Israeli officialswarning that they must take “concrete measures” to ensure that civilians in northern Gaza had access to food, medicine and other basic needs. US officials threatened that they could suspend military support to Israel if conditions did not improve within 30 days. Despite that ultimatum, the amount of aid reaching Gaza that month had dropped to itslowest level in 11 months.After the US deadline passed in November 2024, the Biden administration did nothing and continued sending weapons to Israel, ignoring international condemnation and US law. As he had done since the Hamas attack in 2023, Biden sheepishly told the world that he would not impose any consequences on Israel, and would continue to protect Netanyahu’s government at the UN and other international bodies.But Biden’s most craven attempt to undermine humanitarian groups working to raise awareness of potential famine in Gaza – and to protect Israel’s indefensible starvation policy – came during his final weeks in office. In late December, the Biden administration forced a US-funded organization, the Famine Early Warning System, toretract a reportthat warned of imminent famine in northern Gaza.At that point, Trump had already won the US presidential election, and Biden no longer faced any political repercussions for breaking with Netanyahu. Yet Biden still couldn’t bring himself to acknowledge the suffering he had enabled Israel to inflict on Palestinians in Gaza. And that is Biden’s legacy: complicity in Israel’s starvation and other war crimes until his last days as president.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsJoe BidenOpinionGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

It would be 14 years, three criminal prosecutions and two jury trials before the full truth would emerge.”Ian Foxley had just started a job at a British company in Riyadh when he began to notice payments that didn’t add up. The company culture also struck him as a odd: when he joined, he was warned against talking to an accountant named Michael Paterson, deemed a “madman”. But, when Foxley’s attempts to report irregularities within the company went nowhere, he contacted Paterson. This fascinating longread by David Pegg follows what happened next when the two met, and the major secrets that would be uncovered.Read more2.‘The world is on edge’: five tumultuous weeks with David Lammy, foreign secretary at a time of crisisView image in fullscreenDavid Lammy gets a grilling.Photograph: Harry Borden/The GuardianDavid Lammy’s first year at the Foreign Office has been hit by a string of high-stakes conflicts, from the unfolding horror in Gaza to regime change in Syria and Trump’s humiliation of Zelenskyy. In this interview, journalist Charlotte Edwardes shadows the foreign secretary for five weeks. She had originally planned to meet him in Washington DC, but his trip was cancelled after Israel bombed Iran. Instead, she tails him as he meets the French foreign secretary at London’s British Library, greets constituents in Tottenham, and is met by a crowd of protesters in Peterborough, chanting about genocide and children orphaned – all the while grilling Lammy about Trump, Putin, the Labour party, and why “Gaza is the wound that will not heal”.Read more3.‘A yorkshire pudding like a dishcloth’: how did British pub food get so grim?View image in fullscreenChicken dinner, anyone?Photograph: clubfoto/Getty Images/iStockphoto“We like to think the bad old days of British cuisine, the days when it was a national embarrassment, are far behind us, that the 1990s and 2000s ushered in a wave of quality gastropubs and that the shires are bursting with talented chefs cooking local produce from scratch. In some cases, that is true, but more broadly – in my view, at least – pub food in the UK is on the decline.”Steve Rose is tired of eating £30 pub meals that taste like reheated leftovers. He has spoken to food writers, pub owners and caterers about the reasons behind the decline of Britain’s pub grub – and receives useful tips on how to avoid future disappointment.Read more4.The end of the road? What The Salt Path scandal means for the nature memoirView image in fullscreenRaynor Winn with her husband, Moth.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianWhen Raynor Winn’s The Salt Path was published in 2018, the memoir about the author’s transformative long-distance walk along the UK’s South West Coast Path became an instant hit. It sold more than 2m copies, led to more bestselling books by the author, and resulted in a film adaptation starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs. Then, last month, the Observer reported major inconsistencies in Winn’s story.“The Salt Path Affair”, as Alex Clark calls it here, taps into a broader question about what we want from the nature memoir. Tales like The Salt Path follow a well-worn narrative in which a struggling individual eventually finds healing and redemption in the great outdoors. What does the popularity of such stories, the piece asks, reveal about our relationship to the natural world – and will the fallout from the The Salt Path Affair damage the future of these books?Read more5.He worked with artificial limbs for decades.

We’re bringing a knife to a knife fight, and we are going to fight fire with fire.”It was a brutally honest acknowledgement of what a decade of Donald Trump’s politics has wrought. Out go the courtly and courteous playing-by-the-rules Democrats convinced that Maga is a passing phase,a fever that will break. In come a new generation of pugnacious Democrats prepared to take off the gloves and fight dirty.The trigger for thisscorched-earth approachis Trump’s push to find more Republican seats in the House of Representatives ahead of next year’s crucial midterm elections through gerrymandering, a process of manipulating electoral maps to benefit one party over another.At the president’s urging, Texas Republicans have proposednew congressional districtsaimed at flipping five Democratic-held seats, diluting the voting power of millions of people of colour and further skewing an already deeply partisan map in that state.Trump also dispatched his vice-president, JD Vance,to Indianato discuss redistricting with the state governor and legislative leaders in the hope of gaining one or two Republican seats. Separately, a top Republican leader in Florida announced plans to begin redistricting efforts in the president’s adopted home state.After months of inertia and disunity in response to Trump,Democratsare now finding their voice and taking a stand. Democratic state legislators from Texas fled their home state to deny Republicans a quorum and prevent a vote on the proposed new map.Democratic governors floated the possibility of rushing to redraw their own state maps in retaliation, even if their options are limited.Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, wants Democratic gerrymandering in his state if Texas proceeds, though voters would have to bypass an independent redistricting commission.Newsom said: “Donald Trump is trying to steal the 2026 election. We cannot sit back and watch this happen.”Illinois governor JB Pritzker and New York governor Kathy Hochul have also declared their intent to push redistricting to neutralize Republican map-rigging. Pritzker denounced Trump as a “cheater” and said: “As far as I’m concerned, everything is on the table.”Standing with six Texas Democrats who sought refuge in New York, Hochultold reporters: “I’m tired of fighting this fight with my hand tied behind my back. We are at war and that’s why the gloves are off – and I say bring it on.”They have the backing of prominent party figures such asEric Holder, a former attorney general under President Barack Obama. Holder, whose organisation has long campaigned to end gerrymandering, admitted this week that he has changed his position and now believes that Democrats should respond with their own redistricting.Holdertold the New York Times: “What’s driving Democrats is, I think, a legitimate response. I mean, it’s like the Germans have invaded France. Are you going to just say, “Well, we’re against war and we’re for the resolution of disputes in a peaceful way”? Sometimes you have to take up arms. And when confronted with this authoritarian, anti-democracy effort, we have to take up arms.”The view is shared by another lifelong proponent of independent redistricting commissions.Norm Eisen, a lawyer and co-founder of Democracy Defenders Action, a nonpartisan group dedicated to free and fair elections, said: “It’s said you should never bring a knife to a gunfight. My view is that you should bring a bazooka to a gunfight.“I believe we have no choice now but to respond with massive pro-democracy force to these autocratic manoeuvres by Trump and his enablers in Texas. I favour every Democratic state that has the power to do it maximizing the number of districts. If Texas blinks, they can back off as well.”A mid-decaderedistricting arms racemakes some observers uneasy. They fear that Democrats will sacrifice the moral high ground by using anti-democratic measures in the name of democracy, evoking a statement often attributed to a US army major during the Vietnam war: “It became necessary to destroy the town to save it.”Eisen acknowledges the “tremendous danger” of a race to the bottom. But he added: “If we spend time wringing our hands about that we may find we’ve lost our democracy while we tarried. The continuity of American democracy may depend on blue states responding with alacrity to what Trump and Texas have started. Democracy won’t survive that kind of asymmetry.”View image in fullscreenJasmine Crockett, one of the Texas lawmakers who left the state in protest at Republicans’ redistricting effort.Photograph: Tom Krawczyk/ReutersFew Democrats personify the new bareknuckle approach better thanJasmine Crockett, who was among the leaders the last time Texas Democrats left the state to thwart Republicans in 2021. They stayed away for 38 days, although the Republican-led elections bill and voting restrictions eventually passed.Now a congresswoman in Washington, Crockett argues that such tactics remain effective. “If it’s waking up the conscience of this country about why this is a terrible practice, then that is a win,” she told the Guardian in a phone interview this week. “If it is showing those who decided to stay on the couch during the last presidential there are Democrats that are willing and ready to fight – but you just got to give us a shot.”Republicans have responded more aggressively to Texas Democrats’ efforts to stall procedure than they did four years ago. Senator John Cornyn said theFBI has agreedto help track down the Texas Democrats. Governor Greg Abbott said he is taking legal action to remove dozens of them from office.Crockett believes the authoritarian threat is now so severe that Democrats must stand and fight. “They have taken our kindness for weakness,” she said. “Democrats are very much wanting to be fair.“That is why you don’t find independent redistricting committees in Republican states; you find them in Democratic states. How can we fight when we tie our own hands behind our backs? It is so bad right now that we’ve got to do whatever we can to try to even the playing field somewhat.”She added: “Democracy is currently hanging by a thread at this point. We’ve got one team that’s playing chess and another one that’s playing checkers. We got to play the same game. Unfortunately we have endured a lot of harm and there’s a lot of systems that have been broken in only the first seven months of this administration.”Democrats have long been accused of timidity, showing more concern about being right than about being in power, eschewing vicious attacks on opponents with the notable exception of their own left wing. Joe Biden, then 78, sought to use his presidency to build bridges, restore bipartisanship and the soul of America.Crockett, 44, represents a new generation of smash-mouth politicians ready for verbal combat. Last year her denunciation of Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene’s “bleach blonde bad-built butch body” at a congressional hearing became a meme. Last weekendshe told a conferencethat Trump is “a piece of shit”, earning raucous cheers from her audience.Crockett believes that the Democratic base is crying out for the party to be more bold-faced. “People are OK with you not having all the answers, but I don’t think that people are OK with you not being willing to fight on their behalf. When you sign up to be an elected representative on any level they expect you to be their voice.“We’ve had this kind of over-pronouncement of Republican voices because they do whatever they want and then we’re just letting it happen. People are saying, ‘What is the point? I can never vote for the Republicans but what are you going to do?’“It is about rebuilding that rapport and trust with our base and letting them know that we will be the fighters that they need – not only doing it in response, but we’ve actually got to be proactive.”Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, has also been pursuing a gloves-off approach. He called Trump a “stone cold liar”, sued him for illegally federalising the national guard and, when threatened with arrest by border czar Tom Homan, retorted: “Arrest me. Let’s get it over with, tough guy.” Newsomfiled a $787m defamation lawsuitagainst Fox News, accusing the network of falsely claiming he lied about a phone call with Trump in June.Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist, said: “You’re seeing that the era of the Clintons and the Pelosis and the Bidens are yielding now to a new era of Democratic leaders. JB Pritzker’s emerged, Gavin’s emerged, Jasmine Crockett’s emerged.You’re seeing new voices emerge in this scrum, as you would expect in a democracy. There isn’t one person in charge.”Even as they do battle in a more aggressive manner, Rosenberg argues, Democrats are obliged to make clear the values they striving to defend. “We’re in a fight for the future of our country and for our democracy,” he said. “We have to now operate out of patriotism and love of country and allow that to be our our north star and our guiding force through all of this.“Not fighting means that you’re conceding and that you’re obeying in advance. In this case, this is where we decide to draw a line. We have to now go fight in this and go win it.”Explore more on these topicsDemocratsGavin NewsomCaliforniaWest CoastDonald TrumpTE LawrencenewsShareReuse this content"

She produces hair and makeup tutorials and lifestyle influencer content for the more than 4.6 million followers she has on Instagram and TikTok. Her account on OnlyFans, the platform used by millions for its adult content, offers subscribers nude images and videos of her performing sex acts.Penny East, the new chief executive of the Fawcett Society, the UK’s leading charity campaigning for women’s rights and gender equality, said the brand’s decision to collaborate with an OnlyFans star broke a new threshold in the mainstreaming of the controversial website and its explicit content, warranting “legitimate concern”.The decision to work with Kytsya appears to contravene L’Oréal’s own “Value Charter”, which sets out the ethical standards that must be adhered to by influencers who are partnering with their brands.View image in fullscreenUrban Decay is known for its provocatively named products.Photograph: Craig Barritt/Getty Images for Urban DecayThe charter says influencers must share L’Oréal’s “ethical principles” and must not previously have posted pornography and other “content which is at odds with our values of respect, tolerance and inclusion”.L’Oréal defended the collaboration, praising Kytsya for her openness in talking about “the joys, challenges, and risks of the industry she works in”.But the Fawcett Society CEO questioned whether Kytsya represented an appropriate choice by L’Oréal as a role model for the young women who buy its cosmetics. “We have concerns about the thousands of very young women joining the site in the hope of finding fame and fortune. The majority of OnlyFans creators make very little money and the pressure to find a niche is pushing women to make increasingly explicit content,” East said.“Ari Kytsya is one of the few successes. She is a hugely popular and engaging influencer, with a large following across all social media platforms. She also creates highly explicit and pornographic content on OnlyFans. The move to put OnlyFans content creators in high-street commercial makeup campaigns will only serve to make OnlyFans a more enticing prospect for young girls.”The advertisement, which has been viewed by more than 18.7 million people on Urban Decay’s TikTok page, contains pixellated images of Kytsya, with a sensitive content warning, beneath the headline “UD likes it raw”. Kytsya tells viewers that “censorship is out of control” and calls for “uncensored makeup” that performs “on stage, on camera and yes on mattresses”.View image in fullscreenUrban Decay products. The brand was purchased bought by L’Oréal in 2012.Photograph: Craig Barritt/Getty Images for Urban DecayFounded in 1996, Urban Decay was bought by L’Oréal in 2012 and is known for its provocatively named products, such as “Perversion” eyeliners, “Naked” eye shadows and “All Nighter” setting sprays.L’Oréal’s communications team supplied a comment on behalf of an Urban Decay spokesperson, saying: “Urban Decay partners with a diverse range of talent who represent the many facets of creative expression. Urban Decay chose US creator Ari Kytsya for her distinctive makeup artistry and her authenticity. She is known for her open and transparent dialogue with her community, fostering conversations about her personal experiences, including the joys, challenges, and risks of the industry she works in.”Kytsya frequently promotes the advantages of going into the adult content creation industry, promising TikTok followers that it can prove a lucrative career choice. “The thing about my job is if you go full out you can make enough money to start your own thing whether that’s buying houses or doing Airbnbs and investing,” she says.She also offers practical advice to followers who are considering working in this world, encouraging them to make sure they get tested regularly for sexually transmitted infections. She acknowledges that there are “dangers” involved in the work, and recommends that girls “who have just turned 18” should not rush into the adult industry. “Take time to think about it before you do it.”Concern about L’Oréal’s brand collaboration follows increasing unease about the extreme behaviour promoted by high-profile adult performers who share their material on the OnlyFans platform. Visa and the drinks brand Diageo last week pulled advertisements from aChannel 4documentary1,000 Men and Meabout Bonnie Blue, another adult performer who became famous on the site. OnlyFans had refused to host videos of her attempt to sleep with 1,000 men.Farhad Divecha, CEO of AccuraCast, an international digital marketing agency, said he was unaware of other mainstream global brands using adult content creators to advertise their products. “Today’s society is much more accepting of advertising like this than it might have been five or 10 years ago. Brands want eyeballs. As a marketer, I see untapped potential in those sites,” he said. “It might not hurt Urban Decay if the controversy provokes extra visibility.”Kytsya thanked Urban Decay for hiring her, commenting: “Most brands tend to hesitate when it comes to collaborating with me because of the kind of content I create.”OnlyFans did not respond to an approach for comment.Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleMakeupBeautyPornographynewsShareReuse this content"

Black was locked on to a gurney with crisscrossing black straps over his chest, stomach and legs, and Henry saw blood ooze from the injection site.The staff managed to insert the IV and cleaned the wound, but then struggled for roughly 10 minutes before finding a vein in Black’s second arm, Henry recalled.The IVs would be used to inject a lethal quantity of pentobarbital, a sedative, into Black, a 69-year-old wheelchair user with lifelong intellectual disabilities, dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, severe heart failure and prostate cancer. The drug was meant to render him unconscious as it stopped his breathing and killed him.“You’re almost home,” the spiritual adviser by Black’s side told him as the lethal injection began.While the reverend touched Black’s face to comfort him, Black started breathing and sighing loudly, and after several minutes groaned in agony, saying, “I can’t do this,” and “It hurts so bad,” according to Henry and several journalists who witnessed the execution. He repeatedly lifted his head.“I’m so sorry. Just listen to my voice,” said the reverend, who sang, “The Lord is my shepherd.”Black eventually became still and was pronounced dead at 10.43am, roughly 10 minutes after he hadcried in pain.Tennessee had argued that Black would not consciously experience drawn-out pain. But outside the chamber,seven reporterssharedsimilar accountssuggesting that was exactly what had occurred, the finaljournalistsaying: “It was unanimous among all of us that we saw him in distress.”“Something went horribly, horribly wrong, and I don’t know what it is yet, and all I could do was take notes and watch,” Henry, who represented Black for 25 years, told the Guardian on Thursday. “For him to lift his head up several times and say it hurts, I really wasn’t prepared. I could not believe it was happening. It was horrific.”View image in fullscreenRicky Bell, then the warden at the Riverbend prison in Nashville, in this October 1999 picture.Photograph: Mark Humphrey/APThe execution – which Henry said she considered “100% botched” and amounted to “torture” – appears to be the latest in a long line of troubled state killings.Despite historically lowpublic supportfor the death penalty, a handful of conservativestateshave continued to aggressively pursue executions, maintaining the US’sstatusas aglobal leaderin capital punishment. Donald Trump, who oversaw13 federal executionsin his first term, haspledged to revive capital punishment, reversing Joe Biden’s moratorium on federal killings.Reports ofbotched executionsinclude a2024 Idaho execution haltedafter eight failed attempts to find a vein for lethal injection; an Alabama killing using an experimental nitrogen gas method that caused “violent” shaking last year; and a 2021 lethal injection in Oklahoma that caused vomiting and convulsing. A Guardian report in May revealed that South Carolina appeared to botch an execution by firing squad, a rarely used method now making a comeback, with autopsy records suggesting shooters missed the target area on the man’s heart.Tennessee’s department of correction declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Tennessee governor, Bill Lee, did not respond to an email. Lee declined to grant Black clemency.Jonathan Skrmetti, the state’s attorney general, defended the execution in a statement, writing: “Every American has the right to their own opinion about the death penalty, but courts rely on actual facts and actual law, not on theatrics and passion. Black filed a dozen separate legal challenges to avoid his sentence. Every one of them failed. Byron Black’s execution was entirely legal.”View image in fullscreenRelatives of victims in Byron Black’s murder case after Black’s execution.Photograph: Mark Humphrey/APBlack’s apparently excruciating death was the final chapter in a life that his lawyers said was marked by challenges.A fatal loophole in the lawBlack spent 35 years on death row after he was convicted of the1988 homicidesof Angela Clay, his 29-year-old girlfriend, and her two daughters, Latoya, nine, and Lakeisha, six.Black hasmaintainedhis innocence, though the critical courtroom battles have revolved around his intellectual disability, according to theNashville Banner, which reported that Black’s attorney in 1989 had argued he was incompetent to stand trial. During sentencing, he did not understand he had already been found guilty, his lawyers have said.Black suffered from prenatal alcohol exposure and was exposed to toxic lead as a toddler, contributing to lifelong cognitive and developmental impairments, his attorneys said. He struggled throughout school, endured traumatic brain injuries from playing football and was never able to live independently, having difficulties performing basic chores as an adult.When Henry first met Black in 2000, she was pregnant with her second son, and they bonded over conversations about family: “Getting to know Byron is getting to know his family. He always wanted to talk about his family’s reunions, which are just legendary.” She learned about how he had relatives in all 50 states, tracing their roots to ancestors enslaved by President James Polk.View image in fullscreenBlack as a child.Photograph: Courtesy of public defender of middle district of Tennessee“He was always, always smiling. Talking to him was like sitting on the front porch having a glass of iced tea,” she said, recalling how he wrote down everyone’s birthday in a makeshift calendar and never missed them. He never complained about prison treatment nor asked about his case. “I would give him updates, and his response was always, thank you so much. I never had a visit where he didn’t say, ‘God bless you, I appreciate you,’ including up until the very last moment.”Henry, a federal public defender, watched as Black’s physical and mental health deteriorated over two decades on death row. For years, he struggled to walk, but staff at the prison would wheel him into his legal visits on an office chair, before eventually giving him a wheelchair, she said. When prostate cancer surgery went wrong, he nearly died, she said. “Still, he never said a negative word about the doctor.”Black’s 1971 high school graduation photo.Photograph: Courtesy of public defender of middle district of TennesseeThe stateconceded in 2022court proceedings that Black was, in fact, intellectually disabled under current laws. The Tennessee legislature had amended statutes in 2021 to align its definitions of intellectual disabilities with contemporary medical standards. Executing people with Black’s condition is prohibited.The courts, however, ruled that the new law did not apply to him, because Henry’s intellectual disability claim had been considered and rejected two decades earlier under the old standards.If he had filed the disability claim for the first time after the 2021 reform, his execution would have been deemed illegal, Henry said.View image in fullscreenThe Blacks in a 1965 family picture. Black is in the middle of the front row.Photograph: Courtesy of public defender of middle district of TennesseeIt’s a procedural loophole that torments Henry, who said she feels responsible for what happened since it was her original claim that was rejected 20 years ago.“Every execution takes a piece of your heart,” said Henry, who has represented 13 people who were executed, three of which she witnessed. “But this one hurts so much … Because I raised the intellectual disability claim when I did, he is dead. The law was wrong, the law changed, and he couldn’t get due process because we’d raised it before. And I just cannot reconcile that.”‘I won’t forget you’In the weeks leading up to the execution, Black’s attorneys had voiced significant concerns over the procedure, arguing that there was a serious risk that his defibrillator, implanted to regulate his heart disease, would respond to the injection by repeatedly shocking him, causing protracted, agonizing pain. But Tennessee’s supreme court allowed the execution toproceedwith the device activated.Henry said initial evaluation of the device after his death showed that it did not shock him.Black’s lawyers now hope that the autopsy, which will take weeks to complete, will help make clear what did go wrong.View image in fullscreenAnti death-penalty protesters outside the prison in Nashville.Photograph: Mark Humphrey/APIt’s possible the pentobarbital entered his muscle tissue, instead of his veins, due to the IV insertion problems, she said. The drug may have failed to flow properly due to the tight straps constraining his body, which also could have masked convulsions indicating pain. He may have endured pulmonary edema, a condition seen inothers executed by injection, where the lungs fill with fluid, causing a sensationakin to suffocation and drowning.Henry said thelack of transparencyaround where the state obtained the drug raisedfearsthe supply could be subpotent, improperly stored or have other problems.The state’s attorneys have argued that the pentobarbital should make people unresponsive andunable to perceive pain, but Black’s repeated lifting of his head while groaning in agony suggested otherwise, she said.Skrmetti, the attorney general, said in his statement that the defibrillator not shocking Black was “just as the state’s medical expert predicted”. He also condemned the criticisms of the drug, saying that in previous litigation, Black’s lawyers had argued that pentobarbital had lower risk of pain compared to other lethal injection drugs.Nine days before the execution, Henry had to explain to Black that she was running out of options to save him. The two wept, she recalled: “He grabbed me and held me really, really tight and said, ‘I want you to know that what you did mattered.’”Black made no final statement in the execution chamber.View image in fullscreenThe Black family in 1977.Photograph: Courtesy of public defender of middle district of TennesseeAfter Black was pronounced dead, Henry stood at a podium in front of television cameras and condemned the state for executing “a gentle, kind, fragile, intellectually disabled man in violation of the laws of our country simply because they could”. He said: “What happened here was the result of pure, unbridled bloodlust and cowardice. It was the brutal and unchecked abuse of government power. It was the result of a failed criminal legal system.”She told the crowd Black had said he was shy about speaking, but had asked her to read a message.“He wanted his friends and family to know: ‘I love you and I won’t never forget you. All of our relationships have been very special. It was my pleasure in meeting everybody and the way we connected with each other,” she read, through tears. “And to his legal team, who I know is watching this, keep doing what you’re doing.

Replete with memorabilia paying reverence to Trump as well as politically satirical menu items targeting his enemies, Beainy’s chain expanded to other locations, including Houston.Trump won a second presidency in January, and his administration summarily began delivering on promises to pursue mass deportations of immigrants. Political supporters of Trump in the US without papers, at least in many cases, have not been spared.One casewhich generated considerable news headlines was that of a Canadian national who supported Trump’s plans for mass deportation of immigrants – only for federal authorities to detain her in California while she interviewed for permanent US residency and publicly describe her in a statement as “an illegal alien from Canada”.In another instance, Icereportedlydetained a Christian Armenian Iranian woman who lost her legal permanent US residency, or green card, after a 2008 burglary conviction and incarcerated her at a federal detention facility in California despite her vocal support of Trump. Her husband, with whom she is raising four US citizen children, subsequently blamed the couple’s plight on Biden’s “doing for open borders”, as Newsweeknoted.Beainy’s detention by Ice is not his only legal plight, according to the Houston Chronicle. He sued the landlord of a Trump Burger location in Kemah, Texas, whom Beainy claimed forcibly removed staff and took over the restaurant.The landlord responded with his own lawsuit accusing Beainy of unpaid debts and renamed the Kemah restaurant Maga Burger.In 2022, Beainy told the Houston Chronicle he endured threats to have Trump Burger burned down when the first one opened its doors. But the brand had since gained a loyal following and a portion of its profits were set aside to aid Trump’s fundraising, Beainy said to the outlet.“I would love to have [Trump’s] blessing and have him come by,” Beainysaidat the time. “We’re hoping that he … sees the place.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was about to throw it away when he noticed something unusual: the price printed on the bottle was in lire, meaning it must have been produced before the euro replaced the lira in Italy.View image in fullscreenSuma with one of Archeoplastica’s oldest finds: a 1958 Italian bottle cap.Photograph: ArcheoplasticaIn fact, after delving further, he was astonished to discover that the bottle dated back to the late 1960s.A clear testament to the longevity of plastic and its persistence in the environment, the vintage suntan lotion became the catalyst for Suma’s creation ofArcheoplastica, an online museum that comprises more than 500 plastic relics washed ashore on beaches all over Italy.“Whereas before I didn’t pay too much attention to what I collected, from that moment on I started to look at everything very, very carefully,” said Suma, who studied environmental science at Ca’ Foscari university in Venice before returning to Puglia.He added: “It’s one thing to be taught that plastic lasts for centuries and never degrades, and another to see it with your own eyes.”About 11m tonnes ofplastic waste ends upin the world’s oceans each year via rivers or after being dumped by people along shorelines or chucked into the sea from fishing vessels.A new expert reviewpublished last weekwarned that plastics were a “grave, growing and under-recognised danger” to human and planetary health.View image in fullscreenArcheoplastica’s finds comprise more than 500 plastic relics.Photograph: ArcheoplasticaThe review concluded that the world was in a “plastics crisis”, the driver being the huge acceleration in plastics production since the 1950s. The timeline of relics gathered by Suma and his volunteers across Italy demonstrates this.One of the oldest finds – a 1958 bottle cap featuring the trademark Moplen that was found on a beach in Emilia-Romagna region, northern Italy – points to the beginning of the plastic-production era. Moplen was the commercial name for isotactic polypropylene, a plastic material developed by the company Montecatini.View image in fullscreenA clown-shaped 1960s honey bottle that was produced and only ever sold in Greece.Photograph: ArcheoplasticaOther discoveries include a pink polyethylene bottle for talcum powder that was made in Germany in the late 1950s; a blue tub of hand cream dating to the 1960s with the brand name Gli Sette still clearly visible; and a clown-shaped bottle once filled with honey that was produced and only ever sold in Greece, also in the 1960s, but which turned up on a beach in the Lecce area of Puglia.Finds of products made in subsequent decades include a Spic & Span bathroom cleaning powder from the 1970s, a Nesquik tub from the 80s and the remains of a souvenir Italia ‘90 World Cup football.The most recent discovery, which is yet to be officially added to the Archeoplastica inventory, is a 45rpm vinyl record picked up on a beach by a seven-year-old boy who was in Puglia on holiday with his family.View image in fullscreenSuma and his team do most of their collecting during the autumn and winter.Photograph: ArcheoplasticaAfter Suma’s nephew miraculously managed to bend the record back in the shape, it was played on an old turntable and was revealed to be Jimmy Fontana’s Il Mondo, a song released in 1965.“This find struck me a lot,” said Suma. “The record jumped a lot but you could clearly make out the song.” Barnacle encrustations found on the record indicated that it had been floating in the sea for quite some time.Most of the work by Suma and his team is done during autumn and winter, when tonnes of plastic waste is left behind by beachgoers and authorities pay less attentionto keeping the beaches clean.View image in fullscreenAround the world, about 11m tonnes of plastic waste finds its way into the sea every year.Photograph: ArcheoplasticaThe vast majority of waste they find are single-use plastics such as bottles, bags, fast-food containers and straws.The objective of Archeoplastica, which occasionally exhibits its finds at traditional museums, is to raise awareness and encourage people to limit their use of plastic.But from Suma’s experience, the problem is only getting worse, especially with no meaningful progress towards limiting plastic production.The sea, meanwhile, is taking its revenge. “The ocean is spitting our rubbish back in our faces,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsOceansPollutionItalyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Weeks after proposing to strip protections from the reserve, the Department of Interior signaled it would adopt amanagementplanthat wouldopen82% of the NPR-A to oil drilling. Two weeks ago, before the public comment period had ended, the BLMrescindedthree other Biden-era documents protecting the reserve.The Alaska Wilderness League, an Alaska-focused conservation non-profit, said the administration’s decision to start dismantling protections for the NPR-A before the comment period concludedshowed“a lack of interest in meaningfully reviewing any input before taking action to allow unfettered industrialization across this landscape”.Alaska Native groups, some of which have worked for years to secure protections for areas of the NPR-A, also expressed frustration.View image in fullscreenThe Natural Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.Photograph: Florian Schulz/protectthearctic.orgThe rollback is “a coordinated erasure of years of work by Alaska Native communities”, said Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic in a pressstatement.“To have all the work we’ve done for the last two decades, trying to create important special areas with their unique biological features demonstrated by science, disregarded to allow full-force development is crazy to consider,” said Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, anactivistand former mayor of Nuiqsut, Alaska, a village in the NPR-A.The BLM said in a statement it was working through all comments received on the 2024 NPR-A rule rescission, and that it would respond to substantive comments in the final rule.The White House referred the Guardian to the BLM when asked for comment.‘Devastating’ changeUnder Trump, the Department of Interior has embarked on a push to promote resource extraction in the Arctic,vowingto expand oil and gas in the NPR-A, open oil leasing on the coastal plain of the Arctic national wildlife refuge, and advance a controversial miningroadin the southern Brooks range.The total land in play from these proposals is nearly 25m acres (10m hectares) of Arctic ecosystem, an area larger than the state of Indiana. The NPR-A comprises the vast majority of this. The reserve supports home grounds for polar bears, calving areas for caribou, and habitat formillionsof migratory birds from Africa and Europe, as well as the Americas.In 2023, the Biden administration beganconsultationswith Alaska Native groups and other stakeholders to update existing rules on how the NPR-A should be managed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

That rule protects key areas in the NPR-A for subsistence use and habitat, including Teshekpuk Lake, the Utukok Uplands and the Colville River.Ahtuangaruak, who participated in the 2023 consultations, said removing these protections could be “very devastating rapidly”. She described a worsening ecological situation across the reserve, partly driven by existing oil development.Caribou herds weredeclining, she said, and some had shifted their migration patterns away from her village because of oil and gas development to the west of her village. Permafrost was thawing, causing freshwater Arctic lakes to drain. Ice roads separated caribou calves from caribou cows; polar bears struggled to den in the melting snowpack.Tim Fullman, a senior ecologist at the Wilderness Society, a US conservation non-profit, said that already-existing roads in the Alaskan Arctic had been shown to hinder caribou movement, at times delaying migrating animals for up to a month.Then there’s the perennial health impacts on communities from gas flaring in the NPR-A, which Ahtuangaruak said she began to notice in the early 2000s when she was a healthcare worker.“The flares, when there’d be 20 or more, there would be nights where people would have trouble breathing,” she said. “Babies would start to have events. There was one point where we had 20 babies develop respiratory distress and 10 of them were put on ventilators.”Oil for decadesThirty miles east of Nuiqsut, Ahtuangaruak’s village, is the ConocoPhillips Willow project, adrillingoperation approved in March 2023 under the Biden administration. Still under construction, it is projected to comeonlinein 2029. Once it begins to produce, Willow will beoperationalfor at least 30 years, according to its environmental impact statement.The project is an example of the timeframe involved in the Arctic oil and gas projects theTrump administrationis currently encouraging, says Moderow – spanning decades.“We’re not talking about oil next year. We’re talking about oil in 2050 and 2060 and beyond, when we need to move past it,” he said. The projects “could easily be pumping oil when babies born today are retiring in a climate that’s not livable if that oil is not blocked”.“It’s investing in production that’s going to be going on for decades, well past when we need to be at essentially net zero greenhouse gas emissions if we’re going to have a livable climate,” said Jeremy Lieb, a senior attorney at Earthjustice.Explore more on these topicsAlaskaOil and gas companiesTrump administrationNative AmericansIndigenous peoplesWildlifeClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Other studies have found parental nature connectedness is the strongest predictor of whether a child will become close to nature.“Nature connectedness is now accepted as a key root cause of the environmental crisis,” said Richardson. “It’s vitally important for our own mental health as well. It unites people and nature’s wellbeing. There’s a need for transformational change if we’re going to change society’s relationship with nature.”Richardson said when he tested different policy and urban environmental changes in the model he was surprised at the scale of the changes required to reverse the loss of connection to nature.Increasing the availability of biodiverse green spaces in a city by 30% may look like radical positive progress for wildlife and people but Richardson said his study suggested a city may need to be 10 times greener to reverse declines in nature connection.The study found that measures to increase popular engagement with the natural world were not effective at reversing long-term declines in nature connectedness. Richardson said such schemes by charities – for instance, the Wildlife Trusts’#30DaysWild– were still important for boosting mental health but the modelling suggested they don’t halt the intergenerational loss of nature connection.More effective, according to the study, are measures instilling awareness and engagement with nature in young children and families, such as forest school nurseries.A further obstacle to restoring nature connectedness is that the modelling shows policies to transform early education and urban areas need to be in place over the next 25 years to reverse the decline. But if done, increases in nature connectedness would become self-sustaining.Richardson said the scale of societal changes required to re-establish nature connection may not be as daunting as they appeared because the baselines were now so low.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Nature is ready to spring back – if we let it | Patrick BarkhamRead more“Increase that by [a factor of] 10, and people are spending 40 minutes outside every day – that may be enough,” said Richardson. “Working with families and parents to engage children with nature with a real focus on that intergenerational transmission is key. There’s already a lot of focus on connecting children with nature but I prefer to say – don’t disconnect them. A newborn child is much the same as a child born in 1800. Children are fascinated by the natural world. It’s maintaining that through their childhood and schooling that’s essential, alongside urban greening. There’s policies starting to do that but we’ve got to think in transformational terms – not 30% but 1,000%.”Intriguingly, there may be hope of a cultural shift. Richardson was surprised to find that nature words in books are actually on the increase again – with the decline having fallen from 60.6% between 1800 and 1990 to 52.4% today.“Is it a genuine eco-awareness? Is itthe British trend for nature writing? Is it ‘real’ or is it an artefact of the data? I don’t know,” said Richardson. “There has also been an increasing interest in spirituality in recent decades so that might reflect people getting back in touch with nature.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWildlifeTrees and forestsBiodiversityConservationAccess to green spaceGreen politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

If a rider is found to be in breach of the law and their obligations, we will terminate their contract.”A Just Eat spokesperson said the vast majority of deliveries from Just Eat were completed by registered independent couriers. They had a legal right to work and worked hard to deliver millions of orders every week, the spokesperson said. They added that clear standards and requirements were in place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This includes introducing state-of-the-art identity and video verification technology.”Fresh protests were due to take place outside the Britannia International hotel on Marsh Wall on Friday night. While local people, including women and children, have been involved, the protests have also been heavily promoted by far-right activists and there have been at least four arrests.The Britannia was one of the first locations where protests promoted by far-right activists gathered steam in the wake of demonstrations outside the Bell hotel in Essex, where there have been violent clashes with police.The first few protests outside the Britannia were largely peaceful, but disturbances on Sunday resulted in several arrests and police served 28-day return bans on agitators accused of harassing the hotel’s occupants and trying to break through a fence.Supporters of the far right have been among social media users claiming that asylum seekers are working as delivery drivers while living in the Britannia and that police provided an escort to a “migrant” delivery driver.Police have said people who were filmed leaving the hotel on mopeds were hotel staff, while a police escort was provided to a delivery driver who was delivering to the address.Explore more on these topicsCouriers/delivery industryImmigration and asylumLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

People don’t vote for Diet Coke. They vote for the real thing.”Falconer said that did not mean the party should lurch further to the right or left. “Was Tony Blair left or right? He was energetically progressive. He was a government that had agency and at the moment we are too easily characterised as a government without agency.”He reeled off theemployment rights bill– “a terrific piece of legislation, very bold” – therenters’ rights bill, theplanning billandassisted dying. “This is a reforming and progressive government, there’s a hell of a lot going on, and yet our popularity ratings are falling through the floor.”Falconer, who advised Starmer’s leadership campaign and his early appointments of ministers, said the prime minister’s personality meant that kind of bombast was difficult.“There is absolutely no sense of a confident morning. Part of it is because – this is a good thing – the prime minister’s personality is an unflashy personality. He thinks the right thing to do is not to spend your time telling people what you’re doing, it’s putting your head down and doing it.“But there is more to leading the country than delivery. There is also the sense you give the country of what’s happening.”It would be wrong for MPs or the wider party to conclude that a change of leadership was required, he said. “I do think he’s the right person, indeed. The moment that conversation starts [about leadership change], everybody immediately goes back to Keir and recognises that he’s the best leader for us.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rayner “introduced the workers’ rights, she’s doing the housing stuff, and again … She’s proud of them”.Falconer said he was most struck by Mahmood’s approach to the justice portfolio, where some of the most radical reforms were being made. “Shabana has been an absolutely brilliant, reforming lord chancellor in enormously difficult circumstances. She is somebody whose sense of confidence about what she’s doing is something the whole government should emulate.”Falconer was concerned that the government appeared too in hock to financial markets – even if it was important to show fiscal discipline. “The ability to cope and not be knocked off course is the key thing on the economy,” he said. “Eventually a paralysis will set in, if ultimately the country thinks the bond market is determining the whole of our policy.”Falconer said he knew from his own time in government, where he served as the solicitor general as well as the justice secretary, that a “sudden plunge in popularity” was very damaging to morale. “Your political confidence does tend to go if everything you do is simply parlayed into ‘another fuck-up by the government’,’” he said. “Then you begin to say: ‘Well, let’s not talk about anything.’ Ultimately that never works.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsCharles Falconer, Lord Falconer of ThorotonLabourKeir StarmerEd MilibandAngela RaynerShabana MahmoodnewsShareReuse this content"

The renowned academic, whose area of research relates to Victorian cemeteries including Highgate, Brompton and Abney Park, is required to be based inLondon.She has successfully renewed her visa seven times in the past. But in 2022, she became seriously mentally ill. She was hospitalised for 13 weeks and was unable to engage with the visa renewal system as a result of being so unwell.She overstayed for 46 days before her family inCanadacould make an application for further leave to remain on her behalf. Since then she has been trying to resolve her visa situation for three years with no success, despite submitting extensive documentary evidence to the Home Office about the medical emergency she experienced.“I am deeply concerned about the effects this will have on my research and employment and on my quality of life and continued recovery,” Scott said. “This feels like a penalty for an infraction that was outside of my control. It does not seem right that I should be punished for having an illness.”Her mental health has improved and she has resumed her academic research.She has lodged an appeal on human rights grounds, but if it is unsuccessful she is facing a ban from the UK. An application she made in 2024 for leave to remain was refused on the grounds that she was medically stable and could return to Canada.Scott said: “My case highlights the issue of the Home Office applying policy in a way that is actually at odds with their own and Prime Minister Starmer’s priority of attracting and retaining highly qualified professionals within the UK’s research and employment sectors. It also highlights the hostility of the current climate regarding mental illness.”In its refusal letter, the Home Office said that indefinite leave to remain was “a privilege, not an automatic entitlement”. Officials added: “A mere wish, desire or preference to live in the UK does not amount to an exceptional circumstance.”They said the fact she was prevented from applying in time to renew her visa due to being “acutely ill” also did not amount to an exceptional circumstance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It could also clarify what level of detail businesses should provide to their workers on the allocation of service charges, such as how their share compares with others’ and how their allocation was decided.The waiter, who worked part-time, claims he was allocated £46.34 in gratuities and service charges for 43 hours’ work in March, a sum that was later increased to £97.45. He claims that that share, which came from a total pot of £31,562 handed over by diners that month in his branch of the Ivy, was far lower than it should have been.The waiter estimates that he was one of about 43 employees at the branch – including waiting staff, the kitchen team and management – meaning that his hours would have equated to about 2% of the total worked by staff that month. Yet he received less than a 300th of the service charge and tips collected. The Ivy disputed his calculations, arguing they were inaccurate and misleading. It said it used an independent consultancy to calculate how tips and service charges were shared. Lawyers working for the chain said he was a “disgruntled and discredited” former employee.Under the law implemented last October, employers in Britain must share out 100% of service charges collected in a venue to workers there. It must be done in a “fair and transparent manner” and employees have the right to know “how tips are allocated and distributed”.Diners at the Ivy, which was spun out of the London celebrity haunt and operates nearly 40 restaurants in the UK and Ireland, pay about £21 for fish and chips and £4.50 for a cup of coffee. Caring is attempting a £1bn sale of the business, which is owned by his Troia (UK)Restaurantsparent company.The Ivy said it had complied with the Employment (Allocation of Tips) Act 2023 and operated “a fair and transparent” scheme for distributing tips and service charge,which was “overseen by employee representatives and an independent, third-party business used by many restaurants in the hospitality industry”.A spokesperson for Troia (UK) Restaurants said: “We absolutely refute all the claims that are being made and will provide all the evidence necessary to disprove these allegations to the employment tribunal.“We introduced a fair and transparent scheme after consultations with staff that has been well received and is overseen by employee representatives and an independent, third-party business used by many restaurants in the hospitality industry.”The Ivy said it shared out service charges via a system called a “tronc”, with different team members allocated “tronc points” that determine their share of the service charge each month. However, employees are not given an explanation of exactly how their tronc points are determined or how they compare with other team members’. Diners at the branch of the Ivy where the waiter worked pay an optional 12.5% service charge, with some adding tips on top. The firm says card and cash tips go directly to the individual who was given them.The Ivy claimed that it was unable to give details on how tronc points were allocated because doing so would breach its employees’ rights.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also does not reveal to workers how many individuals at a restaurant have shared the service charge. The Ivy has said that the worker “was provided with full details of his tronc allocation and how it was calculated, which included information which went beyond what he was entitled to receive pursuant to the relevant legislation”.The waiter had worked on and off for the Ivy since November 2023 and said he sought clarification of his service charge and tips from last autumn and into this spring. He was given a warning about behaviour in April, which he claims included forgetting guests drinks and not emptying ice buckets. The business disputes those claims. He said that at about the same time he filed a formal demand for information on his service charge allocation, before resigning in June.The tribunal hearing is due in April 2026.Explore more on these topicsHospitality industryRestaurantsEmployment tribunalsWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

The change would make it much easier to buy and sell marijuana and make the legal multibillion-dollar industry more profitable.The guests at Trump’s fundraiser included Kim Rivers, chief executive of Trulieve, one of the largest marijuana companies, who encouraged Trump to pursue the change and expand medical marijuana research, the report said.During Trump’s first term, two Soviet-born Republican donors, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, directly appealed to Trump for help with their plan to sell marijuana in states where recreational use was legal. Audio of the 2018 dinner, which was secretly recorded by the two men,revealedthat Trump was skeptical, telling the two men that he believed marijuana use “does cause an IQ problem; you lose IQ points”.In the same conversation, the Ukrainian-born Parnas first suggested to Trump that he should remove the US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, and shared a false rumor that the diplomat was badmouthing the president by “telling everybody, ‘Wait, he’s gonna get impeached.’”Parnas and Fruman later helped Rudy Giuliani search for dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine, before being indicted and found guilty of campaign finance violations, for secretly using a Russian oligarch’s money to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republican campaigns and committees, including Trump’s, in pursuit of favors for their planned legal marijuana business.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationCannabisDrugsLaw (US)US politicsShareReuse this content"

Cambodia denies the accusation.The army’s statement said the incident took place in Thailand’s Sisaket province and “clearly demonstrates to both domestic and international society that the use of concealed weapons in border areas continues to exist, constituting a clear violation of the Ottawa Convention by the Cambodian side”.The Ottawa Convention is an international treaty banning the use of landmines, signed by 164 countries, including Cambodia and Thailand.The incident on Saturday risks enflaming tensions, which remain high despite the fragile truce agreed on 29 July to end the armed conflict.Online hate and rising vitriol: deep divisions amid shaky peace between Thailand and CambodiaRead moreFive days of fighting broke out last month after five Thai soldiers were wounded when one stepped on a mine in disputed territory. The clashes, whichkilled at least 43 peopleon either side of the border and displaced more than 260,000, amounted to the worst fighting between the neighbouring countries in more than a decade.Since the truce was agreed, both sides have accused the other ofbreaching it. Relations remain rocky while anger is being stirred online by a mix of disinformation, threats and nationalism.Two days after the two sides met in Malaysia to sign a 13-point agreement on implementing their ceasefire, the Thai army’s statement said that Saturday’s incident constituted “a significant obstacle to the implementation of ceasefire measures and peaceful resolution of problems”.Cambodia strongly denies laying new concealed weapons. “We have not, and will not, plant new landmines,” the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority said in a statement.It said Cambodia had cleared more than 1m mines and nearly 3m other unexploded weapons dating back to a period of war and civil unrest that began in 1970 and lasted more than three decades.The Thai sergeant major lost his left foot in Saturday’s incident, according to the Thai army statement, while two privates suffered less serious injuries.Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsThailandCambodiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

All three were taken to Bellevue hospital and are in a stable condition, the spokesperson said.There had been a verbal dispute between the shooter and one of the victims, according to the police. The firearm used in the shooting was recovered.Video on social media showed people fleeing from the scene, and police surrounding a vehicle and attending to the wounded lying on the ground.The shooting at theNew Yorktourist spot took place amid a significant decrease in gun crime in the city.During the first seven months of 2025, the lowest number of shooting incidents in the city of 8.4 million people occurred since its records on gun crime began, according to the New York police commissioner, Jessica S Tisch.

Those who do go are also spending less on food and drink.Fabrizio Licordari, the president of Assobalneari Italia, an association representing beach clubs, blamed the decline on the high cost of living and its consequences on spending power.Sea, sand and sky-high fees: Italians tussle over their right to lie on the beachRead more“Even with two salaries, many families struggle to reach the end of the month,” he told Ansa news agency. “In such circumstances, it’s natural that the first expenses to be cut are those for leisure, entertainment and holidays.”The drop in attendance, however, also coincides with increases in the cost of private beach resorts and the growing rebellion against theirdominance of Italian shorelines, which has left very little space for free beaches.The cost of renting a sunlounger is a recurring topic of discussion, and rightly so – on average, it costs 17% more than it did four years ago, according to figures this week from the consumer group Altroconsumo. On beaches in the Lazio region, for example, it is difficult to rent two loungers and an umbrella for less than €30 (£26) a day. That rises to about €90 in the popular resort of Gallipoli in Puglia.The actor Alessandro Gassmann stoked the debate after sharing a photo of a beach with deserted loungerson his Instagram pageand writing alongside it: “I read that the season is not going well. Maybe it’s because the prices are exaggerated and the country’s economic situation is forcing Italians to choose free beaches? Lower the prices and maybe things will get better.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added that people in return benefited from services including security and lifeguard supervision.But the consumers association Codacons said going to beach resorts had become “a drain” on people’s finances and accused the concession owners of “shedding crocodile tears”.The beaches might be losing custom, but areas in the mountains, especially the Dolomites, have had a significant rise in visitor numbers, with some areas fearing overtourism. According to a report this week in the newspaperIl Messaggero, more Italians are venturing to the mountains for their holidays, partly as a way to escape increasingly hot summers caused in part by the climate crisis.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

His day is an uneventful parade of tasks: teeth brushing, newspaper reading and failing to put his socks on.It is much to his surprise that he wakes to find the room tidy and his secret box of memories moved. And it is much to his consternation that a boy appears from another box, unruly, undomesticated and curious.It is that very curiosity that unlocks the old man’s backstory and rejuvenates him. Inside the secret box, the boy finds evidence of a perilous biplane crash over wartime seas and a drowning pilot rescued by a whale.By my reckoning that would make the old man about 125 years old, which would also account for the old-fashioned Boy’s Own Adventure focus of the show. It is easy to put that aside, however, when mischievous humour and visual inventiveness abounds, whether it is paper planes floating overhead, deathly waves inundating the stage or the enormous blue whale swelling to the full height of the walls around us.View image in fullscreenTactile wonder …toooBtoooBPleasance Courtyard, 10am and 11am, until 25 AugustI usually take the post-show play session as my cue to leave, but this one is delightful. We have just watched Tamsin Fessey perform a hypnotic dance, aimed at 6-24-month-olds, from inside a colourful tube. Hidden within, she rolls and stretches, giving life to this wriggly creature and making a face of the orange hoop at one end.Tuning in to the priorities of the young audience, she is variously shy, inquisitive, hungry and sick. She dances when the music demands it and sighs when it stops. She plays games with the springy containers around her and discovers enticing silvery balls inside.This toooB seems to have a life of her own until, slowly in this wordless production by Angel Exit, attractively designed by Verity Quinn, we spot the performer within: a foot, a hand, a cautious eye. And with her emergence, it is time for the audience to join in: new balls and tubes appearing around us to create an infant adventure playground, full of tactile wonder.View image in fullscreenJames Joyce for kids … You'll See …You’ll See …Pleasance Courtyard, 12pm, until 24 AugustIt sounds like a joke. Take a famously impenetrable classic of world literature, a stream-of-consciousness Dublin odyssey stretching to 250,000 words, and turn it into a show for the over-eights. But Helen Gregg is for real and her adaptation of James Joyce’s Ulysses is a joy.Introducing a book that few of the adults in the audience will have read, she strips it down to its narrative framework, judiciously editing for family viewing, and turns it into 45 minutes of day-in-the-life storytelling.Leafing through enormous pop-up books – three of them, just like the sections of the original – she traces the comings and goings of a cut-out Leopold Bloom and Stephen Daedalus, flanked by a city’s worth of quirky characters, from funeral to office to pub. In Marc Mac Lochlainn’s production for Galway company Branar, it is performed with wit and lucidity, not to mention musical interludes. Gregg is a brilliant interpreter and makes an imposing novel sound like a fun thing to tackle at home.View image in fullscreenSensory delight … Hello Birds.Photograph: Neal MegawHello BirdsAssembly George Square, 11.30am, until 17 AugustHard to imagine a more gentle introduction to theatre than this sensory performance for babies, written by Jasmine Cole and directed by Connie Crosby. Narrated by Hannah Platts and performed on a large floorcloth over which the audience can roam, it is set in a garden where the leaves are tactile, the mushrooms rattle and the pond is made of silver foil.A bee buzzes by as the children acclimatise, then it is time for the big reveal: a sequence of cloth puppet birds, manipulated by Jennie Rawling, introduced with birdsong and welcomed with a pretty human song. Things get no more dramatic than when the starling imitates a cow and a tractor and, as the lights dim, a night owl soars overhead with stars shining through its wings. The stakes might be low, but is pitched perfectly at a mesmerised audience.View image in fullscreenFinding ways to connect … The Unlikely Friendship of Feather Boy and Tentacle Girl.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanThe Unlikely Friendship of Feather Boy and Tentacle GirlAssembly Roxy, 11.25am, until 17 AugustFeather Boy and Tentacle Girl are opposites. One lives in the city; one in the country. One is rough; the other smooth. One sunny; one sour. But although theirs is a relationship of contradictions, they find a way to connect. They do this through the mutual dependency of acrobatics, balancing high above the stage, moving in careful synchronisation.In this aerial show for the over-eights by circus artists Vee Smith and Sadiq Ali working with Catherine Wheels theatre company, it is as if the two have been let loose in an outsize play park, mocking gravity as they hang upside down, spin precariously or plummet to the ocean depths. Narratively light and open to interpretation, it reaches a climax with a spectacular storm of red and white feathers on Jen McGinley’s set, swirling in windy chaos.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Children's theatreEdinburgh festivalTheatreFamilyFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He hadn’t seen any of the Alien films, though. He hadn’t seenAlienorAliensorAlien 3, he hadn’t seen any of thePredator crossover canon, he hadn’t seen Resurrection orPrometheusor theone afterPrometheus. He hadn’t even seenAlien: Romulus, even though it’s named after the guy who co-founded Rome. The Oscar-winning franchise has earned well over a billion dollars worldwide. There’s nothing more human than loving Alien.Part of the franchise’s success is its malleability. A creature-horror stuffed with Freudian nightmare, the films blend action, sci-fi, theology and satire. (I don’t want to be Frankenstein’s Pedant about it, but the monster is the profit-driven corporation determined to bring the alien to Earth to develop as a biological weapon.) Now that the IP belongs to Disney, we should expect many more instalments. But can they keep stretching the story into exciting shapes? Or are the days of Alien: Below Decks or The Real Housewives of Moon LV-426 upon us?View image in fullscreenCreep show … Timothy Olyphant in Alien: Earth.Photograph: Patrick Brown/FXThankfully, they’ve given control of Alien: Earth (Disney+, from Wednesday 12 August) to writer-directorNoah Hawley, the TV genius responsible forFargoand the dazzlingly ambitious Marvel series Legion. He takes us back a few years before the start of the first film, to an Earth run by a consortium of five tech companies. A deep space research vessel belonging to Weyland-Yutani, AKA Baddy Corp, crash-lands into a building owned by rival Prodigy. Guess what – there’s a very, very bad dog on board, and the Jurassic ovoids being transported? Not Kinder Eggs.The Alien movies’ main creature, the xenomorph, remains mesmerising. Rather than making an eight-hour slasher movie, Hawley uses its threat to explore a story about identity, the limits of AI and human weakness. An intriguing character is Boy Kavalier, the founder of Prodigy. To capture Weyland-Yutani’s extraterrestrial IP, he sends a party of his new creations: Hybrids. We see him secretly transferring the consciousness of terminally ill children into synthetic bodies, with tremendous strength and upgradable minds. Thank God our tech leaders are more responsible!This is one of my favourite tropes: evil genius motivated by lonely boredom. Boy Kavalier, who resembles Richard Hammond in a Bob Dylan wig, has created a new species simply because he wants someone to have an interesting conversation with. No one gets him. There is a twisted romance to that idea, if far-fetched. I mean, what does Elon Musk want? Someone to laugh at his jokes? Maybe that’s the same thing.The Hybrids are a great creation. Watching them, I was reminded of The Secret Life of 4 Year Olds. That documentary showed us infants playing, tracing the growth of recognisably adult behaviour. Kavalier’s prototypes kill and jump off cliffs, charged by lithium batteries that would power a city. Yet in the aftermath they are confused, worried about getting in trouble. They’re super-soldiers with the emotional age of children.‘It’s the best monster ever invented’: Noah Hawley on bringing Ridley Scott’s Alien to TVRead moreIs there a current of identification between Hybrid and xenomorph? Is our enemy’s enemy our friend – or just another enemy? Do humans deserve to survive? The series plays with big questions. Yet this isn’t The Rest Is Aliens, a podcast about industrial espionage and existentialism. Its chief ambition is ramping up dread. And blood. Every episode is, frankly, an abattoir. New aliens have been designed that are blood-curdlingly creepy.The show boasts the sound design of the year, with chitinous clacking and background monkey whoops stoking constant unease. Even the casting is creepy, from child-adult Hybrids to Timothy Olyphant as an inscrutable robot scientist. Adrian Edmondson from The Young Ones is in it – yet so unrecognisable that I still don’t know he’s in it.Alien: Earth adds freshness to the franchise’s convoluted lore – give it your eyeballs. Tasting notes include Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, Westworld,Un Chien Andalou, plus The Secret Life of 4 Year Olds. There’s also the most cinematic monster to ever do it, doing it plenty. If that isn’t entertainment enough, then you truly are unknowable.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherAlienfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is opaque but with flashes of strange brilliance, an adaptation of The Word for Snow, a one-act stage play byDon DeLillofrom 2007 that reflected on the climate crisis.A child called Moon (Moon Guo Barker) wanders around a strange world, entirely peopled by other children, except for one eerie monochrome sequence in which Moon sees adult figures in some kind of underground tunnel, frozen in attitudes of dismay similar to the citizenry of Pompeii. In the course of her travels, bookended by clambering out of a crashed car and finally driving happily off, Moon has dreamlike encounters with these children who speak with the tongues of adult prophets. She also exchanges pungent and often memorable micro-insights or haikus or aperçus about the nature of humanity in this postapocalyptic world.“The word for snow will be the snow,” says one, evidently foreseeing a time when language itself will be scorched away by some cosmic fatality. The scenario is not entirely unlike the super-rich Wall Street trader cruising affectlessly around the Manhattan streets in his stretch limo in DeLillo’s novella Cosmopolis, exchanging gnomic dialogue with the people in his life; this wasfilmed by David Cronenberg with Robert Pattinsonin the lead role.Moon meets three weird child sisters, like something from Shakespeare, and then a child scholar whose words are interpreted by a child translator; she is met by various other infant devils or angels or lost souls. There is also a scene in which a Minotaur figure roams a maze, filmed in the (rather amazing)Lithica labyrinth in Menorca, Spain, a colossal stone land artwork. At one stage, Rivers’s camera locates a gravestone with a single handprint, as if humanity has found a primitive, wordless way of commemorating its own demise.The film is like a slo-mo Lord of the Flies (but without the violence) in a style not far from Pasolini’s ancient Greek dramas, and its uncanny quality creeps up on you. This applies even (or especially) to the dialogue put in the mouths of the children, which although occasionally stilted, has its own unearthly, somnambulist ring, as if an alien intelligence is ventriloquising its views through these innocents. Is all this a “mare’s nest”, in the sense of it being a complicated situation in which an illusory or misleading significance is to be found? Perhaps. In any event, Rivers has an ancient-mariner confidence in his stern, enigmatic address to the audience.Mare’s Nest screened at the Locarno film festivalExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBen RiversFilm adaptationsDon DeLilloFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But, as Bernard MacMahon’s terrific, archive-stuffed documentary reveals, Led Zeppelin had a more roundabout gestation. Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones were in-demand session players in 60s London, while singer Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham were jobbing musicians in Birmingham. It wasn’t until Page joined the Yardbirds that he realised his dream of a no-singles group with a heavy, improvisational edge. Featuring interviews with the surviving members, rare audio of Bonham and big chunks of gig footage, it’s a fascinating slice of rock history.Simon WardellThe Pickup, out now, Prime VideoRussell (Eddie Murphy) is an armoured truck guard edging towards retirement who is paired with irritating newbie Travis (Pete Davidson) on a long day of deliveries.

Oddly, Tim Story’s chase caper turned heist thriller makes Murphy the straight man to Davidson’s goofball, at the expense of the star’s comic abilities.

Dusting off the DeLorean, Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) flies back to 1885 to save Christopher Lloyd’s stranded Doc Brown from being shot dead by Buford Tannen, Biff’s ancestor. Playful tweaks to the genre and a romance for Doc with Mary Steenburgen’s teacher are the new elements in an otherwise familiar plot of cobbled-together gadgetry, space-time dilemmas and jolly slapstick comedy.SWMargrete: Queen of the North, 1.05am, BBC TwoCharlotte Sieling’s 2021 historical drama takes a footnote from the life of a 14th-century Danish royal and gives it a dusting of Game of Thrones-style clan politics, generational scheming and nation building. The estimable Trine Dyrholm is magnetic as Margrete, who – despite being a woman in a man’s world – has unified Norway, Sweden and Denmark and presides over a time of peace. Then a man appears claiming to be her long-dead son, which puts her adopted heir Erik (Morten Hee Andersen) in a funk and threatens to destabilise her hard-won pact.SWLive sportChampionship Football: Southampton v Wrexham, 11am, Sky Sports Main EventFollowed by Sheffield Utd v Bristol City at 5.15pm.

Had I gone to see the film in the upper reaches of the northern hemisphere, where daylight is near-permanent in the summer months? No I was in Leicester Square – a different kind of barren wasteland than the Arctic tundra – and there was another reason for the brightness: The Naked Gun was only 1hr 25m long.Very few modern films – aside from those of the child-friendly variety – clock in at less than 90 minutes, but even so The Naked Gun doesn’t feel a total outlier. In fact, of the last three blockbusters I’ve seen at the cinema, only one – Superman – went beyond the two hour mark, and only by 10 minutes. The other, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, was 1hr 54m, relatively svelte for a 21st-century superhero movie. Granted, earlier in this summer we had Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning, clocking in at a Brobdingnagian 2hr 49m (and boy, at times did it feel it), but looking back now, that almost feels a relic from and earlier, more indulgent time.Because, generally the blockbuster seems to be getting shorter. The average forthis year’s top 10 movies so farat the US box office (which seems to me the best benchmark for the health of the blockbuster given they make and consume the bulk of them), is 2hr 4m. That number (sure to be nudged up further by Avatar: Fire and Ash later this year) is actually higher thanlast year’s averagebetween the top 10 – 2h 01m – but way down on the 2hr 15m and 2hr 16m of2023and2022respectively. Those years admittedly featured some hefty movies like Oppenheimer (3hrs) bumping up their averages, but also some silly lengths for movies of a more disposable nature: how, for example did John Wick 4, a dialogue-light film about a man hurting other men in various imaginative ways, clock in at a whopping 2hr and 49m? Or why did The Batman brush right up to the three-hour mark? And did the live-action Little Mermaid really need to be two and a quarter hours? The animated original managed to rattle through the story in almost an hour less.Listen, we probably talk too much about films being too long these days: it’s something I have definitely been guilty of in this newsletter, somewhat absurdly because I don’t actually have a problem with long films at all – especially when abladder-aiding intermission is includedas part of the deal. I’m generally of the belief that films should be as long as they need to be and, in some cases, a filmneeds to be very long indeed. But it’s certainly the case that blockbusters, once designed to provide quick, easy thrills, have tended toward bloat since the 2010s. Much of that of course has to do with the steroidal growth of the superhero movie, which, in service of the “expanded universe model” of interlocking films, had to incorporate more and more convoluted backstories and peripheral characters into its run times. That feature soon became a bug, with endless complaintsin thinkpiecesand on forums that superhero films had grown too long.View image in fullscreenBrevity over quality … Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, and Teyonah Parris as Captain Monica Rambeau in The Marvels.Photograph: Marvel StudiosBut there has been a sense in recent years that the superhero industrial complex has listened to the ambient noise around its films being too long. You could see those stirrings in the desire by Nia DaCosta, director of 2023’s The Marvels, to make that filmunder two hours. She succeeded and then some: it’s the shortest Marvel movie of all, at 1hr 45m. (Though given The Marvels is regarded as one of the weakest Marvel movies, such brevity doesn’t always equal quality.)Equally Superman director James Gunnhad to deny rumoursWarner Bros had ordered him to make the film shorter: he perhaps should have listened given the movie’s weakest moment is an impossible to follow city-smashing final battle that goes on for at least five minutes more than it needs to. Certainly there’s a sense watching The Fantastic Four that it strives to stay under the two-hour mark. In doing so it perhaps over-corrects a little: a blossoming romance between Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s The Thing and Natasha Lyonne’s schoolteacher suddenly vanishes midway through the movie – or more likely was sent to the cutting room floor by clockwatchers. Still, that did probably contribute to a film that, while not without flaws, felt appealingly brisk.Hopefully more mainstream movies can follow its example, as well as that of The Naked Gun, whose 1hr 25m runtime is identical to that of the original movie in the franchise in 1988. Back then that was a little less of an outlier: the average run time of thetop 10 highest grossers that year– a time Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Coming To America, Die Hard and the like reigned supreme – was a positively breezy 1hr 48m … so there’s still a long way to go in films getting shorter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In his cruellest moments, it was a way for Antrobus’s black father, who died in 2014, to say “I don’t understand you. I don’t love you. You don’t understand my pain.”Antrobus, 38, is calm and reflective when he talks about this. As a deaf person who relies on hearing aids and lip-reading to communicate, he says he has long had to “make sense of myself for other people”.“I got to this point where I was like: what would happen if I didn’t have to do that? What does freedom look like for me?” It was writing poetry that got him to that place, and with that has come a great deal of critical acclaim: his first collection, The Perseverance, published in 2018, won the Rathbones Folio prize (now the Writers’ prize), the Sunday Times young writer of the year award and theTed Hughes award. That last felt somewhat ironic, given that The Perseverance contains a redacted version of Hughes’s poem Deaf School, along with Antrobus’s response, which grapples with its hurtful depiction of deaf children. In Hughes’s poem, the students “lacked a subtle wavering aura of sound” and are “alert and simple”; Antrobus’s poem After Reading Deaf School by the Mississippi River flips it: “Ted isalertandsimple. / Tedlacked a subtle wavering aura of sound”.Antrobus is driven by the desire to understand people and their motivations. His father’s “white” insult came from a projection of his insecurities about his own identity, he believes now. Born in rural Jamaica, the darkest-skinned of seven brothers, his father developed an “ugly duckling” complex from a young age, and was sent to live with an aunt in Kingston when he was three. As a young adult, after his own father had moved to England, he was sent for, moving first to Wolverhampton and later London, where he met Antrobus’s mother at a squatters’ party. Both the poet’s parents had other partners initially, and their relationship was marked by his father’s disappearances, but it lasted in some way or another until Antrobus was four or five. At that point, the writer’s grandmother stepped in to help look after him and his older sister. Even as a child, Antrobus could sense his father’s complicated relationship with his homeland – after a visit to Jamaica 15 years after he had left, his father“found that the place had changed so much and he couldn’t relate to people in the same way. And then they started calling him white because he’d been away so long.”As well as being a second-generation Jamaican immigrant, on his white mother’s side the writer is related to Sir Edmund Antrobus, an enslaver who owned plantations in Jamaica, British Guiana and St Kitts. “It gives me this perspective, of my nation, of my language, which is always slightly like one foot on the land and one foot in the sea,” he says. He has researched the Antrobus lineage and visited the Cheshire village from which the name hails. “Edmund Antrobus’s wealth did not trickle down to my family or to the Antrobuses that are living there in Antrobus village. The wealth has been extracted” – those descendants are in South Africa and have been made even richer by “diamond mine stuff”, he says. “It’s just weird. Should I feel complicit in that?”The only way he has found to reckon with his own identity is through creativity. “I’ve fought through it, I’ve felt through it,” he says, which led him to think: “How can I bring other people into that?” His teaching work – Antrobus is a freelance poetry teacher and editor, and a board member atthe Poetry School– was one way he has been able to help others. It has been a source of guilt that he hasn’t been able to take on as much of that kind of work of late. He puts a lot of pressure on himself to “give back”.I’ve been visiting deaf schools for a decade now, and I’m still yet to see provision that matched the care I got“I’m carrying survivor’s guilt,” he says. Born in Hackney in 1986, he grew up attending a mixture of deaf and hearing schools, and was given specialised support in order to learn to speak, write, sign and lip-read effectively. “I’ve been visiting deaf schools for a decade now, and I’m still yet to see provision that matched the care I got,” he says. Given the closures of deaf schools and cuts to provisions for deaf pupils made over the last three decades, to get the same level of support now “I would have to be the child of an aristocrat”. And without that support, he probably wouldn’t have been able to write. “It blows my mind.”That’s not to say that Antrobus had an easy ride: for a long while, in order to fit in, he resisted anything that would make him look more deaf. His parents – both hearing – never learned sign language, which his mother still feels guilty about. “But it wasn’t really just her fault,” the writer says. “It was also me refusing it.” As a child, he was constantly trying to minimise the fact that he was deaf, whipping out his hearing aids whenever photos were taken and refusing to use the British Sign Language (BSL) he learned at school in front of the hearing children “out of self-consciousness”. He learned ways to avoid bullying, joining both the deaf and hearing teams for football, athletics and swimming. “That’s what kind of saved me,” he says: the social status he was afforded by being good at sport gave him a free pass from the bullying he saw other, non-sporty deaf children experience.Having written three acclaimed poetry collections and two children’s books – the first of which, Can Bears Ski?, became the first everCBeebies bedtime storyto be read in sign language, by deaf actor Rose Ayling-Ellis – Antrobus has now turned to writing adult prose. The Quiet Ear pays homage to Antrobus’s teachers of the deaf, and sets out to show why deaf children deserve so much more support than they are currently receiving. The author describes it as “memoir as advocacy”, charting events in his own life while weaving in deaf history and a call to arms.It feels like a timely book, in an era when healthcare is in crisis and diversity and inclusion measures are under threat across the globe. Antrobus has firsthand experience of contending with “anti-woke” culture in the US, having lived in Oklahoma with his then wife, who is American, for three years. It was ultimately the cost of private healthcare that drew the couple back to the UK when they were expecting their son, having been “hit with a crazy bill”. They had initially planned to return after their son’s birth, but worries about the US approach to “healthcare, DEI, all of that stuff which sounds like science fiction” convinced them to stay in the UK, and though they have since separated, they continue to co-parent in Margate.Yet, though a preferable place to raise a child in some ways, the UK is still at “primary school level” when thinking about disability in general, Antrobus says. He has been pleased to see some positive developments when it comes to deaf rights and awareness, such as Ayling-Ellis winning Strictly Come Dancing in 2021 and becoming a well-known public figure (“She is going to have an impact on the culture in the UK for ever”) and thepassing of the British Sign Language Actin 2022, which put BSL on course to become a recognised language. But he is disheartened by the government’s proposed cuts to personal independence payments (Pips) for disabled people and the continued closure of deaf schools.Margate, where he has been living for the last year, has a “significant deaf history”, but the Royal School for Deaf Children in Margate, one of the oldest deaf schools in the UK,closed in 2015with no replacement, and the Margate Deaf Club is no longer running. “I haven’t been able to access the deaf community here. It’s dissipated. And that, I think, is an example of what is happening all over the country,” he says. “There’s more separation, isolation, hurdles to jump through.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionI haven’t been able to access the deaf community here. It has dissipated – it’s the same all over the countrySuch isolation can be fatal – as the author demonstrates in The Quiet Ear when he writes about a former classmate. Tyrone had worn bright blue hearing aids that he would sometimes pimp up with drawings and stickers, emboldening Antrobus to be more open about his own deafness, since “the girls still really fancied” Tyrone. After leaving school, though, Tyrone lost contact with his deaf friends, struggled to assimilate into the hearing world, developed alcoholism and was arrested on domestic abuse charges. In prison, he did not have his hearing aids and was not referred for new ones after a counsellor deemed his communication to be “fine without them”; he ultimately died by suicide in his cell.It is no wonder, then, that Antrobus feels so indebted to his teachers, to his mum, his mentors – to everyone who kept him off a path similar to Tyrone’s. Now, when he meets people who don’t feel “properly deaf”, he encourages them to embrace their identity and find a community – as when he was walking near his home recently and approached a man with a cochlear implant.After Antrobus said, “Oh, my deaf friend, how are you doing?” and started signing to him, the man became “stiff and anxious”, explaining that he didn’t know sign language. Exclusionary attitudes from signing deaf people had made this man feel that he wasn’t welcome in deaf communities. Traditionally, there was an emphasis on what Antrobus refers to as “capital ‘D’ Deaf people”, who are culturally Deaf, “sign as a first language and are engaged in deaf history and identity”. When the writer explained to this man that the deaf world is very open now, “he started crying, and said, ‘Thank you so much. I needed permission to be a deaf person.’”Antrobus’s hope is that The Quiet Ear will give more deaf people that permission, and educate hearing people about what the community needs. When it comes to deaf and disability rights, “we are at quite an interesting and, I hope, transitional, point”, he says. He is encouraged by how many people are speaking out against the proposed changes to Pips and learning more about disability justice. “It’s good, it’s giving people energy.”There will be a follow-up to The Quiet Ear, Antrobus says, “about language, about voice, about class” – but not about deafness. In the meantime, he’s hoping to work more in the art world, having been commissioned to create work for the Guggenheim and the Barbican. “It challenges me to think in a new dimension,” he says. When we speak, he is just about to travel to Italy for a month-long residency at the esteemed Civitella Ranieri Foundation for artists and writers. “It’s exciting,” but there’s also a part of him that is sad and anxious – this is the longest he has been away from his son.Antrobus clearly loves being a parent – at any mention of his three-year-old he becomes warmer, softer. But “it is difficult, balancing work and parenting,” he says, acknowledging that by asking their son’s mother to take care of him while Antrobus goes away for work he is “giving her a weight”.He tries not to give too much time to other parenting worries, about how his son’s sense of identity will be shaped by social media, or him growing up as a black child in a country that has recently had race riots. “If I was to lean too much into that, I would go mad,” he says, but he hopes that his son will have “a lot more certainty and grounding” about who he is than Antrobus had as a child.Raymond Antrobus: ‘Deafness is an experience, not a trauma’Read moreHis son is hearing, though is learning to sign, and Antrobus “would put money on him doing the BSL GCSE” when he is older. Antrobus himself is able to communicate better than ever, using SSE (sign supported English) and the help of hi-tech hearing aids that connect to his phone (he switched to a private audiology clinic after winning the Ted Hughes award). As a champion of the NHS “going private was a guilt thing”, yet having access to the latest models via private healthcare has meant he “can relax a bit more”, no longer having to rely on lip-reading as much.Antrobus is determined to make use of everything he has been given, to make work like The Quiet Ear, to keep advocating for better resources for deaf people. “I’ve probably been given more than I’ve given back,” he says. “So I owe the world a lot.”The Quiet Ear by Raymond Antrobus is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson.

It is set in a fancy new Manchester nick where conditions are uncommonly good: a 25-day riot in the notoriously crowdedStrangewayshas fast-tracked the introduction of a softly-softly regime. There is one man to a cell, so tensions should be minimised, and only troublemakers are subject to frequent searches. Yet every time Edwards introduces a new inmate, he takes us one step closer to catastrophe.It is like a laboratory experiment in which a mad scientist adds unstable chemicals to a test tube and turns on the Bunsen burner. The steadiest element is Frankie Donnelly, a recovering addict who is in for three-and-a-half years for importing drugs disguised as bars of chocolate. On his side is an even temper, a typewriter and a history of political activism; beyond that, he is at the mercy of his fellow inmates.View image in fullscreenThomas at Summerhall.Photograph: Pamela RaithThey include Kenny, a vulnerable and volatile victim of sexual abuse; Robert, a “white Muslim” drug lord; Bron, a former British soldier with a lethal form of PTSD; and Tommy, who may or may not be an IRA operative. Placating one could trigger another. A chain reaction seems inevitable.Amusingly, Edwards plays against the tension as well as leaning into it. With the audience on tenterhooks, a whimper can be as much fun as a bang. None of these men is precisely the monster you expect. There is humanity, tenderness and care even in this brutal environment.The playwright could find no better interpreter than Mark Thomas, extending a relationship that began withEngland & Son, a play that managed to make a link between juvenile offending and colonialism. Strident and demonstrative, he powers his way through the script under the direction of Charlotte Bennett for Paines Plough, ratcheting up the stakes and jumping brilliantly from scouse narco to Belfast terrorist or bent screw to create a distinct and distinctly dangerous set of characters.Behind the time bomb humour lies a subtle analysis of the social and cultural reasons these damaged men are behind bars. They are not innocent, exactly, but men swept up in forces beyond their control.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is quite the statement about her 86-year-old grandmother whom she was taken to visit as a teenager, when all she wanted to do was go to the movies. To Paterson, Niusia was an old curmudgeon full of complaints and cruelties.But she proceeds to take us on the journey that she went on after Niusia’s death, when she became curious about who her Polish immigrant grandmother had been before settling in Melbourne.It turns out that she had beenHolocaustsurvivor, although, typically for one who had lived through its trauma, she rarely talked about the time “before”.Under the direction of her collaborator Kat Yates, Paterson excavates her grandmother’s past, beginning with her successful businesses in Melbourne, which she singlehandedly built. But the drama then spools back to the beginning: her birth in Warsaw in 1922, her ambitions to become a doctor before her imprisonment in Auschwitz and, chillingly, the medical work she was forced to do under the Nazi eugenicist Josef Mengele.Patterson’s attitude toward Niusia changes after the airing of these memories, sourced through her mother, whose voice we hear in recordings.This is a surprisingly warm play given its theme of the Holocaust and inherited trauma. Paterson is a sweet, perky storyteller, singing at times and incorporating her play-making process into her narration. Sometimes this seems pertinent, other times unnecessary.She brings some taboo-busting humour to the subject, which also only half works. It defuses the tension but sounds like random lines from an edgy standup routine.There are life lessons for Paterson along the way, which she speaks aloud, recommending books that are in brown boxes and which she reaches for at various moments. It is clear that the disinterring of personal history is part of an education – one she now imparts to us.The narrative strays from Niusia towards the end, on to Paterson’s Australian Jewish identity and the anxiety of not being seen as Jewish enough – which could make for a play of its own. It is ultimately Niusia’s story that grips. Paterson puts on an accent to bring her back to life. We hear that she went on to have twins after leaving the camp. As Paterson says, isn’t that the best “fuck you” to Mengele?

(They may see the recentcancellation of that prizeas proving their point.) The character comic quotes that unlikely coverage at the start of her new set, a (marginally) more theatrical offering with which she promises to kill off theatre as well. In a show full of one-liners to rival her 2023 prizewinner, the choicest joke may be the idea that this mild-mannered, delightfully silly act poses any kind of mortal threat whatsoever.Just asher acclaimed debut Skin Pigeonshowcased an array of unapologetically weird female characters, so too does 24 Hour Diner People – with the twist that, this time, they’re all to be found in the same, titular location. The first is a waitress given to eating her tips. Just as Skin Pigeon featured a cowboy with guns for hands, we now meet a trucker with impossibly long arms. One recurring sketch airs the libidinous if immature fantasies of a teenage girl as prom approaches. Another, co-starring a press-ganged audience member, introduces us to a wannabe Bonnie and Clyde plotting a heist of the diner’s takings.Lorna Rose Treen: ‘Someone shouted along to one of my jokes, like I was a band’Read moreWhereas Treen herself was a largely invisible presence in Skin Pigeon, she peeks out from behind the disguises here to comment on the cartoon chaos unfolding. That adds to the generous spirit of an event whose host takes care to involve us in these outpourings of her dotty imagination. No point pretending its several strands all reach satisfactory conclusions, and there are points when endearingly messy and DIY shades into slapdash. A couple of musical numbers, too, don’t play to Treen’s strengths.But it’s easy to submit to the show’s warm embrace of stupidity, to the fine physical comedy of that spindly limbed trucker, and to a host of throwaway one-liners (“last week I did camp America – better known as San Francisco”) whose quality all but the Sun newspaper must admire. Far from killing comedy, Treen proves here that it – and hers in particular – is very much alive.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

When they weren’t so overwhelmed by being so overexposed and in demand,” Chuang said.“It was a really precious few months in which they’re realising who they are, who they are to other people, and want to participate in that image formation.”The Beatles released their first two albums in 1963: Please Please Me and With the Beatles, which catapulted them into the limelight, powered by whatthe Guardian called“a different and heavily northern-flavoured sound of their own”.The band followed that up in 1964 withsingles including A Hard Day’s Nightand two more albums that helped them break America and become a global phenomenon.View image in fullscreenAt London Airport (with Brian Epstein, Mal Evans, and Neil Aspinall) for Pan Am flight 101 to New York City, 7 February 1964.Photograph: Paul McCartneyIn autumn 1963, McCartney decided to pick up a camera, long before he and the group became some of the most photographed people on the planet. He bought a simple Pentax and used mostly black and white Kodak and Ilford film, and took a small selection of colour images in early 1964.“I think they knew that history was happening,” said Chuang. “They wanted to capture it, and do it themselves. They picked a camera for the same reason anyone does, to have your own view.”There are also more reflective self-portraits taken before live shows and interviews. One of the self-portraits is taken in the attic of McCartney’s then girlfriend, the actorJane Asher, which is where he wrote the melody for Yesterday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I had drifted into advertising where the gods determined I would fall among novelists and playwrights who would lead me to a place I could never have imagined.My most important workmate was a former schoolteacher, 32 years old, the father of six children, but an apprentice just as I was, still waiting for the day when his copy would be accepted by our boss. I drove Barry Oakley to work. He gave me Kerouac’s Lonesome Traveler and other books he had reviewed, made sure that I saw Chekhov and Beckett and Ionesco, accompanied me to the first two art exhibitions of my life.View image in fullscreenSidney Nolan’s paintings of Ned Kelly left an indelible mark on a young Carey.Photograph: State Library VictoriaIt was lunchtime at the office when we boarded the tram to see The Ned Kelly Paintings 1946–47: Sidney Nolanat George’s art gallery.I had no expectation of anything except the egg and lettuce sandwich waiting for me back at work, no idea that Nolan’s Kelly paintings were about to burn into my brain and leave their mark for ever.It was 1963 and to quote One Hundred Years of Solitude, “the world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point”.It was the year I discovered Ornette Coleman and Ingmar Bergman, Robbe-Grillet, Bob Dylan, The Cantos of Ezra Pound. I stumbled into James Joyce’s Ulysses and – ignorant as I may have been – recognised a holy place, a blasphemous cathedral which had been banned, unbanned, banned again.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsThese ecstatic moments are denied the old and wise, reserved for the very young who turn the pages of Ulysses and who can hardly believe that such a string of words exists:I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom.Are you allowed to say that?View image in fullscreenCarey in 1964.Photograph: Maggie Diaz/State Library VictoriaIt was the year I read Allen Ginsberg’s Howl and“saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked”.I sought out Max Brown’s Australian Son: The Story of Ned Kellyand it was hereI found that Ned Kelly had also been a writer tortured by the cruelties of the British law. There were 56 pages and in every one he was on fire, enraged, breathless, a widow’s son outlawed.Dear God, I thought, has no one ever really understood what Ned wrote before he robbed the bank at Jerilderie? Did no one see what I saw – that our famous bushranger was a raging poet?my mother and four or five men lagged innocent, and is my brothers and sisters and my mother not to be pitied also who has no alternative only to put up with the brutal and cowardly conduct of a parcel of big ugly, fat necked, wombat headed, big bellied, magpie legged, narrow hipped splay-footed sons of Irish bailiffs or English landlords which is better known as officers of justice or Victorian police who some calls honest gentlemen(Ned Kelly – The Jerilderie Letter)I transcribed the letter and carried it on my person like the relic of a martyred saint. I knew (if no one else did) that I would be a writer and I would know how to do something with this letter when the time arrived. In 1964 I wrote my first unpublishable novel. In 1966 I tried again. So it went. Attempts. Failures.Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground. By 1974, when I finally became airborne,I had lost the Jerilderie Letter.Years passed. Three lives later I was living in New York City. It was 1993 and the Metropolitan Museum of Art was exhibiting the sameKelly paintings I had seen 30 years before. If I did not rush to see them it was because I was certain they could never dazzle the man as they had the callow boy.View image in fullscreenA document about Ned Kelly from Victoria police circa 1874.Photograph: State Library VictoriaBut my friend the Vassar professor was acting as a docent for the exhibition, and it was he who finally persuaded me to visit and then – dear Jesus – what wonders. I was amazed and proud, of us, of Ned, of Nolan, and I began taking my downtown friends uptown see the show. And as I circled the rooms telling the strange story to my victims, it struck me: I was going to write this bloody novel after all.Why write about Ned Kelly, said my old Sydney friend. We know all about him.Peter Carey on True History of the Kelly Gang: ‘At 56, I wrote what my younger self could not have managed’Read moreAnd yes, we knew the police reports and the court transcripts. We knew the Land Acts and the day Ned fought Wild Wright. We knew Jerilderie, Euroa, Stringybark Creek and Constable Fitzpatrick. We knew the history all the way to the execution in Melbourne jail.But you cannot know a boy’s soul from a police report. And Ned Kelly was a boy for most of his short life, and we – having the image of the bearded outlaw in our mind – hadn’t spared a thought for that smooth-cheeked boy who loved his mother, lost his father to police, was apprenticed to a bushranger named Harry Power.View image in fullscreenPhotographs and notes from  Carey’s research materials while writing True History of the Kelly Gang.Photograph: State Library VictoriaI raided Ian Jones’ Ned Kelly to find my story’s spine but I also read obsessively around the subject. I visited Eleven Mile Creek, Benalla, Stringybark Creek, Greta, the first time with my dear friend Paul Priday and Sam, my 11-year-old son, the second time with the architect Richard Leplastrier and publisher Laurie Muller. Laurie was a horseman. Laurie taught me the landscape from a horseman’s point of view, forced me to climb hills I would rather have ignored, sleep out in a swag on a rainy night when, honestly, I preferred a motel bed. The three of us visited Powers Lookout while hungover from duty-free Laphroaig, but not even alcohol poisoning could diminish Leplastrier’s supreme visual intelligence. I made notes, saved a leaf at Stringybark Creek, composed an encyclopedia of smells.The book that finally emerged owes so much to Richard and Laurie, but also to my first 10 years of life in Bacchus Marsh, one hour’s drive from Beveridge where Ned was born. It was just 60 years since Ned’s departure when I arrived and you could hear the language of Ned’s letter in the playground of State School #28.View image in fullscreenCarey’s notebook shows the author mapping out the chapters in True History of the Kelly Gang.Photograph: State Library VictoriaAnd it was thatlanguagethat made me want to write True History of the Kelly Gang, to make a modern poetry from the voice of a hero who was condemned to death by the founder of State Library Victoria, the same institution that now holds his Jerilderie Letter, his armour and every word I wrote about his tragedy.All sorts of problems lay ahead of me, but I would never have a problem with the voice.It’s easy to recognise a writer who’s just come from their desk. You can see it in their haunted eyes, as if they’re still living in another world. This manuscript is that world. It is where I lived a thousand days, always confident about the voice but, Lord … what was it really like to be an Irish immigrant a century ago? What was it like to be 16, locked inside a cell in Beechworth. What were the dimensions of the cell. Where was the shelf, the cruel unbending bed? What does a boy feel to have his father stolen from him, handcuffed to the stirrup iron of a policeman’s mare. My notebooks are a mess of endless questions, inept drawings. What happens when Easter arrives in Australian autumn instead of Holy Irish spring? When the convicts were transported was the banshee left behind? For Ned to come alive I needed to think of things we had never thought before. That is the thrill and the terror of a writer’s life, to walk out on the tightrope every day. The manuscript reveals none of this.View image in fullscreenPapers and drafts of True History of the Kelly Gang.Photograph: State Library VictoriaIf you read the bottom left-hand corner of the manuscript you will easily learn what words were printed on a given day. But there is nothing to show what words have been inserted, transposed, deleted, when the banshee crawled in from the dark.You could ask my computer if you had the skill, but the computer isn’t talking and the only way to get the information is to read all 4,000 pages of the manuscript, not like you or I might read a finished book, but like a saint or mad person in a cell, someone with patience to annotate a river or a cloud.View image in fullscreenA hardcover edition of True History of the Kelly Gang.Photograph: State Library VictoriaAs it happens, my published novel imagines this very reader. Is it he or she or they? A librarian perhaps? It is a someone I invented, a someone who has collected Ned’s scattered pages and collated them into 13 parcels. This has allowed me to map the passage of time, to add layers of information, and also – an important point – provide chapters for my readers.Of course my Ned was not thinking in terms of books or chapters. He had no time for commas and it is this that gives his voice an urgency and passion, never pausing when it would be grammatically correct to do so.“This is a fabulous story,” my New York agent said, “But you don’t need to write it like this.”But I did need to write it just like that. And she was the excellent agent who had long ago introduced me to Gary Fisketjon (who published Cormac McCarthy) and whoI knewwould surely know how to read what I had written.I had never wished for line editing fromanyone, but now I welcomed Gary’s insistent questioning. Yes he was American and we can be amused that he queried the word mopoke. But he got the book, loved the book, never relented in his demand that it be as good as it could be, that the jacket be right, that the map be perfect. There was no escape from his passion. He tracked me down in Europe and spent five hours on the phone arguing about ampersands because he wanted posterity to fully understand thatyou knew what you were doing. He made lists for the foreign publishers and proofreaders who would publish later, just so they would understand that what might be an error in The Chicago Manual of Style was exactly what the author wished in print.View image in fullscreenNed Kelly in Chains taken by photographer Charles Nettleton.Photograph: State Library VictoriaGary went out on a limb for that book, sold it to the sales force, the booksellers and anyone else who would listen to him. Finally I knew what writers mean when they say they were “well published”.Some have questioned my title, but Gary never did. He trusted the book was what Ned named it, with a label declaring it was the true story of a widow’s son who had been subject of perjury, false witness by the police and press.

Despite facing heartbreak and press intrusion, he’s ‘feeling Zen’ as he turns 40 – and about to step it up a gear with two epic new showsSat 9 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTShareTwo days before we meet, James Norton turned 40. To celebrate, he threw a massive party at his home in north-east London – and he’s still feeling the effects. “I didn’t get any sleep,” he admits, “and yesterday was just a huge clear-up, so if I struggle for a word or an anecdote, please forgive me.”To be fair, I’ve seen Norton in worse shape. The last time I encountered him in person he was naked, crawling around on all fours while being spat at. “Oh, yeah,” he smiles, realising I’m talking about his performance as Jude in the2023 stage versionof A Little Life. In that play, an adaptation of Hanya Yanagihara’s cult tragic novel, he remained on stage at the Savoy theatre in London for its whopping three-and-a-half-hour length, fully immersed in a character who suffers an immense, seemingly never-ending ordeal of sexual abuse and self-­harm. “That was a proper … ” He trails off and exhales. “That was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.”Norton has talked in the past about how playing Jude took it out of him – he would find himself unable to stop crying, or rendered catatonic. Despite all this, the moment the play ended he thought, “What if that’s it? What if it’s never as challenging again? It’s like those people who run a marathon, it nearly kills them, and then two weeks later they want to sign up for another.”‘Smooth with a sinister edge’: readers on who the next James Bond should beRead moreThis is what we’re here to talk about today: the career equivalent of that second marathon. For Norton, it’s two huge TV projects, the kind that could turn him from one of Britain’s most admired actors – known for playing complex men in shows such asHappy Valleyand films such asMr Jones– into a global name (not for nothing have rumours persisted that he could be the next Bond). First is King & Conqueror, the new BBC drama he has been working on with his production company, Rabbit Track, for seven years. It tells the epic story of 1066 and the battle between Harold Godwinson (Norton) and William, Duke of Normandy (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) for the English crown. Then there’s House of Guinness, a glossy Netflix drama about the Irish stout dynasty, written by Steven Knight who made Peaky Blinders. They are landing at a moment that feels transformative for the actor – and not only because of any just-turned-40 jitters.A few years ago, Norton had been worried that acting was frivolous – “dressing up and fucking around” as he puts it. But A Little Life made him realise that, no, it has a purpose. He would meet real-life abuse survivors at the stage door every night and learn how important the show had been for them. It made him think about his own past, as a victim of bullies while a young teen at boarding school. And by literally baring all on stage, he became more open, even if said openness – such as spilling his feelings about his 2023 split with former fiancee and fellow actor Imogen Poots, during a panel at this year’s Glastonbury festival, which went viral on TikTok – sometimes leaves him feeling exposed. “If I’d known there was a journalist in the audience I probably wouldn’t have been so honest,” he says with a smile. “I’m realising more and more everyone has a fucking phone.”We meet in Ham Yard, fittingly the same Soho hotel where Norton celebrated A Little Life’s closing party. He cycled here alone and I spot him wandering around the bar, looking for someone who might feasibly be a journalist. In his baggy trousers and T-shirt, he makes for cheerful, relaxed company, though he assures me he often turns up to interviews dripping in sweat from having pedalled frantically to make it on time. He has a puppyish enthusiasm for his work and when he smiles – which is often – his eyes crinkle up and close. When a passing woman interrupts us to tell him, “I think you’re an amazing actor,” he bashfully thanks her before turning to me and pretending he’s writing this piece: “And at this point, the actor’s mum turns up.”View image in fullscreen‘Too much time and space makes me slightly inert.’ Photograph: Silvana Trevale/The Guardian. Clothes:Dior MenNorton orders tea – Earl Grey with a spot of oat milk – and tells me about King & Conqueror. “I put my hands up and admit I didn’t know the story at all,” he says. “I just had a vague gloss of it from school. I wasn’t aware of the relationship Harold and William had before the battle, that they were friends and allies for many years before they realised that, because of the way Europe was being carved up, they would both inevitably end up on a battlefield – and one of them would have to die.”The Rest Is History podcast once compared the events leading up to 1066 to Game of Thrones, and Norton agrees. “It’s mad to think nobody has really done it before,” he says. “And that’s one of the reasons we spent so long developing it.”Producing is clearly new territory for Norton. King & Conqueror was shot in Iceland, and he found himself struggling with concepts that don’t normally intrude on an actor’s consciousness, such as budget. “It’s the closest I’ve ever come to feeling like I’d bitten off too much,” Norton says. “I started using the word ‘burnout’, which is just, like, oh God.” He likes to play down any struggles he talks about, hyper aware people may be thinking, “Oh, give it a rest, you’re making television.” But he’s also keen to point out that being under pressure is really his ideal performance state: “I just do better. Too much time and space makes me slightly inert.”I remember a director saying, ‘Can you be a bit more charismatic?’ That’s hard to do when you're young and self-consciousFar less stressful, he says, is his forthcoming role – purely as an actor – in House of Guinness. No budget worries here: he plays Sean Rafferty, a whip-cracking hardman who keeps the stout company’s workers in line while the Guinness siblings fall into a Succession-style squabble over inheritance, sparked by their father Sir Benjamin’s devilishly crafted will. Norton – who used a special accent coach to nail not only the area (Dublin) but also the period (mid-19th century) – says an awful lot of Guinness 0.0 was consumed on set. And off set?“We shot it in Liverpool, which is full of good Irish pubs. So, yeah, we were splitting the Gs and all that.” He’s referring to the art of making sure your first gulp of Guinness leaves the pint settled at the “G” on the branded glass. Did he perfect it? “IthinkI did,” he says, sounding very unsure. “It usually happened later in the night. I mean … I’ve got vague memories of jumping around a pub.”Whether on or off camera, Norton feels comfortable at the centre of the action these days, which hasn’t always been the case. Back when he was starting out as an actor, he auditioned for Fifty Shades of Grey. “And I remember the director saying, ‘Can you be a bit morecharismatic?’” He laughs. “That’s the hardest thing to just try and do! Especially since I was too young and self-conscious to even really know what she meant.”These days, he thinks he has acquired the age and experience to perform a darkly magnetic character such as Rafferty. “And it felt great,” he says. “Because it taps into that alter ego of who you’d love to be. He’s violent, but he’s romantic, too. There’s a thug in all of us.”View image in fullscreenIn Happy Valley with Sarah Lancashire …Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyView image in fullscreenin A Little Life Luke Thompson …Photograph: Jan VersweyveldView image in fullscreenand in King & Conqueror.Photograph: BBC/Rabbit Track Pictures/RVK Studios/The Development Company/Shepherd Content/CBS Studios/Lila JonsNorton portrayed one of the great villains of British television in Happy Valley’s Tommy Lee Royce. The character he helped create – charming, psychopathic, but in glimpses vulnerable, too – is what he does perfectly. His roles often strike a nerve because they wrestle with the pressures and flaws of modern masculinity.The secret to playing a character like Royce, he says, is that you have to like them on some level. “In the early stages, someone like Tommy was defined only by cruelty and violence, when in fact he’s defined by damage, trauma and fear. So the way in is trying to separate acts that are inherently abhorrent and unforgivable from the context. And the context is that, nearly always, anyone capable of that type of cruelty has been subjected to cruelty. So he’s just a deeply sad, damaged man. Maybe ‘like’ is the wrong word, but empathy for sure.”Happy Valley made Norton a household name, but he says he has been lucky that his career has involved big next steps rather than giant leaps that might have left him out of his depth. He started in theatre, and did some guest days on TV and film, before Happy Valley was followed by shows such as Grantchester, in which he played sleuthing vicar Sidney Chambers, andMcMafia, as the son of a Russian mafia boss living in London. Then came the chance to do A Little Life. The thought of playing the lead terrified Norton – which was the reason Poots and his agent told him he had to do it.If playing Jude was gruelling, there were other factors that made it even harder for Norton. At 22 he was diagnosed with diabetes and, as a result, is constantly hooked up via Bluetooth to a glucose monitor (he has to self-inject up to 15 times a day). For A Little Life he carefully stashed sugar gels around the stage to help him stay on top of things. If the Bluetooth failed, a stage manager would be on alert to get the message to him. “Someone might be doing an intimate scene with me, or something violent, and when they were close up they’d whisper ‘three point two’, then carry on. It was intense.”View image in fullscreen‘I want to be honest but I don’t want to talk about my relationships at all.’ Photograph: Silvana Trevale/The Guardian. Clothes:Saint LaurentOn only one occasion did Norton fail to respond in time. “One horrible thing about having a hypoglycemic moment is you get a kind of clarity at first, which makes you think you don’t need sugar. Then what happens next is like a sort of terrible psychedelic trip, where you’re so confused you don’t know where you are.” It happened during a scene where he was required to run around the stage. “It was terrifying. I was dripping with sweat, dropping my lines, confused. The actors could all tell something wasn’t right.”When the play first opened, some audience members disobeyed the strict no-cameras rule and snapped Norton during his naked scenes – photos even ended upappearing on MailOnline. He must have felt violated?“Yeah … I mean, violated is probably too strong. My strongest memory is that it was just a bit sad, a bit gross, this idea that it would be framed in a kind of titillating way when the subject matter was so clearly vicious and upsetting. But I think the reaction, generally, was that it was misjudged, which was gratifying.”I don’t like it when I’m photographed with a friend walking down the street and it’s told the next day like it’s a romanceThe naked scenes caused a lot of noise around the show. Norton said at the time he thought “as a culture”, we are “scared of the penis”, though he thinks we have since become a lot better at accepting male nudity on screen. Have we, though, I wonder? The biggest (excuse the pun) example of male nudity I can think of is The White Lotus, which involved the use of giant prosthetic ones. If those are what we’re all looking at, no wonder society is scared of the penis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s like in Pam & Tommy, where there’s an animatronic penis that talks.” He laughs while considering his position on all of this. “I can say that I have never had a prostheticoran animatronic penis. All my penis work is my own.”He falls silent. “Oh shit, that’s going to be the headline, isn’t it? Do I need to call my publicist?”Norton was born in south London but grew up in Malton, North Yorkshire. He has described his childhood as “idyllic” but that’s not exactly true. He was sent to boarding school and found himself being tormented by bullies there. “It’s that thing where a lot of boys are having separation anxiety, feelings of fear and confusion as to why they’ve been taken out of their home at the age of 11,” he says. “A lot of people retreat into themselves, and others deal with that same confusion by doing that Lord of the Flies thing and becoming the bully. I was young for my year and I became an exciting target because I would react to things that were thrown my way. I didn’t have the self-awareness to just go: whatever.”Norton has a tendency to play it down, but he acknowledges that the scars have stayed with him. “Oh, for sure. It’s something that is part of the jigsaw puzzle of my 40-now years.” In fact, part of the reason he took on the role of Jude was that he thought it might somehow rid him of the bullied child within. Did it go deeper than that: did he see fame as an act of revenge on the bullies?“There’s a sort of byproduct to the acting thing, which is that the barometer of your success is the public reaction,” he says. “That can get hijacked by parts of your personality which are needing affirmation, which we all have. That part of me is gratified by the feeling of being on a billboard or whatever. Then you step away from that and realise it’s not going to really get rid of that need for affirmation, because nothing will.”View image in fullscreen‘All my penis work is my own.’ Photograph: Silvana Trevale/The Guardian. Clothes and watch:Louis VuittonNorton thought he had a decent gauge when it came to not letting work intrude on his personal life. “I’ve always been clear about it taking up too much space at the expense of relationships and friendships,” he says. “But A Little Life, more than any other job, was where that didn’t happen. It took everything out of me.”As an outside observer, it’s hard not to wonder if the pressure he put himself under contributed to his split with Poots after six years. But he says no. “That happened naturally and amicably. Two actors going out is always challenging because of scheduling. We were travelling a lot. And that was one of many factors that brought a very happy relationship to an end.”Norton has given a decent impression of a man pretty comfortable with all aspects of fame – but since the split he has found the attention on his love life oppressive. “I’ve always tried to balance authenticity with privacy,” he says. “I want to be honest but I don’t want to talk about my relationships at all and I don’t like it when I get photographed with a friend walking down the street and it’s then told the next day like it’s a romance. Another romance!”‘Torture porn or serious literature?’: the love-hate phenomenon of cult novel A Little LifeRead moreThe week before we meet there has indeed been tabloid speculation about various women in Norton’s life. He was photographed with the socialite Flora Huddart; before that he was hanging out at the Lido festival in London with Lily Allen. “Snogging”, one tabloid reported, although if you actually looked at the pictures … “I’m not snogging them! Funny that, isn’t it?” he says. Norton is laughing while we discuss this, but there’s a subtle vibe shift in the room. Five minutes ago it felt as if he would have happily sat here chatting away for hours. Now, maybe he has an eye on the clock.“Look,” he says, “I’m a man in London going on occasional dates, meeting people, living my life, and it’s kind of no one’s business really.”Which is, of course, fair enough. The only reason he talked about his romantic life at Glastonbury, he says, was because Annie Mac asked him if he had experienced any big life changes, and he always tries to answer things honestly. “I was like, well, I had a breakup and that was a massive change.” He says he has been fortunate to go through life without having to deal with any major grief, but that he came to realise the split was a kind of grief in itself. “I lost the person,” he told the crowd, “but I also lost the life I was about to lead, the kids we had named, all that kind of stuff.”It probably didn’t help matters that, as he approached 40, Norton was starting to pick up roles as dads in shows such as Playing Nice (he calls it his “sad dad era”). “If you’d asked me at 25, I probably thought I might have a kid by 40,” he says. “But equally, I had a fucking great 30s, and hopefully kids might still be in my life at some point. That’s the privilege of being a man and not having to worry about my biological clock.” In a way, he says, he’s more relaxed now than he was a decade ago when everyone around him started having kids. “I think I did feel that pressure to get on the train, do the same thing.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Silvana Trevale/The Guardian. Styling throughout: Lewis Munro. Grooming: Petra Sellge at The Wall Group. Prop stylist: Grace Snellock. Top:Simone Rocha. Trousers:Solid Homme. Socks:Uniqlo. Shoes:Dr MartensIf Norton sounds Zen about it all now, there are good reasons why. After the split from Poots he went to Plum Village, a Buddhist retreat in France set up by the Vietnamese monk and activist Thích Nhat Hanh. Norton actually studied theology at Cambridge before he trained at Rada, specialising in Buddhist and Hindu faith, and as a teenager he had a period where he became “very committed” to Catholicism. But this is different, he says. “With Buddhism, you don’t really talk about faith. The teaching isn’t about worship. It’s about the self. It’s about one’s own journey and experience of the world. And it’s been amazing for me. It’s an incredible community and it’s given me an opportunity to just stop and recognise the value of quiet, peaceful space, which I don’t often give myself in life. Even just to rest and sleep. I think for a lot of my younger years I thought inaction and stasis was just a waste of time.”There’s certainly nottoomuch sleep or rest going on. Norton’s new producing gig is almost a full-time job, and a different one. “I sit at a desk, discuss ideas and read scripts. It’s broader and more empowering than just turning up very late in the development process as an actor.” He will be appearing in about half of the shows Rabbit Track produce, and there are other gigs, too – he has been filming Sunny Dancer, a British comedy about a teenage cancer survivor going to “chemo camp”, and will appear as Ormund Hightower, leading a march on King’s Landing, in season three of House of the Dragon.Norton has been generous with his time, but it’s the moment to wrap things up. I sense a hint of relief that there will be no more prying questions. “Was that OK?” I ask. “Or was it a bit … ” “Yeah, you went close,” he says, laughing.It’s only later that I start to wonder what he meant by that. I went close … to what, exactly? Him storming out? Throwing me a Tommy Lee Royce-style punch before drenching me in Earl Grey and oat milk? It’s all rather hard to imagine. The James Norton of today seems to be able to smile gracefully, suck up any negativity and take it all in his stride. He seems extremely content; secure in his own skin while restlessly creative. And all of that with a whopping hangover.King & Conqueror airs on BBC One and iPlayer from24 August. House of Guinness is on Netflix in September.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaActingHappy ValleyMcMafiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was The Way Way Back that freed us bothMaddy MussenSat 9 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareIn the first five minutes of the 2013 comedy drama The Way Way Back, a teenage boy has a conversation with his stepfather in a car bound for Cape Cod. You can only see the stepdad’s eyes in the rearview mirror, but you instantly know it’sSteve Carell. At this point, I loved Carell. He’s the reason that I, then a teenager, watched the film.“Duncan … let me ask you something,” Carell’s character says. “On a scale of one to 10, what do you think you are?” Duncan responds shyly that he thinks he’s a six. Any normal adult would balk and correct him. Tell him he’s nothing less than a 10. “I think you’re a three,” says Carell’s character, Trent. Suddenly, I hated Carell with a blind fury. He was a vision of pure evil. I didn’t want to watch him in anything else, ever.As it turns out, this was a full-sized, double-strength dose of projection.I’m 27 now, and it’s been six years since I rid myself of my real-life Trent. After my dad died when I was six, my mum started dating a new guy within a year. Though intensely smart and caring, she was blinded by grief and clawing around in the dark for a cure. That’s when she found her Trent on Match.com. A charming, self-motivated man, he seemed like the Real Deal.The film was screaming to me: this is a bad guy! Get away from him!But Trent changed our lives almost immediately. He made us give up the dog we got when my dad died because his adult daughter didn’t like dogs. He moved my mum, sister and I into the middle of the countryside, away from all our friends. He made me feel small, unsafe and unwelcome in my home. He stopped my mum from seeing her own friends, spending her own money and leaving the house. Later, we would find out that he locked his first wife in the house when he went to work “to keep her safe”.I didn’t know what I was experiencing was abuse until I watched The Way Way Back. Even then, the film never calls it that. But Carell’s character is so clearly the villain, and so uncannily similar to my stepdad, that it was unavoidable. It was as if someone had made an entire film to scream to me: this is a bad guy! Get away from him! Trent utilises what people now know as “coercive control”. He manipulates and belittles Duncan and his mum, Pam, with methods so familiar that it made me wince. To avoid Trent, Duncan lands a job at a water park, and his ragtag group of colleagues drag Duncan out of his awkward shell. By the end of the film, he stands up to Trent, freeing his mother from his clutches.As a teenager, I was too scared to fight back. But then I found my water park: Animal, a clothing chain based in the south of England, where I was a weekend shop girl from ages 17 to 19. Every awkward hello to customers and failed refund attempt made me a little bolder, more sure of myself.One day, as I was heading out to work, my stepdad pushed me over the edge, and I stood up to him. I told my mum that if she stayed with him, she’d never see me again.For a while, my mum still wanted to make the relationship work. But that was never going to be how it ended. In the final few minutes of The Way Way Back, Pam is in the front passenger seat next to Trent on the way home from Cape Cod. Suddenly, as if by epiphany, Pam clambers to the back to sit with her son. The film ends with them looking out of the rear window together, side by side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But the dual-island nation inspired a tradition in the English metropolis that is still going 55 years on – the annual carnival in Moss Side.Geraldine Walters, 79, a retired mental health nurse who was born in St Kitts, and her late husband, Rudolph, from Nevis, were on the very first organising committee from the Leeward Islands People’s Association (Lipa).She remembers how passionate everyone was about making it work – so passionate that when funding from the authorities arrived late one year, carnival treasurer Rudolph took out a loan to fund it, using their home as collateral, without her knowing.She said: “We had it for people to come together and have a good time and enjoy themselves, because sometimes in the community you didn’t know anyone – it was for Black, white, anyone who wanted to come and enjoy themselves.”View image in fullscreenManchester carnival pioneers Geraldine and Rudolph Walters at their Manchester home.Photograph: Geraldine WaltersIt’s a legacy that still unites people today. This weekend, thousands will gather in and around Princess Road, the route toManchesterairport that bisects Moss Side, for a celebration of Caribbean culture that would not be possible without the carnivals of the early 70s.Locita Brandy, now 90, left Nevis for Britain in the late 1950s. The Manchester she came to, with its gaslit terraced streets, was austere and still scarred by the war. In those early days making a new life on Carter Street, Moss Side, to help her family back at home, living conditions involved “four people in one room, cooking on a paraffin heater on a landing upstairs” and encountering the idea of “race” and its inequalities for the very first time, her son, Keithly Brandy says.View image in fullscreenLocita Brandy, 90, left Nevis for Britain in the late 1950s. There are signs all over Manchester of her work as a campaigner, educator, social worker, councillor and Christian activist.Photograph: Locita BrandyAs a Black woman at that time her opportunities to socialise were restricted not just by race, but by gender roles, Keithly says. But through the Church of England and the Mothers’ Union she began to develop as an activist, while bringing up six children.By 1970, émigrés from the Leeward Islands – the arc of tropical jewels between theCaribbeanSea and the Atlantic Ocean – including Locita Brandy and the Walters, decided to stage an event that would brighten up the year.Five years earlier, they had formed the Leeward Islands Association, at the home of local baker Billy Hanley, with the objective of “promoting racial harmony, morally, socially and culturally”.The first event involved Lipa joining Alexandra Park’s centenary festival, which was like an English summer fete, before throwing an impromptu procession through the streets, with one steel band and three floats.In the years that followed, Irish dancers mingled with the carnival traditions of Trinidad, Grenada, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis and Antigua, infused with the spirit of Jamaica’s junkanoo masquerades, with troupes led by a police marching band and white horses parading through Moss Side, and dances in the neighbourhood’s Polish Club.There were no elaborate costumes. Moss Side’s traditional English haberdashers donated fabric for the event, while the late Labour MP Tony Lloyd acted as patron, and big Manchester employers such as Kellogg’s acted as sponsors. Prizes for the carnival king and queen were handed out at Belle Vue fairground. The day started early – and when it was over, everyone got together to clear up the litter.“That’s what I like about Manchester,” Viola Walters, Geraldine’s daughter, who made costumes for carnivals past while her mother cooked “for thousands”, said. “We are diverse and different cultures come together.”Manchester’s carnival has evolved through the years, with continued debates in the city about how it can stay true to its roots. Pioneers like the Walters, describe feeling left behind – although today’s event says it celebratesthe “elders” who “worked tirelessly” to keep it going.When asked to sum up his mother’s legacy, Keithly Brandy, who, with his siblings, grew up steeped in the traditions of Manchester’s earliest carnivals, uses just one word, without any hesitation: “Overlooked.”View image in fullscreenThe Moss Side carnival, some time in the 1970s. The carnival has evolved through the years, with continued debates in the city about how it can stray true to its roots.Photograph: Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre/Locita Brandy“It’s been an uphill struggle to get mum’s legacy recognised,” he added.Keithly is now working through the dozens of crates that his mother compiled in a lifetime of activism that took her to South Africa on pan-African missions, and to Croatia, Poland and Russia with the Mothers’ Union.Her papers, now being carefully catalogued by Manchester’s Ahmed Iqbal UllahRaceRelations Resource Centre, are thought to comprise one of the UK’s most extensive, post-Windrush Black history archives. Keithly envisages a future where insights from the collection will be taught in schools, alongside African languages.There are unmarked signs all over Manchester of Locita Brandy’s work as a campaigner, educator, social worker, councillor and Christian activist. In the pelican crossing she fought for in Moss Side after a child was knocked over. In the sports ground that was set up for girls to enjoy sport. In the memories of adults who enjoyed their first childhood trips to the seaside through the Normanby Street youth project she began, and the former pupils of the now-closed Birley High who remember the African-Caribbean-inspired dishes she introduced to the menu while working at the school kitchen.For Locita and the early carnival organisers, including Basil Gumbs and Estelle Palmer (the great-grandmother of Premier League footballer Cole Palmer) carnival was just one way of keeping heritage alive.“Mrs Brandy and the others who came here as part of the Windrush generation, they were homesick,” the Manchester historian Linford Sweeney said. “And while London had their carnival, there was nothing going on in Manchester for the community, it was basically work, work, work and more work.”As a fusion of pan-African, uniquely Caribbean and European traditions, a traditional carnival – with its mas bands, steelpans, feathered headdresses and costumes, carnival queen, princess and prince – derives directly from the tensions and exchanges of colonialism. It draws on traditional African masquerades as well the parodies of French colonisers’ masked balls that enslaved people would hold in Trinidad; the word carnival – which by one interpretation means “farewell to meat” – is linked to Roman Catholic, Lenten traditions.View image in fullscreenLocita Brandy leading the Moss Side carnival parade in 1974.Photograph: Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre/Locita BrandyFundamentally, Sweeney says, carnival is about freedom. “It’s not a party really, it’s a celebration,” he said. “It’s meant to be a celebration of freedom. In 1834, with the end of slavery, people got their chance to be free to do what they wanted to do, went through the streets and they had various parades and various things to celebrate freedom.“We can’t forget that. If we forget what happened to us when we were called three-fifths human and called property, then I’m sorry for the next generation, because they could end up in exactly the same position.”The British, post-Windrush version of carnival, while echoing liberation celebrations, accelerated with the introduction of Jamaican sound system culture, which brought reggae and soca outdoors.“My mum allowed me, as a young person, to introduce the sound systems to carnival,” Keithly Brandy said. I had friends in London – the Mastermind Roadshow, though they were called Conqueror at the time, and they were allowed to come down and play. They played at theAbasindi Centreuntil 5am.”Sweeney has fond memories of spending the 70s setting up youth theatres in Manchester and riding with the Natty Bongo sound system.“Carnival and sound systems went hand in hand,” he said. “People were starting to really think, listen, let’s get out of the house parties – the ones the older people used to do in people’s front rooms. The blues parties started coming in with the sound systems. We’d go to theRussell Cluband then a blues party – we didn’t finish until 6am in the morning.”Manchester Caribbean Carnivalis on 9 and 10 August,with a packed programme of events from early, including J’Ouvert, a parade and music in Alexandra Park, Moss SideExplore more on these topicsGreater ManchesterCotton Capital: ongoing seriesFestivalsCaribbeanRaceManchesterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thanks to a number of unforeseen events the procedure has already been cancelled once, and my wife is keen not to miss our Friday morning slot. When it’s time to leave she comes out to my office shed with the dog following.“We’re off,” she says.“Do you want me to come?” I say.“Why?” she says. “Do you want to come?”“Not really,” I say. “I’m just offering.”“What possible use would your presence serve?” she says.“I’m being polite,” I say. “If I thought there was a risk of you saying yes, I wouldn’t have asked.”My wife goes to the supermarket after dropping the dog off. In total she is gone for about three hours. During this time I pace back and forth between my office and the kitchen. At one point, to keep myself busy, I wash up a bowl, drop the bowl, break the bowl and, in a belated bid to catch the bowl, cut my hand open on one of the larger shards. I am thinking about what possible use my presence might serve when my wife walks in with two full bags of shopping.“How was that?” I say.“A nightmare,” she says.“The vet?” I say.“No, Sainsbury’s,” she says. “The vet was fine. She loves it there.”“When do you pick her up?” I say.“Not until 4.30. There are more bags in the car, by the way.”By the afternoon I am fretting about the dog’s operation to the extent that I take myself to bed with a book to calm down. I don’t wake up from this activity until the front door opens at 5.15.By the afternoon I am fretting about the dog’s operation to the extent that I take myself to bed with a book to calm downThe dog staggers into the bedroom dressed in a snug short-sleeved onesie printed with a peculiar pattern, like pyjamas for a very long toddler, or a canine prison uniform. She is at sea – too groggy to climb on to the bed, and too wary to be lifted.“She doesn’t like the vet any more,” my wife says.“Nice suit,” I say.“It’s instead of the head cone,” my wife says. “She wasn’t having the cone.”“How long does she have to wear it?” I say.“A week to 10 days,” she says.“She looks depressed,” I say.“I think she feels a bit betrayed,” my wife says.“Yeah,” I say, looking at the dog. “But not by me, right? As far as you know, I played no part in this.”The dog looks up at me, forlorn, confused and dressed for bed.After a long sleep the dog regains most of its former joie de vivre. After two days she appears to have fully recovered. After four days of not being allowed off the lead, she is bouncy and dangerously under-exercised.Weirdly, however, the dog never raises any objections to the onesie, or makes even a half-hearted attempt to get out of it. This is an animal that has effectively eaten three dog beds, that regularly reduces dog toys to their smallest constituents, that chews up pillows, blankets, plastic flower pots, footballs, shoes and anything with a handle.“It’s like you fancy yourself in it,” I tell the dog. “Even though it would be fair to say it does nothing for you.” The dog’s tail wags through the little hole at the back of the suit.“I hate that thing,” my wife says. “But when I suggested taking it off early the vet told me grim stories about dogs chewing their stitches out.”According to the advisory letter that came with the dog’s medication, it’s acceptable to remove the onesie in order to wash it, provided you keep your dog in your sights the whole time. But after six days the dog will not allow anyone to undo the snaps running along the top. She seems to have forgotten about life before wearing pyjamas all day.“It’s been a week,” my wife says. “You can take her to the park with a ball if you like.”“No thanks,” I say.“Are you embarrassed by her outfit?”“No,” I lie.On the afternoon of the eighth day the dog spends a happy hour rolling around in the wet garden. When she comes back in with the onesie covered in dark mud, my wife grabs her by the collar, undoes all the back snaps, and wrestles it off her.“Do you want me to keep an eye on her while you wash that,” I say.“That won’t be necessary,” my wife says, flinging the onesie in the bin. The dog looks on, naked and bereft.Explore more on these topicsPetsThe Tim Dowling columnFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Blackberry and raspberry blends tend to have a slightly hairy texture, which I try to ignore, but offer more complexity and depth, while high-banana-content blends are sweeter, creamier and more texturally satisfying.The mixes with a higher berry content seemed to be better value, not least because bananas are a cheap filler. Sadly, no supermarket brands were organic, which I find concerning, especially for strawberries, which, according tothe Pesticide Action Network UKare among the most heavily sprayed crops.

There is no trick or trouble to getting them right, but there is a magic about nut ices that is as jaw-dropping as a magician’s act – delicious and sophisticated, without adulterating the childlike joy that underpins every sort of ice-cream. Then, I like to celebrate rhubarb as a sorbet, which is great on its own, or with cold custard, or to accompany stodgier puddings.Walnut and pear lollies (pictured top)This can be adapted for any nuts – it works particularly well with pecans (lightly roasted before making the milk, and consider using maple syrup in place of the sugar), hazelnuts (roasted before making the milk), almonds (roasted or raw, skin on or skin off) or pistachios (skinless, if you can get them, roasted or raw). You can get inventive and seasonal with the fruit, too, but it is really only necessary to add a sweet dimension to walnuts – other nuts can fly solo.Prep5 minCook1 hr 10 minFreeze6 hr+Makesabout 6 x 100ml lollies220g walnut halves or pieces100g white sugar1 ripe pearFirst make a nut milk: put 140g of the walnuts in a blender with 350ml cold water, then blend , until they’re a very fine texture, which will take several minutes.Strain the nut water through a very fine sieve, pressing with the back of a spoon to extract the last bits of goodness. Measure out 450ml of the nut milk (if you don’t have quite enough, top up with more water), then add the sugar and stir until it dissolves.Roast the remaining 80g walnuts very gently in a 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3 oven for 45 minutes to an hour, until light golden brown, then remove and leave to cool.To make the lollies, divide the roast walnuts evenly between six lolly moulds. Peel, core and dice the pear, then divide this between the lolly moulds, too. Top with the sweet walnut milk to come 5mm below the rim, then put on the lid and lolly sticks, and freeze for about six hours, until solid.Rhubarb sorbetView image in fullscreenRhubarb is such a camp monstrosity of a petiole.

Leave to cool to room temperature, then blend finely.Churn the mixture in an ice-cream machine according to the maker’s instructions until fully firm, then put into a suitable container, seal and put in the freezer for half an hour or so, to firm up.

The UK car industry certainly thinks so and is readying for a surge in demand as anew subsidy schemecuts the price of some electric cars by up to £3,750.With purchase prices – not to mentionrange anxiety– contributing to weak consumer uptake, the government grants are designed to bring the upfront cost closer to a petrol car. Making them cheaper will also give “thousands more drivers access to savings of up to £1,500 a year in fuel and running costs compared to a petrol car”, officials say.Robert Forrester, the chief executive of the car dealership groupVertu Motors, says:“With the average new electric vehicle now costing close to £49,000, the market has drifted away from the everyday motorist.“This grant helps correct that, opening access to a wider range of customers by making sub-£40,000 EVs more appealing and financially viable.”The schemeThe £650m electric car grant (ECG) is a reboot of a previous state-backed money-off scheme to incentivise drivers to switch, before a ban on the sale of new fully petrol or diesel cars and vans from 2030.There are two tiers pegged to how green the manufacturing process is. The greenest vehicles in “band one” qualify for a £3,750 discount while for “band two” vehicles the figure is £1,500.All eligible vehicles must have an RRP below £37,000. The grant only applies to new cars.View image in fullscreenNew Teslas are sold above the subsidy scheme’s threshold of £37,000.Photograph: TeslaThe good news is that consumers don’t have to fill in any extra paperwork when they make a purchase. It is the manufacturer that applies for the grant, with the allocated funds deducted from the car’s list price.Tom Jervis, the consumer editor atAuto Express,says that while the grant is aimed at EVs costing under £37,000 “price alone isn’t enough”.“Eligibility also depends on manufacturer commitment to emissions targets, the environmental impact of the battery and production process, and where the car and battery are built,” he says. “It is based on lifecycle carbon costs, meaning the country of assembly and battery production play a major role.”The price and environmental conditions attached to securing a grant mean that some well-known brands, including Tesla, are not part of the scheme.To qualify the manufacturer must have a science-based target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. These are verified by theScience Based Targets initiative, an independent body that assesses corporate sustainability plans.View image in fullscreenThe new Nissan Micra is eligibile for the grant.Photograph: Nissan/PAVehicles made in countries where the electricity grid is more reliant on fossil fuels will get a higher score than those made in one powered by renewables or nuclear. This focus on emissions essentially excludes vehicles made in China with its reliance oncoal-fired powerstations.Which cars are eligible?Although the scheme was launched formally in the middle of July, the full list of qualifying cars is still some way off. That’s because manufacturers need to apply to be considered for funding.This week, the government announced the first. On the list are 19 models from four carmakers: Citroën, Renault, Nissan and Vauxhall. They include the Citroën ë-C3 – Auto Express’s 2024 car of the year – Renault Megane, Nissan Micra and Vauxhall Grandland Electric. They are now available at the band two discount of £1,500 each.The Department for Transport (DfT) has adedicated pageon thegov.ukwebsite which it is updating on a rolling basis with the list of approved vehicles. It says it expects to approve more models over the coming weeks.The £37,000 cut-off point narrows the choice significantly in a market where about 70% of new EVs cost over £40,000. It rules out upmarket models, including the UK’s bestselling EV, theTesla Model Y, and every other Tesla on sale. No Audi, BMW or Mercedes EV would now be eligible either. The scheme’s design also favours European over Chinese-built cars.“Countries with high-carbon electricity, like China, are penalised in the grant calculations, meaning Chinese-built EVs like the MG4, BYD Dolphin, and Leapmotor models are expected to only qualify for the £1,500 tier – if they qualify at all,” says Jervis. “South Korean brands like Hyundai and Kia are in a grey area – reliant on fossil-fuel-heavy grids but potentially meeting other sustainability metrics. Their eligibility will likely vary by model.”He adds: “The scheme is unapologetically tilted in favour of European production with cleaner assembly and battery footprints, and this has given many manufacturers confidence that they will qualify.”View image in fullscreenCountries with high-carbon electricity, such as China, are penalised in the grant calculations, meaning Chinese-built EVs such as this MG4 may struggle to qualify for the grant.Photograph: MG/PAThelatest Nissan Leaf, which is being produced at the Japanese manufacturer’sSunderland plant, is thought to be a shoo-in for scheme qualification when it arrives in showrooms later this year.Auto Express hascompiled a list of the 52 carsits writers think could qualify if they meet the sustainability criteria.A recent poll by online marketplace Carwow found that four in 10 drivers thought the scheme excluded too many of the EVs now on sale.The objective is to make budget EVs more attractive to the public as opposed to executives who lease them, or acquire them as company cars, or through salary sacrifice schemes.Carwow’s Iain Reid says: “Crucially, the grant applies to both outright purchases and leasing deals, making electric vehicles more accessible to a wider range of private drivers.”Discounts by carmakersIf you have your heart set on a car marque unlikely to make the cut the good news is that the scheme has triggered a wave of price cuts by manufacturers who don’t want to be left behind.The Chinese brand Leapmotor has, for example, launched what it calls aleap-grant, with adverts that pose the question: “Why wait for the government?” It has cut the price of its cheapest model, the To3, by £1,500 to £14,495 and is billing it as the “UK’s most affordable 5-door electric city car”. It has also cut the price of its C10 SUV by £3,750, bringing it down to £32,750.Other manufacturers have taken action to make sure models come under the price threshold for the scheme. Jervis says: “Both the Vauxhall Grandland and Renault Scenic were slightly above the cut-off when the grant was first announced, but the entry point for the Scenic range has dropped by £200 and the Grandland by £400 to put both electric SUVs at £36,995.View image in fullscreenThe entry-level Renault Scenic electric car is priced to bring it within the scope of the subsidy.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/Reuters“Getting the entry models under £37,000 is crucial for brands, as that brings the entire lineup using the same battery into eligibility.”He says Chinese carmakers GWM Ora and MG have also cut prices by up to £3,750, “likely because they fear they won’t qualify – in order to stay competitive. Volvo, Hyundai and Kia all launched offers too, and we are likely to see more brands follow suit over the next few weeks.”Buynow or wait?With the scheme scheduled to run until 2027–28 – or until the funding is exhausted – early signs point to strong demand.Carwow’s Reid says: “Traffic to our EV grant information pages surged 160% immediately after the announcement. The government’s previous plug-in car grant, which ended in June 2022, helped increase electric car sales by 70% within a year. Our advice is to start researching and test-driving now. On average, the car-buying journey takes around 190 days, so being prepared means you can act fast once the grant applies to your chosen model. There’s a definite first-mover advantage and today’s mix of official and brand incentives may not stick around for long.”Now is a “very good time to go and buy an electric vehicle”, says Vertu Motors’ Forrester. “It’s coming at a time when we are, for the first time, seeing cheaper electric vehicles on the market.”He adds: “I think there’ll be a limited number [of cars approved for grants] because a lot of manufacturers don’t think they will comply and are discounting to overcome the competitive disadvantage. Whether you get a grant or not, doesn’t really matter, does it? The price has come down.”Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsMotor financeMotoring (Money)Consumer affairsConsumer spendingEconomicsEthical and green livingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the Euphoria actor Sydney Sweeney’s recent ad for American Eagle denim has done just that.Critics have interpreted the campaign as promoting eugenics, defenders have taken the backlash as evidence of so-called “woke” culture in the extreme and scrutinising it has taken on the trappings of a cottage industry. “Clocking in for my shift at the Sydney Sweeney American Eagle opinion factory,”the journalist Hunter Harris wrote on her Substack.It comes in a long line of provocative jeans adverts, some objectively controversial or offensive, others more subjectively so.Born in the USA: Is American Eagle really using whiteness to sell jeans?Read moreA 1973 campaign from Jesus Jeans that featured the slogan “you shall have no other jeans before me” sparked discussion for its use of religiosity to sell clothes. The Italian anti-consumerist film director Pier Paolo Pasolini evenwrote an essay on the subjectin which he said the slogan “takes the form of a nemesis – although unintentionally – that punishes the church for its pact with the devil”.A series of 1980s Calvin Klein jeans adverts raised hackles for their use of young female models in sexually suggestive guises. “You know what gets between me and my Calvin’s? Nothing,” mused a 15-year-old Brooke Shields in 1980, in a video directed and shot byRichard Avedon.View image in fullscreenA 1980s Calvin Klein magazine advert featuring Brooke Shields.Photograph: Retro AdArchives/AlamyIn another Calvin Klein campaign from 1995, which wascriticisedfor alluding to child exploitation, models including Kate Moss were filmed as they undid their jeans and were asked: “Are you nervous?”“Calvin made millions,” saidAllen Adamson, an author and branding expert. “He was the first one to really understand that buzz and controversy and being disruptive could sell denim.” The Shields campaign wasreportedly a huge success, with many customers going into shops to ask for the “Brooke Shields jeans”.Levi’s also has a history of setting tongues wagging. The famous Nick Kamen ad from the 80s, in which he strips down to his underwear in a laundrette so he can wash his 501s, turned the straight male gaze of most mainstream ads on its head by making the object of desire a male model. According to the fashion historian Tony Glenville: “It was massive and made it even into spoofs on comedy shows. It made a huge impact on sales and jeans sales generally.”Levi’s made its mark again in 1995 with a campaign in which the Filipino-American fashion designer Zaldy, sitting in the back of a New York taxi in drag, seems to shock the sweaty, lecherous driver ogling her by shaving her chin mid-drive. Landing at a time when there was a lack of LGBTQ+ representation in advertising,the Advertising Standards Authority reportedly came close to banning it.View image in fullscreenThe American Eagle campaign featuring Sydney Sweeney followed a tradition for jeans adverts that court controversy.Photograph: David ’Dee’ Delgado/ReutersAccording to the retail marketing expert Catherine Shuttleworth, campaigns designed to turn heads evolve from a need to “cut through”. “Good advertising creates cut through, and when it comes to advertising for clothing, it’s really hard to grab people’s attention,” she said.Cutting through in the social media age is arguably much harder than before given the fragmentation of media. Adamson said: “It’s very expensive to reach consumers through traditional media, so you need social media to break through,” especially to reach younger consumers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People can talk about the fit or the stitching. It’s basically denim.”Glenville agreed: “Sometimes the actual jeans can be a bit dull. It’s packaging within the advertising, it’s styling and narrative that sells them.”More so than in the past, the market for denim is also saturated. “The denim market in America is ginormous,” said Shuttleworth. “You’ve got to do something that makes you stand out from the pack. And so I think a lot of those companies will take risks.”Even going as far as to get your ad banned might be a good thing, she said. “By getting it banned, everybody talks about it [but] if you get it wrong, suddenly you could have a long-term problem where people boycott your products.”For Adamson, the worst possible scenario for fashion advertising is that “no one notices or no one cares”.It’s too early to know what the Sweeney ad’s impact on direct sales will be, but it’s clear that people noticed and cared, andit doesn’t seem to have been bad for business. American Eagle sharesclimbed 23%in a week, even as commentators began to move on to the next: a Levi’s ad in which Beyoncé wears a blonde wig and red lipstick moved the conservative commentator Megyn Kelly to take umbrage and Piers Morgan to accuse the singer of “culturally appropriating” Marilyn Monroe.Explore more on these topicsJeansAdvertisingnewsShareReuse this content"

Then head for the more temperate Cantabrian coast and its fantastic beaches, superb seafood and relaxed vibesAnnie BennettSat 9 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareWhile we all know that “costa” is simply the Spanish word for “coast”, for most of us it has a much wider meaning, evoking all sorts of images, both positive and negative. It may be beaches, fun, cold beers and tapas at achiringuito(beach bar) with your feet in the sand. Perhaps you’re thinking of childhood holidays in a thrillingly huge hotel, where you happily stuffed yourself with ice-cream and chips for a fortnight. More recent memories might revolve around showy beach clubs with exorbitant prices. If you’ve been to the costas of eastern or southern Spain in the past few years, however, you may have reluctantly concluded that your favourite resorts are now a bit too hot for comfort.View image in fullscreenThis year, there has been a lot of buzz about “la España fresca”, or cool Spain, but, in reality, Spaniards have been thronging the northern coast in summer for decades, decamping to Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria and the Basque Country. This is particularly true for residents of Madrid and other cities in central Spain that are stifling in July and August.Along the north coast, temperatures are usually more like those of Cornwall on a good summer’s day. But be warned: you do get blisteringly hot spells, too, not to mention a greater risk of wet weather. I have trudged along beaches in driving rain in June, but enjoyed glorious sunshine and delicious swims well into September.One of my favourite chunks of northern Spain is the Costa Trasmiera in Cantabria. If you are trying to cut down on flying, it has the advantage of being easy to reach byBrittany Ferriesfrom Portsmouth or Plymouth to Santander, the regional capital, or from Portsmouth to Bilbao, an hour’s drive away.View image in fullscreenAnchovies and tuna for sale in Santoña.Photograph: Tim Graham/AlamySailing into the Bay of Santander, your eyes are drawn to the city, framed by its string of beaches, rising up on your right. Look left, however, and the view is rural rather than urban. A long spit of glittering sand, El Puntal, protrudes into the bay, with a green landscape stretching out behind it to the east. This is the Costa Trasmiera, a stretch of about 30 miles (50km) between Santander and the fishing town of Santoña.A car is really useful to get to different beaches along the coast, but there are buses from Santander to the main places, such as Somo, Noja and Santoña. With a car, you are only likely to be travelling short distances each day, so using an EV is no problem.If you liked the look of El Puntal as you were arriving, you can jump on alittle ferryacross the bay. I love doing this when I’m staying in Santander, as within a quarter of an hour I’m running into the sea, shrieking as the cold water hits my body. If you’re used to wallowing in the tepid soup of the Mediterranean in summer, it might come as a bit of a shock.View image in fullscreenThe view across the bay from Santander.Photograph: Juanma Aparicio/AlamyBack on the sand, a chopped seafood salad and glass of rosé atChiringuito El Puntal Tricioalways hits the spot. Walking along the beach brings you to Somo, a hub for surfers from all over the world, where you’ll find lots of cafes, bars and places offering surfing and paddleboarding tuition.Hotel Bemon Playa(doubles from €90 room-only) is in the thick of things if you fancy staying for a few days.Heading east along the coast, it’s one superb beach after another: Loredo, Langre, Galizano, Antuerta, Cuberris. Book a table for a lobster lunch or a seafood platter overlooking the sea atHotel Astuy(doubles from €60 room-only) in Isla, where the crustaceans served in the restaurant are kept in seawater pools in caves below the building. The hotel is a good base for exploring the area, but just beyond Isla, right next to Playa de Ris,Camping Playa Joyel(pitches from €19.50) is one of several good campsites on the Costa Trasmiera, with lots of facilities to keep kids happy.It’s not hard to see how people while away a summer here with swims, walks, long lunches and sunset cocktailsFrom the campsite, it’s an easy walk into Noja, the main holiday town on the coast. Practical rather than pretty, for most of the year it is a sleepy place with a population of about 2,500. In summer, however, the number rises to an astounding 80,000-plus, mostly in second homes and holiday apartments – a much higher ratio of tourists and second-home owners to residents than in resorts on the Costa Blanca and Costa del Sol. Families from other parts of Spain, especially the adjacent Basque Country, install themselves for the entire school holidays, which can stretch from late June until the second week of September.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This may not be the most attractive place, but for the thousands who come here year after year, it has everything needed for a relaxing holiday with no delusions of grandeur or attempts at being cool. No one cares what you’re wearing here.Those who can summon the energy to move on from Noja only have to round the headland to come upon yet another splendid beachWith Playa de Ris on one side of Noja and the equally gorgeous Trengandín stretching away on the other (a path links the two), it’s not hard to see how people while away a summer here with swims, picnics, leisurely walks, long lunches and sunset cocktails. Seafood is, of course, excellent, but thenécoras(velvet crabs) are particularly prized.Those who can summon the energy to move on from Noja only have to round the El Brusco headland at the end of Trengandín to come upon yet another splendid beach. Berria is bordered by theSantoña, Victoria and Joyel marshlands, a nature reserve that attracts migratory birds from autumn to spring.View image in fullscreenConsidered a delicacy, Santoña anchovies are served straight from the tin at restaurants and tapas bars.Photograph: Sergio Rojo/AlamyThe adjacent town of Santoña marks the end of the Costa Trasmiera. It’s all about fisheries and canning factories here, which is a lot more interesting than it sounds. As long as you like anchovies, that is. Santoña anchovies are bigger and fleshier than most, with a softer texture and a more delicate flavour, and here they’re expertly filleted and preserved in olive oil. Considered a delicacy throughout Spain, they are served straight out of the tin at top restaurants and tapas bars. Have a look around theanchovy museum– really – before ordering someat a bar, along with a plate of sardines and a beer. Devour the lot while standing at a high table on the pavement outside, then quaff another beer. You may find yourself ordering more anchovies as well.By now you should have tuned into the laid-back Costa Trasmiera vibe. All you have to do, at some point, is make your way back to Santander. It only takes about half an hour by car, but you may be tempted to stop at some of the inland villages along the way. This is not an area to rush around, which – if you’re doing things properly – you will no doubt have gathered by now.Explore more on these topicsSpain holidaysBeach holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you lie down among theyellow rattleand the bird’s-foot trefoil and gaze across the sward, you can see marsh orchids poking above the grasses like mini pagodas. Down in the valley, the River Monnow cascades east, and above is the Cefn, a boggy old drovers’ road that follows the ridge.It was on the Cefn that several marbled white butterflies hurtled past me like a peloton of cyclists, then appeared to swerve around the ghosts of old drovers. The upper sides of the adults wings are a vivid pied pattern of embroidery. The undersides are more hazy, andJoan Miró-like. I know the farmers, Simon and Anita, whose land they danced over, and I was excited to tell them.View image in fullscreenAn old grain cleaner on the farm.Photograph: Simon LockettTheir farm is an upland holding where rare breed pigs, such as Sandy and Blacks, turn over the bracken to release dormant seeds. White park cattle, carefully managed, perform a similar task, stirring up the ground without over-poaching. They also have a lowland farm, which I had visited earlier that day. Here, the fields are planted with heritage cereals, and instead of spraying off anything that is not the crop, Simon lets it all grow together. Consequently, the fields are full of herbs such as common vetch, with its deep roots, and the lanky blue flowers of chicory, which fixes nitrogen. It all helps to maintain the soil’s health.View image in fullscreenThe seeds before they are sorted by the grain cleaner.Photograph: Simon LockettSoon the crop will be harvested, and the heritage grains will be separated from the herbs and grasses by an ancient French grain cleaner. It’s a wonderful old contraption. When Simon flicked a switch, it came alive, a great, grumbling drum with chutes coming off the side for the different sizes of seed. The grains will then be milled for flour which goes out to small-scale bakeries across the country.By treating the soil with affection, they are building up a rich humus for future generations,not degrading it. This is food production as a liberating, creative act, giving natural systems the freedom to flourish.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentCountry diaryRural affairsFarmingPlantsSummerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The two countries have come closer to ending 35 years of enmity by signing a peace treaty in Washington and agreeing to a US private consortium taking control of a strategic corridor on Iran’s border.The corridor passing through southernArmeniawill link Azerbaijan with its exclave Nakhchivan, a longstanding demand of Baku. The US will operate the corridor under Armenian sovereignty on a 99-year land lease, changing the balance of power in the region. Some Iranian commentators claimed the deal amounts to “Iran’s geopolitical suffocation in the region”.Control of the corridor that runs along the border between Armenia and northernIranhas been the single biggest block to a peace deal between the two countries.The deal is also a further blow to Russia’s diminished influence in the region, as Armenia’s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, guides his Christian-majority country towards the west, and eventually the EU.Russia– which still has a military base in Armenia – seems unable to resist the Trump initiative, partly due to its preoccupation with Ukraine.In a statement on Saturday the Iranian foreign ministry said: “Establishing communication networks will serve the security, and economic development of the nations of the region when it is done within the framework of mutual interests, respecting the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries of the region, and without foreign interference”.Abbas Mousavi, former Iranian ambassador to Baku and a deputy presidential spokesperson, described Trump’s direct involvement in the issue of relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia as “interesting, offensive and dangerous”.But there is little Iran can do to block a deal that the US, Armenia and Azerbaijan see as in their mutual interest.Armenia and Azerbaijan have been in conflict since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous Azerbaijani region mostly populated by ethnic Armenians, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia. Azerbaijan, the superior military power which is largely run as an authoritarian dictatorship, wrested back full control of the region in 2023 by force, prompting almost all of the territory’s 120,000 ethnic Armenians to flee to Armenia.In the most novel part of the deal, an – as yet unformed – US consortium will take control of a 20-mile-long transit corridor connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave. It will be named the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity”.The proposal, first discussed during the Biden administration, raises the prospect of a US presence right on the Iranian border. Tehran worries such a development might cut off its access to the Black Sea as well as toEuropevia Georgia.A further opening of the border with Turkey would integrate Armenia into the Middle Corridor project, an economic trade route between Europe and China that bypasses Russia and Iran. Armenian leaders have long seen economic benefits in this project for their landlocked country.The White House said the new transport corridor would “enable unhindered connectivity between the two countries, while respecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity and people of Armenia”. The route is billed to include roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines and fibre-optic lines. A US commercial presence lowers the incentive for either side to resort to military solutions.As part of the Washington accord, the two sides have also agreed to end other border disputes, but Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, stressed in press briefings that a final agreement required the Armenian constitution to be amended to eliminate “baseless territorial claims” against Azerbaijan, adding to not do so would be seen as “an act of disrespect” by the US. Armenia is expected to hold a referendum on the constitution in 2027, but the more Aliyev highlights his demand, the more hostility will grow inside Armenia.But Aliyev, and his ally Turkey, gain greatly from the agreement so may not look for obstacles. As part of the agreement, for instance, restrictions on military cooperation between Azerbaijan and the US can be lifted. Aliyev said: “We have pre-signed the Peace Agreement, which has been negotiated for a long time, and the fact that it is pre-signed in the capital of the No 1 superpower, in the world’s No 1 office, and in the presence of the great president of the USA, means that there should be no doubt that any of the parties will make a step back.”He also called for Trump to be awarded the Nobel peace prize.Explore more on these topicsIranAzerbaijanArmeniaEuropeMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyRussiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

But Costa believes her populist leader can still be saved – if her prayers are answered andDonald Trumpintervenes.“I believe in God and I believe God will touch Donald Trump’s heart and that he will help us,” Costa proclaimed as she stood in her garden clutching the American flag she waves at pro-Bolsonaro rallies. “I’m convinced God has chosen him as a liberator,” she says of the US president. “And I believe God will empower him – and all Americans – so they come to love and liberate my land.”Costa is far from the only Bolsonarista pinning her hopes on a Trumpian intercession as the end of Bolsonaro’s trial nears. In the coming weeks, Brazil’s supreme court is widely expected to find Bolsonaro guilty of masterminding a coup plot, which would leave the 70-year-old looking at up to 43 years behind bars.Friends and foes of the ex-president, who governed from 2019 to the end of 2022, are convinced the outcome is a foregone conclusion. “We’re almost certain the sentence has already been written [and] Bolsonaro will be jailed,” said Patrícia de Carvalho, 50, a pro-Bolsonaro businesswoman from Brazil’s capital who insists her leader is innocent.Guilherme Boulos, a leftwing congressman and close Lula ally, also believes Bolsonaro’s conviction and imprisonment is assured. “I’ve read the chief prosecutor’s 300-page report … the evidence is extremely robust,” Boulos said, pointing to a slew of incriminating material unearthed by federal police investigators.The evidence includes the discovery that an allegedplan to assassinate Lulaand Alexandre de Moraes, the supreme court judge presiding over the trial, was printed out in Bolsonaro’s presidential palace. “Any fair trial that considers this evidence will lead to Bolsonaro’s conviction for an attempted coup,” Boulos predicted.Costa, Carvalho and millions of other devotees now see only one possible lifeline for their movement’s leader: Trump heaping pressure on the supreme court and Lula’s government in an attempt to force judges to absolve him.‘Classic tinpot dictator’: Trump exports his assault on democracy to BrazilRead moreIn recent weeks the US president has started answering their calls, first by imposing 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports in retaliation against a supposed anti-Bolsonaro “witch-hunt”, then bystripping eight supreme court judgesof their US visas, and finally by hitting Moraes with sanctions and accusing him of turning South America’s biggest democracy into“a judicial dictatorship”.At the centre of Trump’s pressure campaign is Bolsonaro’s third son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a congressman who has close ties to the Maga movement. Eduardo, 41, moved to the US in February claiming he was a victim of political persecution and has busied himself trying to persuade Trump officials to target Brazil.“[I visit the White House] almost every week,” he told the Brazilian newspaper O Globo this week, admitting he was lobbying the Trump administration to impose further sanctions after his father wasplaced under house arreston Monday.He said he hoped for a reaction from the US. “What they’ll do, I don’t know,” added the hard-right politician, who named some of his US contacts as the Republican congresspeople María Elvira Salazar, Richard McCormick and Chris Smith, and Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannon.With Bolsonaro’s day of judgment expected in September, his disciples are urging Trump’s administration to impose sanctions on other members of the 11-member supreme court in order to secure an acquittal. Last Sunday, Carvalho joined thousands of protesters outside Brasília’s central bank, carrying a banner urging Trump to make Brazil great again. Many marchers carried US flags or wore red Maga caps stamped with Trump’s name. Carvalho voiced confidence that the court would buckle under US pressure and drop the case.View image in fullscreenJair Bolsonaro supporters protest in front of the central bank in Brasília last weekend.Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/The GuardianExperts disagree. They believe Trump’s sanctions and tariffs do not have a prayer of swaying the five judges who will decide Bolsonaro’s fate.What could Trump do to save Bolsonaro’s skin? “Invade Brazil,” quipped Thomas Traumann, a political pundit and the author of a book about his politically divided country called Biography of the Abyss. “There’s no chance at all of it happening.”Traumann said Trump’s pressure campaign had been Bolsonaro’s “last card” but it had failed, serving only to turn many of Brazil’s conservative elites against the ex-president for putting his own personal interests above those of his country. This week one industry federationwarnedthat Trump’s tariffs could cost Brazil’s economy £3.5bn over the next two years.Traumann believed the chances of another member of the Bolsonaro clan winning next year’s presidential election and offering their patriarch a get-out-of-jail-free card had also taken a hit.‘A family of traitors’: Trump’s Brazil tariffs ultimatum backfires on BolsonaroRead moreBoulos also thought Trump’s ploy – which he called “a shameful, arrogant, imperialist affront” – hadbackfired on Bolsonarismo. “Even people on the right are looking at this and saying this can’t be possible … Brazil isn’t the US’s back yard, it isn’t a little banana republic where he can intervene and do whatever he wants.”Bolsonaro and his politician sons have long portrayed themselves as flag-waving patriots, encouraging followers to wear Brazil’s yellow-and-green football jersey and adopt the national anthem as their song. “But they have revealed themselves to be traitors to the nation who are being used by Trump to attack Brazilian sovereignty, Brazilian jobs and the Brazilian economy,” Boulos claimed. “If the objective was to save Bolsonaro, they’ve completely shot themselves in the foot.”Yet the Bolsonaristas have vowed to fight on. This week after Bolsonaro was confined to his mansion, fleets of cars and motorbikes honked their way through the streets of the capital in protest at his treatment. Pro-Bolsonaro congresspeople staged a 30-hour occupation of the lower house to demand an amnesty for the former president and for the rightwing activists who ransacked the same building during their 8 January 2023 rampage through Brasília.At one street protest, Costa, who admitted climbing on to the roof of congress during those pro-Bolsonaro riots, hoisted her stars-and-stripes flag into an azure sky and begged the US president to act. “Trumpy! Trumpy! Trumpy! Trumpy!” the throng around her chanted joyfully, using the Brazilian pronunciation of his name.“Trumpy! Come here to Brazil, Trumpy!” Costa bellowed back in English, imploring him to encircle Brazil with US military bases and colonise her homeland. “We love you!”Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS foreign policyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s off the table, absolutely off the table.”The Mexican president said her government had been informed of the executive order but insisted that “it had nothing to do with the participation of any military or any institution on our territory. There is no risk that they will invade our territory.”Mexico’s foreign ministry later said it “would not accept the participation of US military forces on our territory” after the US embassy in Mexico released a statement saying both countries would use “every tool at our disposal to protect our peoples” from drug trafficking groups.Sheinbaum demands return of Mexican citizens held at ‘Alligator Alcatraz’Read moreNews of Trump’s secret directive to the Pentagon was first reportedby the New York Times,which cited people familiar with the matter, and noted that the order “provides an official basis for the possibility of direct military operations at sea and on foreign soil against cartels”.The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the move would enable the US government to use the military to target trafficking organizations.“It allows us to now target what they’re operating and to use other elements of American power, intelligence agencies, the Department of Defense, whatever … to target these groups if we have an opportunity to do it,” Rubio said.“We have to start treating them as armed terrorist organizations, not simply drug dealing organizations.“Trump has made going after Latin American drug-trafficking organizations a top priority of his administration:in February,the state department designated seven organized crime groups as foreign terrorist organizations, including five powerful cartels in Mexico.At the time, the White Houseclaimed these groupsconstituted “a national security threat beyond that posed by traditional organized crime” with activities including “infiltration into foreign governments across the Western Hemisphere”.It is unclear how much impact that designation has had, as US agencies already have a range of tools to target transnational organized crime groups by restricting their members’ abilities to travel or do business.But the designation would widen the range of potential targets for prosecution to include anyone who provides “material support” to the cartels.The Trump administration has alsodeployed thousandsof active-duty combat troops, as well as drones and spy planes to the south-west US border in order to crack down on the northward flow of drugs, particularly fentanyl, as well as staunch the flow of immigrants.Trump administration doubles reward for arrest of Venezuela’s president to $50mRead moreThis latest order would represent a profound and unprecedented escalation of tactics by the US government in Latin America, potentially opening the door for unilateral American military assaults across the region.Jack Riley, former deputy administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency who helped lead the capture of the drug kingpinJoaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, welcomed the Trump administration’s directive, having long been a proponent of designating cartels as terrorist organizations.“This to me is the next logical step,” said Riley. “It probably opens up avenues for training our counterparts, additional funding obviously, and puts some teeth into the federal agencies that are operating overseas.”Still, Riley cautioned that Trump’s order may face obstacles at home before troops can even set foot overseas.“You’re probably going to have some legal challenges in the US to his authority to do this without congressional approval,” he said. “But that doesn’t seem to bother him.”In Mexico, however, security analysts feared the move would not only be ineffective at eliminating drug-trafficking groups but also prove devastating to US-Mexico relations.“It’s not a welcome development,” said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, head of the North American observatory at the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime. “And beyond the narrative, it seems to me that once again there’s been a misdiagnosis of these illicit markets and how we can weaken and dismantle them.”The news comes at a delicate time for US-Mexico relations, with Mexico in the midst of negotiating a tariff deal with the Trump administration as well as a new security agreement, which Sheinbaum had said was close to being signed.Mexico and the United States have often cooperated closely on security, including during the Mérida Initiative back under former President Felipe Calderón. But even then, said Farfán-Méndez, US boots on the ground was seen as a red line. This new move by the Trump administration would potentially cross that line – with devastating impacts on the countries’ relationship.“It would have very serious consequences, where Mexico would stop cooperating,” she said. “This does seem to me like it would lead Mexico to ask, ‘what’s the incentive to collaborate with you? If you’re going to take unilateral action anyway?’”Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasUS foreign policyDonald TrumpDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

Cambodia denies the accusation.The army’s statement said the incident took place in Thailand’s Sisaket province and “clearly demonstrates to both domestic and international society that the use of concealed weapons in border areas continues to exist, constituting a clear violation of the Ottawa Convention by the Cambodian side”.The Ottawa Convention is an international treaty banning the use of landmines, signed by 164 countries, including Cambodia and Thailand.The incident on Saturday risks enflaming tensions, which remain high despite the fragile truce agreed on 29 July to end the armed conflict.Online hate and rising vitriol: deep divisions amid shaky peace between Thailand and CambodiaRead moreFive days of fighting broke out last month after five Thai soldiers were wounded when one stepped on a mine in disputed territory. The clashes, whichkilled at least 43 peopleon either side of the border and displaced more than 260,000, amounted to the worst fighting between the neighbouring countries in more than a decade.Since the truce was agreed, both sides have accused the other ofbreaching it. Relations remain rocky while anger is being stirred online by a mix of disinformation, threats and nationalism.Two days after the two sides met in Malaysia to sign a 13-point agreement on implementing their ceasefire, the Thai army’s statement said that Saturday’s incident constituted “a significant obstacle to the implementation of ceasefire measures and peaceful resolution of problems”.Cambodia strongly denies laying new concealed weapons. “We have not, and will not, plant new landmines,” the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority said in a statement.It said Cambodia had cleared more than 1m mines and nearly 3m other unexploded weapons dating back to a period of war and civil unrest that began in 1970 and lasted more than three decades.The Thai sergeant major lost his left foot in Saturday’s incident, according to the Thai army statement, while two privates suffered less serious injuries.Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsThailandCambodiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Only one of its two bells was recovered from the rubble, leaving the northern tower silent. With funds from US churchgoers, a new bell was constructed and restored to the tower.Hiroshima’s fading legacy: the race to secure survivors’ memories amid a new era of nuclear brinkmanshipRead moreAfter heavy downpours on Saturday morning, the rain stopped shortly before a moment of silence and ceremony in which Nagasaki mayor Shiro Suzuki urged the world to “stop armed conflicts immediately”.View image in fullscreenPeople attend an early morning mass at Urakami cathedral in Nagasaki, Japan, on Saturday to mark 80 years since the atomic bomb was dropped.Photograph: Franck Robichon/EPA“Eighty years have passed, and who could have imagined that the world would become like this?” he said. “A crisis that could threaten the survival of humanity, such as a nuclear war, is looming over each and every one of us living on this planet.”About 74,000 people were killed in the south-western port city, on top of the 140,000 killed in Hiroshima.Days later, on 15 August 1945,Japansurrendered, marking the end of the second world war.Historians have debated whether the bombings ultimately saved lives by bringing an end to the conflict and averting a ground invasion. But those calculations meant little to survivors, known ashibakusha, many of whom battled decades of physical and psychological trauma, as well as stigma.View image in fullscreenChurchgoers pray at the Urakami cathedral in Nagasaki.Photograph: è„ìcçNëæòY; 上田康太郎/APHiroshi Nishioka, a 93-year-old survivor who was just three kilometres from where the bomb exploded, told ceremony attenders of the horror he witnessed as a young teenager.“Even the lucky ones [who were not severely injured] gradually began to bleed from their gums and lose their hair, and one after another they died,” he recalled. “Even though the war was over, the atomic bomb brought invisible terror.”Nagasaki resident Atsuko Higuchi said it “made her happy” that everyone would remember the city’s victims.“Instead of thinking that these events belong to the past, we must remember that these are real events that took place,” the 50-year-old said.View image in fullscreenThe restored bell of Urakami cathedral that arrived from the United States is displayed in May 2025.Photograph: The Asahi Shimbun/Getty ImagesThe chief priest of Urakami Cathedral, Kenichi Yamamura, said the bell’s restoration “shows the greatness of humanity”.“It’s not about forgetting the wounds of the past but recognising them and taking action to repair and rebuild, and in doing so, working together for peace,” Yamamura said.He also sees the chimes as a message to the world, shaken by multiple conflicts and caught in a frantic new arms race.“We should not respond to violence with violence, but rather demonstrate through our way of living, praying, how senseless it is to take another’s life,” he said.Nearly 100 countries were set to participate in this year’s commemorations, including Russia, which has not been invited since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Israel, whose ambassador was not invited last year over the war in Gaza, was in attendance.View image in fullscreenJapan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, offers a wreath at a ceremony at Nagasaki’s Peace Park.Photograph: Issei Kato/ReutersAn American university professor, whose grandfather participated in the Manhattan Project, which developed the first nuclear weapons, spearheaded the bell project.During his research in Nagasaki, a Japanese Christian told him he would like to hear the two bells of the cathedral ring together in his lifetime.Inspired by the idea, James Nolan, a sociology professor at Williams College in Massachusetts, embarked on a year-long series of lectures about the atomic bomb across the United States, primarily in churches. He managed to raise $125,000 from American Catholics to fund the new bell.When it was unveiled in Nagasaki in the spring, “the reactions were magnificent. There were people literally in tears”, said Nolan.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificSecond world warNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is the pair’s second annual meeting, following Luxon’s visit to Canberra last year.Gaza and the topic of recognising Palestinian statehood loomed large, two days after the Israeli security cabinet approved a plan to take over Gaza City,prompting global condemnation.On Saturday, the foreign ministers of both countries alongside Germany, Italy and UK releaseda joint statement condemning Israel’s latest offensive. Last month,New Zealand and Australiacosigned theNew York Call– a declaration indicating the possible recognition of Palestinian statehood.Speaking to media after their formal meeting, neither Luxon nor Albanese would confirm when a declaration of statehood might happen but said Israel’s latest plans were “wrong”.“Military action, as we’ve seen, is not the way to solve this problem,” Luxon said. “The latest action from Israel we’re seeing in the past 24 hours is wrong and risks violating international law.”Australians want to see a ceasefire, Albanese said. “They want to see the killing stop. They want to see hostages released. They want to see peace in the region.”Both leaders rejected the idea that possible trade retaliation from the US president, Donald Trump, over recognising Palestinian statehood would affect their positions. Australian goods imported into the US have attracted Trump’s baseline 10% tariff, while last week, New Zealand was hit with asurprise 15% tariff.“We make our own assessments in … our own economic and our security interests,” Luxon said.“Australia has exactly the same position,” Albanese said. “As a sovereign nation, we make our decisions.”The leaders also discussed deepening ties in defence and security, and fielded questions about their nations’ relationships with China, which is the largest trading partner to both countries but whose growing influence and military exercises in the Pacific have caused discomfort.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They all wore black balaclavas or face coverings, except for the man at the front of the group.Allan said: “Nazis don’t belong in this country and they know it. That’s why they hide behind masks in the dark.”She added in a statement on Saturday: “I thank police who maintained the public order. It’s clear they need more powers, and we’re giving it to them.“Our criminalanti-vilification lawscome into effect next month. We will introduce powers for police to unmask cowards at protests after that.“We’re not afraid of these goons – but we won’t tolerate them either.”Police alleged an altercation occurred during the protest when a 26-year-old man confronted the group and was assaulted.“The man, of no fixed place of abode, was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries and the investigation into the assault remains ongoing,” the police said in a statement.“No arrests were made throughout the protest and police had a strong presence to maintain community safety and to prevent any breach of the peace.“Victoria police respects the right to protest. However, there is absolutely no place for antisemitic, racist or hate-based behaviour in our society and police will not tolerate such activity.”In a second incident police believe was linked the first, officers attended the Bacchus Marsh train station to monitor a planned event.“Members of local and specialist units responded to both the event and a counterprotest to that event, about 9am,” police said in a further statement.Police said there were no assaults and no arrests were made at the second gathering.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bring them in now. We’re back in parliament next week. Let’s bring them forward. Let’s do whatever’s needed. Let’s bring the mask laws in.”He also suggested that the group behind the march led a “recruitment drive” immediately afterwards.Explore more on these topicsVictoriaAustralian police and policingVictorian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2019, one day of the festival was cancelled due to extreme weather and in 2022, as the northern rivers region experienced devastating flooding, the festival changed its venue.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAlice said her team did a lot of site work to mitigate the effects of the weather: ensuring there was adequate drainage, creating pathways for people to move safely around and investing in sturdy marquees. But she said extreme weather was now something event organisers needed to plan for.“It’s absolutely something we now need to discuss more urgently,” Alice said. “This weather that we’ve had – we’re used to rain in the northern rivers … but it’s very unusual for it to be this wet at this time of year.“We’re feeling these effects in a different way.”A surface trough sitting off the coast of Queensland and pushing moisture down the east coast led to an extensive area of cloud stretching from central eastern Queensland through theNew South Walescoast, and rainy conditions for much of the east coast, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.There were heavy rainfall totals along the eastern seaboard after Friday night, with 75mm to the north of Rockhampton, more than 50mm along the coast from Yamba towards Lismore and up to 50mm in Sydney’s east.Some parts of the NSW coast have already seen their average monthly rainfall dramatically exceeded in the first eight days of August, including Sydney, where average August rainfall has been about 80mm – and which, as of 9am on Saturday, has already received 140mm of rain. Rainfall in Newcastle has reached 147mm.“In the seven days to 9am this morning, the highest rainfall for NSW is 255mm at Careys Creek [in the Hunter region],” senior BoM meteorologist Jonathan How said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a comment that that was met with pushback from Kyiv, the US president said that an end to the warmust involve “some swapping of territories”. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stressed early on Saturday that “Ukrainians will not give their land to occupiers”.Map of UkraineTrump has agreed to meet the Russian president even if he refuses to meet Zelenskyy, adding to fearsUkrainecould be sidelined in negotiations.In a Telegram post on Saturday in which he emphasised Kyiv must be represented for any peace deal to be viable, Zelenskyy wrote: “Any decisions that are without Ukraine are at the same time decisions against peace. They will not bring anything. These are dead decisions. They will never work.”Ukraine will not give up land, Zelenskyy warns ahead of Trump-Putin meetingRead moreThe meeting between Lammy and Vance took place at Chevening in Kent. The Guardian understands it was held at the request of the US.On Saturday evening, Lammy posted on X that he had held a meeting with Vance, Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the Ukrainian president, Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s defence minister, and European national security advisers.“The UK’s support for Ukraine remains ironclad as we continue working towards a just and lasting peace,” he said.Zelenskyy said on Saturday evening that the meeting of security advisers from Ukraine and its partner countries had been constructive, adding that Kyiv’s arguments were heard and dangers were taken into account.Zelenskyy said officials from Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Finland and Poland took part in the meeting, aiming to consolidate positions to achieve a ceasefire.“The path to peace for Ukraine should be determined together and only together with Ukraine, this is key principle,” he said in his evening address.On Saturday evening the leaders of the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Poland and Finland, and the president of the EU Commission, released a joint statement declaring that the path to peace could not be decided without Ukraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The two countries have come closer to ending 35 years of enmity by signing a peace treaty in Washington and agreeing to a US private consortium taking control of a strategic corridor on Iran’s border.The corridor passing through southernArmeniawill link Azerbaijan with its exclave Nakhchivan, a longstanding demand of Baku. The US will operate the corridor under Armenian sovereignty on a 99-year land lease, changing the balance of power in the region. Some Iranian commentators claimed the deal amounts to “Iran’s geopolitical suffocation in the region”.Control of the corridor that runs along the border between Armenia and northernIranhas been the single biggest block to a peace deal between the two countries.The deal is also a further blow to Russia’s diminished influence in the region, as Armenia’s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, guides his Christian-majority country towards the west, and eventually the EU.Russia– which still has a military base in Armenia – seems unable to resist the Trump initiative, partly due to its preoccupation with Ukraine.In a statement on Saturday the Iranian foreign ministry said: “Establishing communication networks will serve the security, and economic development of the nations of the region when it is done within the framework of mutual interests, respecting the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries of the region, and without foreign interference”.Abbas Mousavi, former Iranian ambassador to Baku and a deputy presidential spokesperson, described Trump’s direct involvement in the issue of relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia as “interesting, offensive and dangerous”.But there is little Iran can do to block a deal that the US, Armenia and Azerbaijan see as in their mutual interest.Armenia and Azerbaijan have been in conflict since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous Azerbaijani region mostly populated by ethnic Armenians, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia. Azerbaijan, the superior military power which is largely run as an authoritarian dictatorship, wrested back full control of the region in 2023 by force, prompting almost all of the territory’s 120,000 ethnic Armenians to flee to Armenia.In the most novel part of the deal, an – as yet unformed – US consortium will take control of a 20-mile-long transit corridor connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave. It will be named the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity”.The proposal, first discussed during the Biden administration, raises the prospect of a US presence right on the Iranian border. Tehran worries such a development might cut off its access to the Black Sea as well as toEuropevia Georgia.A further opening of the border with Turkey would integrate Armenia into the Middle Corridor project, an economic trade route between Europe and China that bypasses Russia and Iran. Armenian leaders have long seen economic benefits in this project for their landlocked country.The White House said the new transport corridor would “enable unhindered connectivity between the two countries, while respecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity and people of Armenia”. The route is billed to include roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines and fibre-optic lines. A US commercial presence lowers the incentive for either side to resort to military solutions.As part of the Washington accord, the two sides have also agreed to end other border disputes, but Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, stressed in press briefings that a final agreement required the Armenian constitution to be amended to eliminate “baseless territorial claims” against Azerbaijan, adding to not do so would be seen as “an act of disrespect” by the US. Armenia is expected to hold a referendum on the constitution in 2027, but the more Aliyev highlights his demand, the more hostility will grow inside Armenia.But Aliyev, and his ally Turkey, gain greatly from the agreement so may not look for obstacles. As part of the agreement, for instance, restrictions on military cooperation between Azerbaijan and the US can be lifted. Aliyev said: “We have pre-signed the Peace Agreement, which has been negotiated for a long time, and the fact that it is pre-signed in the capital of the No 1 superpower, in the world’s No 1 office, and in the presence of the great president of the USA, means that there should be no doubt that any of the parties will make a step back.”He also called for Trump to be awarded the Nobel peace prize.Explore more on these topicsIranAzerbaijanArmeniaEuropeMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyRussiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

HerInstagram posthas been watched more than 1.7m times and is captioned with a plea: “Please share so a lot of women will see it!”In the tearful video, Mina said pictures she had put on Vinted had apparently been copied and then posted on “porn sites”. She said a Google search of her name now brought up links to that content, just as she was applying for jobs.The Guardian could not independently confirm her account. In the Instagram video, she said she had reported the matter to Google and the German police, who do not comment on individual criminal complaints.This week the German news outlet Der Spiegel published an interview with Mina, saying she was 22 years old, lived in Cologne and wished to keep her surname private. It said she had used Vinted for “several years”.“The idea of a secondhand platform for clothes is super and important, also considering climate change,” she said. But she lamented Vinted was no longer a “safe space” for her, calling her experiences there “creepy”.She said she had received a barrage of abusive messages via Vinted’s messaging system including: “Hello, I’d like to buy this item of clothing but I’d like you to try it on without underwear first”, and: “Can I also buy you?”Others demanded “more intimate” pictures than the ones she posted.Mina said even more disturbing was the fact photos in which she posed in clothing she was trying to sell including bikini tops and summer dresses had resurfaced on other websites depicting her as an “erotic model” and saying she was a “naked OnlyFans star”.She said she had never posted nude photos online and had no account on the amateur pornography site. Spiegel said it found her name and images on sex-focused German-language forums, with links back to her Vinted and Instagram accounts.Several investigations have turned up similar complaints.In April, a joint report by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and public broadcasters NDR and WDR exposed a public Telegram channel called Girls of Vinted launched in June 2024, and featuring more than 1,000 pictures taken from the marketplace platform and placed in a sexualised context.The report said the Telegram channel featured women who appeared to be selling sexual services based on information included in their profiles, while most were there as legitimate Vinted users and showcased involuntarily.Several of the more than 130 women shown, many of them from Germany, Italy andFrance, reported then receiving lurid messages on their Vinted accounts. Before the Telegram channel was shut down earlier this year, it had accumulated 2,000 mainly male subscribers.In October, the UK broadcasterChannel 4revealed a comparable website called Vinted Sluts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In its updated online help centre, it allows usersto report inappropriate behaviour and content.This was an option used by Bella and Sonja, who said Vinted then shut down the offending accounts after about a week. They soon received new offensive messages from other accounts, however.Vinted said if users found their photos on third-party sites, it would contact those platforms to request removal “where possible”.“We have already reported such cases to Telegram via various channels and, in connection with the Channel 4 documentary, achieved the shutdown of a named website,” a company spokesperson said.Vinted advises its members in its community standards not to share photos in which their face is visible and to keep personal information such as full names, addresses and bank details out of private messages, while minimising data included on shipping labels.“We are aware of the challenges online platforms face in addressing inappropriate behaviour and take our members’ negative experiences very seriously. Safeguarding our members is an ongoing priority,” the spokesperson said.“We will continue to review and evolve our systems to prevent incidents and to respond swiftly whenever issues arise.”Legal experts advise users whose images have been hijacked for sexualised content to report it to the authorities in their country as well as the websites where they are posted.

The deal includes an agreement that will create a major transit corridor linking Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan, with the United States owning development rights to the corridor. It was to be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, the White House said.Donald Trump said that naming the route after him was “a great honour for me”, but “I didn’t ask for this”. A senior administration official, on a call before the event with reporters, said it was the Armenians who suggested the name.Separate from the joint agreement, bothArmeniaand Azerbaijan signed deals with the United States meant to bolster cooperation in energy, technology and the economy, the White House said. Further details were not released.Azerbaijan escalates rare standoff with Russia over downing of passenger planeRead moreThe Azerbaijani president, Ilham Aliyev, and the Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, shook hands to mark the moment, with Trump in the middle, reaching up and clasping his own hands around theirs.The agreement was welcomed by a number of global figures on Saturday. The UK’s foreign secretary, David Lammy, congratulated Armenia and Azerbaijan “on the bold steps taken in Washington”, as well as commending Trump for his role in the development.The presidents of the European Commission and the European Council, Ursula von der Leyen and António Costa, also hailed the deal and called for its speedy implementation, in order for the countries to move towards “full-fledged normalisation”.Iran’s foreign ministry reacted by issuing a warning against foreign involvement. While it welcomed the end of Armenia and Azerbaijan’s conflict, Iran – which shares a border with both countries – has long opposed the creation of the transit corridor agreed as part of the deal.The two nations have been locked in conflict for nearly four decades as they fought for control of the Karabakh region, known internationally asNagorno-Karabakh. The area was largely populated by Armenians during the Soviet era but is located within Azerbaijan. The two nations battled for control of the region through multiple violent clashes that left tens of thousands of people dead over the decades, all while international mediation efforts failed.Most recently, Azerbaijan reclaimed all of Karabakh in 2023 and had been in talks with Armenia to normalise ties.Trump has sought a reputation as a peacemaker and made no secret of the fact that he covets a Nobel peace prize. Friday’s signing adds to a series of peace and economic agreements brokered by the US this year.Both Armenia’s and Azerbaijan’s leaders said the breakthrough was made possible by Trump and his team, and joined a growing list of foreign leaders and other officials who have said Trump should receive the Nobel peace prize.“We are laying a foundation to write a better story than the one we had in the past,” Pashinyan said, calling the agreement a “significant milestone”.“President Trump in six months did a miracle,” Aliyev said.Trump remarked on how long the conflict had gone on between the two countries. “Thirty-five years they fought, and now they’re friends and they’re going to be friends a long time,” he said.That route will connect Azerbaijan and its autonomous Nakhchivan exclave, which are separated by a 32km-wide (20-mile) patch of Armenian territory. The demand from Azerbaijan had held up peace talks in the past.For Azerbaijan, a major producer of oil and gas, the route also provides a more direct link to Turkey and onward to Europe.Trump indicated he wold like to visit the route, saying, “We’re going to have to get over there.” Asked how he felt about lasting peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Trump said “very confident”.The signing of a deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, also strikes a geopolitical blow to their former imperial master, Russia. Throughout the nearly four-decade conflict, Moscow played mediator to expand its clout in the strategic South Caucasus region, but its influence waned quickly after it launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.TheTrump administrationbegan engaging with Armenia and Azerbaijan in earnest earlier this year, when Trump’s key diplomatic envoy, Steve Witkoff, met Aliyev in Baku and started to discuss what a senior administration official called a “regional reset”.Negotiations over who will develop the Trump Route – which will eventually include a rail line, oil and gas pipelines, and fiber optic lines – will probably begin next week, and at least nine developers have expressed interest already, according to the senior administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.Associated Press and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsEuropeArmeniaAzerbaijanTrump administrationDonald TrumpNagorno-KarabakhUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Those who do go are also spending less on food and drink.Fabrizio Licordari, the president of Assobalneari Italia, an association representing beach clubs, blamed the decline on the high cost of living and its consequences on spending power.Sea, sand and sky-high fees: Italians tussle over their right to lie on the beachRead more“Even with two salaries, many families struggle to reach the end of the month,” he told Ansa news agency. “In such circumstances, it’s natural that the first expenses to be cut are those for leisure, entertainment and holidays.”The drop in attendance, however, also coincides with increases in the cost of private beach resorts and the growing rebellion against theirdominance of Italian shorelines, which has left very little space for free beaches.The cost of renting a sunlounger is a recurring topic of discussion, and rightly so – on average, it costs 17% more than it did four years ago, according to figures this week from the consumer group Altroconsumo. On beaches in the Lazio region, for example, it is difficult to rent two loungers and an umbrella for less than €30 (£26) a day. That rises to about €90 in the popular resort of Gallipoli in Puglia.The actor Alessandro Gassmann stoked the debate after sharing a photo of a beach with deserted loungerson his Instagram pageand writing alongside it: “I read that the season is not going well. Maybe it’s because the prices are exaggerated and the country’s economic situation is forcing Italians to choose free beaches? Lower the prices and maybe things will get better.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added that people in return benefited from services including security and lifeguard supervision.But the consumers association Codacons said going to beach resorts had become “a drain” on people’s finances and accused the concession owners of “shedding crocodile tears”.The beaches might be losing custom, but areas in the mountains, especially the Dolomites, have had a significant rise in visitor numbers, with some areas fearing overtourism. According to a report this week in the newspaperIl Messaggero, more Italians are venturing to the mountains for their holidays, partly as a way to escape increasingly hot summers caused in part by the climate crisis.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Attenders demanded an immediate end to the military campaign and for the release of hostages.“This isn’t just a military decision. It could be a death sentence for the people we love most,” Lishay Miran Lavi, the wife of hostage Omri Miran, told the rally, pleading Donald Trump to intervene to immediately end the war.‘A deadly scheme’: Palestinians face indiscriminate gunfire at food sitesRead morePublic opinion polls show an overwhelming majority of Israelis favour an immediate end to the war to secure the release of the remaining 50 hostages held by militants in Gaza. Israeli officials believe about 20 hostages are still alive.The Israeli government has faced sharp criticism at home and abroad, including from some of its closest European allies, over the announcement that the military would expand the war. The full cabinet is expected to give its approval as soon as Sunday.Most of the hostages who have been freed emerged as a result of diplomatic negotiations. Talks toward a ceasefire that could have seen more hostages released collapsed in July.“They (the government) are fanatic. They are doing things against the interests of the country,” said Rami Dar, 69-year-old retiree, who travelled from a nearby suburb outside Tel Aviv, echoing calls for Trump to force a deal for the hostages.Tel Aviv has seen frequent rallies urging the government to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas, which ignited the war with their October 2023 attack.“Frankly, I’m not an expert or anything, but I feel that after two years of fighting there has been no success,” said Yana, 45, who attended the rally with her husband and two children. “I wonder whether additional lives for both sides, not just the Israelis but also Gazans, will make any difference.“View image in fullscreenOpinion polls show an overwhelming majority of Israelis favour an end to the war to secure the release of the remaining hostages held by militants in Gaza.Photograph: Amir Cohen/ReutersAbout 1,200, mostly Israelis, were killed and 251 were taken into Gaza during Hamas’ attack on Israel on 7 October, 2023. More than 400 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since.Protesters waved Israeli flags and carried placards bearing the images of hostages. Others held signs directing anger at the government or urging Trump to take action to stop Netanyahu from moving forward with plans to escalate the war. A small number of protesters held images of children killed by the military in Gaza.Israel’s military has killed more than 61,000 Palestinians in the war, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which said on Saturday that at least 39 had been killed in the past day.Israel’s delusional, inhuman Gaza takeover plan could be recipe for perpetual warRead moreSome of the prime minister’s far-right coalition allies have been pushing for a total takeover of Gaza. The military has warned this could endanger the lives of the hostages in Gaza.Far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich, a proponent of continuing the war, issued a statement on Saturday criticising Netanyahu and calling for the annexation of large parts of Gaza.Netanyahu told Fox News in an interview that aired on Thursday that the military intended totake control of all Gazabut that Israel did not want to keep the territory.The announcement from the prime minister’s office early on Friday said the military would take Gaza City, but did not explicitly say if Israeli forces would take all the territory.Tal, a 55-year-old high school teacher, told Reuters at the rally in Tel Aviv that expanding the war was “terrible,” warning it would result in the deaths of soldiers and hostages. They said the war should end with the military withdrawing: “We don’t have anything to do there.

Civil defence spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told AFP that at least six people were killed and 30 wounded after Israeli troops targeted civilians assembling near an aid point in central Gaza.It comes after, early Friday, the Israeli security cabinet approved plans to launch major operations to seizeGazaCity, triggering a wave of outrage across the globe. Despite the backlash and rumours of dissent from Israeli military top brass, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu remained defiant over the decision.In a post on social media late Friday, Netanyahu said “we are not going to occupy Gaza - we are going to free Gaza from Hamas”. Netanyahu faces mounting pressure to secure a ceasefire to bring the territory’s more than two million people back from the brink of famine and free the hostages held by Palestinian militants.Meanwhile:The worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and Israel’s plans to expand military control over the enclave have pushed Germany to curb arms exports to Israel, a historically fraught step for Berlin driven by a growing public outcry. Conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz, hitherto a staunchly pro-Israel leader, made the announcement on Friday arguing that Israel’s actions would not achieve its stated war goals of eliminating Hamas militants or bringing Israeli hostages home.The UN Security Council announced an emergency meeting on Israel’s plans was rescheduled to 10am EDT on Sunday (3pm BST) after originally being scheduled to take place at 3pm EDT (8pm BST) on Saturday. The UN Mission of Panama, which holds the council presidency this month, provided no details, but Saturday is the Jewish Sabbath and Israel is certain to want to speak at the meeting.The efforts for a new ceasefire have the backing of major Arab Gulf monarchies, according to two officials who spoke to AP anonymously due to the sensitivity of the discussions. One is involved directly in the deliberations and the second was briefed on the efforts. The monarchies are concerned about further regional destabilisation if Israel fully reoccupies Gaza, the officials said. A senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorised to brief the media, said the group has yet to receive details on the latest efforts to revive ceasefire talks.ShareUpdated at05.59 EDT"

Germany, Israel’s second-biggest arms supplier and strongest backer in Europe, on Fridaysuspended the delivery of weaponrythat could be used in Gaza.Foreign ministers from the UK, Germany, Italy, Australia and New Zealand said in ajoint statementon Saturday that the plans to control Gaza City will make an already perilous situation worse, with the “worst-case scenario” of mass famine already unfolding in the territory. The ministers said further large-scale military operations in Gaza “willaggravate the catastrophic humanitarian situation, endanger the lives of the hostages, and further risk the mass displacement of civilians”.An emergency UN security council meeting has been scheduled for 10am EDT on Sunday, after being pushed back from Saturday.The proposal is also reported to have opened a deep rift between Netanyahu and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) leadership but has not been opposed by the Trump administration, Israel’s most important backer.Hamas said in a statement that Netanyahu’s plans meant he had abandoned the surviving hostages seized by the group in its surprise attack on Israel in October 2023, which triggered the war. The statement accused the Israeli prime minister of “sacrificing them to serve his personal interests and extremist ideological agenda”.Before the security cabinet meeting, which began on Thursday and ran through the night, the Israeli prime minister had said Israelplanned to take control of the entire territoryand eventually hand it to friendly Arab forces opposed to Hamas.The plans announced on Friday morning stop short of that goal, perhaps reflecting the opposition of the IDF chief of general staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, who told Netanyahu on Tuesday he was “walking into a trap” according to Israeli press reports, warning it would endanger the remaining 20 or so living hostages held by Hamas and further strain Israel’s army after nearly two years of regional wars.However, in a meeting with the leadership of the IDF southern command on Friday, Zamir vowed to carry out the government’s orders.“We are advancing detailed preparations at the highest level, accounting for all possible outcomes. As always, we will carry out the mission with utmost precision and determination,” the army chief said.NBC published commercial satellite imagery showing a buildup of Israeli military vehicles on the edge of the coastal strip and quoted US officials as saying it could mean a new ground offensive is imminent.US demands for Hezbollah disarmament may force Lebanon into dangerous choice | William ChristouRead moreThe plan laid out by Netanyahu’s office lists five objectives: disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarising the entireGazaStrip, taking security control of the territory, and establishing “an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority”.Israel has repeatedly bombarded Gaza City and carried out numerous raids in its devastated streets, returning to different neighbourhoods again and again as militants regrouped. It is one of the few areas of Gaza that has not been turned into an Israeli buffer zone or placed under evacuation orders.The Netanyahu plan would mean sending ground troops into the few areas of the territory that have not been totally destroyed, making up about 25% of the Gaza Strip. It would force approximately 1 million Palestinians in Gaza City and surrounding areas into evacuation zones in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. Sources familiar with details of the meeting said the evacuation of the city was scheduled to be completed by 7 October.According to Israel’s Channel 12, the plan is being framed as a limited operation rather than a full invasion, apparently to placate military chiefs wary of long-term occupation, warding off an open rift with the IDF leadership. Some Israeli reports suggested Zamir may resign.A major ground operation could displace tens of thousands of people and further disrupt efforts to deliver food to the territory.View image in fullscreenPalestinians, who have little access to food due to Israel’s blockade, waiting to receive hot meals on Thursday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe Israeli security cabinet’s decision has ignited protests at home and abroad. Thousands of demonstrators are preparing to take to the streets over the weekend, while families of the remaining hostages held in Gaza fear an escalation could doom their loved ones. Dozens of them protested outside the security cabinet meeting in Jerusalem on Thursday, and then outside the home of the defence minister, Israel Katz, on Friday.Former top Israeli security officialshave also come out against the plan, warning of a quagmire with little added military benefit. The Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid, denounced the cabinet’s move on Friday, calling it a disaster that would “lead to many other disasters”, including the deaths of hostages and the killing of many soldiers, as well as costing Israeli taxpayers tens of billions and causing “diplomatic bankruptcy”.The German chancellor,Friedrich Merz, said it was “increasingly difficult to understand” how Israel’s plan would accomplish the aims of disarming Hamas and liberating the remaining hostages.“Under these circumstances, the German government will not authorise any exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice,” he said.The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, said Israel’s decision was wrong and urged it to immediately reconsider. “This action will do nothing to bring an end to this conflict or to help secure the release of the hostages. It will only bring more bloodshed,” he said.The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, said the Israeli government’s plan for a complete military takeover of the occupied Gaza Strip “must be immediately halted”, while the EU Council president, António Costa, said implementation of the plan “must have consequences for EU-Israel relations”.However, no opposition has come from Washington. When asked about a possible Israeli takeover of Gaza, Donald Trump said on Tuesday: “I really can’t say. It is going to be pretty much up to Israel.”The news site Axios cited a US official as saying that Trump had been appalled by the video released by Hamas showing an Israeli hostage digging his own grave. “It influenced the president, and he is going to let the Israelis do what they need to do,” the official was quoted as saying.Netanyahu’s office said that under the plan to defeat Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army would prepare to “take control of Gaza City while distributing humanitarian assistance to the civilian population outside combat zones”.An Israeli official had earlier said the security cabinet would discuss plans to conquer all or parts of Gaza not yet under Israeli control. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that whatever was approved would be implemented gradually to increase pressure on the Palestinian militant group.Palestinians, at least90% of whom have already been displaced at least onceby the war and of whom nearlyone in 10 have been injured in Israeli attacks, are braced for further misery. There is little remaining of the healthcare system and aid agencies such as the UN have been largely shut out by Israel.View image in fullscreenA man who was injured while rushing to collect humanitarian aid airdropped into Gaza City is carried away for medical treatment.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APAya Mohammad, a 30-year-old Palestinian who, after repeated displacement, had returned with her family to Gaza City, said: “Where should we go? We have been displaced and humiliated enough. You know what displacement is? Does the world know? It means your dignity is wiped out, you become a homeless beggar, searching for food, water and medicine.”At least 42 Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes and shootings across southern Gaza on Thursday, according to local hospitals.Israel’s military offensive has killed at least 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, most of them civilians. The figuredoes not include the thousands believed to be buried under rubbleor the thousands killed indirectly as a consequence of the war.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

As of 9pm, 466 people had been arrested for showing support for Palestine Action.“There were a further eight arrests for other offences including five assaults on officers.”The Met said the total of 474 was the most arrests it had made related to a single operation in at least the past decade.Before the planned event in the capital, the Met said it had drawn officers from other forces to help form a “significant policing presence”. It was anticipated the event would result in large numbers of people being detained.By Saturday afternoon, hundreds of people had gathered in Parliament Square for a demonstration organised by the campaign group Defend Our Juries, who said “approximately 1,000 sign-holders” had turned up.The Met said it estimated 500-600 people were in Parliament Square when the demonstration began, but “many” were not partaking.A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries said earlier: “The fact that unprecedented numbers came out today risking arrest and possible imprisonment shows how repulsed and ashamed people are about our government’s ongoing complicity in a livestreamed genocide, and the lengths people are prepared to go to defend this country’s ancient liberties.”View image in fullscreenPolice arresting a woman in Parliament Square.Photograph: Gary Calton/The Guardian“The police have only been able to arrest a fraction of those supposedly committing ‘terrorism’ offences, and most of those have been given street bail and allowed to go home. This is a major embarrassment to Yvette Cooper, further undermining the credibility of this widely ridiculed law.”On Saturday evening, the home secretary thanked officers and reaffirmed the government’s decision to ban Palestine Action.“Many people may not yet know the reality of this organisation, but the assessments are very clear – this is not a nonviolent organisation. UK national security and public safety must always be our top priority,” Cooper said.The demonstration began at 1pm but officers made a small number of arrests beforehand. Soon after, officers began arresting people outside the green holding signs that referenced Palestine Action. One woman, while being dragged away by police, said: “All of you have loved ones, you’re arresting the wrong people. Arrest the people over there [pointing towards parliament], arrest the people complicit in the genocide.”From 1pm to 2pm, demonstrators holding signs that read “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action” were silent. “It’s all very sedate, peaceful and moving,” said Suzan Broom, who clapped and cheered for those being taken away by police. “I’ve been following them and saying thank you because I’m too scared.”Two women taking part in the action, one in her mid-70s, were arrested by police midway through their interview with the Guardian. One said of the turnout: “I think it’s great, people are absolutely sick of seeing genocide on their screens.”She said the vandalism of RAF aircrafts by Palestine Action members was a “protest action, it’s not at all terrorism”.“Those planes are the terrorists. They’re going over and shooting and killing children,” she said.View image in fullscreenAn arrested protester is driven away in a police van.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianZoe, one of those taking part in the demonstration, said: “I along with hundreds of ordinary people have had enough of our government’s collusion in genocide.“You can hear the claps and it’s got like a family-friendly environment here. You’ve seen it with your own eyes. It’s completely peaceful and there’s nothing vaguely terrorist right now. We’re just being ordinary peaceful people saying we oppose genocide,” she said.She wore a large patch with the words “Jews Against Genocide”. She said: “I wear it clearly and with pride to make sure that other people recognise that there are many many Jews who do not support genocide of any nature.”“I’m holding a piece of paper for goodness sakes, that’s not a terrorist act. A terrorist act is intentionally starving 2 million,” she said. “I don’t know what to say to [Palestinians], I’m so sorry it’s come to this. I wish we could do more but we’re trying our best.”Officers searched the bags of those arrested. In one backpack handled with blue forensic gloves, they uncovered some bread and a milk carton filled with water.Robert Del Naja, from the band Massive Attack, joined the sign-holders and said: “UK civil liberties are trapped in a manufactured crisis. Peaceful citizens of conscience – including pensioners – have become terrorists, at the will of a human rights lawyer turned authoritarian who now lunges at opinions that expose the moral vacuum of his unrecognisable government.”Some of those arrested were publicly processed on the street outside Scotland Yard, near the main demonstration, where crowds gathered and shouted “‘shame on you” at officers.Amnesty International called the mass arrests “deeply concerning”.“The protesters in Parliament Square were not inciting violence and it is entirely disproportionate to the point of absurdity to be treating them as terrorists,” said Sacha Deshmukh, the organisation’s chief executive.“We have long criticised UK terrorism law for being excessively broad and vaguely worded and a threat to freedom of expression. These arrests demonstrate that our concerns were justified.”View image in fullscreenA woman is arrested during the demonstration.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianBefore the protest, a Home Office spokesperson said: “The home secretary has been clear that the proscription of Palestine Action is not about Palestine, nor does it affect the freedom to protest on Palestinian rights.“It only applies to the specific and narrow organisation whose activities do not reflect or represent the thousands of people across the country who continue to exercise their fundamental rights to protest on different issues. Freedom to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy and we protect it fiercely.”The firstthree peopleto be charged with supporting the group in England and Wales were named on Thursday.Jeremy Shippam, 71, Judit Murray, 71, and Fiona Maclean, 53, have been charged with displaying an article in a public place, arousing reasonable suspicion that they are a supporter of a proscribed organisation after their attendance at a previous demonstration last month.Palestine Action was banned in June, days after activists from the group broke into RAF Brize Norton and defaced two military aircraft with spray paint. The ban means that membership of, or support for, Palestine Action is a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison under the Terrorism Act 2000.In a separate development, the government announced on Saturday it would send an additional £8.5m of aid to Gaza via a UN agency, a day after Keir Starmer said Israel’s expansion plans were “wrong” and “will only bring more bloodshed”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

His soft-touch approach isn’t working.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceShabana MahmoodLabourImmigration and asylumCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Protesters chanted “send them home” and “we want our country back”.View image in fullscreenAnti-immigration protest in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianOne man standing on a stage in front of about 400 people said: “England is doomed. You cannot stop it by protesting, the far right must unite.”He called upon the separate far-right organisations to come together in a group that should include Tommy Robinson, a far-right agitator whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.Robinson is on bail suspected of assaulting a man in St Pancras station.The protest, Nuneaton says No!, was organised by the extremist nationalist group Homeland party, whose activists unfurled a banner reading “Remigration NOW”, referring to the mass deportation of immigrants and those born in the UK with heritage from overseas.Many who attended said they were from the area and denied being far right.Meanwhile, Nazi imagery could be seen on T-shirts worn by a handful of people.Music blared from a loudspeaker, including Rule, Britannia! with the chorus loudly sung along to. The protest wound down by mid-afternoon as the music was switched off and many protesters, including most of the women, left.Some remained, drinking cans of beer and working themselves up against the police, whom they accused of covering up crimes by asylum seekers.When one officer agreed with a protester that the alleged rape of the child was a “horrific crime”, in an attempt to calm some agitated protesters, one shouted: “Horrific crime? Well let us protest then.”The officer responded: “We are letting you protest.”By late afternoon, the crowd had entirely dispersed. Later, some protesters could be seen taking turns to sing karaoke on the street outside the Wetherspoon’s pub.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sadly, teenagers in the UK and around the world have taken their own lives because of it.”The NCMEC data is significant as it is based on reports from online platforms and internet providers – such as Snapchat,Instagramand TikTok – rather than victims, who can be reluctant to disclose the abuse.Tech firms are obliged under US law to flag suspicious material to NCMEC. The figures show that Snapchat reported about 20,000 instances of concerning material – including sextortion and child sexual abuse images – in the first half of last year.This is more than the combined number of reports from Facebook, Instagram, TikTok,X(formerly known as Twitter), Google and Discord. It is understood that Snapchat revised its policies for reporting this content last year and that as a result, subsequent figures will be lower.Rani Govender, of the NSPCC, said sextortion and other financially motivated sexual crimes had a “devastating” impact on youngsters, affecting their ability to trust or seek help and in some cases leading to suicide.NCMEC said it was aware of “more than three dozen” teenage boys worldwide who had killed themselves after falling victim to sextortion since 2021.Govender said some tech firms were “inadvertently turning a blind eye to the abuse occurring on their watch” by introducing protections such as end-to-end encryption, which make it harder to spot harmful content.Unlike some other platforms, Snapchat does not have end-to-end encryption on its text-based chats.Police forces are increasingly concerned that predators are turning to ever more sophisticated attempts to target children online.The Guardian has uncovered a 101-page manual giving detailed instructions on how best to exploit young internet users, including advice on the best phones, encryption, apps and alter egos to use.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe dossier teaches users how to turn victims into “modern-day slaves” by acquiring explicit images before they then feel “compelled to comply with the extortionist’s demands”.The guide was allegedly produced by a 20-year-old man called Baron Martin from Arizona, US, who wasarrested by the FBIin December and calls himself “the king of extortion”. Martin claims it has been “the catalyst for thousands of extortions”, according to the US Department of Justice.According to researchers, the sextortion manual was distributed on a number of “Com networks” – online communities where mostly young men share sadistic and misogynistic material and encourage each other to commit crimes.Milo Comerford, of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) thinktank, said: “The continued accessibility of this kind of chillingly detailed sextortion guide points to the growing risk posed by toxic online communities that exploit and abuse children.”TheFBIhas identified scores of online gangs who collaborate to identify vulnerable victims before targeting them using a feigned romantic interest to obtain compromising photos.Those are then used to blackmail the victim to either provide further explicit images, self-harm, or carry out another act of violence or animal abuse.Comerford, of the ISD, said “robust multi-agency” safeguards were urgently required to build awareness of the risks of sextortion among young people, parents, guardians, teachers and others.He added: “These transnational networks are comprised of a constantly shifting landscape of groups that use social media platforms to identify, groom, and harm their victims, and in some cases engage in mass violence.”Snapchat and Facebook have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsOnline abuseChildrenSnapchatFacebookXSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

White died during Friday’s violence.The suspect’s father contacted police and said his son was upset about the death of his dog, and had also become fixated on the Covid-19 vaccine, an official said.One of White’s neighborstold the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: “He very deeply believed that vaccines hurt him and were hurting other people.”The police officer who was shot to death ina confrontationwith a gunman was identified as 33-year-old David Rose – a husband and father of two daughters who had a son on the way.Rose, who joined the DeKalb county police force in September of last year and previously served in the US marines, had responded to reports of gunfire near the CDC campus. He was later rushed to the Emory University hospital, where he died of his injuries.Georgia: suspected gunman and police officer dead after shooting near CDC and Emory UniversityRead moreAfter firing shots at the CDC campus near Emory University on Friday afternoon, White was found dead on the second floor of the pharmacy building. Authorities have not said if he was killed by police or took his own life.He was reported to be wearing a surgical mask and was armed with two handguns, a rifle and a shotgun, and he was carrying two backpacks filled with ammo,officials told CNN.The CDC director, Susan Monarez, confirmed that at least four buildings at the public health agency had been struck in the shooting, which began shortly before 5pm on Friday.“The active shooter incident near our campus today has understandably brought fear, anger and worry to all of us,” Monarez said in a message to CDC employees. “I want to express my deep appreciation for your professionalism and resilience during this time.”“We are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC’s Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose. We stand with his wife and three children and the entire CDC family,” the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr,postedonline on Saturday.But those words of sympathy from Kennedy, an avowed skeptic of vaccine safety, were rejected by a group of former CDC scientists, communicators, policy analysts and public health experts who were laid off by the Trump administration.“Kennedy is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC’s workforce through his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust,” Fired but Fighting, a group of former CDC employees who were laid off, said ina statement. “We don’t need thoughts and prayers. We need an administration that does not villainize federal workers who are just trying to do their job. We need a HHS Secretary who does not promote misinformation about science and vaccines.”Kennedy recently ordered the cutting of the budget for mRNA vaccine development. He said in a statement that the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) would terminate 22 mRNA vaccine development investments, suggesting the vaccines “fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu”. Critics said the decision was not grounded in science and pointed to evidence that the covid vaccines had saved millions of lives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Building 21, where the CDC director has her office, took much of the gunfire.TheAtlantapolice chief, Darin Schierbaum, said the department had received a call about an active shooter at about 4.50pm and arrived at the scene to find Rose critically injured.DeKalb county’s interim police chief, Greg Padrick, said Rose “was committed to serving the community” and requested prayers for “his family, his friends, his loved ones and the entire DeKalb county police department family”.The director of the FBI, Kash Patel, said Rose was a hero who “made the ultimate sacrifice”.“Pray for the family, friends, and colleagues of this hero who acted quickly to defend others and made the ultimate sacrifice,”Patel said in a post on X.The attack came as threats of violence against healthcare professionals in the US are on the rise.A survey byNational Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses in the US, found that 48% of the more than 2,000 responding nurses reported an increase in workplace violence.In December, UnitedHealthcare chief executive officerBrian Thompsonwas shot dead on a Manhattan street.

She served as the president of the National Organization for Women’s Los Angeles chapter from 1990 to 1996.

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent will serve as acting commissioner, making him the agency’s seventh leader this year.The outlet reported the Department of Homeland Security had sent the IRS a list of 40,000 names on Thursday that it suspects of being in the country illegally. DHS asked the tax service to crosscheck confidential taxpayer data to verify their addresses.The IRS reportedly responded that it was able to verify fewer than 3% of the names on the DHS list, and mostly names that came with an individual taxpayer identification, or ITIN number, provided by DHS.Administration officials then requested information on the taxpayers the IRS identified, which the service declined to do, citing taxpayer privacy rights.The White House has identified the IRS as a component of itscrackdown on illegal immigrationand hopes that the tax agency help locate as many as 7 million people in the US without authorization. In April, homeland security struck adata sharing agreementwith the treasury department – which oversees the IRS.But Long appears to have resisted acting on that agreement, saying the IRS would not hand over confidential taxpayer information outside its statutory obligation to the treasury.Trump removes IRS commissioner Billy Long two months after he was sworn inRead moreWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson rejected the notion that the IRS was not in harmony with administration priorities.“Any absurd assertion other than everyone being aligned on the mission is simply false and totally fake news,” Johnson told the Post. “TheTrump administrationis working in lockstep to eliminate information silos and to prevent illegal aliens from taking advantage of benefits meant for hardworking American taxpayers,” she added.In fact, undocumented immigrants paid $96.7bn in federal, state and local taxes in 2022, including $59.4bn to the federal government, helping to fund social security and Medicare, despite being excluded from most benefits, according toan analysisfrom the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy thinktank.DHS told the Post that its agreement with IRS “outlines a process to ensure that sensitive taxpayer information is protected, while allowing law enforcement to effectively pursue criminal violations”.Pressure on federal agencies to conform to administration priorities has also led to pressures on the Census Bureau to conduct a mid-decade population review as well as thefiringof Bureau of Labor head last week after it published a unfavorable job report.After being dismissed on Friday, Long, aformer six-termMissouri congressman, said that he would be the new US ambassador to Iceland.“It is a honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland,”Long said in post on X.“I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!”He followed that up with a morehumorous entrythat referred to former TV Superman actor Dean Cain’s decision, at 59,to jointo the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency.“I saw where Former Superman actor Dean Cain says he’s joining ICE so I got all fired up and thought I’d do the same.

This ends (for now) years of speculation over what might be done withParamount, a global conglomerate that was nonetheless considered on less sure footing than its fellow remaining big five studios, Disney, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros. (Well, maybe not the recently embattled Warner Bros, though they seem to have gotten a major reprieve with their killer 2025 slate) Skydance honcho David Ellison is the new Paramount CEO. The new co-chairs of Paramount Pictures will be Skydance executive Dana Goldberg and former Sony executive Josh Greenstein.Cancelling Colbert, bribery, an $8bn deal: what’s going on at Paramount?Read moreBut with Ellison at the top boasting years of Skydance experience, he’ll ultimately be determining Paramount’s fortunes as a movie and TV company. The son of billionaire Larry Ellison, David for years seemed like he got into the movies primarily to work in closer proximity to airplanes. His first film as a producer was the 2005 flop Flyboys, a world war one fighter-pilot drama that was an early strike against the burgeoning movie career of star James Franco. Undeterred, the next year he founded Skydance Media, the kind of thing a 23-year-old budding pilot can do if they happen also to be a billionaire’s son.Over the years, the company co-financed a number of big Paramount productions. They didn’t all or even mostly involve fighter planes, but they did include big Paramount brands (Mission: Impossible, Star Trek), would-be franchise-starters and restarters (Jack Reacher, Jack Ryan, a couple of Terminators) and, in what Ellison must have considered his crowning achievement,Top Gun: Maverick, for which he received a best picture nomination as one of the film’s producers. So does this indicate that Paramount will move towards makingTop Guneven more of a signature title, the platonic ideal of billion-dollar nostalgia franchise with ample access to expensive fighter planes?View image in fullscreenA young David Ellison promoting Flyboys in 2006.Photograph: Max Morse/ReutersMaybe. In some ways, the Skydance merger isn’t as grim as other corporate acquisitions in this field. Ellison is just 42, which sets him apart from someone likeBob Iger(who recently unretired in his 70s and still hasn’tset a proper successor). The deal also doesn’t consolidate Paramount under another studio’s umbrella, the way that 20th Century Fox went from storied, century-old cinema legacy to Disney shingle that mostly revives franchises from its catalog and produces lower-budget offerings directly for streaming. (This was a possibility for Paramount; Sony was apparentlylooking at acquiring them.) Nor does the merger put another movie studio under the control of a tech company. Though it’s not exactly known for an art-forward sensibility – like, say, Annapurna, the more prestigious movie company that David’s sister, Megan, founded in 2011 – Skydance is still mainly an entertainment firm.What, then, might be expected from Paramount in the Skydance era? The relative narrowness of previous Skydance operations suggests an ongoing ignorance about how to run other aspects of the business, such as thenews division of CBS. Ellison has talked a bit about keeping CBS trustworthy and independent, but a leading 60 Minutes produceralready quit, pre-merger, over pre-merger interference from Paramount. Ellison also made comments about most people identifying as “center-right” or “center-left”, a thinking that suggests he’s looking at journalism in terms of pleasing his audience, rather than doing reporting that might prompt baseless charges of bias. Less of an ethical challenge but central to the Paramount business is the ongoing dip in value of the company’s signature cable brands – they own MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and Showtime, among others – which other companies have dealt with by spinning off into separate entities. But these channels are arguably more tied into Paramount’s identity; Nickelodeon, for example, has provided a steady stream of movie hits in addition to TV franchises. They will probably stay put for now (though that won’t protect them from layoffs). Between those brands and the company’s seeming political triangulating, it seems likely that the importance of Taylor Sheridan, whose universe of centrist-appeal western shows does so well in traditional TV terms, will only increase.Despite that cable legacy, streaming and “non-linear” TV are said to be a priority for the company, with Ellison mentioning a dedication to premium streaming-only movies and shows in hisday-one open letter. Though Skydance had some success working on big-picture theatrical franchises for Paramount, their branched-out efforts to provide content for various streaming services has been more typical of that arena – that is, often expensive but somehow still low-rent.Ghosted,Heart of Stone,6 Underground… several of the interchangeable streaming caper/spy movies that feel more like mockbusters than events have Skydance’s name on them. They often feel, in fact, like knockoffs of the movies Paramount might have made for theaters in the 2000s and 2010s. Skydance also attempted to start their own animation studio by employing the disgraced former Pixar head John Lasseter, which so far has resulted in the twin embarrassments ofLuck(on Apple TV+) andSpellbound(on Netflix). The company does have an animated project from the Incredibles creator Brad Bird in the works, as well as a cartoon called, uh, Pookoo. They’re also shooting a live-action project called Matchbox. This is not a code name. It is based on the toy cars.View image in fullscreenDirector James Mangold and Timothée Chalamet on the set of A Complete Unknown.Photograph: Macall Polay/Searchlight PicturesThose movies won’t be on the Paramount slate, but they could be indicative of where the corporate heads are at when it comes time to rebuild the movie studio. Ellison may not be a tech CEO, but his billionaire dad is; Larry Ellisonco-founded Oracle. That mix of established money and a vaguely tech-forward outlook could turn out to be recent-big-business as usual. The real question mark regarding Skydance is how (or if) they might handle the stuff that doesn’t involve blatant imitating or trend-chasing that every big studio does. (Has any movie studio undergoing a shift in the past decade declared an intention not to leverage a bunch of supposedly valuable old IP?) Recent past periods of creativity flourishing at Paramount seemed almost accidental. In the mid-to-late 2010s, for example, the studio had a few years where they made or distributed Denis Villeneuve’sArrival, Richard Linklater’sEverybody Wants Some!!, Alexander Payne’sDownsizing, Darren Aronofsky’sMother!, Martin Scorsese’sSilence, and Denzel Washington’sFences, among others, boldly supporting movies made by and for thinking adults. (They also made some pretty decent franchise movies with Skydance, such asStar Trek Beyondand several Mission: Impossible entries.)It doesn’t seem like Skydance’s first priority it would be replicating any of those grownup movies, even a hit like Arrival. Yet it is hopeful that thefirst announced Paramount Pictures dealbrokered by Goldberg and Greenstein is a James Mangold-directed, Timothée Chalamet-starring original film called High Side – in other words, an old-fashioned, A-list-director-and-star combination. Maybe Ellison and his lieutenants are able to reach back to more Paramount-specific projects – their thrillers of the 70s, the star-driven comedies of the 80s and 90s, the surprise inventiveness of their affiliation with MTV films – and do a little more than play with Matchbox cars and fighter jets.Explore more on these topicsParamount PicturesUS televisionTelevisionFilm industryTimothée ChalametTop GunCBSfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That was how Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, described the latest upgrade to ChatGPT this week.The race Altman was referring to was artificial general intelligence (AGI), a theoretical state of AI where, by OpenAI’s definition, a highly autonomous system is able to do a human’s job.Describing the new GPT-5 model, which will powerChatGPT, as a “significant step on the path to AGI”, he nonetheless added a hefty caveat.“[It is] missing something quite important, many things quite important,” said Altman, such as the model’s inability to “continuously learn” even after its launch. In other words, these systems are impressive but they have yet to crack the autonomy that would allow them to do a full-time job.OpenAI’s competitors, also flush with billions of dollars to lavish on the same goal, are straining for the tape too. Last month, Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook parentMeta, said development of superintelligence – another theoretical state of AI where a system far exceeds human cognitive abilities – is “now in sight”.OpenAI takes on Meta and DeepSeek with free and customisable AI modelsRead moreGoogle’s AI unit on Tuesday outlined its next step to AGI by announcing anunreleased modelthat trains AIs to interact with a convincing simulation of the real world, while Anthropic, another company making significant advances, announced an upgrade to its Claude Opus 4 model.So where does this leave the race to AGI and superintelligence?Benedict Evans, a tech analyst, says the race towards a theoretical state of AI is taking place against a backdrop of scientific uncertainty – despite the intellectual and financial investment in the quest.Describing AGI as a “thought experiment as much as it is a technology”, he says: “We don’t really have a theoretical model of why generative AI models work so well and what would have to happen for them to get to this state of AGI.”He adds: “It’s like saying ‘we’re building the Apollo programme but we don’t actually know how gravity works or how far away the moon is, or how a rocket works, but if we keep on making the rocket bigger maybe we’ll get there’.“To use the term of the moment, it’s very vibes-based. All of these AI scientists are really just telling us what their personal vibes are on whether we’ll reach this theoretical state – but they don’t know. And that’s what sensible experts say too.”However, Aaron Rosenberg, a partner at venture capital firm Radical Ventures – whose investments include leading AI firm Cohere – and former head of strategy and operations at Google’s AI unit DeepMind, says a more limited definition of AGI could be achieved around the end of the decade.“If you define AGI more narrowly as at least 80th percentile human-level performance in 80% of economically relevant digital tasks, then I think that’s within reach in the next five years,” he says.Matt Murphy, a partner at VC firm Menlo Ventures, says the definition of AGI is a “moving target”.He adds: “I’d say the race will continue to play out for years to come and that definition will keep evolving and the bar being raised.”Even without AGI, the generative AI systems in circulation are making money. The New York Timesreported this monththat OpenAI’s annual recurring revenue has reached $13bn (£10bn), up from $10bn earlier in the summer, and could pass $20bn by the year end. Meanwhile, OpenAI is reportedly in talks about a sale of shares held by current and former employees that would value it at about $500bn,exceeding the price tag for Elon Musk’s SpaceX.Some experts view statements about superintelligent systems as creating unrealistic expectations, while distracting from more immediate concerns such as making sure that systems being deployed now are reliable, transparent and free of bias.“The rush to claim ‘superintelligence’ among the major tech companies reflects more about competitive positioning than actual technical breakthroughs,” says David Bader, director of the institute for data science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From a technical standpoint, we’re seeing impressive improvements in specific capabilities – better reasoning, more sophisticated planning, enhanced multimodal understanding.“But superintelligence, properly defined, would represent systems that exceed human performance across virtually all cognitive domains. We’re nowhere near that threshold.”Nonetheless, the major US tech firms will keep trying to build systems that match or exceed human intelligence at most tasks. Google’s parent Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon alone will spend nearly $400bn this year on AI,according to the Wall Street Journal, comfortably more thanEU members’ defence spend.Rosenberg acknowledges he is a former Google DeepMind employee but says the company has big advantages in data, hardware, infrastructure and an array of products to hone the technology, from search to maps and YouTube. But advantages can be slim.“On the frontier, as soon as an innovation emerges, everyone else is quick to adopt it. It’s hard to gain a huge gap right now,” he says.It is also a global race, or rather a contest, that includes China.DeepSeekcame from nowhere this year to announce the DeepSeek R1 model, boasting of “powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviours” comparable with OpenAI’s best work.Major companies looking to integrate AI into their operations have taken note. Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, uses DeepSeek’s AI technology in its main datacentre and said it was “really making a big difference” to its IT systems and was making the company more efficient.According to Artificial Analysis, a company that ranks AI models, six of the top 20 on its leaderboard – which ranks models according to a range of metrics including intelligence, price and speed – are Chinese. The six models are developed by DeepSeek, Zhipu AI, Alibaba and MiniMax. On the leaderboard for video generation models, six of the top 10 – including the current leader, ByteDance’s Seedance – are also Chinese.Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, whose company has barred use of DeepSeek, told a US senate hearing in May that getting your AI model adopted globally was a key factor in determining which country wins the AI race.“The number one factor that will define whether the US or China wins this race is whose technology is most broadly adopted in the rest of the world,” he said, adding that the lesson from Huawei and 5G was that whoever establishes leadership in a market is “difficult to supplant”.It means that, arguments over the feasibility of superintelligent systems aside, vast amounts of money and talent are being poured into this race in the world’s two largest economies – and tech firms will keep running.“If you look back five years ago to 2020 it was almost blasphemous to say AGI was on the horizon. It was crazy to say that. Now it seems increasingly consensus to say we are on that path,” says Rosenberg.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingOpenAIChatGPTSam AltmanMetaAlphabetanalysisShareReuse this content"

She enjoyed a quiet first inning, watching as Braves right-hander Hurston Waldrep struck out the first two batters before Agustin Ramirez lined out to third baseman Nacho Alvarez.The Braves also were set down in order by Miami right-hander Ryan Gusto in the bottom of the first inning, with no calls from Pawol needed at first base.As the first base umpire, Pawol’s responsibility was to check Waldrep’s hands for foreign substances following the inning. During that brief encounter she also appeared to receive a warm greeting from Braves catcher Sean Murphy on his way to the dugout.Pawol’s first real test came in the third inning when she called Braves catcher Sean Murphy safe on a close play. Replays indicated Murphy may have been out, but Marlins manager Clayton McCullough did not challenge the call.Pawol also showed she will make animated calls. When Miami’s Xavier Edwards grounded into a double play, Pawol pumped her fist and lifted her leg when she called Edwards out in the third inning.Pawol couldn’t help but notice her debut was being watched closely. Fans responded with a warm ovation when the video board focused on the umpire between innings, forcing her to take a quick glance at her image.Pawol will work third base in Saturday night’s second game of the doubleheader. She will be in the spotlight when she calls pitches behind the plate in Sunday’s final game of the series.There was much anticipation for her historic debut on Saturday. A crowd of photographers gathered while waiting for the umpires to walk onto the field from their entry ramp near the Marlins dugout.View image in fullscreenJen Pawol, second from right, poses with fellow umpires David Rackley, Chris Guccione and Chad Whitson before the first pitch of Saturday’s double-header in Atlanta.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAMcCullough and Braves bench coach Walt Weiss greeted Pawol when lineups were exchanged at home plate before the game. Pawol then jogged down the first base line. She shook hands with Marlins first base coach Tyler Smarslok before taking her position on the right field line for the first pitch.Pawol said Thursday she was “overcome with emotion” when notified she would make her Major LeagueBaseballdebut this weekend.“It was super emotional to finally be living that phone call that I’d been hoping for and working towards for quite a while, and I just felt super full – I feel like a fully charged battery ready to go,” Pawol said.Pawol, 48, has been working in the minor leagues since she was assigned to the Gulf Coast League in 2016. She was assigned the Triple-A championship game in 2023 and worked spring training games in 2024 and again this year.Pawol, who is from New Jersey, had only a few days to prepare for Saturday’s doubleheader. She said she was told of her long-awaited promotion during a Wednesday conference call with director of umpire development Rich Rieker and vice president of umpire operations Matt McKendry.Pawol was a three-time all-conference softball selection pick at Hofstra. She worked as an NCAA softball umpire from 2010-16.Pawol’s rise to makeMLBhistory came 28 years after the NBA gender barrier for game officials was broken and 10 years after the NFL hired its first full-time female official. The men’s soccer World Cup first hired a female referee three years ago. The NHL has not had any women as on-ice officials.Explore more on these topicsMLBAtlanta BravesMiami MarlinsBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

During a stroll on tournament grounds he reels off the names of players he competes with regularly on the tour. “Now they’re at a position where I have wars with them and go back and forth. So this is great, man. It’s great to see,” he says. “And then you have Giovanni [Mpetshi Perricard], you have Gaël [Monfils], who I looked up to.”Seconds after Tiafoe mentions his name, Monfils suddenly appears from around a corner as if magically summoned by the American’s utterance. His arrival naturally leads to a pause in this interview as an excited Tiafoe greets Monfils by heaping praise on his new haircut, particularly focusing his attention on the Frenchman’s sleek fade. Monfils responds with a compliment of his own: “You’re looking like a wedding day,” he says, laughing.Victoria Mboko’s Montreal magic: the Canadian teen who toppled four grand slam championsRead moreThis encounter perfectly encapsulates the dynamic between two different generations of black players in a sport where their success immediately marks them as trailblazers. Although they step on to the court with the sole intention of beating each other, there is also a deep understanding between them and they are extremely supportive.“He texts me all the time,” says Tiafoe. “He tells me, like: ‘Yo, you can do this.’ Don’t get it twisted, when he plays he still wants to beat my ass and so do I, but it’s just a lot of love.”Tiafoe, at No 14 in the rankings is the third-highest ranked US man behind Taylor Fritz, the world No 4, and Ben Shelton, who won the Toronto Masters 1000 on Thursday night, but in terms of name recognition the 27-year-old has become the most prominent US male tennis player in years.His matches attract NBA stars like Kevin Durant, hebreaks bread with Taylor Swiftand hasearned a fan in Michelle Obama. In recent weeks Tiafoe has been name-dropped in songs from the rap duo Clipse and the rapper Wale.“I still think he’s the player on tour with the most clout, like every celebrity knows him, or he knows every celebrity. He’s mentioned in two rap songs, so he’s pretty iconic,” says Coco Gauff, laughing.Tiafoe, for his part, believes his burgeoning profile underlines the importance of tennis reaching beyond its traditional audience: “Just to be able to be in a position where I get crossover, people want to be a part of things I’m doing in a predominantly white sport. They see themselves in me, in the sport, and they want to get behind me. Hopefully I’m able to get that done,” he says.There is also simply nobody like Tiafoe. His extroverted character and bluntness can be abrasive to some spectators, but he is kind, warm and has time for everyone. Laughter is never far from his lips, which makes his energy infectious. He has also deliberately made a point of using his platform to promote female athletes. When he is not playing, he is often at WNBA games and he wears player jerseys throughout the tennis season during practice. He is friends with many female basketball players.View image in fullscreenFrances Tiafoe at Wimbledon in 2025.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I think [female athletes] just need to get their flowers,” says Tiafoe. “They put in the work, just like we do. They just need to be getting their love, their notoriety, their compensation. Let them smell their flowers. That’s kind of what it is. And I think more women should support women, to be honest with you, because it’s a beautiful thing. It’s not just me showing up and supporting it. It’s me showing up and watching a good product.”In addition to his support for women’s sport, Tiafoe has also actively tried to help certain female tennis players follow in his path. His success has paved the way for others at the JuniorTennisChampions Center (JTCC), his childhood tennis club near Washington DC, particularly the WTA players Hailey Baptiste and Robin Montgomery. This year, while also working with Franklin Tiafoe, Frances’s twin brother, Baptiste has enjoyed a breakout season, reaching the top 50. Both players cite Tiafoe as a mentor they have constantly sought advice from and he has tried to be on hand to help them in any way he can. He takes great pride in their success.“I’m still young – I’ve still got a lot more to achieve. I still haven’t scratched the surface of my career. But with them, I’ve already won in so many ways,” says Tiafoe. “So it’s kind of how you look at the glass, but it’s amazing to be in that seat. It’s a blessing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionDuring tournaments, Tiafoe can sometimes be found training with other female players, which is still an unusual sight. He describes Jessica Pegula as his favourite training partner on the WTA: “She hits the ball so pure and right in pocket every time,” he says. “She’s pretty relaxed as well. But she doesn’t want to hit with me any more. She’s made some finals now in some slams, 1000s, and she doesn’t want to talk to me as much any more. She got too big time for me. She forgot about the little people.”Such is his jovial nature, Tiafoe is often the butt of jokes among his friends on the tour. They tease him for his questionable organisational skills, his lack of punctuality and his general unseriousness. His driving has also come under fire. Offered a platform to defend himself against his friends’ scorn, Tiafoe smiles. “I just recently got my license, so I was definitely shaky in the early days, probably when they were saying it,” says Tiafoe. “But I’m definitely nice [at driving]. I’m definitely [Lewis] Hamilton 2.0 behind the wheel so I don’t worry too much about it.”Ben Shelton rallies to beat Karen Khachanov in Toronto for biggest title of careerRead moreThe story of Tiafoe’s past has already been told countless times, but it can never be repeated enough. The son of Sierra Leonean parents who immigrated to the United States, Tiafoe spent much of his formative years at the JTCC, where his father worked as a janitor.He has defied almost impossible odds to establish himself as one of the best tennis players in the world. After reaching his second grand slam semi-final at the US Open last year,when he lost to Fritzin five sets in heartbreaking fashion, this year Tiafoe will attempt to rediscover the magic on courts that have regularly inspired his best.Regardless of what awaits him as he enters the prime years of his career, however, it is obvious that in many ways Tiafoe has already won.“I’d tell guys from the [club] that I’d want to be a pro,” says Tiafoe. “They would just clown and not take it seriously. I was always like: ‘Don’t worry, man. I’m going to be the last person laughing.’ Here we are today.”Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

They’ve made their way online through social media and other postings.A club fighter, Jacob Solis, is in the ring with a world-class fighter named Marquis Taylor. Both men are wearing headgear. Solis is under the impression that this is a sparring session. Taylor has been incentivized to treat the encounter as something more.Solis is staggered by a roundhouse right to the side of his head. Lurching forward, defenseless, he’s punched hard again; this time by an illegal blow to the back of his head. As he slumps forward, a third roundhouse right – also to the back of his head – drives him to the canvas. There’s no referee. No one helps Solis as he struggles to rise and staggers toward a corner.The overflow crowd loves it. The blow-by-blow commentator calling the livestream, watched by thousands of viewers, sounds enthralled.Welcome to Sparring Club.Sparring Club is the creation of BoxRaw, a British company that sells men’s and women’s apparel and combat sports equipment. Sparring Club is important branding for BoxRaw. Itswebsitefeatures a full-screen video that shows two men in a boxing ring with the superimposed legend: “SPARRING CLUB: THIS IS KILL OR BE KILLED.”Recently, BoxRaw entered into a partnership with The Ring, which is owned byTurki al-Sheikh, the most powerful force in boxing.On 11 July, BoxRaw and The Ring promoted a Sparring Club event at the Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse in Brooklyn. Posts on social media advertised the date, time and site, promised free entry for fans, and described the event as follows: “Live Pro Sparring from New York’s Top Prospects … Raw, Handpicked, Dog Eat Dog … Two fighters competing will be selected to fight on the Canelo vs Crawford undercard.”View image in fullscreenAn advertisement for the Sparring Club event on 11 July in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn.Photograph: BoxRawThe social media posts served the dual purpose of attracting fans and recruiting fighters. A post by trainer Eric Kelly (who served as BoxRaw’s point person on the ground on the night of the event) declared, “Slots is slimming up. There’s only a few slots left. I’m only looking for killers! Professional. Who man enough to hop in? You say you can fight right? Let me know!”View image in fullscreenNew York trainer Eric Kelly served as BoxRaw’s point person on the ground for the Sparring Club event on 11 July.Photograph: Eric Kelly’s InstagramA New York trainer who was at the event later told the Guardian, “Eric Kelly called and told me he was hosting a sparring session that was sponsored by BoxRaw and The Ring and I should tell any pros I have in the gym that it’s a big opportunity. If they look good, maybe they can get a spot on the Canelo-Crawford show. So right there; that tells you it won’t really be sparring. It’s more like a tryout to be on a team. You want to make an impression and leave a mark. And you do that by knocking the other guy out.”On 14 June, USABoxing, which oversees amateur boxing in the United States, sent a memorandum to its members in the New York metropolitan area. The memo noted that USA Boxing had received reports of “an unsanctioned boxing event” titled “Sparring Club Presents: Dog City, NYC” and reminded members that:(1) “Sparring as entertainment, which includes sparring events of any capacity, is prohibited as outlined in the USA Boxing Sanction Manual.”(2)“A USA Boxing athlete member shall not box in any boxing competition that is not sanctioned under USA Boxing.”(3)“Any boxer, coach or official who participates in an unsanctioned or unregulated combat sport is ineligible to participate in competition as an athlete or non-athlete member of USA Boxing.”The memorandum closed with the declaration, “USA Boxing takes the participation in unsanctioned events very seriously, as these events may jeopardize one’s standing with USA Boxing while placing innocent lives at risk.”A 10 July email to all USA Boxing members titled“Important Notice: Participation in Unsanctioned Dog City Sparring Event” elaborated on that warning and read in part: “It has come to our attention that an unsanctioned sparring event operating under the name ‘Dog City’ is circulating within our boxing community. We must strongly advise all USA Boxing members not to participate in this event or any similar activity that is not sanctioned by USA Boxing. Unsanctioned events do not carry the required safety protocols, oversight, or insurance coverage that protect our athletes, coaches, and officials. These events compromise the standards we uphold as the National Governing Body of Olympic-style amateur boxing in the United States.”Faced with this obstacle, BoxRaw declared that all of the event participants would either be professionals or have the intention to turn pro and would never fight as an amateur again. That solved one regulatory issue but led to another.All professional boxing activity in the State of New York is subject to regulation by the New York State Athletic Commission. More specifically, the New York General Business Law states, “The conduct of combative sports outside the supervision of the commission or an authorized sanctioning entity is prohibited.”The NYSAC Rules and Regulations as they relate to professional fights require:(1) Pre-fight medical examinations for all combatants.(2) At least one commission-designated doctor and at least one ambulance with medical personnel consisting of at least one paramedic with appropriate resuscitation equipment to be continuously present at ringside.(3) A post-fight medical evaluation of each combatant by an on-site commission-designated physician immediately following each match.Additionally, promoters are required to provide medical insurance for both amateur and professional combat sports events.Sparring Club took the position that it was not subject to these requirements since its event would consist of “sparring” rather than actual fights. But the General Business Law includes “sparring” as a regulated combat sport that must be conducted under the supervision of the commission, albeit with fewer requirements. And the law specifically requires that any entity involved in the conduct of professional sparring first procure a license from the commission. For example, gyms where fighters train are required to have a sparring license.BoxRaw submitted an application for a sparring license to the New York State Athletic Commission well in advance. But some of material necessary to finalize the application wasn’t submitted until the day of the event, adding an element of uncertainty to the proceedings.The event itself was a huge draw. In addition to the in-ring activity, fans were drawn to the Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse by the promise of free pizza, ice cream, and tickets to the following night’s fights at Louis Armstrong Stadium which would includeEdgar Berlanga v Hamzah Sheerazand Shakur Stevenson v William Zepeda. One boxing veteran recounts, “I was shocked when we got to the terminal. There was a line several blocks long of people waiting to get in. And when we got inside, the place was packed.”Inside the terminal warehouse, the atmosphere was festive. Turki al-Sheikh was there with promoter Eddie Hearn andRing Magazine CEO Rick Reeno, who is among Sheikh’s most trusted boxing advisors. Hearn left early to attend the fight betweenKatie Taylor and Amanda Serranoat Madison Square Garden. His companions stayed a bit longer.There was a lot of security outside the ring. Inside the ropes, security was lax.Trainer Andre Rozier looks back on the event and says, “It was something new and different. They had, I think it was 26 sparring sessions. Guys were supposed to go three two-minute rounds with 16-ounce gloves. I had six guys there.”Calvin Ford, the trainer who guidedGervonta Davisto stardom, arrived with a van full of fighters from the Washington DC area.There were no women on the card.“There were a lot of fights or sparring or whatever you want to call it,” says a New York trainer who was at the event. “Some of it was sparring. And some of it was fighting. One problem was, some guys were there to spar and didn’t know the guy they were in with was there to fight. And the matchmaking was set up wrong. There was a lot of mismatches. Jacob should never have fought the guy he was in with. Kurt Scoby was in with a guy who had, maybe, 10 amateur fights. I talked one of my fighters out of it when we got there.”The event was streamed live by The Ring. Some combatants had cornermen. Others didn’t. Eric Kelly served as timekeeper and called the action for fans inside the terminal warehouse.During some of the early fights, a man wearing a blue T-shirt and light-colored slacks was in the ring and told the fighters to break a few times.“But he wasn’t really refereeing,” a member of the on-site production team recalls. “Just keeping the action going. Then someone decided that having him in the ring made it look too much like fights – which they weren’t allowed to do – so they took him out.”In theory, two slots on the Canelo-Crawford undercard were up for grabs.Kurt Scoby is a quality fighter; a puncher with 15 knockouts and 17 wins in 18 pro bouts. He was matched against Mike Austin, a fighter who had yet to have a professional fight. Scoby knocked Austin down hard. But when Austin rose, Scoby backed off and didn’t press his advantage. That was the right thing to do.Other “sparring” was fought to the finish.James Yarborough from Brooklyn has never had a pro fight. BoxRec.com lists his amateur record as 0-and-1 (the loss being a walkover when he was unable to compete in a scheduled bout). Josh Popper used to spar with Yarborough and was the beneficiary of that walkover.“I know James,” Popper says. “He’s a nice guy. But I’ve never seen him win a fight.”Yarborough was matched against a professional from Baltimore named Ehijele Ubuane, a relative novice with modest skills who is trained by Ford. The first two rounds might have been sparring. Round three was a fight with Yarborough being pummeled and Ubuane’s corner urging him on, exultant when the fight was stopped.“It was fun,” Rozier says. “The fighters enjoyed it. The crowd enjoyed it. People had a good time.”Jacob Solis didn’t have a good time.Marquis Taylor was born, raised, and lives in Texas. He’s 31 years old and has been fighting professionally for 12 years. His record stands at 18-1-2 and he’s ranked as the No 13 middleweight in the world by the World Boxing Council.Solis, age 33, has been fighting for 19 months and has accumulated a 7-0-1 ledger against fighters who are opponents for opponents. The seven men he beat have a composite ring record of two wins against 31 losses with 22 “KOs by” in their most recent 33 outings.Think of Taylor and Solis in terms of the difference between a ranked football team from a Power Five conference and a team from the lower echelons of the Ivy League. Wins and losses don’t tell the story of the difference between them.View image in fullscreenTurki al-Sheikh, left, chairman of Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Entertainment, is the most powerful force in boxing today.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesBobby Harrison, Taylor’s manager, told the Guardian, “I wasn’t there. Marquis saw something about it on Instagram; that Turki was giving away opportunities to fight on the Canelo-Crawford undercard. I didn’t even know he was going. He jumped on a plane with his father, who’s his trainer, got there, set his bag down, and went almost directly into the ring.”Solis’s participation was also arranged without input from his manager. A member of Jacob’s team says that Pardeep Singh, a brand director and production director for BoxRaw, contacted Solis directly to make the fight.Solis went to the Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse expecting a sparring session with an equivalent-level fighter. Late in the afternoon, he learned who he’d be in the ring with.“Two young women were making the matchups based on approximate weight,” a friend of Solis’s says. “But there was no weigh-in. There wasn’t any medical examination either.”Nor was there a third man in the ring for the Taylor-Solis encounter.“It wasn’t sparring,” a trainer who was onsite recalls. “Sometimes, when a fighter is preparing for a fight, you have hard sparring that feels like fighting. But if a fighter is hurt, the guy who hurt him backs off. That’s what Kurt Scoby did with his guy. Taylor didn’t.”Wade Plemons was the lead commentator for The Ring’svideo stream. An excerpt from that stream has been posted on YouTube with the title “INSANE Sparring in Brooklyn! BOXRAW x The Ring Sparring Club.” The Solis knockout segment starts atthe 5:06 mark of that excerpt.“Look at that left hook,” Plemons shouts. “It’s all Taylor on offense right now. A right hand. Ooooooh! Oh, my goodness. That right there, folks; it’s going to be the end of this sparring session.”As Solis staggers to his feet and wobbles to a corner with no assistance of any kind, a voice is heard shouting in the background, “Get the fuck in the ring. Why y’all ain’t getting in the ring!”Had the session been a properly regulated fight, Taylor would likely have been disqualified for deliberate flagrant fouls.Solis received no medical attention after he was knocked out.“There was a woman walking around with ‘EMT’ on her shirt,” an acquaintance of Solis says. “But when Jacob went down, we couldn’t find her. He went back to the dressing room. No one came back to ask if he was OK. He got dressed, got in an Uber with a friend, and went home.”Meanwhile, after Taylor knocked Solis out, Taylor went to the ropes, looked out at the crowd, and shouted, “Where you at, Turki? Where you at? I’m right here. I’m the one you’ve been looking for, baby.”Bobby Harrison defends his fighter’s conduct, citing the promise that two fighters who participated in the event would be selected to fight on the Canelo-Crawford undercard.“This was the opportunity of a lifetime for Marquis,” Harrison says. “No one will fight him. He hasn’t lost in 10 years. He’s a high-risk, low-reward opponent. He has this great opportunity in front of Turki al-Sheikh to put himself on the biggest card in a decade and he gave it everything. If you are going to create a winner-takes-all gladiator contest, then I suggest you have someone in the ring with those guys to ensure their safety as they are all fighting for a life-changing opportunity.”Solis could be forgiven if he has a different point of view. He was unprotected before, during and after his Sparring Club ring encounter. A neurologist he saw several days later confirmed that he had suffered a concussion. A 25 July fight that Jacob had scheduled for Atlantic City was canceled. It’s unclear when he’ll be medically cleared to fight again.Old-time boxing fans talk fondly about the “Philly gym wars” of the past. But those fabled sparring sessions in Philadelphia gyms were waged largely between evenly matched fighters. There’s no honor in a world-ranked fighter beating up a novice.And consider the possible consequences. Suppose Solis had suffered a brain bleed or, worse, wound up in a coma. The potential financial liability incurred by BoxRaw’s Sparring Club would have been enormous. And the toll in human suffering would have been greater.Josh Popper, a close friend of Solis, was invited to participate in the Sparring Club event but chose not to attend.“I don’t have much to say about it because I wasn’t there,” Popper told the Guardian. “But I will say that, in sparring, you’re not looking for knockouts. There’s different levels of sparring. Sometimes there’s an understanding that you’ll be going hard. Sometimes it’s about timing and working on things you’re trying to develop. And you might have a one-punch flash knockout. Those things happen. That’s just the way it is. But this wasn’t a one-punch flash knockout. Jacob went there with the intention of sparring. The other guy? You tell me.”Several days after the Sparring Club event, Samantha McEachin, counsel for the New York State Athletic Commission, sent an inquiry letter to Pardeep Singh, asking inter alia for a list of participants, injuries and all available videos of the action. Singh did not respond to two requests from the Guardian for an interview to discuss the event.The NYSAC might determine that no rules, regulations or statutes were broken. Alternatively, it could issue fines, suspend or revoke licenses, or refer the matter to the New York State Attorney General for civil proceedings.The event was poorly organized from a safety point of view. There were instances where the combatants were mismatched. There was no third man in the ring to properly protect either participant. Common-sense medical safeguards were non-existent. The key legal issue will be where the commission draws the line between sparring and fighting.Meanwhile, after the event, BoxRaw posted numerous “Sparring Club” clips on social media.“Respect isn’t given,” the narrator of one clip says. “It’s earned in blood.”On 30 July, Box Raw posted an invitation for “the Middle East’s top prospects” to appear at a new Sparring Club event to be held in Riyadh on 15 August with the lure of “food, drinks, chaos” and the promise that “1 fighter will be scouted for a Ring Magazine undercard.”“No crown without blood,” the post pledged.View image in fullscreenAn advertisement on social media for a forthcoming Sparring Club event in Riyadh.Photograph: BoxRawAnd on 30 July, Bobby Harrison told the Guardian, “We just got an offer for Marquis to fight in Las Vegas during fight week for Canelo-Crawford. The details haven’t been worked out yet, but I think it will happen.”Thomas Hauser’s email address isthomashauserwriter@gmail.com.

Hugo Ekitiké! Milos Kerkez! Jérémie Frimpong! And soon, possibly, Alexander Isak! It’s vital, Bob Paisley always said, to build from a position of strength, andLiverpoolthis summer have certainly done that.If Isak does join, Liverpool’s transfer spending this summer will be approaching £400m, which would be the second-highest figure paid by any club in a single transfer window (behind only Chelsea in summer 2023) – the lack of signings last summer coupled with some canny sales has given them significant profitability and sustainability rules headroom.Liverpool should be title favourites but not because of spending, insists SlotRead moreIf there is a giddiness on Merseyside at the prospect, it’s understandable. Liverpool suddenly have a range of attacking options the like of which no Premier League club has had since perhaps the early days of Roman Abramovich at Chelsea. If pre-season games are anything to go by, it would seem there will be a shift from the 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 hybrid of last season to something more overtly 4-2-3-1, with Mohamed Salah, Wirtz and Cody Gakpo operating behind a centre-forward – at the moment Ekitiké but maybe later Isak.There is a clear sense ofArne Slottaking full command, as Jürgen Klopp’s rejig of the forward line is swept away. Which itself must be thrilling to Liverpool fans: if he could win the league, have them play as they did last season, with somebody else’s players, what could he do with his own? And it is exciting, there is a sense of a new era for the Premier League, of the battle ceasing to be Manchester City against Liverpool or Arsenal and becoming Liverpool against perhaps three challengers, if Chelsea’s performance in the Club World Cup final was indicative of the heights they could reach.But football is an endlessly complicated game; nothing is ever as straightforward as it appears it might be. With any change, there is doubt. In this era when so many coaches have a philosophy, a platonic ideal of the game towards which they are striving, it is one of football’s ironies that often the most successful sides are those that embody a tension.View image in fullscreenArne Slot will be looking to lift the Premier League trophy again, this time with many of his own players, rather than those inherited from the previous manager.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images for the Premier LeagueSlot won with Klopp’s players. Arsène Wenger constructed some of his best football at Arsenal on the foundations left by George Graham. Pep Guardiola finally won the Champions League after the arrival of Erling Haaland, whose reluctance to involve himself in midfield represented a significant point of difference to previous Guardiola centre-forwards. A pure manifestation of a theory without friction seems often less effective, perhaps more predictable, than a system built through compromise.That’s a vague, abstract concern, of greater relevance to future historians than the here and now; it would, after all, be absurd to criticise a manager for fashioning a team to their model of football. But there are more immediate worries. Firstly, by making possibly five major signings, have Liverpool changed too much at once?Every transfer is a risk, but changing almost half a team at once magnifies that risk. This probably isn’t what Liverpool planned. Uncomfortable as it may be to discuss Diogo Jota’s death in terms of its ramifications for squad-building, that is something the club have had to face. Liverpool seem to have acted very sensitively in helping players deal with their grief, but they also suddenly needed to buy a centre-forward.It may be that the new signings gel instantly but it’s entirely reasonable to expect that process of integration to take a few weeks. The more players come in, the longer that is likely to take and that could cost Liverpool a few points that, in a tight title race, could prove crucial. Liverpool perhaps benefited from the reverse last season, getting off to a fast start, winning 11 of their first 13 league games under Slot in part because their lack of summer signings meant nobody (apart from Federico Chiesa) was having to adjust to new surroundings and teammates.Then there’s the question of balance. Jarell Quansah has been sold and while Joe Gomez remains at the club, his injury problems mean he cannot be relied upon. Ibrahima Konaté doesn’t have the best injury record and Virgil van Dijk is 34. That suggests a squad possibly short of a central defender, something highlighted by the fact Wataru Endo, Andy Robertson and Ryan Gravenberch have played in central defence at times in pre-season.Perhaps the plan is at times to use a midfielder in the back four, using possession as a defensive tool in the way Barcelona did with Javier Mascherano, but that would seem a ploy only really applicable to games against cautious opponents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps that’s saying not much more than that Wirtz is a more attacking figure than Dominik Szoboszlai, but that will place additional defensive responsibility on the midfield pairing of Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister. Where Szoboszlai fits in is another question; as well as offering cover for Wirtz, he could perhaps player as one of the deeper midfielders against opponents who sit back and allow Liverpool possession.View image in fullscreenScarves bearing the faces of Liverpool’s new signings Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Hugo Ekitike alongside the late Diogo Jota are seen for sale ahead of the pre-season friendly against Athletic Club.Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty ImagesBut that’s not the only tweak. Salah’s role could change quite significantly. He has always been at his best with a centre-forward who vacates the space for him to sweep into from his position on the right. Ekitiké and Isak are both mobile players, but they are both centre-forwards. They are not facilitators with the instinct to drop deep or pull wide in the way Roberto Firmino or Jota, or even Luis Díaz, did. Nor, in truth, with Wirtz seemingly likely to operate as a No 10, is there even obvious space for Ekitiké or Isak to drop into. That means an adjustment for Salah.It’s not an enormous issue. He’s played perfectly well with Darwin Núñez. There’ll be another tweak with Frimpong overlapping from full-back, going on his outside more frequently than Trent Alexander-Arnold did in later seasons. That should in theory help create room for Salah to dart inside, distracting the full-back, but it’s another element of uncertainty.And that’s the concern for Liverpool. The thrill of the signings is rooted in the pristine possibility, untarnished by experience, of what they could achieve together, but an inevitable accompaniment to that projection is the possibility of failure. The uncertainty of five new signings allows Liverpool to dream, but it also exposes them to doubt.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolInside footballFootball tacticsArne SlotcommentShareReuse this content"

The goalkeeper’s departure at the end of the 2022-2023 season epitomises the club’s self-inflicted problems, the sort of business ineptitude that has scarred United and Sir Jim Ratcliffe will demand is a thing of the past.When André Onana, a goalkeeper well-known to the then manager Erik ten Hag, was available for nothing, United allowed De Gea to run down his contract and then spent £40m on the Cameroonian a year later. The logic was lost on everyone, missing out on a fee for the Spaniard, despite a subpar final season, and then splashing out on an inferior replacement.Manchester United seal £73.7m deal for Benjamin Sesko from RB LeipzigRead moreDe Gea took a season off and returned to become the best in class in Serie A. He was the firstFiorentinaplayer sent out to warm up 45 minutes before kick-off at Old Trafford and was given a standing ovation. After all, he won the club’s player of the year on four occasions.Things need to be different with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. They are replacements for high-quality individuals who, for various reasons, are not wanted by Ruben Amorim. Few can doubt Marcus Rashford, now at Barcelona, is a world-class forward and Alejandro Garnacho has the potential to be one of the best wingers on the planet.Chelsea are keento sign him.United’s new front three has cost more than £200m, a sum they will not recoup in sales this summer. Rashford’s wages are being covered, Jadon Sancho is proving difficult to shift and Antony is awaiting offers but a loan is likely.With Sesko in the stands after the confirmation of his transfer on Saturday morning, Mason Mount was, surprisingly, given the false No 9 role, with Mbeumo and Cunha behind to begin with. There was a flow in the final third as the players swapped positions, although that is unlikely next weekend against Arsenal when Sesko is available and Amorim acknowledged United “struggled without a reference as a striker” in his rigid 3-4-3 formation. Rasmus Højlund stayed on the bench, as United went 90 minutes without a traditional No 9, an indication of the Dane’s prospects.View image in fullscreenDavid de Gea acknowledges the applause of the Manchester United fans.Photograph: Molly Darlington/Getty ImagesIt is difficult to learn much about United on this showing. Amorim said he should be judged after a full pre-season with the squad. Come the start of the Premier League, United will be different, as Sesko will be demanding crosses and passes in behind, tactics not possible with Mount as the most advanced forward.The focus on Saturday was on Mbeumo and Cunha, to see what they bring to a team that lacked ideas, creativity and clinical finishing on their way scoring 44 goals in 38 Premier League games and finished 15th. Mbeumo brought a collection of neat touches, bringing teammates into play, but Amorim said United had a “lack of fluidity”. That said, the Cameroon international’s lightness of touch and thought was enough to give optimism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The manager wants players to set the tempo, that the bare minimum required is 100% effort and Mbeumo has that. In a game played at nowhere near full speed, United still lacked mobility from their central midfield duo of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes.Cunha, on the other hand, is known for walking around the pitch when the ball is not at his feet. When it is, however, he comes alive. He can carry it through defensive lines, turning opponents. Excitement has been lacking at Old Trafford and a player like Cunha can inspire the crowd. Replica Cunha shirts are already popular with fans with the names of Cantona, Beckham and Ronaldo on their backs, because supporters love a maverick. During a break in play, Amorim beckoned Cunha to offer detailed instructions, an indicator that the Brazilian still has plenty to learn.For Sesko to be served, United’s wing-backs will be important. One the right, Amad Diallo brought his own brand of dribbling to attack but without the telling final ball reaching a United player.While the front three has been overhauled, everything behind remains unchanged, so the ease with which United conceded the opening goal was concerning. Two Fiorentina players were left unmarked at the back post from a corner, allowing Simon Sohm a simple finish from 12 yards.View image in fullscreenNew signings Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon and Matheus Cunha are presented to the fans before kick-off.Photograph: Matt West/ShutterstockIt was not the confidence-boosting start United’s defence or Altay Bayindir desired. After a Robin Gosens own goal brought the equaliser, the shootout was settled when Fabiano Parisi’s penalty was saved by the stand-in goalkeeper before Kobbie Mainoo scored to make it 5-4 and United the winners.Fiorentina are United’s only European opposition this season, allowing plenty of time for bonding on the training ground between the new arrivals. Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko may hope to one day receive a send-off like De Gea, who was substituted with minutes to go, receiving his third ovation of the day. United’s hierarchy will be hoping they were waving goodbye to a past era as they look to ignite a new one.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedFiorentinaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The majority, 268, were in Gaza, while 20 were in the West Bank, with about half serving football directly.Among the sites hit was the PFA’s headquarters in Gaza, struck during an Israeli air raid.More than 1,300 Palestinians are reported to have been killed in the vicinity of aid distribution points managed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation since the US- and Israeli-backed logistic group’s launch in late May.Explore more on these topicsMohamed SalahIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The 25-year-old Sweden international is training by himself after taking no part in the club’s Sela Cup fixtures against Espanyol and Atlético Madrid, having missed the trip to Singapore and South Korea amid Liverpool’s interest in him.Liverpool’s new era promises excitement – but have they changed too much? | Jonathan WilsonRead moreNewcastle have rejected a £110m offer for Isak, who has three years remaining on his contract, from the Anfield club out of hand, but his situationremains shrouded in uncertaintyas the Premier League opener at Aston Villa approaches. Asked after Saturday’s 2-0 defeat by Atlético at St James’ Park if he may have to let the player go, Howe said: “That’s a decision that I won’t make, that will be for other people to make.“For me, I’m just trying to manage the situation and manage the team, most importantly manage the group of players that I’m working with day to day, that I love coaching and helping. We’re focusing on Aston Villa. Everything else, to a degree, from my perspective is not in my control, so it’s not my focus.”Asked further about a report that Isak had been told he will not be sold this summer, Howe added: “That’s not something I’m aware of. Of course, there’s discussions going on all the time that I’m not party to. I have no knowledge of that.”Newcastle, who signed Isak from Real Sociedad for £63m during the summer of 2022, have placed a £150m price tag on him in an effort to ward off potential suitors, but face a major task to persuade the player to continue his career at St James’ Park. Asked if he believed he could talk his star forward round, the head coach, Howe, said: “If it was that easy, I’d have done it yesterday.”View image in fullscreenEddie Howe has been frustrated in the transfer market this summer.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesThe Isak saga has added greater urgency to Newcastle’s transfer window mission, which has encountered repeated setbacks in recent weeks with Benjamin Sesko, Hugo Ekitiké, James Trafford and João Pedro havingslipped through their fingers.They were already looking to recruit another striker to replace the departed Callum Wilson, and Howe will hope Anthony Gordon does not add to his problems after limping off during Saturday’s friendly.The 47-year-old said: “It’s an ankle problem. We initially maybe thought it was a muscle problem, but the good news is I think it was just a twist, so the initial feeling is he should be OK.”In better news for Howe, Newcastle are understood to be closing in on a deal for Milan’s Germany international defender Malick Thiaw, although he said: “I’ve been preparing these two games the last two days, so I’m not updated on anything that’s happened.” The move would be a breakthrough for Howe in his search for a defender, having missed out on Dean Huijsen earlier in the transfer window,when he moved to Real Madridfrom Bournemouth.Another Newcastle target, Yoane Wissa, did not feature again for Brentford in their training ground friendly against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday following Friday night’s 2-2 draw at the Gtech Community Stadium against the Bundesliga club.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedTransfer windowLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Phil Parkinson was encouraged, despite the sour ending for the visitors. “I took a moment when the lads ran out for the warm-up and just reflected because where we’ve come from to be playing on a stage like this today was very special,” he said.“The new lads came in and did really well and so did the existing players – that gives us great heart for the season. It was a very proud day for the club, playing at this level and there were a lot of positives.”Two years ago, Southampton were operating four divisions higher than their opponents, ending 2022-23 against Liverpool whileWrexhamsigned off from the National League at Torquay. It is only four years since the journey to this point under the ownership of Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney began; they started 2021-22 at Solihull Moors in front of a crowd of 2,196, while Saints were beginning a 10th straight season in the top flight.View image in fullscreenJosh Windass scores from the penalty spot to give Wrexham a first-half lead.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/ShutterstockHere they were as equals, duking it out on a pristine glossy surface a world away from Damson Park. Max Cleworth and Ryan Barnett – both on the pitch that day, the latter for Solihull – also started here. There were no A-listers present but the Saints owner, Dragan Solak, and the former Saints vice-chair Les Reed who is now a Wrexham adviser, were in attendance.Until the final minute of regular time it appeared Wrexham would start the season with a victory courtesy of a first-half penalty, awarded after Ronnie Edwards barged Kieffer Moore and converted by Josh Windass, one of seven Wrexham debutants, six of whom were in the starting lineup.Parkinson was adamant Edwards should have been sent off given he made no attempt to play the ball but the referee, James Bell, informed the Wrexham manager he felt there was a covering defender. Edwards somehow escaped without a booking. “It is a gamechanging moment if they go down to 10 men,” Parkinson said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Still, at 32the youngest managerin the English Football League, rested hands on head trying to make sense of it all.Wrexham were accomplished, Windass striking the bar before opening the scoring, but gradually lost their grip on an entertaining game. The arrival of Mateus Fernandes, who has numerous top-flight admirers, on the hour helped the hosts. Moore’s departure with an ankle injury early in the second half also hampered Wrexham. Southampton dialled up the pressure.Wrexham missed chances to double their lead; Lewis O’Brien, their £3m record signing, was ushered off the ball when through on goal and the substitute Ryan Hardie, another new face, forced Gavin Bazunu into an instinctive left-handed save on 87 minutes. In between those episodes Parkinson enjoyed an amusing back and forth with the home fans after Sam Smith’s tug on Joshua Quarshie in the box went unpunished.Cleworth, on a booking, was fortunate to avoid being penalised for handling a Shea Charles shot within two minutes of the restart. Those chances whirled in Parkinson’s mind when the substitute Ryan Manning levelled, leathering a superb free-kick into the top corner from 25 yards. Manning was instrumental in the winner, too. He chested Charles’s raking diagonal pass, teeing up Damion Downs. The US forward – also a summer signing – fluffed his lines from a couple of yards out but the Southampton captain, Jack Stephens, was alive at the back post to apply the finish, the ball cannoning in off the underside of the bar.For Stephens, it was a cathartic moment, an outpouring of emotion and a timely retort to his critics. At a fans’ forum in the week, on the eve of a new era, the Southampton technical director, Johannes Spors, was forced to defend the decision to hand Stephens a fresh three-year contract. At the final whistle, Stephens kissed the captain’s armband and seemingly did some soul-searching, staring deep into the stands.Still said: “We know Stevo gets a fair bit of criticism – he’s made mistakes and he probably knows that better than anyone – but he’s a really good human being and deserves his goal.”Parkinson, meanwhile, stood deflated, hands on hips; his opposite number perhaps put it best. “Welcome to theChampionship,” Still said. “It’s just crazy, isn’t it?”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSouthamptonWrexhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Even the presence of Ruud Gullit at sweeper in a visiting side featuring Mark Hughes in attack could not deny Boro a 2-0 win as an exciting decade peopled by, among other luminaries, Juninho, Fabrizio Ravanelli, Nick Barmby, Gareth Southgate, Gaizka Mendieta and Bolo Zenden dawned.Manning and Stephens’ late show earns Southampton dramatic win against WrexhamRead moreAlong the way Boro would reach three League Cup finals, winning one, while also losing FA Cup and, most excitingly, Uefa Cup finals. Not to mention bouncing back from a one-season second-tier sabbatical.Teesside was firmly on not just the UK but the European map. Or at least it was until the economic profile of football ownership changed and Steve Gibson’s club struggled to compete at the very highest level.These days the Riverside rarely rocks to capacity crowds and, after eight seasons out of the Premier League, a relatively modest 26,286 congregated to see how their club’s latest manager, Rob Edwards, shaped up.The good news for Boro fans is that the answer is so far, so good, after Dael Fry’s winning header secured three points. “I’m really pleased,” said Edwards. “It was a tough game but lovely to keep a clean sheet and score from a set piece. Swansea’s strikers had very few touches of the ball and we played some good stuff at times.”Edwards is big on connectivity and has taken the admirable step of attending a plethora of supporters’ events over the summer, canvassing opinions while attempting to tap into the local psyche.Norwich 1-2 Millwall, Boro 1-0 Swansea and more: Championship clockwatch – liveRead moreThe former Luton manager has switched formation to 3-4-2-1 while endeavouring to wean his squad off the increasingly slow possession-heavy approach favoured by Michael Carrick.Edwards wants to see his team in high-tempo, hard-pressing mode but here Boro’s players sometimes seemed to forget Carrick had been sacked and reverted to their old habits.If they experienced a fortunate defensive reprieve when Ronald’s half-volley flew fractionally wide, Swansea’s Lawrence Vigouroux did extremely well to fingertip Morgan Whittaker’s shot on to the barLike Edwards, Alan Sheehan was anxious to endear himself to a newish public in his first competitive match after being promoted from Swansea’s caretaker manager to the real thing.

Snoop Dogg is also scheduled to visit the Liberty Stadium this season and has been forgiven for an unfortunate incident in 2011 when he performed in south Wales wearing a Cardiff replica shirt.Fry headed Boro into an early second-half lead with a stooping connection with Whittaker’s corner.

Indeed Boro recently accepted a £20m bid for Hackney from Ipswich only for a player who has been watched repeatedly by Newcastle, among others, to reject that move. “It’s a win-win situation,” said Edwards. “If Hayden’s here, great; he’s a brilliant player. But, if he’s not, the funds will be available to spend.”Sheehan, too, is presiding over a stylistic shift as Swansea transition from a possession-monopolising approach to a more direct one. “We didn’t create anywhere enough; they made sure we played down the sides a bit too much,” said Swansea’s manager. “No excuses, just disappointment.”The suspicion, though, is that Sheehan’s will be far from the only team to stumble in the shadow of the Cleveland Hills as, 30 years after the Riverside’s doors first opened, Edwards aims to return the good times to Teesside.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipMiddlesbroughSwansea Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I think that’s the bare minimum for a club likeLiverpool,” said Van Dijk. “It’s going to be very tough but we’ve been through very tough times anyway and I’m really looking forward to it. I’m looking forward to every bit of it.“We’re all in this together and that’s how it should be. Us as a group with players, staff but together with our fans, we have to go together into this and support each other and be there for each other in the good and lesser-good days.”Van Dijk spoke of his desire to leave a lasting impression at Anfield. “Any success with Liverpool, that feeling is incredible. That’s what you play football for. You want to be leaving a legacy behind, you want to be remembered, you want to inspire the next generation in everything you do.“We are at a club where legends will be remembered and honoured and always be welcomed back. It’s an amazing feeling and an amazing feeling that we were part of that period of time, but we still are part of the club and want to be successful.”Van Dijk is – alongside teammates Mohamed Salah, Alexis Mac Allister and Florian Wirtz –included on the 2025 Ballon d’Or shortlist. Salah, last season’s Premier League player of the season and Football Writers’ Association Footballer of the Year, said: “Being a legend at a club, especially like Liverpool, is such a great thing. It shows you that you worked very hard and achieved things that are difficult for people to achieve. I’m grateful for something like that.”“It is nice if you can start the season with the chance of winning something,” Slot said. “Normally you have to play numerous games before you can win something.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the anxiety levels among the fans returned against Steven Pressley’s side, who took the lead in the 51st minute through a Ryan Astley header.The Rangers defender Nasser Djiga was then sent off for a last-man challenge on Finlay Robertson but as the game moved into added time James Tavernier, who came off the bench, levelled from the spot, after Drey Wright pulled down Djeidi Gassama. To add to the consternation of the home support, Cyriel Dessers had the ball in the net in the seventh minute of added time only to be ruled offside.Martin said: “Every club I have been at, it’s a bit of pain and when you get through that pain, it’s so worth it. I don’t think I expected anything less coming here, it’s not going to be a quick fix. This club has not had success for a long, long time. I’ve been asked about the supporters’ reaction and I just don’t have a problem because I understand it.View image in fullscreenRangers levelled in spite of being reduced to 10 men when Nasser Djiga was sent off for taking out Finlay Robertson as he closed in on goal.Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images“We are at a point now at this club where something needed to change. The ownership has changed, there’s a new coaching staff, there’s new players, there’s hopefully a new way of behaving in the training ground – properly, every single day, regarding standards and what’s expected at this football club. So it’s not a quick fix and this is not me coming out and making excuses.“I think we change the manager from year to year and nothing really changes. So now it’s about really changing the culture and the feel of the club day in and day out. That will end up in a good outcome. Good process, good people, will always end up in a good outcome. But maybe not so quickly as everyone wants.”Martin was surprised by the boos that rang round the stadium when he brought on Kieran Dowell, along with Nicolas Raskin, to replace Lyall Cameron and Mohamed Diomande. He said: “Yeah, that surprised me. I’m not on any social media or anything like that, so I don’t really know what the narrative is around Kieran. I don’t think it helps him, I don’t think it helps the rest of the guys. That’s how I feel about it really.”David Martindale is excited by the “gamechangers”Livingstonnow possess after Lewis Smith scored a stunning goal to help defeatFalkirk3-1 in the battle of the two promoted teams. The winger, who joined from Hamilton last summer, fired home a magnificent strike from the edge of the area in first-half stoppage time to add to Scott Pittman’s 18th-minute opener.After Robbie Muirhead’s penalty was saved by Scott Bain early in the second half, the visitors hit back through Ross MacIver before substitute Jeremy Bokila sealed the win late on.Martindale said: “The amount of goals I’ve seen wee Smithy score like that is incredible. I feel from maybe the previous years in the Premiership, the last season especially, we’ve probably now got gamechangers on the park. There’s boys with real moments of quality.”Stephen Robinson saidSt Mirreninitially showedMotherwelltoo much respect in the their 0-0 draw in Paisley. The visitors dominated for long spells during the opening hour before Robinson adjusted his team and tactics to quell the threat.Robinson said: “We complicated the press a little bit against them, maybe gave too much respect to them and that’s my responsibility. We rectified that, but had we maybe done that right from the start perhaps we could have won the game. So that’s my fault.”His Motherwell counterpart, Jens Berthel Askou, was similarly satisfied at taking something after an opening-day home draw with Rangers. The Dane said: “We had our moments. They also had a few, especially on set pieces, when they brought some balls in the box. But having a clean sheet here is OK.

Here come nine months of Premier League hopes and fears. Even if the eventual fate awaiting a team can become crystal clear as early as the opening weekend, there can be no backward glances. This means more, as the modern cliche goes. Many are happy to live by those words.Regrettably, club football’s return also means the sun setting on a brilliant summer of sport, the closing of an ever-narrower window. Only the truly afflicted are not glad of the respite. The close season, as it was previously termed, lowers the cortisol, regulates the serotonin levels until it’s time to go again.The Club World Cupwas not too much of a diversion, despite Gianni Infantino’s best efforts and corralling of Donald Trump, a month of unlovable fare that desperately searched for authenticity via its blaring, high-contrast cocktail of celebrity and Saudi Arabian money.Why is ‘Dave from Egham’ so wound up by women’s football? | LettersRead moreEngland’s modern-classic 25-dayTest series with India, a British & Irish Lions rugby union tour torestore faith in the tradition, the emotions ofRory McIlroy’s Royal Portrush homecomingat the Open, Jannik Sinner andCarlos Alcaraz playing outtwo thrilling grand slam tennis finals, both male andfemale versions of the Tour de Franceand, most of all, the rollercoaster ride the Lionesses took England on to defend their Euros crown. All have offered welcome relief from the Premier League’s self-important yet irresistible charms.Each featured sport played at ultra-competitive levels, with plenty of needle around. England’s fielders attempted to distract their opponents with a circular set of sledges that often recalled the incantations from the Wicker Man. Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard eyed each other’s moves in the high mountains in predatory fashion, each trying to bury the other, but by Paris their admiration for each other was also made plain. Similar respect filled the air in the clinches shared between teams afterIndia levelled at the Oval, and in Sydney as Australia signed off with a deserved consolation victory.The spirit of cricket endures. This summer South Africa’s captain, Wiaan Mulder, declared his team’s innings with him on 367 not out against Zimbabwe, 33 short of the highest Test score, reasoning that “Brian Lara keeping that record is exactly the way it should be”, and showing clemency to a redeveloping opponent.Where Wisden quoted a number of responses bemoaning “woke nonsense” and the like, Mulder’s gesture spoke to sportsmanship, legacy and a respect for his sport’s purity. The following weekend, the final of Infantino’s plaything ended in an on-pitch skirmish between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain players andTrump gatecrashing the celebrations.So back into the football void we go, where “Respect” is a long-forgotten Football Association campaign, where video assistant referees mean the on-pitch official’s decision is less than final, where fans now pore over rivals’ published accounts in search of profitability and sustainability breaches. Such are the terms of engagement of the Premier League.As a less modern cliche has it, Sunday’s the meeting of Liverpool and Crystal Palace is a traditional curtain-raiser, while also drawing the curtain on everything else. Though certain managers, Pep Guardiola among them, count it as a major trophy, it retains a status of glorified friendly, though it has often reflected the cynicism of the season ahead.Its most famous match, when it was the Charity Shield, remains the first staging at Wembley in 1974, Liverpool’s Kevin Keegan and Leeds’ Billy Bremner dismissed for throwing punches. Leeds’ Johnny Giles has admitted his role as Keegan’s provocateur, saying in 2020: “He was in a bit of a temper … I actually did hit him.” The two miscreants, but not Giles, were banned for 11 matches each, among their chief offences being the ungentlemanly discarding of shirts as they left the field, these days common practice for the dismissed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another serious casting of shade was at Villa Park in August 2012, Wembley in use for the London Olympics. London’s 16 days as the centre of the sporting universe, with its Super Saturday, a host rapt by the prospect of Team GB winning medals in even the most obscure sports, had reached its closing Sunday. Mo Farah had won double gold the previous night.Enter Chelsea and Manchester City, whose grasping of the spirit of London 2012, sportsmanship bringing all together, was to kick blessed lumps from each other, the referee Kevin Friend all but losing control, Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic dismissed for a studs-up challenge on his Serbian compatriot Aleksandar Kolarov’s shin. Eight yellow cards were waved. Three years later, back at Wembley, Arsène Wenger and José Mourinho shunned each other in theatrical fashion rather than shake hands.Scenes you won’t want to see … but actually really want to see? That Premier League football is played at the edge of sanity and acceptability is a leading reason why it holds the attention through the dark winter it beckons.Explore more on these topicsCommunity ShieldfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I didn’t play so well last night in the first round but tonight is when it really matters.“It’s not gone to plan this year in the World Series but there are plenty of opportunities to win and I’ve finally picked one up,” added Littler, who’s been in superlative form in other events, particularly with his victories in the Premier League and recent World Matchplay.Now he’s after a trans-Tasman double when he moves on to the New ZealandDartsMasters. “A few days off and then Auckland, I can’t wait,” he said of next weekend’s event.The frightening thing for his opponents is that Littler prevailed at the WIN Sports and Entertainments Centre without ever quite hitting his very best form.Perth ace Heta, who had held high hopes of toppling Littler after averaging nearly 110 in his first-round match on Friday, just couldn’t hit those heights again, and the teenager made him pay by reeling off three straight legs from 3-3 to move into the semis, including a 104 checkout in the penultimate game.In the semis, there was some more magic from Littler as he pulled off the biggest finish of the tournament, a maximum 170 “big fish” checkout on the way to beating Bunting.In the final, Littler was always in control once he produced two fantastic legs, one featuring a 143 checkout and the next an 11-darter. It all left De Decker sighing with a rueful smile: “He needs to retire because it’s not fun any more.”Explore more on these topicsDartsLuke LittlerAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

For John Mitchell’s team, Marlie Packer’s suspension and the head injury absence of Emily Scarratt were compensated for by the returns of Ellie Kildunne and the captain, Zoe Aldcroft.The hosts had been keen to avoid the kind of lethargic start that has often cost them dear against elite teams.

The Six Nations champions eventually made the most of their numerical advantage, though, with another driving maul pushing Maud Muir over the line.As has often been the case in recentLe Crunchclashes, France emerged for the second half with a newfound urgency. Bourgeois added another three points within minutes of the restart, after an impressive drive through the heart of the England defence by Teani Feleu.England soon added a fourth try to dash any hopes of a comeback, though, with Megan Jones running in after a quick penalty from a five-metre scrum. The final half-hour was nevertheless a more balanced affair, with France stretching the opposition defence several times but undermining their efforts with repeated handling errors and poor discipline.Momentum swung back in England’s direction in the final 10 minutes. After being held up by excellent France defence a couple of times, Lark Atkin-Davies eventually went over for the visitors’ fifth try five minutes from time. The Bristol front-rower soon scored her second in similar fashion, completing an evening of forward supremacy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The resulting penalty was taken quickly but a long kick straight into touch dashed any hopes of a score to get the 7,500-strong crowd back on their feet.While both sets of coaches had insisted before the match that the final result would not be their primary concern, a 16th consecutive win for England over France (and their biggest in 15 years) will provide vindication of the work done over their summer-long training camp.“It’s a privilege to have this pressure,” Mitchell said, when asked about the expectations for England before their home World Cup. “We’ve earned it over this three-year cycle, it’s not something we’re going to walk away from. We’ve worked hard to be in this position.”For the hosts, their lone warm-up match offered something of a reality check. “We’re disappointed, because clearly we didn’t show what we’ve worked on this summer,” France’s coach, Gaëlle Mignot, lamented. “But we’re a resilient team, we’ll get back to work.“We wanted to play against England to get an idea of how we were doing, and that’s definitely what happened tonight. We know that if we don’t improve in every sector, we’ll have a hard time during the tournament.”The two sides are expected to meet again in five weeks’ time, this time in Bristol for a blockbuster World Cup semi-final. Before then, England face the USA in Sunderland on 22 August in the tournament’s curtain-raiser, whileLes Bleuestake on Italy in Exeter the following day.Explore more on these topicsWomen's rugby unionRugby unionFrance women's rugby union teamEngland women's rugby union teamWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025newsShareReuse this content"

However, his departure looked inevitable after a string of unconvincing displays, and takes Liverpool’s income from sales this summer to almost £200m, with more likely to follow as the £40m-plus-rated midfielder Harvey Elliott possibly next to move on.It also opens up a space in their forward line, which has already been strengthened with the arrival of Hugo Ekitiké as part of a near-£300m spend, and the No 9 shirt.

Having spent much of the past four years struggling to string together wins, she is now as match-tough as she has ever been.She said: “You always feel a little bit of nerves before the first round, but I think that overall, I’m approaching everything in a lot more calm way, mature, and I think I’m trusting a lot more the work I’m doing behind the scenes. I know I’m putting a lot of hours in, and it takes some of the pressure off of the results.”Raducanu puts in hard yards as she targets rankings rise under Roig’s ruleRead moreA far greater test awaits Raducanu, who had received a first-round bye owing to her status as a seeded player, in round three. A Wimbledon rematch is guaranteed as she will either face the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, her conqueror in the third round, or the 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova, whoRaducanu defeated in round twothis summer.Raducanu was supported from the crowd by Roig, who consistently offered tactical advice from his position next to the baseline. Although their partnership is still less than a week old, she believes Roig has already made a positive difference to her game. “I think the way I’m playing, the movements of my shot, improving the quality of my shot,” she said. “There were four or five points where I did something that we were working on, and it’s always really satisfying and rewarding when you hit a shot and you’ve worked on it in practice. So I think I’m going to improve a lot, hopefully doing the work day in, day out.”After their first conversations about her game, Raducanu and Roig quickly agreed that the main focus of their work is improving her overall level. “It’s just, like, the level needs to be better. In a good way, not in a negative way. It’s just calling it how it is,” she said. “And I’m very like that. I’m very kind of factual and I don’t necessarily like fluffing something up. I think that’s where we get on really well and we understand each other. Just in general, everything is like: ‘We need to improve. We need to get every shot better.’ And that’s exciting, because I feel like there’s a lot of potential to go and I don’t think I’m near it.”During her one previous appearance in Cincinnati two years ago, where she dismantled Serena Williams in the final month of her career and Victoria Azarenka in consecutive matches, Raducanu showed that the faster courts here suit her well. This time, however, she had the oppressive heat to deal with. The temperature on Champions Court rose to 30C (85F) with considerable humidity.Raducanu opened the match poorly with three loose unforced errors and a double fault to drop her opening service game to love. Constant aggression from Danilovic, an ultra-offensive lefty with a big serve and forehand but poor movement, allowed the Serb to dictate the majority of the early exchanges. In the opening games, Raducanu was forced to scrap behind the baseline, chasing down balls while trying to elicit unforced errors from her opponent for much of the first set.View image in fullscreenFrancisco Roig has been brought in as Emma Raducanu’s new coach.Photograph: Frey/TPN/Getty ImagesHowever, Raducanu’s depth of service return was brilliant from the beginning, consistently refusing Danilovic the short balls she was looking for behind her first serve. Raducanu also defended well, maintaining her depth and patiently looking for opportunities to take the ball early and attack. In the face of this intensity, Danilovic’s error count rose throughout.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAfter struggling on serve early on, Raducanu gradually grew in confidence. From her uncertain position behind the baseline, she ended a composed, efficient performance striking the ball early and putting Danilovic’s laboured movement under constant pressure as she eased into the third round.One year after missing most of the North American swing, including the Cincinnati Open, before her first round loss at Flushing Meadows, Raducanu is in quite a different position. Her run on the hard courts began with two positive showings, reaching the semi-finals of the WTA 500 event in Washington before winning two matches last week in Montreal. Now she will have another opportunity to test her level against one of the world’s best.Elsewhere, Iga Swiatek, the Wimbledon champion, continued her excellent form by easing into the third round with a composed 6-1, 6-4 win over Anastasia Potapova.

Just a few months agohe appeared determined to stay in the NFLfor at least one more year. “I didn’t leave rugby just to try it for a year, people would be pretty dumb to think that I’d leave straight away,” he said in February.Rees-Zammit had made sufficient progress in Jacksonville to make their 90-strong training squad but the back injury sustained last month, which reduced his chances of making their 53-man active roster for the coming season, prompted a sudden reassessment. With head coach Doug Pedersen and his assistants having been dismissed in April, something else appears to have changed in the interim.As Bell implies, Rees-Zammit’s options have been increasing elsewhere. In addition to the prospect of the rest of Wales following Tandy’s lead by greeting him as a prodigal son, the 24-year-old is understood to have been approached to join R360, theproposed rebel leaguewhose backers have reportedly signed pre-contract agreements with 160 players in anticipation of a planned launch next year.While money has never been Rees-Zammit’s main motivation – he has walked out on a potential £712,000 salary at Jacksonville – the prospect of earning up to £1m for a 12-game season in 12 months’ time would have understandable appeal.View image in fullscreenLouis Rees-Zammit has speed and athleticism, but that isn’t enough to stand out in the world of the NFL.Photograph: Nathan Ray Seebeck/Imagn Images/Reuters“Professional sport gives you a very short window,” says Bell, who watched Rees-Zammit closely in training this summer preparing for his role as an analyst on Sky Sports. “You’re always fighting Father Time.“Louis should be very proud of himself. In theNFLwe celebrate players who can play two different positions. The fact he even attempted to play a totally different sport at the very highest level is amazing. This year he could have made the team from what I saw in training, you never really know.“I’m the wrong person to ask because I wasn’t supposed to make it. I wasn’t picked up in the draft, but ended up playing in the NFL for eight years.”Other experts disagree on whether Rees-Zammit ever really stood a chance of making it in the NFL. After successfully coming through a 16-week training camp run by the NFL’s International Player Pathway last year, he signed a three-year contract with the Chiefs last summer, but after playing three pre-season games he was released to the Jaguars last August, before signing a new 12-month deal in February.For all his talent and speed, by NFL standards even his athleticism is not exceptional – the best time he recorded for the 40-yard dash at Kansas of 4.43 seconds is significantly slower than the 4.20 benchmark set by the Chiefs’ fastest wide receiver, Xavier Worthy – while technically and tactically he was understandably off the pace.View image in fullscreenLouis Rees-Zammit didn’t seem to find one position to call his own while he was in American football, one reason perhaps why his move there didn’t really succeed.Photograph: Denny Medley/USA Today SportsIn retrospect, his debut appearance for the Chiefs in a pre-season game last August, coincidentally against the Jaguars who signed him a few weeks later, was symptomatic of the confusion surrounding the entire escapade, with the coaching staff unsure how to use him. Wearing a No 9 shirt he was used in three positions – running back, kick returner, kicker, plus as part of the special teams on punt coverage – and contributed four yards.“Rees-Zammit is a fantastic athlete, but in terms of pace and athleticism, there’s maybe 500 of those guys in Florida alone,” says double Super Bowl winner turned pundit Osi Umenyiora, who was born in London before enjoying a stellar NFL career with the New York Giants and Atlanta Falcons. “You have to be superior athletically to be able to learn the game and then break through.”Bell believes Rees-Zammit will return to rugby as a better player, having picked up new skills and matured as a person because of his once-in-a-lifetime experience. “He will have learned different ways to attack people in the open field, different ways to attack in tight spaces,” Bell says. “He has new skills that opponents in rugby won’t have seen before. His mindset will have matured. He really stepped out of his comfort zone.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pair have stayed in touch during his NFL sojourn, with Rees-Zammit visiting the Gloucester dressing rooms at a Premiership game against Leicester last winter. “Physically he has changed a little bit,” he says. “The athletic profile of NFL athletes is different to rugby players, so he’s a bit bigger, more muscular.“NFL is a very anaerobic sport, whereas rugby is more aerobic, so it will take some time for him to get back up to speed. But Louis is such a talented footballer that he’ll be able to adjust. Rugby is in his blood so it shouldn’t take him too long.View image in fullscreenGloucester, where Louis Rees-Zammit played his club rugby, are believed to have first refusal on him if he returns to the Premiership.Photograph: Nigel French/PA“This is not a failure, it’s just a chapter in his life that is now closed. He has incredible self-belief, which he will have needed to go there in the first place. He has what I call a ‘Championship mindset’. He believes he is going to be great, and therefore he is great.“That mindset is super rare, even in elite sport. The human brain isn’t designed to think like that, but he will be ready to rip and show rugby what they’ve been missing.”The former Wales and Lions winger Alex Cuthbert is less concerned about the physical transition that may be required, and is backing Rees-Zammit to make an impact as soon as he is playing again. His biggest challenge in the short term may be in securing a club contract, as with just six weeks until the start of the European season most budgets are already allocated.Gloucester are understood to have first refusal, but are already close to the salary-cap threshold, with neighbours Bristol believed to be exploring their options. Thetakeover of Newcastle Falcons by Red Bull, as revealed by the Guardian in June, presents another intriguing possibility as the energy drinks company undoubtedly have the resources and crave association with global stars.“I’m not even sure he needs a club to play for Wales,” Cuthbert says. “He is exactly what Welsh rugby has been missing. It’s been so negative in Wales for so long, but Louis will bring excitement off the pitch and an X-factor on it. He can be our Henry Pollock.“After 18 months in the NFL he will be a better professional, will be in better shape and will bring a huge number of casual fans with him. It’s the perfect time for him to come back, as there’s a new Wales coach and two years until the World Cup.”Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cause if he was out there not going in y’all would be on his ass about it! So give credit and grace lames.”Lions-Falcons preseason game halted with 6:31 left after Morice Norris injuryRead moreSanders, a highly-rated draft prospectwho endured a dramatic fallinto the fifth round in April, entered the game fourth on the Browns depth chart, butwas pressed into starting dutybecause of injuries. His status could change after he led three touchdown drives in nearly three full quarters of action, showing tremendous poise and awareness in the pocket.Sanders said he’s not worried about how the depth chart shakes out.“When I get out there it’s just doing what I gotta do,” Sanders said. “Everything else is not in my hands, so I don’t worry about it. I just don’t think that deep into everything because it’s nothing you’re gonna be able to control. So why put energy in something that you can’t control?”Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said he was pleased with how Sanders played, but said it’s too early to know if he will get more reps in practice or start the next preseason game against the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles in what is viewed as an open quarterback competition.“I’m honestly not focused there,” Stefanski said. “I think the guys need to continue to earn their roles. That’s what these guys are doing.”While Sanders played into the third quarter, counterpart Bryce Young had a quick, but effective night for Carolina.Young played two series and completed 4 of 6 passes for 58 yards, including a five-yard touchdown pass to Jalen Coker to give Carolina an early 7-0 lead. Coker, who is battling for a roster spot after a solid rookie season, had an impressive night, also hauling in a long pass with one hand while a defender had ahold of one of his arms, although the play was called back on a penalty.But this night belonged to Sanders.After failing to score in his first three possessions while facing Carolina’s starters, Sanders began to heat up against the second team in the second quarter.The Browns caught a break when they recovered a muffed punt return by the Panthers at the Carolina 10.Two plays later Sanders fired a seven-yard TD strike between two defenders to tie the game in the second quarter. After a couple of nifty runs and throws, Sanders found Davis again over the middle for a 12-yard score to give Cleveland the lead with 1:04 left in the first half.Davis finished with three catches for 23 yards.Cleveland stretched its lead to 21-7 in the third quarter when Gage Larvadain scored on a jet sweep from four yards out.The Panthers managed just 251 yards on offense to go along with six penalties for 60 yards and two turnovers.“Part of our play style is playing smart and I don’t feel like we did that,” Panthers coach Dave Canales said.Panthers second-year wide receiver Xavier Legette had a short night after getting ejected early in the first quarter when he threw several punches at Browns cornerback Rayshawn Jenkins after the two got locked up in a block well after the completion of a play.“You can’t have that,” Canales said. “As soon as you throw a punch, we are at a disadvantage.”Jenkins, who eventually ripped off Legette’s helmet, was also ejected from the game.Explore more on these topicsCleveland BrownsNFLUS sportsCarolina PanthersLeBron JamesShareReuse this content"

We would like to thank theAtlanta Falconsorganization, the EMS team at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and the doctors and staff at Grady for their support.”Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa says sitting on Trump’s sports council will be ‘an honor’Read moreLions coach Dan Campbell asked for prayers for the 24-year-old Norris.“We’re just praying for Mo and ask that everybody prays for him,” Campbell said.Campbell said Norris had his mother with him at the hospital.Norris, the former Fresno State player listed as Detroit’s second-team safety, hit Carter with his facemask facing the running back’s midsection, and the defender’s head snapped back after making the hit.Lions quarterback Kyle Allen said it was immediately obvious the medical personnel saw this as a serious injury.“Usually you see a couple trainers out there,” Allen said. “It’s never good when they bring out the stretchers. We just started praying for him and hoping for the best. When it’s taking that long, with that many people and that many trainers around him, you’re just hoping for the best.”Added Allen: “It’s just awful. ... You sign up for football and you understand the risk, you understand the injury risk. You never think something like that is going to happen.“At the end of the day we’re all out here as football players. We may be on 32 different teams but we’ve all played football our whole lives and had our own injuries and been through it.”When play resumed, Falcons quarterback Emory Jones took a snap and then held the ball as players from both teams stood at the line of scrimmage and the clock continued to run. Finally, with 6:31 left, an official announced the game had been suspended “per New York.”The Lions led 17-10 when played was stopped.Campbell and Falcons coach Raheem Morris made the decision to not finish the game.“Raheem Morris is a class act,” Campbell said. “He’s the ultimate class act. We agreed it just didn’t feel right to finish that game.”Morris said it was “common courtesy” for the coaches to decide to not finish the game.“It was tough to watch,” Morris said. “It was tough for the other team to see getting a teammate hurt that way. It was the right thing to do for Dan and his crew and his team and everything we had going on right there, I thought that was the right thing.“You never like to see anybody get hurt in any type of game or any type of way. It was a tough deal for those guys, a tough deal for us, a tough deal all across the board.”Allen said the decision to not finish the game was easy to make.“I don’t think anyone on that sideline wanted to play,” Allen said. “We weren’t part of that decision but you could look in anyone’s eyes and see that.”Though the decision to not finish the game seemed dramatic, there were two precedents from preseason games in consecutive weeks in August 2023.New England’s game at Green Bay in Week 2 of the 2023 preseason was called off when Patriots cornerback Isaiah Bolden was carted off in the fourth quarter. Bolden appeared to collide with teammate Calvin Munson while attempting to make a hit on a pass completion to Malik Heath of the Packers.Bolden was taken to a hospital and released the next day.A week later, a game between Miami and Jacksonville was not completed after Dolphins receiver Daewood Davis was carted off in the fourth quarter. Davis was hurt when he ran a slant route and was attempting to catch a pass when he was hit by Jaguars linebacker Dequan Jackson.Davis was released from the hospital a day later.The two frightening injuries happened some eight months after Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated on the field during a regular season game at Cincinnati in January 2023. Hamlin has enjoyed a remarkable recovery and resumed football the following season and spent last year as a Bills starter.Explore more on these topicsNFLDetroit LionsAtlanta FalconsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The review’s findings are understood to have relied in part on assurances the company received from Israel-based staff.However, in recent days some senior executives at the company’s US headquarters have raised doubts about the veracity of the information received from some of the employees in Israel who manage the company’s relationship with the military.One of the sources familiar with internal conversations said executives had been unable to verify some of the information provided by staff in Israel, and had questioned whether employees may have felt more bound to their country’s military rather than to their employer.Using leaked Microsoft documents, the Guardian has identified several employees involved in managing projects with Unit 8200 who have previously shared online that they have served in or are reservists of the elite eavesdropping unit, which is equivalent in its remit to the US National Security Agency.Despite concerns raised by executives in recent days, the company has not yet launched the kind of formal review it conducted earlier this year into its work with the Israeli military. The review was prompted byreporting by the Guardianand others about Israel’s reliance on Microsoft technology during its Gaza offensive.A Microsoft spokesperson said the company “takes these allegations seriously, as shown by our previous independent investigation. As we receive new information, we’re committed to making sure we have a chance to validate any new data and take any needed action.”According to the leaked files reviewed by the Guardian, Microsoft – including senior executives – was aware Unit 8200 planned to move large volumes of sensitive and classified intelligence data into Azure as the company began working with the unit in 2021 to add advanced security measures within the cloud platform.However, the company has insisted its executives were not aware Azure was being used by Unit 8200 to store the content of intercepted Palestinian calls. “We have no information related to the data stored in the customer’s cloud environment,” a spokesperson said earlier this week.In a statement issued by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) after publication of the investigation, a spokesperson said: “We appreciate Microsoft’s support to protect our cybersecurity. We confirm that Microsoft is not and has not been working with the IDF on the storage or processing of data.”Several Microsoft sources said the IDF’s statement was viewed with surprise by the company’s leadership since it is not a secret it provides cloud storage to the military under contracts with Israel’s defence ministry.Following the revelations about Unit 8200’s reliance on Microsoft, a worker-led group, No Azure for Apartheid, issued a series of demands, including that the company cut off and “make all ties to the Israeli military publicly known”.Abdo Mohamed, an organizer with No Azure for Apartheid, who wasfired by the companylast year, said Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, and other executives “claim they are unaware of how their company colluded with the Israeli regime to profit from Palestinian suffering while being the very ones who committed Microsoft to this partnership in 2021”.Explore more on these topicsMicrosoftIsraelIsrael-Gaza warCloud computingnewsShareReuse this content"

Ask that version of the AI for an artichoke recipe, and the same amount of pasta-related text could take several times – even 20 times – that amount of energy, experts say.As it rolled out GPT-5, the companyhighlightedthe model’s breakthrough capabilities: its ability to create websites, answer PhD-level science questions, and reason through difficult problems.But experts who have spent the past years working to benchmark the energy and resource usage of AI models say those new powers come at a cost: a response from GPT-5 may take a significantly larger amount of energy than a response from previous versions ofChatGPT.OpenAI unveils ChatGPT-5 and its hyped ‘PhD level’ intelligence struggled with basic spelling and geographyRead moreOpenAI, like most of its competitors, has released no official information on the power usage of its models since GPT-3, which came out in 2020. Sam Altman, its CEO, tossed out somenumberson ChatGPT’s resource consumption on his blog this June. However, these figures, 0.34 watt-hours and 0.000085 gallons of water per query, do not refer to a specific model and have no supporting documentation.“A more complex model like GPT-5 consumes more power both during training and during inference. It’s also targeted at long thinking … I can safely say that it’s going to consume a lot more power than GPT-4,” said Rakesh Kumar, a professor at the University of Illinois, currently working on the energy consumption of computation and AI models.The day GPT-5 was released,researchersat the University of Rhode Island’s AI lab found that the model can use up to 40 watt-hours of electricity to generate a medium-length response of about 1,000 tokens, which are the building blocks of text for an AI model and are approximately equivalent to words.Adashboardthey put up on Friday indicates GPT-5’s average energy consumption for a medium-length response is just over 18 watt-hours, a figure that is higher than all other models they benchmark except for OpenAI’s o3 reasoning model, released in April, and R1, made by the Chinese AI firm Deepseek.This is “significantly more energy than GPT-4o”, the previous model fromOpenAI, said Nidhal Jegham, a researcher in the group.Eighteen watt-hours would correspond to burning that incandescent bulb for 18 minutes. Given recentreportsthat ChatGPT handles 2.5bn requests a day, the total consumption of GPT-5 could reach the daily electricitydemandof 1.5m US homes.As large as these numbers are, researchers in the field say they align with their broad expectations for GPT-5’s energy consumption, given that GPT-5 is believed to be several times larger than OpenAI’s previous models. OpenAI has not released the parameter counts – which determine a model’s size – for any of its models since GPT-3, whichhad 175bnparameters.A disclosure this summer from the French AI company Mistralfindsa “strong correlation” between a model’s size and its energy consumption, based on Mistral’s study of its in-house systems.“Based on the model size, the amount of resources [used by GPT-5] should be orders of magnitude higher than that for GPT-3,” said Shaolei Ren, a professor at the University of California, Riverside who studies theresourcefootprint of AI.Benchmarking AI power usageGPT-4 waswidelybelievedto be 10 times the size of GPT-3. Jegham, Kumar, Ren and others say that GPT-5 is likely to be significantly larger than GPT-4.Leading AI companies like OpenAIbelievethatextremelylargemodels may be necessary to achieve AGI, that is, an AI systemcapableof doing humans’ jobs. Altman has argued strongly for this view,writingin February: “It appears that you can spend arbitrary amounts of money and get continuous and predictable gains,” though he said GPT-5 did not surpass human intelligence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

GPT-5 is deployed on more efficient hardware than some previous models. GPT-5appearsto use a “mixture-of-experts” architecture, which means that it is streamlined so that not all of its parameters are activated when responding to a query, a construction which will likely cut its energy consumption.On the other hand, GPT-5 is also a reasoning model, and works in video and images as well as text, which likely makes its energy footprint far greater than text-only operations, both Ren and Kumar say – especially as the reasoning mode means that the model will compute for a longer time before responding to a query.“If you use the reasoning mode, the amount of resources you spend for getting the same answer will likely be several times higher, five to 10,” said Ren.Hidden informationIn order to calculate an AI model’s resource consumption, the group at the University of Rhode Island multiplied the average time that model takes to respond to a query – be it for a pasta recipe or an offering to Moloch – by the model’s average power draw during its operation.Estimating a model’s power draw was “a lot of work”, said Abdeltawab Hendawi, aprofessorof data science at the University of Rhode Island. The group struggled to find information on how different models are deployed within data centers. Their finalpapercontains estimates for which chips are used for a given model, and how different queries are parceled out between different chips in a datacenter.Altman’s June blog post confirmed their findings. The figure he gave for ChatGPT’s energy consumption per query, 0.34 watt-hours per query, closely matches what the group found for GPT-4o.Hendawi, Jegham and others in their group said that their findings underscored the need for more transparency from AI companies as they release ever-larger models.“It’s more critical than ever to address AI’s true environmental cost,” said Marwan Abdelatti, aprofessorat URI. “We call on OpenAI and other developers to use this moment to commit to full transparency by publicly disclosing GPT-5’s environmental impact.”Explore more on these topicsOpenAIChatGPTSam AltmanEnergyArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

That was how Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, described the latest upgrade to ChatGPT this week.The race Altman was referring to was artificial general intelligence (AGI), a theoretical state of AI where, by OpenAI’s definition, a highly autonomous system is able to do a human’s job.Describing the new GPT-5 model, which will powerChatGPT, as a “significant step on the path to AGI”, he nonetheless added a hefty caveat.“[It is] missing something quite important, many things quite important,” said Altman, such as the model’s inability to “continuously learn” even after its launch. In other words, these systems are impressive but they have yet to crack the autonomy that would allow them to do a full-time job.OpenAI’s competitors, also flush with billions of dollars to lavish on the same goal, are straining for the tape too. Last month, Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook parentMeta, said development of superintelligence – another theoretical state of AI where a system far exceeds human cognitive abilities – is “now in sight”.OpenAI takes on Meta and DeepSeek with free and customisable AI modelsRead moreGoogle’s AI unit on Tuesday outlined its next step to AGI by announcing anunreleased modelthat trains AIs to interact with a convincing simulation of the real world, while Anthropic, another company making significant advances, announced an upgrade to its Claude Opus 4 model.So where does this leave the race to AGI and superintelligence?Benedict Evans, a tech analyst, says the race towards a theoretical state of AI is taking place against a backdrop of scientific uncertainty – despite the intellectual and financial investment in the quest.Describing AGI as a “thought experiment as much as it is a technology”, he says: “We don’t really have a theoretical model of why generative AI models work so well and what would have to happen for them to get to this state of AGI.”He adds: “It’s like saying ‘we’re building the Apollo programme but we don’t actually know how gravity works or how far away the moon is, or how a rocket works, but if we keep on making the rocket bigger maybe we’ll get there’.“To use the term of the moment, it’s very vibes-based. All of these AI scientists are really just telling us what their personal vibes are on whether we’ll reach this theoretical state – but they don’t know. And that’s what sensible experts say too.”However, Aaron Rosenberg, a partner at venture capital firm Radical Ventures – whose investments include leading AI firm Cohere – and former head of strategy and operations at Google’s AI unit DeepMind, says a more limited definition of AGI could be achieved around the end of the decade.“If you define AGI more narrowly as at least 80th percentile human-level performance in 80% of economically relevant digital tasks, then I think that’s within reach in the next five years,” he says.Matt Murphy, a partner at VC firm Menlo Ventures, says the definition of AGI is a “moving target”.He adds: “I’d say the race will continue to play out for years to come and that definition will keep evolving and the bar being raised.”Even without AGI, the generative AI systems in circulation are making money. The New York Timesreported this monththat OpenAI’s annual recurring revenue has reached $13bn (£10bn), up from $10bn earlier in the summer, and could pass $20bn by the year end. Meanwhile, OpenAI is reportedly in talks about a sale of shares held by current and former employees that would value it at about $500bn,exceeding the price tag for Elon Musk’s SpaceX.Some experts view statements about superintelligent systems as creating unrealistic expectations, while distracting from more immediate concerns such as making sure that systems being deployed now are reliable, transparent and free of bias.“The rush to claim ‘superintelligence’ among the major tech companies reflects more about competitive positioning than actual technical breakthroughs,” says David Bader, director of the institute for data science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From a technical standpoint, we’re seeing impressive improvements in specific capabilities – better reasoning, more sophisticated planning, enhanced multimodal understanding.“But superintelligence, properly defined, would represent systems that exceed human performance across virtually all cognitive domains. We’re nowhere near that threshold.”Nonetheless, the major US tech firms will keep trying to build systems that match or exceed human intelligence at most tasks. Google’s parent Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon alone will spend nearly $400bn this year on AI,according to the Wall Street Journal, comfortably more thanEU members’ defence spend.Rosenberg acknowledges he is a former Google DeepMind employee but says the company has big advantages in data, hardware, infrastructure and an array of products to hone the technology, from search to maps and YouTube. But advantages can be slim.“On the frontier, as soon as an innovation emerges, everyone else is quick to adopt it. It’s hard to gain a huge gap right now,” he says.It is also a global race, or rather a contest, that includes China.DeepSeekcame from nowhere this year to announce the DeepSeek R1 model, boasting of “powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviours” comparable with OpenAI’s best work.Major companies looking to integrate AI into their operations have taken note. Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, uses DeepSeek’s AI technology in its main datacentre and said it was “really making a big difference” to its IT systems and was making the company more efficient.According to Artificial Analysis, a company that ranks AI models, six of the top 20 on its leaderboard – which ranks models according to a range of metrics including intelligence, price and speed – are Chinese. The six models are developed by DeepSeek, Zhipu AI, Alibaba and MiniMax. On the leaderboard for video generation models, six of the top 10 – including the current leader, ByteDance’s Seedance – are also Chinese.Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, whose company has barred use of DeepSeek, told a US senate hearing in May that getting your AI model adopted globally was a key factor in determining which country wins the AI race.“The number one factor that will define whether the US or China wins this race is whose technology is most broadly adopted in the rest of the world,” he said, adding that the lesson from Huawei and 5G was that whoever establishes leadership in a market is “difficult to supplant”.It means that, arguments over the feasibility of superintelligent systems aside, vast amounts of money and talent are being poured into this race in the world’s two largest economies – and tech firms will keep running.“If you look back five years ago to 2020 it was almost blasphemous to say AGI was on the horizon. It was crazy to say that. Now it seems increasingly consensus to say we are on that path,” says Rosenberg.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingOpenAIChatGPTSam AltmanMetaAlphabetanalysisShareReuse this content"

Here’s whyMargaret SullivanI was a public editor at the New York Times, handling complaints from the public. That is a better path than CBS’s oneSat 9 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 9 Aug 2025 16.42 EDTShareFor years before I became the public editor at the New York Times, I admired the work of journalists doing the job of holding their own newsrooms accountable to high standards.And when I heard thatCBSNews would get a position something like that, I thought – briefly – that this could be a positive development. After all, the network’s credibility and independence hascome under fireafter its parent companysettleda frivolous lawsuit brought byDonald Trump. Paramount Global, the CBS parent company, wasbashedforcapitulatingto political pressure in order to get federalapprovalfor a merger with another media company.I quickly changed my mind once I learned the details. This is not a traditional ombudsman but what some have dubbed a “bias monitor” who will receive and evaluate claims of bias in the network’s journalism and report on them to the corporation’s president.We are witnessing the silencing of American media | Robert ReichRead moreAppointing such a person was part of the FCC’s recent approval of Paramount’smergerwith Skydance. Other conditions included agreeing to Trump priorities such as rooting out diversity programs.The new job “seems designed to ensure little critical is aired about the current administration”, said Glenn Kessler, the longtime Washington Post journalist and editor of the Fact Checker, who is now writing a Substacknewsletter.Kessler also noted that the Trump-appointed FCC chair, Brendan Carr, in commenting on the new position, compared it to the creation of an ombudsman decades ago when General Electric bought NBC. Butthatregulator was designed to ensure NBC’s editorial independence and to guard against interference from the new owner, a business conglomerate.In sharp contrast, Kessler told me, this “newfangled ombudsman suggestsCBSwill not have independence from political interference”.Public editors are there to serve the reader and to provide transparency and accountability. It’s to the Guardian’s credit that it maintains a “readers’ editor”; NPR boasts a similar position. Elisabeth Ribbans recentlyunpackedhow the Guardian handled a controversial story about a malnourished child in Gaza; Kelly McBride examined complaints that NPR had failed to give sufficient coverage to anti-Trump demonstrations.But many news organizations have terminated the role, sometimes stating that it is redundant since social media gives voice to critics.I never bought that explanation. Public editors can do something that even the most impassioned outside critics can’t do – get response from internal decision makers, consider all points of view, and publish their conclusions on the very site in which the journalism originally appeared.Decades ago at the Washington Post, Bill Green did an exemplary investigation of how the paper came to publish “Jimmy’s World” – a fabricated story about an eight-year-old heroin addict. The Post gave him free rein and then published his 18,000-word findings over several pages.At the New York Times, Clark Hoyt wrote columns criticizing the overuse of anonymous sources and considering complaints about how the Jerusalem bureau chief’s son had served in the Israeli military.Job requirements for public editors, therefore, include fairness, independence and a thick skin.The Times position was sometimes called “the worst job in journalism” because you were often writing something that would tick off your newsroom colleagues.That didn’t scare me. When I heard, in 2012, that the Times job was going to be open, I applied and got the gig. My nearly four years weren’t easy, but I had the great advantage of a publisher – Arthur O Sulzberger Jr – who believed in the role and supported my work.From 60 Minutes to Colbert, it’s been a dark time for CBS. But there’s a ray of hope | Margaret SullivanRead moreThe best part by far was hearing from Times readers how much they appreciated the opportunity to be heard, and to understand what was going on behind the scenes. I always felt I reported not to the newsroom editors, or to Sulzberger, but to the Times readership.I was disappointed when the paper – on the verge of getting a new publisher in Sulzberger’s son – decided to abolish the role in 2017. By then, I had settled into my new job as Washington Post media columnist; there was no ombudsman there any more. The Post had ended that role a few years earlier.In both cases, I thought it was a loss for readers, for credibility and even for the papers’ own staffs, who often appreciated the work, especially when they weren’t the ones under the magnifying glass.It’s simple, really. As journalists, we hold others to account. A good public editor can do the same for the newsroom itself.But a “bias monitor” set up in a highly politicized environment – as part of corporate maneuvering to clear the path for a merger – is not designed to continue that tradition.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionCBSNewspapers & magazinesNewspaperscommentShareReuse this content"

Blood is on his handsMohamad BazziAt several points during his presidency, Biden could have stopped starvation from spreading in Gaza. He didn’t do thatSat 9 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 9 Aug 2025 06.01 EDTShareIn March 2024, the global authority on food securitywarned that Palestinianswere experiencing “catastrophic levels of hunger”, and famine was imminent in northern Gaza as Israel continued its siege of the territory.That reportwas one of the most direct warnings from the UN and international relief groups, which had been raising alarms about the potential for widespread starvation in Gaza since December 2023.Joe Biden was in the White House at the time, and his administration not only failed to heed those repeated warnings, but it worked to undermine UN agencies and humanitarian groups that tried to focus attention on Israel’s use of starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza. Today, Donald Trump and his administration are deeply complicit in the human-madefamine unfolding in Gaza, but it’s important to remember that US complicity predates Trump – and it’s another stain on Biden’s legacy as president.At several points during his presidency, Biden could have stopped starvation from spreading inGaza, if his administration had listened to warnings from the UN and aid groups and used them as an impetus to limit unconditional US military support for Israel. Biden’s record is not only shocking for the multiple missed opportunities he had to change course, but for his callousness toward the suffering of Palestinians.When will we finally admit: the Gaza death toll is higher than we’ve been told | Arwa MahdawiRead moreTop Israeli officials made no secret of their intention to starve Gaza’s population of 2.2 million, within days of the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. Two days later, Israel’s then defense minister,Yoav Gallant, declared: “I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed.” He added: “We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.” By December 2023, the UN’s hunger monitoring group, Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC),warned in a reportthat more than 1 million people in Gaza were facing widespread starvation within several months unless Israel eased its restrictions on aid.The IPC, which includes the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization and other agencies, was set up in 2004 to sound the global alarm on food shortages and starvation that could lead to famine. (Itdeclared faminesin Somalia in 2011 and South Sudan in 2017, although a formal declaration of famine is retroactive and often lags behind deteriorating conditions on the ground.) Last month,the IPC warnedin an alert that the “worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out” in Gaza, although the group still has not officially declared a famine.In February 2024, Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, warned of the speed and scale of Israel’s mass starvation campaign. “We have never seen a civilian population made to go so hungry so quickly and so completely,”he told the Guardian, echoing reports by UN agencies and humanitarian groups showing that Israel wasdeliberately blocking foodand other aid from entering Gaza, and usingstarvation as a weapon– a war crime under international law.With such detailed warnings, the Biden administration and Israel’s other western supporters could not claim that they didn’t know the severity of hunger in Gaza, and the extent of Israel’s policy ofintentionally starvingPalestinians. As the alarms of imminent famine intensified in the spring of 2024, Biden could have acted by pressuring the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to allow more food into Gaza and enforcing US laws which ban weapons shipments to US allies that obstruct humanitarian aid.Biden did not have to become so deeply complicit in Israel’s war crimes – his administration had the political leverage and legal mechanisms to restrain Netanyahu and end the war, saving thousands of Palestinian lives and many of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Instead, Biden and his aides contorted themselves to keep sendingbillions of dollarsin US weapons that enabled Israel to continue its genocidal war.And in the process of justifying his ineffective and morally bankrupt policies, Biden not only ignored warnings over the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza, he flouted US law and his own administration’s rules. In February 2024, Biden issued a new national security memo that required the state department to certify that recipients of US armswould abide by international lawand allow the delivery of humanitarian aid during active conflicts. The memo relied on existing US laws, especially the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act, which forbids the US government from providing weapons to a country that blocked American humanitarian aid, as Israel haddone repeatedlyduring the Gaza war.By May 2024, the Biden administration had a chance to use that law to restrict its weapons shipments to Israel and pressure Netanyahu into ending the war. Instead, the state department sent a 46-page report to Congress full of bureaucratic double-speak, which avoided concluding that the Israeli militaryhad violated international lawwhile using US weapons or that Israel had obstructed aid from reaching Gaza. If the administration had reached those conclusionsin its report, Biden would have been able to suspend most arms deliveries to Israel, arguing that he was upholding US law. But Biden decided to continue enabling Netanyahu to kill thousands of Palestinians and to expand his siege of Gaza.In October 2024, the Biden administration had another opportunity to change its policy when two of its top officials – then secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and defense secretary, Lloyd Austin –sent a letter to Israeli officialswarning that they must take “concrete measures” to ensure that civilians in northern Gaza had access to food, medicine and other basic needs. US officials threatened that they could suspend military support to Israel if conditions did not improve within 30 days. Despite that ultimatum, the amount of aid reaching Gaza that month had dropped to itslowest level in 11 months.After the US deadline passed in November 2024, the Biden administration did nothing and continued sending weapons to Israel, ignoring international condemnation and US law. As he had done since the Hamas attack in 2023, Biden sheepishly told the world that he would not impose any consequences on Israel, and would continue to protect Netanyahu’s government at the UN and other international bodies.But Biden’s most craven attempt to undermine humanitarian groups working to raise awareness of potential famine in Gaza – and to protect Israel’s indefensible starvation policy – came during his final weeks in office. In late December, the Biden administration forced a US-funded organization, the Famine Early Warning System, toretract a reportthat warned of imminent famine in northern Gaza.At that point, Trump had already won the US presidential election, and Biden no longer faced any political repercussions for breaking with Netanyahu. Yet Biden still couldn’t bring himself to acknowledge the suffering he had enabled Israel to inflict on Palestinians in Gaza. And that is Biden’s legacy: complicity in Israel’s starvation and other war crimes until his last days as president.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsJoe BidenOpinionGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Weird!Sat 9 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 9 Aug 2025 05.01 EDTShareHere’s a sentence I never thought I’d write:Marjorie Taylor Greene, a far-right conspiracy theorist and bigot who also happens to be a Republican congresswoman, has suddenly started to speak (a small amount of) sense. It’s unclear what exactly precipitated it, but the Georgia congresswoman has declared war on her fellow Republicans.“The course that [the Republican party] is on, I don’t want to have anything to do with it,” Greene told the Daily Mail last week.Greene went on to complain that her male colleagues treat their female peers badly, referencing the Trump administration pulling Elise Stefanik’s nomination for United Nations ambassador in favor of Mike Waltz. To refresh your memory, just a couple of months before getting confirmed as US ambassador to the UN, Waltz wasousted as national securityadviser after it was revealed he had mistakenly added a journalist to a private Signal chat used to discuss strikes in Yemen. Weird how some people – and by “people” I mean well-connected white men – have a way of always failing up.“[Stefanik] got screwed by the White House,” Greene told the Mail. “I think there’s other women in our party that are really sick and tired of the way men treat Republican women.” Which is interesting wording: Greene doesn’t seem to care about how Republican men treat women in general, just the ones in the party. Still, baby steps and all that. It’s certainly amusing to see Greene suddenly have a revelation that a party led by alegally defined sexual predatormay have some disturbing views about women.Greene seems to be having a lot of revelations lately: sherecently becamethe first Republican lawmaker to say that there is a genocide happening in Gaza. She also criticized the Florida representative Randy Fine for dismissing a report about Israel’s forced starvation in Gaza as propaganda and writing“starve away”on social media.Fine, by the way,has previously saidGaza should be nuked andposted thatPalestinians are “demons that live on Earth … they only deserve death.” There’s always very little outrage from lawmakers,or media coverage, about his hateful remarks because anti-Palestinian racism is a bipartisan position in the US.To be clear, I don’t think Greene’s comments about Gaza have anything to do with empathy for Palestinians. Unfortunately, I also don’t think her comments were prompted by an analysis of thegrowing consensusfrom respected experts that a genocide is under way. Rather, it’s more likely that Greene, a Christian nationalistwho has a history of promoting Islamophobic and antisemitic conspiracy theories, is motivated by antisemitic impulses here. Let me be unequivocal about this: while she may occasionally be making more sense recently, Greene is no friend to the Palestinian cause specifically or progressive issues more generally.Nevertheless, it’s still fun to watch the congresswoman sow discord in the Republican party by calling for a release of theEpstein files,criticizing US strikes in Iranand denouncing Fox News. On Wednesday, for example, she took aim at the Fox News personalityMark Levin, who called the congresswoman a “lunatic”, by calling Fox News irrelevant.“[M]ost of the people that watch Fox News are very much up in age, the baby boomer generation, who I love … but that’s their biggest audience. That’s not the future of America,” the congresswoman said. That statement echoes comments shemadeto the former Florida Republican lawmaker Matt Gaetzin June, when she called Fox News and the New York Post “propaganda” and “neocon network news”.In that same conversation she said: “We have propaganda news on our side, just like the left does, and the American people have been brainwashed into believing that America has to engage in these foreign wars in order for us to survive, and it’s absolutely not true.”Keep going, Marjorie! While I can’t stress enough that MTG is no ally, that doesn’t mean she’s not an accidental asset when it comes to destroying the Republican party. I’ve lost any hope that the Democrats, a party that largely consists of self-interested careerists who don’t believe in much other than their own advancementandarehappytohelp fund a genocide, will mount any sort of meaningful fight against the worst instincts of Trumpism. When Maga eventually collapses it will be frominfighting, not Democratic opposition.Trump names registered sex offender to lead children’s sports initiativeLawrence Taylor, a former New York Giants linebacker and registered sex offender has been appointed to a council that willadvise on mattersincluding youth sports.

Responding to my column, Rachel Taylor, executive director ofEvery Casualty Counts, an international NGO that works to document casualties of armed violence, pointed out the following: “The Gaza population register is managed by theIsraeli ministry of interior– they certify all births and deaths in Gaza.

However, given the absence of a viable Palestinian government and overt resistance from the Israeli government, any such solution has been little more than a default talking point used by western politicians for some time.According to Pew Research,only 21% of Israeli adultsthink Israel and a Palestinian state can coexist peacefully – a historic low.But what’s the alternative?Western governments are forcing it now, because of global outrage at the appalling humanitarian situation includingstarvation in Gaza, with recognition of a Palestinian state being used as a carrot for the Palestinians and a stick for the Israelis to begin such a process.What would recognition mean?The time for Australia to recognise the state of Palestine is right now | Ed HusicRead moreIn Australia, Anthony Albanese is right to point tothe need for “action not slogans”amid the push from the public and some on his own backbench,particularly the former minister Ed Husic, in the face of horrific images from Gaza.Recognition of Palestine statehood may be a way of responding to public sentiment without imposing substantive sanctions on Israel in response to its breaches of international humanitarian law. It may well be a means to an end but it would need to be coupled with other extensive measures to create any pathway to peace, and even then it’s contingent on so many unlikely commitments from both Hamas and Israel that it may be doomed.The pressure on Australia comes as its allies France, the UK and Canada have all indicated willingness to formally recognise a state of Palestine as soon as next month.This is not simple, in any respect.Hamas has set the tone, demanding “unconditional international recognition” of an independent Palestinian state.Under a French/Saudi proposal, backed by the EU and other Arab nations, a temporary international mission would step in to stabilise the situation.The various conditions and actions outlined by those nations flagging Palestinian recognition borrow some elements of the Arab peace initiative, which has been tossed back and forth since the early 2000s due to various sticking points including the return of Palestinian refugees.While removing Hamas from Gaza is one critical step, democracy building to avoid a dangerous void in governance is anotherWhile Benjamin Netanyahu has signalled some willingness to negotiate with Arab nations, he has previously rejected that plan.Canadahas also demanded electionsin the Palestinian territories next year that exclude Hamas.The last parliamentary election in the territories was in 2006, with the Palestinian Authority since then controlling parts of the West Bank under Mahmoud Abbas, and Hamas controllingGaza. Even if all the other conditions were miraculously met on both sides, holding a viable democratic election within 12 months would be a mammoth practical challenge as well as a diplomatic one.This is just one of many serious roadblocks to progress and is a space where Australia could have impact if Albanese is serious about action over slogans. He says Australia is a small player in this.But offering development assistance and expertise in conjunction with other nations could help. Statehood, for example, would offer the opportunity for a full Australian embassy in Palestine, a potential vehicle for hand-in-hand work to help build a new leadership framework.With or without statehood, while removing Hamas from Gaza is one critical step, democracy building to avoid a dangerous void in governance is another.During an Australian parliamentary visit to Israel and the West Bank in August 2023 – just before the Hamas attacks – I joined a meeting with a particularly dynamic aspiring political candidate in Ramallah. She said new leaders and fresh political thinkers were often shut out of the closed-shop Palestinian Authority.As it stands the authority has neither the mandate nor the logistical resources to lead the immense political change and rebuild required.Equally problematic is getting the Netanyahu government to agree to any of the conditions, when its hardline rightwing members have threatened to walkeven over a ceasefire, let alone a permanent pathway to peace.For once, Albanese’s characteristic pragmatic caution seems right, recognising both the opportunity to apply pressure while also acknowledging the limits to Australia’s influence on what has so far been an intractable conflict.Zoe Danielis a three-time ABC foreign correspondent and former independent member for GoldsteinExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionPalestinian territoriesGazaIsraelAustralian politicsAnthony AlbaneseZoe DanielcommentShareReuse this content"

Or so it seems, considering how often that word is thrown around in public life these days.This year alone, Zarah Sultana, the former Labour MP and founder of a new left party with Jeremy Corbyn, called the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, a “billionaire-backed grifter” (perhaps borrowing from thelanguage of Coutts staffwho referred to him as a “disingenuous grifter” when his bank account was closed two years ago). Sultana, in turn, was accused of being a“grifter” duping “honest socialists”by the journalist Paul Mason.When giving evidence at the Covid inquiry, the Spectatoreditor and former cabinet minister, Michael Gove, called the lawyer Jolyon Maugham, whose Good Law Project campaign group pursued PPE contract cases, a “politically motivated grifter”. Meanwhile, the journalist and author James Ball accused the New York University history professor Ruth Ben-Ghiat of“resistance grift”for suggesting the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, is trying to control the population by spreading disease.In a recent podcast, the Atlantic writer David Frum called Donald Trump’s presidencythe “grift machine”, while the US president was alsocalled “grifter-in-chief”by Florida congressman Maxwell Frost. Two years ago, it was the Sussexes who were memorablycalled “fucking grifters”by Spotify’s head of podcast innovation, Bill Simmons, after their multiyear deal with the platform ended after just 12 episodes.From 2017-24, the written use of the word “grifter” has more than doubled, according to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). But over the past few months in particular, it has been striking how often the term – both grifter and grift – is cropping up in our political discourse. In April this year, it made its debut in parliament: it wasused in a House of Commons debateon the impact of digital platforms on democracy by the Liberal Democrat MP for Cheltenham, Max Wilkinson. “You find a mad and hateful narrative. You tell everyone it is free speech, and before you know it, you might be lucky enough to become a successful online grifter with your top off,” he said. “Perhaps you will be an MP, or maybe even the president of America.”“Grifter”, according to the OED, is a variant of the US slang “grafter”: someone who “makes money by shady or dishonest means; a thief; a swindler” – or “one who practises ‘graft’, especially in public life; a politician, official, etc, who misuses his or her position in order to reap dishonest gain or advantage”. That second meaning has clearly captured the political zeitgeist. “It’s a kind of shorthand for inviting suspicion about the methods and motivations of someone with an opposing viewpoint,” Fiona McPherson, an executive editor at the OED, told me.Why is it that we’re not only disagreeing with our political opponents, but assuming they are con artists somehow profiting from what we deem to be their bad opinions, policies and rhetorical style? Spivs who are in it for nefarious ends rather than simply wrong-headed?When you search the term “grifter” on sites such as Reddit and TikTok, it is often used in relation to influencers – wellness gurus, pickup artists, life coaches, crypto bros. So many online subcultures now dabble in essentially the same business model: sowing insecurity and then charging people with the promise to rid them of it. Wherever the algorithm leads you, from sleep coaches for knackered new mums to gym rats for lonely boys, you are likely being exposed, day in, day out, to some form of grift.When politicians themselves mimic such influencers – Farage and the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, for example, now trade into-camera vertical videosthat gain millions of views – it is hard to ignore the similarities. Suspicions of British politicians’ motives in general are high, sparked by the 2009expenses scandaland intensifying over the past few years ofcrony Covid contractsand ministersbagging freebies.View image in fullscreenRobert Jenrick engages with a man he claims has dodged a fare in a video made for social media at King’s Cross station.Photograph: @RobertJenrickThe rise of the “true scam” genre also reveals our morbid fascination with grift. From theTinder SwindlertoFyre festival, andTheranosto theCaptain Tom Foundation, stories of the hubris and humiliation of people perceived to be on the make with our money dominate TV documentaries, long-form journalism and investigative podcasts. All this and you can barely open your banking app today without warnings about the nefarious means used by scammers to winkle money out of you. Fraud is themost common crimein England and Wales, with the highest number of casesrecorded last year.In the resulting atmosphere of ambient paranoia, perhaps it’s little wonder we’re on the lookout for “grifters” – and why the insult appears to resonate. So welcome to the Age of Grift: if you’re not spotting it, you’re probably on the end of it.Anoosh Chakelian is Britain editor of the New StatesmanExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionSocial mediaDigital mediaScamsConsumer affairscommentShareReuse this content"

Bad political decisions made it soDaniel TrillingIn the frenzy of racism and culture warring, the issue of why hotels are used gets overlookedSat 9 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 9 Aug 2025 03.58 EDTShareAbroad section of Britain’s right has spent the summer behaving as if it would like a repeat of last year’s racist riots. As politicians and commentators cry “tinderbox Britain” – are they warning us, or willing it on? – far-right extremists have been actively trying to stoke violence. This year, they have pinned their hopes on asylum hotels, an issue where public fears over crime, immigration and the welfare state conveniently converge.In some places, far-right activists have piggybacked on protests prompted by local grievances. The most significant this year wasin Epping, Essex, after an alleged sexual assault by an asylum seeker led to demonstrations that turned violent when they were joined by members of various far-right groups. A similar pattern has unfolded in London’s Canary Wharf,after untrue rumoursthat some of the Epping hotel residents were being moved there. In other cases, far-right activists have themselves organised the protests. A call has gone out among their online networks for gatherings this weekend in several parts of England.It is unlikely – though not impossible – that the end result will be on the scale of the riots we saw last summer, since that was triggered by a shocking act of murder followed by widespread misinformation and conspiracy theories about the identity of the killer. But anti-fascist campaigners I’ve spoken to believe it may cause lower-level disturbances like those seen in Epping and inKnowsley, Merseyside, in 2023, and it will certainly help ensure that asylum hotels remain a contentious topic for many months to come.One question, however, often goes unanswered: why are asylum seekers being accommodated in hotels in the first place? Before 2020, the phenomenon hardly existed, yet by its peak in 2023 there weremore than 55,000 peoplein hotels, waiting many months to have their asylum claims processed. (Today the number has dropped to about 30,000.)For some, the answer will be: “because there are too many people seeking asylum in the UK and we don’t have the resources to support them”. This is misleading. Although Britain has seen higher numbers of asylum applications in recent years, according toOxford University’s Migration Observatorythey are not exceptional when compared with those of other European countries. Yet the UK relies on costly hotel accommodation far more heavily than any of its neighbours.A series of actions by both Labour and Conservative governments since the turn of the century has brought us to this point. The first was the decision by Tony Blair’s government to make people seeking asylum heavily reliant on state support. Until mid-2002, asylum seekers could take up jobs if they had to wait more than six months for an initial decision on their asylum claim. Much of the press disliked this, saying it allowed asylum seekers to take other people’s jobs. So the government in effectbanned them from working. (In many other European countries, people seeking asylum are still allowed to work after a waiting period.)If a government bans people from working then it needs to provide them with essential support, unless it is happy for them to starve to death on the streets. At first, accommodation waslargely providedby local councils’ housing departments. But politicians took a second decision, which was to privatise the accommodation. This began in the late 2000s, but the really important step was taken by David Cameron and Nick Clegg’s coalition government.In 2012, as part of the coalition’s wider austerity drive,asylum accommodation was outsourcedto the same profit-driven contractors that now run many of our public services. The contractors often failed to provide decent housing or value for money and the government had torewrite the contracts. Even then, problems persisted: by the end of the decade, it was becomingincreasingly commonto house asylum seekers in “contingency accommodation” such as short-term lets and hotels.The third decision, taken by the governments of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, was to sabotage the asylum system itself. During the first Covid lockdown in 2020, people seeking asylum were placed in hotels – which, at the time, were largely empty anyway –for public health reasons. This coincided with a rise in the number of people crossing the Channel by small boat, as opposed to stowing away in lorries as they had largely done previously. (Many people who choose such routes do so because they do not have the option of a safe resettlement scheme, such as the one the UK has offered to Ukrainian refugees.)The Conservative government encouraged hostility towards small boat journeys,describing themas an “invasion”. Instead of moving asylum seekers out of hotels and into more suitable accommodation when the pandemic subsided, it kept them there while it builtprison-likeencampmentsas an alternative. (These schemes mostly never got off the ground.) At the same time, it allowed abacklog of asylum applicationsto grow – and thentried to banmany asylum seekers from claiming asylum at all, saying it would instead deport them permanently to Rwanda. (That scheme never got off the ground either.)All the above has led to more asylum seekers living in more hotels for longer, in more parts of the country. At its root, it is a story of public penny-pinching and market forces causing a problem that is then made worse by politicians promising a quick fix or finding a convenient scapegoat. If that sounds familiar then perhaps it’s because it’s a story we also find in our hospitals, schools and wider communities.This could be an occasion to ask what has gone wrong with the state more generally, and to talk about what could be done to make it work better for everyone. Keir Starmer’s governmenthas promisedto end the use of hotels by 2029, by investing in the asylum system and reducing small boat journeys. But if it is unwilling to have that wider conversation, then the right is ready with its own seductive, destructive answers.Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe and Bloody Nasty People: The Rise of Britain’s Far RightDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But that was before I saw first-hand where most of the UK’s imported berries come from. The working conditions of migrant farm workers in southern Spain were something I never thought I would see in a European country. While others flounder,the Spanish economy is booming, in large part thanks to unusually high migration levels – but too many of the people propping it up are being treated disgracefully.At the end of Huelva’s berry-growing season in April, I sat having lunch at a roadside restaurant in town, as an endless stream of trailers with fruit logos on the side thundered past. At peak times, 2,000 of these lorries leave Huelva every day, laden with berries destined for the European market.More than 60%of the strawberries British people eat in winter were grown in the polytunnels in Huelva.The 11,000-hectare (27,000-acre) sprawl there is surrounded by roughly 40chabolas,makeshift slums housing thousands of migrant workers. According to Diego Cañamero, co-founder of Soc-Sat, the Andalusian Workers’ Union, 40% of Huelva’s seasonal work force of 100,000 are undocumented. Without paperwork, the workers cannot rent accommodation, and so thousands are forced to live in shacks made of scraps scavenged from waste dumps,with no running water or electricity.Cañamero put me in touch with a local union official, who took me around the enormous sprawl of polytunnels and surroundingchabolas.He asked not to be named – he told me he had been attacked because of his organising efforts. Spain’s berry exports are worth upwards of£1.5bn a year, so there are powerful forces at work here. Indeed, it didn’t take long before our car was being followed. At some farms, often with no company name displayed, we were welcomed by workers, but some were hostile, unwilling to speak to a journalist for fear of losing their jobs.In 2019, the union receivedmore than 1,000 complaintsrelated to working conditions in Huelva. Six years on, things have not improved. There are farms that treat their workers fairly and pay a decent wage, but most don’t, my union guide said. Most berry pickers are from Morocco and sub-Saharan Africa, but there are also South Americans and eastern Europeans.Research conducted by Ethical Consumerin 2023 found that workers are often paid less than the Spanish minimum daily wage of about £45, and are regularly required to work overtime without pay.Two Moroccan women took me into their dwelling, a shipping container in a forest clearing between broken-down cars and washing lines. They spoke no Spanish or English, but when one pointed to a stinking hole in the floor and said “kaka”, the mosquitoes and flies spoke for themselves. In Huelva, the rightwing myth of migrants stealing jobs is dispelled; few if any Spaniards would work under these slavery-like conditions. This has not stopped Spain’s far-right party Vox proposing a new Trump-inspiredplan for mass deportations.Inside the vast expanse of polytunnels, pesticides keep insects at bay. I witnessed workers wearing no protective clothing or masks while spraying the plants with these chemicals. The heat was fierce, but many farm bosses don’t allow workers to bring in bottled water, claiming it could ruin the crops. Some labourers are electronically monitored, and are deducted pay for low efficiency and toilet breaks, according to the 2024 documentaryThe Invisibles: Modern Slavery in Europe. I also met women on two-hour walks from their slums to the nearest shop, wary of hitchhiking because of several incidents of sexual harassment.Spain has an estimated 9.3 million foreign-born people,almost 20% of the population. Andaccording to economists at JP Morgan, the country’s unusually pro-migration stance has been critical to its low unemployment levels and soaring GDP, as migrant workers fill the gaps left by an ageing Spanish population – in particular, in the critical industries of tourism and agriculture. Indeed, it is doing so well that The Economist named it thebest in the worldin 2024.But who is looking out for the workers who are suffering so that their host country can thrive, and the rest of Europe can eat summer fruits in the depths of winter? Roughly600,000 of Spain’s migrant workers are undocumented– although Pedro Sánchez’s government has pledged to naturalise 300,000 of them every year, which could be a step in the right direction to improve their working conditions.It will need a concerted effort to alleviate the miserable situation many workers are trapped in. The trade union has proposed much stronger regulation of agricultural employment, with a requirement for companies employing foreign workers to ensure they have a basic level of housing and a living wage. So far, Cañamero told me, they have been met with total silence. The Spanish labour ministry says it carried outmore than 4,000 inspectionsin Huelva in 2022, issuing €1.6m worth of fines.Unfortunately, farm bosses are often alerted to these inspections beforehand. Soc-Sat has proposed to the ministry of labour that they carry them out unannounced, but to no avail. Nothing ever seems to change there, my union guide told me, even after 20 years of journalists documenting the strawberry-pickers’ undignified conditions.While Spain celebrates its widely envied GDP growth and the plaudits of the economic establishment, and Europe’s supermarkets count the profits from year-round grocery sales, the people doing the punishing work that supports it are suffering appalling working conditions and living in slums. These imported strawberries should leave a bitter taste in all our mouths.Tone Sutterud is a freelance human rights and environment journalist and translatorExplore more on these topicsSpainOpinionFruitEuropeFarmingFoodWorkers' rightscommentShareReuse this content"

Despite facing heartbreak and press intrusion, he’s ‘feeling Zen’ as he turns 40 – and about to step it up a gear with two epic new showsSat 9 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTShareTwo days before we meet, James Norton turned 40. To celebrate, he threw a massive party at his home in north-east London – and he’s still feeling the effects. “I didn’t get any sleep,” he admits, “and yesterday was just a huge clear-up, so if I struggle for a word or an anecdote, please forgive me.”To be fair, I’ve seen Norton in worse shape. The last time I encountered him in person he was naked, crawling around on all fours while being spat at. “Oh, yeah,” he smiles, realising I’m talking about his performance as Jude in the2023 stage versionof A Little Life. In that play, an adaptation of Hanya Yanagihara’s cult tragic novel, he remained on stage at the Savoy theatre in London for its whopping three-and-a-half-hour length, fully immersed in a character who suffers an immense, seemingly never-ending ordeal of sexual abuse and self-­harm. “That was a proper … ” He trails off and exhales. “That was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.”Norton has talked in the past about how playing Jude took it out of him – he would find himself unable to stop crying, or rendered catatonic. Despite all this, the moment the play ended he thought, “What if that’s it? What if it’s never as challenging again? It’s like those people who run a marathon, it nearly kills them, and then two weeks later they want to sign up for another.”‘Smooth with a sinister edge’: readers on who the next James Bond should beRead moreThis is what we’re here to talk about today: the career equivalent of that second marathon. For Norton, it’s two huge TV projects, the kind that could turn him from one of Britain’s most admired actors – known for playing complex men in shows such asHappy Valleyand films such asMr Jones– into a global name (not for nothing have rumours persisted that he could be the next Bond). First is King & Conqueror, the new BBC drama he has been working on with his production company, Rabbit Track, for seven years. It tells the epic story of 1066 and the battle between Harold Godwinson (Norton) and William, Duke of Normandy (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) for the English crown. Then there’s House of Guinness, a glossy Netflix drama about the Irish stout dynasty, written by Steven Knight who made Peaky Blinders. They are landing at a moment that feels transformative for the actor – and not only because of any just-turned-40 jitters.A few years ago, Norton had been worried that acting was frivolous – “dressing up and fucking around” as he puts it. But A Little Life made him realise that, no, it has a purpose. He would meet real-life abuse survivors at the stage door every night and learn how important the show had been for them. It made him think about his own past, as a victim of bullies while a young teen at boarding school. And by literally baring all on stage, he became more open, even if said openness – such as spilling his feelings about his 2023 split with former fiancee and fellow actor Imogen Poots, during a panel at this year’s Glastonbury festival, which went viral on TikTok – sometimes leaves him feeling exposed. “If I’d known there was a journalist in the audience I probably wouldn’t have been so honest,” he says with a smile. “I’m realising more and more everyone has a fucking phone.”We meet in Ham Yard, fittingly the same Soho hotel where Norton celebrated A Little Life’s closing party. He cycled here alone and I spot him wandering around the bar, looking for someone who might feasibly be a journalist. In his baggy trousers and T-shirt, he makes for cheerful, relaxed company, though he assures me he often turns up to interviews dripping in sweat from having pedalled frantically to make it on time. He has a puppyish enthusiasm for his work and when he smiles – which is often – his eyes crinkle up and close. When a passing woman interrupts us to tell him, “I think you’re an amazing actor,” he bashfully thanks her before turning to me and pretending he’s writing this piece: “And at this point, the actor’s mum turns up.”View image in fullscreen‘Too much time and space makes me slightly inert.’ Photograph: Silvana Trevale/The Guardian. Clothes:Dior MenNorton orders tea – Earl Grey with a spot of oat milk – and tells me about King & Conqueror. “I put my hands up and admit I didn’t know the story at all,” he says. “I just had a vague gloss of it from school. I wasn’t aware of the relationship Harold and William had before the battle, that they were friends and allies for many years before they realised that, because of the way Europe was being carved up, they would both inevitably end up on a battlefield – and one of them would have to die.”The Rest Is History podcast once compared the events leading up to 1066 to Game of Thrones, and Norton agrees. “It’s mad to think nobody has really done it before,” he says. “And that’s one of the reasons we spent so long developing it.”Producing is clearly new territory for Norton. King & Conqueror was shot in Iceland, and he found himself struggling with concepts that don’t normally intrude on an actor’s consciousness, such as budget. “It’s the closest I’ve ever come to feeling like I’d bitten off too much,” Norton says. “I started using the word ‘burnout’, which is just, like, oh God.” He likes to play down any struggles he talks about, hyper aware people may be thinking, “Oh, give it a rest, you’re making television.” But he’s also keen to point out that being under pressure is really his ideal performance state: “I just do better. Too much time and space makes me slightly inert.”I remember a director saying, ‘Can you be a bit more charismatic?’ That’s hard to do when you're young and self-consciousFar less stressful, he says, is his forthcoming role – purely as an actor – in House of Guinness. No budget worries here: he plays Sean Rafferty, a whip-cracking hardman who keeps the stout company’s workers in line while the Guinness siblings fall into a Succession-style squabble over inheritance, sparked by their father Sir Benjamin’s devilishly crafted will. Norton – who used a special accent coach to nail not only the area (Dublin) but also the period (mid-19th century) – says an awful lot of Guinness 0.0 was consumed on set. And off set?“We shot it in Liverpool, which is full of good Irish pubs. So, yeah, we were splitting the Gs and all that.” He’s referring to the art of making sure your first gulp of Guinness leaves the pint settled at the “G” on the branded glass. Did he perfect it? “IthinkI did,” he says, sounding very unsure. “It usually happened later in the night. I mean … I’ve got vague memories of jumping around a pub.”Whether on or off camera, Norton feels comfortable at the centre of the action these days, which hasn’t always been the case. Back when he was starting out as an actor, he auditioned for Fifty Shades of Grey. “And I remember the director saying, ‘Can you be a bit morecharismatic?’” He laughs. “That’s the hardest thing to just try and do! Especially since I was too young and self-conscious to even really know what she meant.”These days, he thinks he has acquired the age and experience to perform a darkly magnetic character such as Rafferty. “And it felt great,” he says. “Because it taps into that alter ego of who you’d love to be. He’s violent, but he’s romantic, too. There’s a thug in all of us.”View image in fullscreenIn Happy Valley with Sarah Lancashire …Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyView image in fullscreenin A Little Life Luke Thompson …Photograph: Jan VersweyveldView image in fullscreenand in King & Conqueror.Photograph: BBC/Rabbit Track Pictures/RVK Studios/The Development Company/Shepherd Content/CBS Studios/Lila JonsNorton portrayed one of the great villains of British television in Happy Valley’s Tommy Lee Royce. The character he helped create – charming, psychopathic, but in glimpses vulnerable, too – is what he does perfectly. His roles often strike a nerve because they wrestle with the pressures and flaws of modern masculinity.The secret to playing a character like Royce, he says, is that you have to like them on some level. “In the early stages, someone like Tommy was defined only by cruelty and violence, when in fact he’s defined by damage, trauma and fear. So the way in is trying to separate acts that are inherently abhorrent and unforgivable from the context. And the context is that, nearly always, anyone capable of that type of cruelty has been subjected to cruelty. So he’s just a deeply sad, damaged man. Maybe ‘like’ is the wrong word, but empathy for sure.”Happy Valley made Norton a household name, but he says he has been lucky that his career has involved big next steps rather than giant leaps that might have left him out of his depth. He started in theatre, and did some guest days on TV and film, before Happy Valley was followed by shows such as Grantchester, in which he played sleuthing vicar Sidney Chambers, andMcMafia, as the son of a Russian mafia boss living in London. Then came the chance to do A Little Life. The thought of playing the lead terrified Norton – which was the reason Poots and his agent told him he had to do it.If playing Jude was gruelling, there were other factors that made it even harder for Norton. At 22 he was diagnosed with diabetes and, as a result, is constantly hooked up via Bluetooth to a glucose monitor (he has to self-inject up to 15 times a day). For A Little Life he carefully stashed sugar gels around the stage to help him stay on top of things. If the Bluetooth failed, a stage manager would be on alert to get the message to him. “Someone might be doing an intimate scene with me, or something violent, and when they were close up they’d whisper ‘three point two’, then carry on. It was intense.”View image in fullscreen‘I want to be honest but I don’t want to talk about my relationships at all.’ Photograph: Silvana Trevale/The Guardian. Clothes:Saint LaurentOn only one occasion did Norton fail to respond in time. “One horrible thing about having a hypoglycemic moment is you get a kind of clarity at first, which makes you think you don’t need sugar. Then what happens next is like a sort of terrible psychedelic trip, where you’re so confused you don’t know where you are.” It happened during a scene where he was required to run around the stage. “It was terrifying. I was dripping with sweat, dropping my lines, confused. The actors could all tell something wasn’t right.”When the play first opened, some audience members disobeyed the strict no-cameras rule and snapped Norton during his naked scenes – photos even ended upappearing on MailOnline. He must have felt violated?“Yeah … I mean, violated is probably too strong. My strongest memory is that it was just a bit sad, a bit gross, this idea that it would be framed in a kind of titillating way when the subject matter was so clearly vicious and upsetting. But I think the reaction, generally, was that it was misjudged, which was gratifying.”I don’t like it when I’m photographed with a friend walking down the street and it’s told the next day like it’s a romanceThe naked scenes caused a lot of noise around the show. Norton said at the time he thought “as a culture”, we are “scared of the penis”, though he thinks we have since become a lot better at accepting male nudity on screen. Have we, though, I wonder? The biggest (excuse the pun) example of male nudity I can think of is The White Lotus, which involved the use of giant prosthetic ones. If those are what we’re all looking at, no wonder society is scared of the penis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s like in Pam & Tommy, where there’s an animatronic penis that talks.” He laughs while considering his position on all of this. “I can say that I have never had a prostheticoran animatronic penis. All my penis work is my own.”He falls silent. “Oh shit, that’s going to be the headline, isn’t it? Do I need to call my publicist?”Norton was born in south London but grew up in Malton, North Yorkshire. He has described his childhood as “idyllic” but that’s not exactly true. He was sent to boarding school and found himself being tormented by bullies there. “It’s that thing where a lot of boys are having separation anxiety, feelings of fear and confusion as to why they’ve been taken out of their home at the age of 11,” he says. “A lot of people retreat into themselves, and others deal with that same confusion by doing that Lord of the Flies thing and becoming the bully. I was young for my year and I became an exciting target because I would react to things that were thrown my way. I didn’t have the self-awareness to just go: whatever.”Norton has a tendency to play it down, but he acknowledges that the scars have stayed with him. “Oh, for sure. It’s something that is part of the jigsaw puzzle of my 40-now years.” In fact, part of the reason he took on the role of Jude was that he thought it might somehow rid him of the bullied child within. Did it go deeper than that: did he see fame as an act of revenge on the bullies?“There’s a sort of byproduct to the acting thing, which is that the barometer of your success is the public reaction,” he says. “That can get hijacked by parts of your personality which are needing affirmation, which we all have. That part of me is gratified by the feeling of being on a billboard or whatever. Then you step away from that and realise it’s not going to really get rid of that need for affirmation, because nothing will.”View image in fullscreen‘All my penis work is my own.’ Photograph: Silvana Trevale/The Guardian. Clothes and watch:Louis VuittonNorton thought he had a decent gauge when it came to not letting work intrude on his personal life. “I’ve always been clear about it taking up too much space at the expense of relationships and friendships,” he says. “But A Little Life, more than any other job, was where that didn’t happen. It took everything out of me.”As an outside observer, it’s hard not to wonder if the pressure he put himself under contributed to his split with Poots after six years. But he says no. “That happened naturally and amicably. Two actors going out is always challenging because of scheduling. We were travelling a lot. And that was one of many factors that brought a very happy relationship to an end.”Norton has given a decent impression of a man pretty comfortable with all aspects of fame – but since the split he has found the attention on his love life oppressive. “I’ve always tried to balance authenticity with privacy,” he says. “I want to be honest but I don’t want to talk about my relationships at all and I don’t like it when I get photographed with a friend walking down the street and it’s then told the next day like it’s a romance. Another romance!”‘Torture porn or serious literature?’: the love-hate phenomenon of cult novel A Little LifeRead moreThe week before we meet there has indeed been tabloid speculation about various women in Norton’s life. He was photographed with the socialite Flora Huddart; before that he was hanging out at the Lido festival in London with Lily Allen. “Snogging”, one tabloid reported, although if you actually looked at the pictures … “I’m not snogging them! Funny that, isn’t it?” he says. Norton is laughing while we discuss this, but there’s a subtle vibe shift in the room. Five minutes ago it felt as if he would have happily sat here chatting away for hours. Now, maybe he has an eye on the clock.“Look,” he says, “I’m a man in London going on occasional dates, meeting people, living my life, and it’s kind of no one’s business really.”Which is, of course, fair enough. The only reason he talked about his romantic life at Glastonbury, he says, was because Annie Mac asked him if he had experienced any big life changes, and he always tries to answer things honestly. “I was like, well, I had a breakup and that was a massive change.” He says he has been fortunate to go through life without having to deal with any major grief, but that he came to realise the split was a kind of grief in itself. “I lost the person,” he told the crowd, “but I also lost the life I was about to lead, the kids we had named, all that kind of stuff.”It probably didn’t help matters that, as he approached 40, Norton was starting to pick up roles as dads in shows such as Playing Nice (he calls it his “sad dad era”). “If you’d asked me at 25, I probably thought I might have a kid by 40,” he says. “But equally, I had a fucking great 30s, and hopefully kids might still be in my life at some point. That’s the privilege of being a man and not having to worry about my biological clock.” In a way, he says, he’s more relaxed now than he was a decade ago when everyone around him started having kids. “I think I did feel that pressure to get on the train, do the same thing.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Silvana Trevale/The Guardian. Styling throughout: Lewis Munro. Grooming: Petra Sellge at The Wall Group. Prop stylist: Grace Snellock. Top:Simone Rocha. Trousers:Solid Homme. Socks:Uniqlo. Shoes:Dr MartensIf Norton sounds Zen about it all now, there are good reasons why. After the split from Poots he went to Plum Village, a Buddhist retreat in France set up by the Vietnamese monk and activist Thích Nhat Hanh. Norton actually studied theology at Cambridge before he trained at Rada, specialising in Buddhist and Hindu faith, and as a teenager he had a period where he became “very committed” to Catholicism. But this is different, he says. “With Buddhism, you don’t really talk about faith. The teaching isn’t about worship. It’s about the self. It’s about one’s own journey and experience of the world. And it’s been amazing for me. It’s an incredible community and it’s given me an opportunity to just stop and recognise the value of quiet, peaceful space, which I don’t often give myself in life. Even just to rest and sleep. I think for a lot of my younger years I thought inaction and stasis was just a waste of time.”There’s certainly nottoomuch sleep or rest going on. Norton’s new producing gig is almost a full-time job, and a different one. “I sit at a desk, discuss ideas and read scripts. It’s broader and more empowering than just turning up very late in the development process as an actor.” He will be appearing in about half of the shows Rabbit Track produce, and there are other gigs, too – he has been filming Sunny Dancer, a British comedy about a teenage cancer survivor going to “chemo camp”, and will appear as Ormund Hightower, leading a march on King’s Landing, in season three of House of the Dragon.Norton has been generous with his time, but it’s the moment to wrap things up. I sense a hint of relief that there will be no more prying questions. “Was that OK?” I ask. “Or was it a bit … ” “Yeah, you went close,” he says, laughing.It’s only later that I start to wonder what he meant by that. I went close … to what, exactly? Him storming out? Throwing me a Tommy Lee Royce-style punch before drenching me in Earl Grey and oat milk? It’s all rather hard to imagine. The James Norton of today seems to be able to smile gracefully, suck up any negativity and take it all in his stride. He seems extremely content; secure in his own skin while restlessly creative. And all of that with a whopping hangover.King & Conqueror airs on BBC One and iPlayer from24 August. House of Guinness is on Netflix in September.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaActingHappy ValleyMcMafiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He hadn’t seen any of the Alien films, though. He hadn’t seenAlienorAliensorAlien 3, he hadn’t seen any of thePredator crossover canon, he hadn’t seen Resurrection orPrometheusor theone afterPrometheus. He hadn’t even seenAlien: Romulus, even though it’s named after the guy who co-founded Rome. The Oscar-winning franchise has earned well over a billion dollars worldwide. There’s nothing more human than loving Alien.Part of the franchise’s success is its malleability. A creature-horror stuffed with Freudian nightmare, the films blend action, sci-fi, theology and satire. (I don’t want to be Frankenstein’s Pedant about it, but the monster is the profit-driven corporation determined to bring the alien to Earth to develop as a biological weapon.) Now that the IP belongs to Disney, we should expect many more instalments. But can they keep stretching the story into exciting shapes? Or are the days of Alien: Below Decks or The Real Housewives of Moon LV-426 upon us?View image in fullscreenCreep show … Timothy Olyphant in Alien: Earth.Photograph: Patrick Brown/FXThankfully, they’ve given control of Alien: Earth (Disney+, from Wednesday 12 August) to writer-directorNoah Hawley, the TV genius responsible forFargoand the dazzlingly ambitious Marvel series Legion. He takes us back a few years before the start of the first film, to an Earth run by a consortium of five tech companies. A deep space research vessel belonging to Weyland-Yutani, AKA Baddy Corp, crash-lands into a building owned by rival Prodigy. Guess what – there’s a very, very bad dog on board, and the Jurassic ovoids being transported? Not Kinder Eggs.The Alien movies’ main creature, the xenomorph, remains mesmerising. Rather than making an eight-hour slasher movie, Hawley uses its threat to explore a story about identity, the limits of AI and human weakness. An intriguing character is Boy Kavalier, the founder of Prodigy. To capture Weyland-Yutani’s extraterrestrial IP, he sends a party of his new creations: Hybrids. We see him secretly transferring the consciousness of terminally ill children into synthetic bodies, with tremendous strength and upgradable minds. Thank God our tech leaders are more responsible!This is one of my favourite tropes: evil genius motivated by lonely boredom. Boy Kavalier, who resembles Richard Hammond in a Bob Dylan wig, has created a new species simply because he wants someone to have an interesting conversation with. No one gets him. There is a twisted romance to that idea, if far-fetched. I mean, what does Elon Musk want? Someone to laugh at his jokes? Maybe that’s the same thing.The Hybrids are a great creation. Watching them, I was reminded of The Secret Life of 4 Year Olds. That documentary showed us infants playing, tracing the growth of recognisably adult behaviour. Kavalier’s prototypes kill and jump off cliffs, charged by lithium batteries that would power a city. Yet in the aftermath they are confused, worried about getting in trouble. They’re super-soldiers with the emotional age of children.‘It’s the best monster ever invented’: Noah Hawley on bringing Ridley Scott’s Alien to TVRead moreIs there a current of identification between Hybrid and xenomorph? Is our enemy’s enemy our friend – or just another enemy? Do humans deserve to survive? The series plays with big questions. Yet this isn’t The Rest Is Aliens, a podcast about industrial espionage and existentialism. Its chief ambition is ramping up dread. And blood. Every episode is, frankly, an abattoir. New aliens have been designed that are blood-curdlingly creepy.The show boasts the sound design of the year, with chitinous clacking and background monkey whoops stoking constant unease. Even the casting is creepy, from child-adult Hybrids to Timothy Olyphant as an inscrutable robot scientist. Adrian Edmondson from The Young Ones is in it – yet so unrecognisable that I still don’t know he’s in it.Alien: Earth adds freshness to the franchise’s convoluted lore – give it your eyeballs. Tasting notes include Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, Westworld,Un Chien Andalou, plus The Secret Life of 4 Year Olds. There’s also the most cinematic monster to ever do it, doing it plenty. If that isn’t entertainment enough, then you truly are unknowable.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherAlienfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His day is an uneventful parade of tasks: teeth brushing, newspaper reading and failing to put his socks on.It is much to his surprise that he wakes to find the room tidy and his secret box of memories moved. And it is much to his consternation that a boy appears from another box, unruly, undomesticated and curious.It is that very curiosity that unlocks the old man’s backstory and rejuvenates him. Inside the secret box, the boy finds evidence of a perilous biplane crash over wartime seas and a drowning pilot rescued by a whale.By my reckoning that would make the old man about 125 years old, which would also account for the old-fashioned Boy’s Own Adventure focus of the show. It is easy to put that aside, however, when mischievous humour and visual inventiveness abounds, whether it is paper planes floating overhead, deathly waves inundating the stage or the enormous blue whale swelling to the full height of the walls around us.View image in fullscreenTactile wonder …toooBtoooBPleasance Courtyard, 10am and 11am, until 25 AugustI usually take the post-show play session as my cue to leave, but this one is delightful. We have just watched Tamsin Fessey perform a hypnotic dance, aimed at 6-24-month-olds, from inside a colourful tube. Hidden within, she rolls and stretches, giving life to this wriggly creature and making a face of the orange hoop at one end.Tuning in to the priorities of the young audience, she is variously shy, inquisitive, hungry and sick. She dances when the music demands it and sighs when it stops. She plays games with the springy containers around her and discovers enticing silvery balls inside.This toooB seems to have a life of her own until, slowly in this wordless production by Angel Exit, attractively designed by Verity Quinn, we spot the performer within: a foot, a hand, a cautious eye. And with her emergence, it is time for the audience to join in: new balls and tubes appearing around us to create an infant adventure playground, full of tactile wonder.View image in fullscreenJames Joyce for kids … You'll See …You’ll See …Pleasance Courtyard, 12pm, until 24 AugustIt sounds like a joke. Take a famously impenetrable classic of world literature, a stream-of-consciousness Dublin odyssey stretching to 250,000 words, and turn it into a show for the over-eights. But Helen Gregg is for real and her adaptation of James Joyce’s Ulysses is a joy.Introducing a book that few of the adults in the audience will have read, she strips it down to its narrative framework, judiciously editing for family viewing, and turns it into 45 minutes of day-in-the-life storytelling.Leafing through enormous pop-up books – three of them, just like the sections of the original – she traces the comings and goings of a cut-out Leopold Bloom and Stephen Daedalus, flanked by a city’s worth of quirky characters, from funeral to office to pub. In Marc Mac Lochlainn’s production for Galway company Branar, it is performed with wit and lucidity, not to mention musical interludes. Gregg is a brilliant interpreter and makes an imposing novel sound like a fun thing to tackle at home.View image in fullscreenSensory delight … Hello Birds.Photograph: Neal MegawHello BirdsAssembly George Square, 11.30am, until 17 AugustHard to imagine a more gentle introduction to theatre than this sensory performance for babies, written by Jasmine Cole and directed by Connie Crosby. Narrated by Hannah Platts and performed on a large floorcloth over which the audience can roam, it is set in a garden where the leaves are tactile, the mushrooms rattle and the pond is made of silver foil.A bee buzzes by as the children acclimatise, then it is time for the big reveal: a sequence of cloth puppet birds, manipulated by Jennie Rawling, introduced with birdsong and welcomed with a pretty human song. Things get no more dramatic than when the starling imitates a cow and a tractor and, as the lights dim, a night owl soars overhead with stars shining through its wings. The stakes might be low, but is pitched perfectly at a mesmerised audience.View image in fullscreenFinding ways to connect … The Unlikely Friendship of Feather Boy and Tentacle Girl.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanThe Unlikely Friendship of Feather Boy and Tentacle GirlAssembly Roxy, 11.25am, until 17 AugustFeather Boy and Tentacle Girl are opposites. One lives in the city; one in the country. One is rough; the other smooth. One sunny; one sour. But although theirs is a relationship of contradictions, they find a way to connect. They do this through the mutual dependency of acrobatics, balancing high above the stage, moving in careful synchronisation.In this aerial show for the over-eights by circus artists Vee Smith and Sadiq Ali working with Catherine Wheels theatre company, it is as if the two have been let loose in an outsize play park, mocking gravity as they hang upside down, spin precariously or plummet to the ocean depths. Narratively light and open to interpretation, it reaches a climax with a spectacular storm of red and white feathers on Jen McGinley’s set, swirling in windy chaos.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Children's theatreEdinburgh festivalTheatreFamilyFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

(They may see the recentcancellation of that prizeas proving their point.) The character comic quotes that unlikely coverage at the start of her new set, a (marginally) more theatrical offering with which she promises to kill off theatre as well. In a show full of one-liners to rival her 2023 prizewinner, the choicest joke may be the idea that this mild-mannered, delightfully silly act poses any kind of mortal threat whatsoever.Just asher acclaimed debut Skin Pigeonshowcased an array of unapologetically weird female characters, so too does 24 Hour Diner People – with the twist that, this time, they’re all to be found in the same, titular location. The first is a waitress given to eating her tips. Just as Skin Pigeon featured a cowboy with guns for hands, we now meet a trucker with impossibly long arms. One recurring sketch airs the libidinous if immature fantasies of a teenage girl as prom approaches. Another, co-starring a press-ganged audience member, introduces us to a wannabe Bonnie and Clyde plotting a heist of the diner’s takings.Lorna Rose Treen: ‘Someone shouted along to one of my jokes, like I was a band’Read moreWhereas Treen herself was a largely invisible presence in Skin Pigeon, she peeks out from behind the disguises here to comment on the cartoon chaos unfolding. That adds to the generous spirit of an event whose host takes care to involve us in these outpourings of her dotty imagination. No point pretending its several strands all reach satisfactory conclusions, and there are points when endearingly messy and DIY shades into slapdash. A couple of musical numbers, too, don’t play to Treen’s strengths.But it’s easy to submit to the show’s warm embrace of stupidity, to the fine physical comedy of that spindly limbed trucker, and to a host of throwaway one-liners (“last week I did camp America – better known as San Francisco”) whose quality all but the Sun newspaper must admire. Far from killing comedy, Treen proves here that it – and hers in particular – is very much alive.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It was The Way Way Back that freed us bothMaddy MussenSat 9 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareIn the first five minutes of the 2013 comedy drama The Way Way Back, a teenage boy has a conversation with his stepfather in a car bound for Cape Cod. You can only see the stepdad’s eyes in the rearview mirror, but you instantly know it’sSteve Carell. At this point, I loved Carell. He’s the reason that I, then a teenager, watched the film.“Duncan … let me ask you something,” Carell’s character says. “On a scale of one to 10, what do you think you are?” Duncan responds shyly that he thinks he’s a six. Any normal adult would balk and correct him. Tell him he’s nothing less than a 10. “I think you’re a three,” says Carell’s character, Trent. Suddenly, I hated Carell with a blind fury. He was a vision of pure evil. I didn’t want to watch him in anything else, ever.As it turns out, this was a full-sized, double-strength dose of projection.I’m 27 now, and it’s been six years since I rid myself of my real-life Trent. After my dad died when I was six, my mum started dating a new guy within a year. Though intensely smart and caring, she was blinded by grief and clawing around in the dark for a cure. That’s when she found her Trent on Match.com. A charming, self-motivated man, he seemed like the Real Deal.The film was screaming to me: this is a bad guy! Get away from him!But Trent changed our lives almost immediately. He made us give up the dog we got when my dad died because his adult daughter didn’t like dogs. He moved my mum, sister and I into the middle of the countryside, away from all our friends. He made me feel small, unsafe and unwelcome in my home. He stopped my mum from seeing her own friends, spending her own money and leaving the house. Later, we would find out that he locked his first wife in the house when he went to work “to keep her safe”.I didn’t know what I was experiencing was abuse until I watched The Way Way Back. Even then, the film never calls it that. But Carell’s character is so clearly the villain, and so uncannily similar to my stepdad, that it was unavoidable. It was as if someone had made an entire film to scream to me: this is a bad guy! Get away from him! Trent utilises what people now know as “coercive control”. He manipulates and belittles Duncan and his mum, Pam, with methods so familiar that it made me wince. To avoid Trent, Duncan lands a job at a water park, and his ragtag group of colleagues drag Duncan out of his awkward shell. By the end of the film, he stands up to Trent, freeing his mother from his clutches.As a teenager, I was too scared to fight back. But then I found my water park: Animal, a clothing chain based in the south of England, where I was a weekend shop girl from ages 17 to 19. Every awkward hello to customers and failed refund attempt made me a little bolder, more sure of myself.One day, as I was heading out to work, my stepdad pushed me over the edge, and I stood up to him. I told my mum that if she stayed with him, she’d never see me again.For a while, my mum still wanted to make the relationship work. But that was never going to be how it ended. In the final few minutes of The Way Way Back, Pam is in the front passenger seat next to Trent on the way home from Cape Cod. Suddenly, as if by epiphany, Pam clambers to the back to sit with her son. The film ends with them looking out of the rear window together, side by side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In his cruellest moments, it was a way for Antrobus’s black father, who died in 2014, to say “I don’t understand you. I don’t love you. You don’t understand my pain.”Antrobus, 38, is calm and reflective when he talks about this. As a deaf person who relies on hearing aids and lip-reading to communicate, he says he has long had to “make sense of myself for other people”.“I got to this point where I was like: what would happen if I didn’t have to do that? What does freedom look like for me?” It was writing poetry that got him to that place, and with that has come a great deal of critical acclaim: his first collection, The Perseverance, published in 2018, won the Rathbones Folio prize (now the Writers’ prize), the Sunday Times young writer of the year award and theTed Hughes award. That last felt somewhat ironic, given that The Perseverance contains a redacted version of Hughes’s poem Deaf School, along with Antrobus’s response, which grapples with its hurtful depiction of deaf children. In Hughes’s poem, the students “lacked a subtle wavering aura of sound” and are “alert and simple”; Antrobus’s poem After Reading Deaf School by the Mississippi River flips it: “Ted isalertandsimple. / Tedlacked a subtle wavering aura of sound”.Antrobus is driven by the desire to understand people and their motivations. His father’s “white” insult came from a projection of his insecurities about his own identity, he believes now. Born in rural Jamaica, the darkest-skinned of seven brothers, his father developed an “ugly duckling” complex from a young age, and was sent to live with an aunt in Kingston when he was three. As a young adult, after his own father had moved to England, he was sent for, moving first to Wolverhampton and later London, where he met Antrobus’s mother at a squatters’ party. Both the poet’s parents had other partners initially, and their relationship was marked by his father’s disappearances, but it lasted in some way or another until Antrobus was four or five. At that point, the writer’s grandmother stepped in to help look after him and his older sister. Even as a child, Antrobus could sense his father’s complicated relationship with his homeland – after a visit to Jamaica 15 years after he had left, his father“found that the place had changed so much and he couldn’t relate to people in the same way. And then they started calling him white because he’d been away so long.”As well as being a second-generation Jamaican immigrant, on his white mother’s side the writer is related to Sir Edmund Antrobus, an enslaver who owned plantations in Jamaica, British Guiana and St Kitts. “It gives me this perspective, of my nation, of my language, which is always slightly like one foot on the land and one foot in the sea,” he says. He has researched the Antrobus lineage and visited the Cheshire village from which the name hails. “Edmund Antrobus’s wealth did not trickle down to my family or to the Antrobuses that are living there in Antrobus village. The wealth has been extracted” – those descendants are in South Africa and have been made even richer by “diamond mine stuff”, he says. “It’s just weird. Should I feel complicit in that?”The only way he has found to reckon with his own identity is through creativity. “I’ve fought through it, I’ve felt through it,” he says, which led him to think: “How can I bring other people into that?” His teaching work – Antrobus is a freelance poetry teacher and editor, and a board member atthe Poetry School– was one way he has been able to help others. It has been a source of guilt that he hasn’t been able to take on as much of that kind of work of late. He puts a lot of pressure on himself to “give back”.I’ve been visiting deaf schools for a decade now, and I’m still yet to see provision that matched the care I got“I’m carrying survivor’s guilt,” he says. Born in Hackney in 1986, he grew up attending a mixture of deaf and hearing schools, and was given specialised support in order to learn to speak, write, sign and lip-read effectively. “I’ve been visiting deaf schools for a decade now, and I’m still yet to see provision that matched the care I got,” he says. Given the closures of deaf schools and cuts to provisions for deaf pupils made over the last three decades, to get the same level of support now “I would have to be the child of an aristocrat”. And without that support, he probably wouldn’t have been able to write. “It blows my mind.”That’s not to say that Antrobus had an easy ride: for a long while, in order to fit in, he resisted anything that would make him look more deaf. His parents – both hearing – never learned sign language, which his mother still feels guilty about. “But it wasn’t really just her fault,” the writer says. “It was also me refusing it.” As a child, he was constantly trying to minimise the fact that he was deaf, whipping out his hearing aids whenever photos were taken and refusing to use the British Sign Language (BSL) he learned at school in front of the hearing children “out of self-consciousness”. He learned ways to avoid bullying, joining both the deaf and hearing teams for football, athletics and swimming. “That’s what kind of saved me,” he says: the social status he was afforded by being good at sport gave him a free pass from the bullying he saw other, non-sporty deaf children experience.Having written three acclaimed poetry collections and two children’s books – the first of which, Can Bears Ski?, became the first everCBeebies bedtime storyto be read in sign language, by deaf actor Rose Ayling-Ellis – Antrobus has now turned to writing adult prose. The Quiet Ear pays homage to Antrobus’s teachers of the deaf, and sets out to show why deaf children deserve so much more support than they are currently receiving. The author describes it as “memoir as advocacy”, charting events in his own life while weaving in deaf history and a call to arms.It feels like a timely book, in an era when healthcare is in crisis and diversity and inclusion measures are under threat across the globe. Antrobus has firsthand experience of contending with “anti-woke” culture in the US, having lived in Oklahoma with his then wife, who is American, for three years. It was ultimately the cost of private healthcare that drew the couple back to the UK when they were expecting their son, having been “hit with a crazy bill”. They had initially planned to return after their son’s birth, but worries about the US approach to “healthcare, DEI, all of that stuff which sounds like science fiction” convinced them to stay in the UK, and though they have since separated, they continue to co-parent in Margate.Yet, though a preferable place to raise a child in some ways, the UK is still at “primary school level” when thinking about disability in general, Antrobus says. He has been pleased to see some positive developments when it comes to deaf rights and awareness, such as Ayling-Ellis winning Strictly Come Dancing in 2021 and becoming a well-known public figure (“She is going to have an impact on the culture in the UK for ever”) and thepassing of the British Sign Language Actin 2022, which put BSL on course to become a recognised language. But he is disheartened by the government’s proposed cuts to personal independence payments (Pips) for disabled people and the continued closure of deaf schools.Margate, where he has been living for the last year, has a “significant deaf history”, but the Royal School for Deaf Children in Margate, one of the oldest deaf schools in the UK,closed in 2015with no replacement, and the Margate Deaf Club is no longer running. “I haven’t been able to access the deaf community here. It’s dissipated. And that, I think, is an example of what is happening all over the country,” he says. “There’s more separation, isolation, hurdles to jump through.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It has dissipated – it’s the same all over the countrySuch isolation can be fatal – as the author demonstrates in The Quiet Ear when he writes about a former classmate. Tyrone had worn bright blue hearing aids that he would sometimes pimp up with drawings and stickers, emboldening Antrobus to be more open about his own deafness, since “the girls still really fancied” Tyrone. After leaving school, though, Tyrone lost contact with his deaf friends, struggled to assimilate into the hearing world, developed alcoholism and was arrested on domestic abuse charges. In prison, he did not have his hearing aids and was not referred for new ones after a counsellor deemed his communication to be “fine without them”; he ultimately died by suicide in his cell.It is no wonder, then, that Antrobus feels so indebted to his teachers, to his mum, his mentors – to everyone who kept him off a path similar to Tyrone’s. Now, when he meets people who don’t feel “properly deaf”, he encourages them to embrace their identity and find a community – as when he was walking near his home recently and approached a man with a cochlear implant.After Antrobus said, “Oh, my deaf friend, how are you doing?” and started signing to him, the man became “stiff and anxious”, explaining that he didn’t know sign language. Exclusionary attitudes from signing deaf people had made this man feel that he wasn’t welcome in deaf communities. Traditionally, there was an emphasis on what Antrobus refers to as “capital ‘D’ Deaf people”, who are culturally Deaf, “sign as a first language and are engaged in deaf history and identity”. When the writer explained to this man that the deaf world is very open now, “he started crying, and said, ‘Thank you so much. I needed permission to be a deaf person.’”Antrobus’s hope is that The Quiet Ear will give more deaf people that permission, and educate hearing people about what the community needs. When it comes to deaf and disability rights, “we are at quite an interesting and, I hope, transitional, point”, he says. He is encouraged by how many people are speaking out against the proposed changes to Pips and learning more about disability justice. “It’s good, it’s giving people energy.”There will be a follow-up to The Quiet Ear, Antrobus says, “about language, about voice, about class” – but not about deafness. In the meantime, he’s hoping to work more in the art world, having been commissioned to create work for the Guggenheim and the Barbican. “It challenges me to think in a new dimension,” he says. When we speak, he is just about to travel to Italy for a month-long residency at the esteemed Civitella Ranieri Foundation for artists and writers. “It’s exciting,” but there’s also a part of him that is sad and anxious – this is the longest he has been away from his son.Antrobus clearly loves being a parent – at any mention of his three-year-old he becomes warmer, softer. But “it is difficult, balancing work and parenting,” he says, acknowledging that by asking their son’s mother to take care of him while Antrobus goes away for work he is “giving her a weight”.He tries not to give too much time to other parenting worries, about how his son’s sense of identity will be shaped by social media, or him growing up as a black child in a country that has recently had race riots. “If I was to lean too much into that, I would go mad,” he says, but he hopes that his son will have “a lot more certainty and grounding” about who he is than Antrobus had as a child.Raymond Antrobus: ‘Deafness is an experience, not a trauma’Read moreHis son is hearing, though is learning to sign, and Antrobus “would put money on him doing the BSL GCSE” when he is older. Antrobus himself is able to communicate better than ever, using SSE (sign supported English) and the help of hi-tech hearing aids that connect to his phone (he switched to a private audiology clinic after winning the Ted Hughes award). As a champion of the NHS “going private was a guilt thing”, yet having access to the latest models via private healthcare has meant he “can relax a bit more”, no longer having to rely on lip-reading as much.Antrobus is determined to make use of everything he has been given, to make work like The Quiet Ear, to keep advocating for better resources for deaf people. “I’ve probably been given more than I’ve given back,” he says. “So I owe the world a lot.”The Quiet Ear by Raymond Antrobus is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson.

It is set in a fancy new Manchester nick where conditions are uncommonly good: a 25-day riot in the notoriously crowdedStrangewayshas fast-tracked the introduction of a softly-softly regime. There is one man to a cell, so tensions should be minimised, and only troublemakers are subject to frequent searches. Yet every time Edwards introduces a new inmate, he takes us one step closer to catastrophe.It is like a laboratory experiment in which a mad scientist adds unstable chemicals to a test tube and turns on the Bunsen burner. The steadiest element is Frankie Donnelly, a recovering addict who is in for three-and-a-half years for importing drugs disguised as bars of chocolate. On his side is an even temper, a typewriter and a history of political activism; beyond that, he is at the mercy of his fellow inmates.View image in fullscreenThomas at Summerhall.Photograph: Pamela RaithThey include Kenny, a vulnerable and volatile victim of sexual abuse; Robert, a “white Muslim” drug lord; Bron, a former British soldier with a lethal form of PTSD; and Tommy, who may or may not be an IRA operative. Placating one could trigger another. A chain reaction seems inevitable.Amusingly, Edwards plays against the tension as well as leaning into it. With the audience on tenterhooks, a whimper can be as much fun as a bang. None of these men is precisely the monster you expect. There is humanity, tenderness and care even in this brutal environment.The playwright could find no better interpreter than Mark Thomas, extending a relationship that began withEngland & Son, a play that managed to make a link between juvenile offending and colonialism. Strident and demonstrative, he powers his way through the script under the direction of Charlotte Bennett for Paines Plough, ratcheting up the stakes and jumping brilliantly from scouse narco to Belfast terrorist or bent screw to create a distinct and distinctly dangerous set of characters.Behind the time bomb humour lies a subtle analysis of the social and cultural reasons these damaged men are behind bars. They are not innocent, exactly, but men swept up in forces beyond their control.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is quite the statement about her 86-year-old grandmother whom she was taken to visit as a teenager, when all she wanted to do was go to the movies. To Paterson, Niusia was an old curmudgeon full of complaints and cruelties.But she proceeds to take us on the journey that she went on after Niusia’s death, when she became curious about who her Polish immigrant grandmother had been before settling in Melbourne.It turns out that she had beenHolocaustsurvivor, although, typically for one who had lived through its trauma, she rarely talked about the time “before”.Under the direction of her collaborator Kat Yates, Paterson excavates her grandmother’s past, beginning with her successful businesses in Melbourne, which she singlehandedly built. But the drama then spools back to the beginning: her birth in Warsaw in 1922, her ambitions to become a doctor before her imprisonment in Auschwitz and, chillingly, the medical work she was forced to do under the Nazi eugenicist Josef Mengele.Patterson’s attitude toward Niusia changes after the airing of these memories, sourced through her mother, whose voice we hear in recordings.This is a surprisingly warm play given its theme of the Holocaust and inherited trauma. Paterson is a sweet, perky storyteller, singing at times and incorporating her play-making process into her narration. Sometimes this seems pertinent, other times unnecessary.She brings some taboo-busting humour to the subject, which also only half works. It defuses the tension but sounds like random lines from an edgy standup routine.There are life lessons for Paterson along the way, which she speaks aloud, recommending books that are in brown boxes and which she reaches for at various moments. It is clear that the disinterring of personal history is part of an education – one she now imparts to us.The narrative strays from Niusia towards the end, on to Paterson’s Australian Jewish identity and the anxiety of not being seen as Jewish enough – which could make for a play of its own. It is ultimately Niusia’s story that grips. Paterson puts on an accent to bring her back to life. We hear that she went on to have twins after leaving the camp. As Paterson says, isn’t that the best “fuck you” to Mengele?

A pulsing jerk of Rajeh’s shoulder catches and spreads until the whole group is bouncing as one and surging through the space, eyes shining, entranced by the music, like a full moon ritual or a solstice party under the light cloud of anEdinburghsky.It is infectious, and inevitably the invitation comes to join them: in a circle dance, instructions shouted over the music, or in a mass bop, arms thrust into the air, only a moderate amount of awkwardness and a few inhibitions thrown off.View image in fullscreenInfectious … Dance People at Old College Quad, Edinburgh.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianButDancePeople is more than a groovy dancefloor. What it really seems to be is a lot of ideas that have been thrown up between Rajeh, the dancers and dramaturg Peggy Olislaegers, that haven’t been shaped into an effective whole. These roam vaguely (and sometimes specifically) around ideas of community and connection, citizenship, workers’ oppression, borders and activism.Works and Days review – wild ride charts the arc of human progressRead moreCumbersome pieces of stage set are moved around the space, forcing us out of the way – part of the power dynamic of the space, you could say. There’s the drawing of boundaries that are then transgressed; excerpts from historical letters describing workers lives, and audience members describing their day; voiceover, projection, participation and some live oud music.The real theme is the feeling of helplessness of the average person in the face of the world’s problems, and what this show is trying to do is turn us from passive to active spectators, by physically making us the protagonists, inviting us into the performer’s sacred space, showing us the solidarity and the value in the people around us. But it is too overloaded and too wandering to be truly effective. As the night turns dark, the mood shifts from happy community into something more angry and alienating, and the galvanising force ebbs away.AtOld College Quad, Edinburgh, until 10 August.Edinburgh international festivalruns until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025DanceTheatreEdinburgh festivalFestivalsEdinburghreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now she returns, to rebut a descriptor widely applied tothat 2023 debut– specifically, that her comedy is mild and lacks edge. You want edge, she asks in How to Be a Baddie? I’ll give you edge! And so the show does, to a degree – if not a degree high enough to cancel out the 29-year-old’s unshakeable amiability and charm.In part, she explains, the confusion was a cultural one: back home in India, there’s nothing conservative (to use one of her critics’mots injustes) about Ashfaq. She’s a standup, for a start, in a country where that attracts not, ahem, intelligent reviews like this one, but vigilante attention and online insults. Ashfaq has a choice quip in response to one such, and another explaining why she’s off-putting to both Hindu and Muslim men.The promised combative material on religion does not then materialise; she reads the audience’s horoscopes instead. (One off-colour response prompts a deft running joke about how Ashfaq’s crowd-work is malfunctioning tonight.) More on-message with the bad-girl theme is the standout section on erotica. What starts as autobiographical standup about the books that fuelled Ashfaq’s sexual awakening leads to a recital of some One Direction fan fiction, Indian-style, in which our simpering heroine has been sold into slavery to the X Factor stars.Memories stir ofSofie Hagen’s whole showabout her teenage Westlife fanfic. But the Mumbai native brings a style all of her own to this literary epic, which includes Zayn Malik with an Arabic accent and jokes about Indian tweens’ murderous feelings towards their would-be mothers-in-law.The later sections don’t re-ascend to these comic heights. A section on defending her sister’s honour at school might feel edgier to those who better comprehend its repeated Hindi term,randi– akin to whore or slut. A closer on Ashfaq’s recent surgery for haemorrhoids wrings less juice than you’d expect out of one of those perfect-for-comedy bodily indignities. You may not leave convinced of Ashfaq’s delinquency, but she certainly proves that 2023’s success was no flash in the pan.AtMonkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

When they weren’t so overwhelmed by being so overexposed and in demand,” Chuang said.“It was a really precious few months in which they’re realising who they are, who they are to other people, and want to participate in that image formation.”The Beatles released their first two albums in 1963: Please Please Me and With the Beatles, which catapulted them into the limelight, powered by whatthe Guardian called“a different and heavily northern-flavoured sound of their own”.The band followed that up in 1964 withsingles including A Hard Day’s Nightand two more albums that helped them break America and become a global phenomenon.View image in fullscreenAt London Airport (with Brian Epstein, Mal Evans, and Neil Aspinall) for Pan Am flight 101 to New York City, 7 February 1964.Photograph: Paul McCartneyIn autumn 1963, McCartney decided to pick up a camera, long before he and the group became some of the most photographed people on the planet. He bought a simple Pentax and used mostly black and white Kodak and Ilford film, and took a small selection of colour images in early 1964.“I think they knew that history was happening,” said Chuang. “They wanted to capture it, and do it themselves. They picked a camera for the same reason anyone does, to have your own view.”There are also more reflective self-portraits taken before live shows and interviews. One of the self-portraits is taken in the attic of McCartney’s then girlfriend, the actorJane Asher, which is where he wrote the melody for Yesterday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a melodrama-packed show with an apalling script and questionable premise. But it’s enjoyable nonethelessSarah DempsterSat 9 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 9 Aug 2025 21.31 EDTShareScotland, 1714, and the air is heavy with script. Scowling laird Red Jacob MacKenzie (Peter Mullan) has snuffed it and the task of spelling out the significance of the tragedy has fallen, from no little height, on his eldest daughter.“Clan MacKenzie is vulnerable,” wails Ellen MacKenzie (Harriet Slater). “No successor has been named. Someone else, not of our blood, could come in and take charge of the clan; of our home, of our money, of our reputation, of everything we have!”Agreement comes from the shadows, where a maid is hiding from the soundtrack’s bagpipes. “Your father’s untimely death has shaken us all, lass,” she whispers, tremulously. “What’s to come will be a trial …” [a pause, here, to allow for the arrival of the requisite italics] “…for all of us.”There are VisitScotland-approved zoom-shots of cattle and soft-focus heritage buttocksShe’s not wrong. Or rather, she’snae wrang. For this is Outlander: Blood of My Blood, where the accents are as thick as the exposition and everyone is forced to stand in driving rain as slabs of dialogue are dragged by wincing Scotsmen across glens the colour of porridge.It’s quite something. But then, so was – and, indeed is – Outlander, the unapologetically preposterous time-travelling romantic drama for which this unapologetically preposterous time-travelling romantic drama serves as a prequel. Outlander, for the unaccustomed, goes something like this: spirited second world war nurse Claire Randall (Caitríona Balfe)touches a standing stone while holidaying in the Scottish Highlands and is immediately transported back to 1743, where she falls in love with brooding soldier Jamie Fraser (Sam Heughan) and his hexagonal jawline. There follows much “love across the divide” melodrama, plus Jacobite-based skirmishes, VisitScotland-approved zoom-shots of cattle and soft-focus heritage buttocks. With the eighth (eighth!) and final series due to air next year, the decision has been made to expand the Outlander universe, lest the loss of muscular actors staggering between eras with their kilts around their ankles proves too much to bear.Wednesday season two review – Jenna Ortega’s charisma could power 1,000 hearsesRead moreAnd now? The fun continues with Outlander: Blood of My Blood, in which we meet the parents of both Jamie and Claire as they, too, #livelaughlove between past and present. Hang on a minute, though. Didn’t Outlander make it clear that Claire’s parents died in a car crash when she was a young child? It certainly did! And was there any mention of them having been involved in any type of time-travellery prior to this? There certainly was not! But never mind that because they’re alive now, banging on a first world war-era picnic blanket before conspicuously not dying in the aforementioned car crash. Instead, Julia Moriston (Hermione Corfield) and Henry Beauchamp (Jeremy Irvine) skip merrily from the CGI wreckage before Julia promptly disappears into the same standing-stone time-portal that will, 30 years hence, whoosh-off her daughter. The end. Of episode one, at least. There’ll be more from the bangers as the series progresses. Or rather, as the series continues (“progresses” seems too strong a word for a production that contains the line, “My, my, a sassenach – and a fiery one!”).For now, however, we are primarily concerned with Clan MacKenzie.“There are plenty of folk eager to see the demise ae Clan MacKenzie!” warns adviser Ned Gowan (Conor MacNeill).“I will bring glory tae Clan MacKenzie!” bellows Dougal MacKenzie (Sam Retford) directing the full-force of his 18th-century action-beard at shifty brother Colum (Séamus McLean Ross). Dougal is a Bad Lot. We know this because he shouts at boars and boffs a topless local over a barrel.Older sister Ellen, meanwhile, has just met Brian Fraser, bastard son of Simon Fraser, formerly Lord Lovat of Beaufort (“I’m Brian Fraser, bastard son of Simon Fraser, formerly Lord Lovat of Beaufort”). Stunned by Brian’s (Jamie Roy) tousled bob, she agrees to secretly meet him on a local bridge. Will their forbidden love eventually lead to the birth of Outlander’s Jamie Fraser while widening the age-old rift between Clan MacKenzie and Clan Fraser? Aye.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Similarly not-bad is the cinematography (spectacular) and the acting, which is uniformly decent.But the script. Oh, the script. There is the line, “They say hatred and love are two sides of the same coin.” Someone else says, “Rest assured, this incident will not be forgotten easily, Dougal MacKenzie!” before ducking for cover as another girder of exposition crashes from the rafters. It is both atrocious and very watchable.

Beck (Peter Haber), Alex (Jennie Silfverhjelm) and the team investigate.Hollie RichardsonOur Farm Next Door: Amanda, Clive and Kids6.30pm, Channel 4It’s Christmas in Yorkshire!

Before gifting the goats with new coats and Boxing Day paddleboarding on the local tarn, there’s work to be done – including taking the scaffolding down and fitting doors.HRThe Manhattan Project in Colour8pm, Channel 4This brisk film’s USP is colourising 80-year-old photos and footage from the Manhattan Project.

But, as Bernard MacMahon’s terrific, archive-stuffed documentary reveals, Led Zeppelin had a more roundabout gestation. Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones were in-demand session players in 60s London, while singer Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham were jobbing musicians in Birmingham. It wasn’t until Page joined the Yardbirds that he realised his dream of a no-singles group with a heavy, improvisational edge. Featuring interviews with the surviving members, rare audio of Bonham and big chunks of gig footage, it’s a fascinating slice of rock history.Simon WardellThe Pickup, out now, Prime VideoRussell (Eddie Murphy) is an armoured truck guard edging towards retirement who is paired with irritating newbie Travis (Pete Davidson) on a long day of deliveries. However, their van is targeted by criminals led by Keke Palmer’s Zoe, forcing a change of plans for all involved. Oddly, Tim Story’s chase caper turned heist thriller makes Murphy the straight man to Davidson’s goofball, at the expense of the star’s comic abilities. But the confident, charismatic Palmer takes up some of the slack, and the highway action sequences are smartly done.SWBack to the Future Part III, 3.35pm, BBC OneView image in fullscreenWhat’s up Doc? … Back to the Future Part III on BBC One.Photograph: Moviestore collection Ltd/AlamyShot back to back with Part II, the final part of the sci-fi trilogy is a much better film, largely due to the fun everyone seems to be having with the western setting. Dusting off the DeLorean, Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) flies back to 1885 to save Christopher Lloyd’s stranded Doc Brown from being shot dead by Buford Tannen, Biff’s ancestor. Playful tweaks to the genre and a romance for Doc with Mary Steenburgen’s teacher are the new elements in an otherwise familiar plot of cobbled-together gadgetry, space-time dilemmas and jolly slapstick comedy.SWMargrete: Queen of the North, 1.05am, BBC TwoCharlotte Sieling’s 2021 historical drama takes a footnote from the life of a 14th-century Danish royal and gives it a dusting of Game of Thrones-style clan politics, generational scheming and nation building. The estimable Trine Dyrholm is magnetic as Margrete, who – despite being a woman in a man’s world – has unified Norway, Sweden and Denmark and presides over a time of peace.

Then head for the more temperate Cantabrian coast and its fantastic beaches, superb seafood and relaxed vibesAnnie BennettSat 9 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareWhile we all know that “costa” is simply the Spanish word for “coast”, for most of us it has a much wider meaning, evoking all sorts of images, both positive and negative. It may be beaches, fun, cold beers and tapas at achiringuito(beach bar) with your feet in the sand. Perhaps you’re thinking of childhood holidays in a thrillingly huge hotel, where you happily stuffed yourself with ice-cream and chips for a fortnight. More recent memories might revolve around showy beach clubs with exorbitant prices. If you’ve been to the costas of eastern or southern Spain in the past few years, however, you may have reluctantly concluded that your favourite resorts are now a bit too hot for comfort.View image in fullscreenThis year, there has been a lot of buzz about “la España fresca”, or cool Spain, but, in reality, Spaniards have been thronging the northern coast in summer for decades, decamping to Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria and the Basque Country. This is particularly true for residents of Madrid and other cities in central Spain that are stifling in July and August.Along the north coast, temperatures are usually more like those of Cornwall on a good summer’s day. But be warned: you do get blisteringly hot spells, too, not to mention a greater risk of wet weather. I have trudged along beaches in driving rain in June, but enjoyed glorious sunshine and delicious swims well into September.One of my favourite chunks of northern Spain is the Costa Trasmiera in Cantabria. If you are trying to cut down on flying, it has the advantage of being easy to reach byBrittany Ferriesfrom Portsmouth or Plymouth to Santander, the regional capital, or from Portsmouth to Bilbao, an hour’s drive away.View image in fullscreenAnchovies and tuna for sale in Santoña.Photograph: Tim Graham/AlamySailing into the Bay of Santander, your eyes are drawn to the city, framed by its string of beaches, rising up on your right. Look left, however, and the view is rural rather than urban. A long spit of glittering sand, El Puntal, protrudes into the bay, with a green landscape stretching out behind it to the east. This is the Costa Trasmiera, a stretch of about 30 miles (50km) between Santander and the fishing town of Santoña.A car is really useful to get to different beaches along the coast, but there are buses from Santander to the main places, such as Somo, Noja and Santoña. With a car, you are only likely to be travelling short distances each day, so using an EV is no problem.If you liked the look of El Puntal as you were arriving, you can jump on alittle ferryacross the bay. I love doing this when I’m staying in Santander, as within a quarter of an hour I’m running into the sea, shrieking as the cold water hits my body. If you’re used to wallowing in the tepid soup of the Mediterranean in summer, it might come as a bit of a shock.View image in fullscreenThe view across the bay from Santander.Photograph: Juanma Aparicio/AlamyBack on the sand, a chopped seafood salad and glass of rosé atChiringuito El Puntal Tricioalways hits the spot. Walking along the beach brings you to Somo, a hub for surfers from all over the world, where you’ll find lots of cafes, bars and places offering surfing and paddleboarding tuition.Hotel Bemon Playa(doubles from €90 room-only) is in the thick of things if you fancy staying for a few days.Heading east along the coast, it’s one superb beach after another: Loredo, Langre, Galizano, Antuerta, Cuberris. Book a table for a lobster lunch or a seafood platter overlooking the sea atHotel Astuy(doubles from €60 room-only) in Isla, where the crustaceans served in the restaurant are kept in seawater pools in caves below the building. The hotel is a good base for exploring the area, but just beyond Isla, right next to Playa de Ris,Camping Playa Joyel(pitches from €19.50) is one of several good campsites on the Costa Trasmiera, with lots of facilities to keep kids happy.It’s not hard to see how people while away a summer here with swims, walks, long lunches and sunset cocktailsFrom the campsite, it’s an easy walk into Noja, the main holiday town on the coast. Practical rather than pretty, for most of the year it is a sleepy place with a population of about 2,500. In summer, however, the number rises to an astounding 80,000-plus, mostly in second homes and holiday apartments – a much higher ratio of tourists and second-home owners to residents than in resorts on the Costa Blanca and Costa del Sol. Families from other parts of Spain, especially the adjacent Basque Country, install themselves for the entire school holidays, which can stretch from late June until the second week of September.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This may not be the most attractive place, but for the thousands who come here year after year, it has everything needed for a relaxing holiday with no delusions of grandeur or attempts at being cool. No one cares what you’re wearing here.Those who can summon the energy to move on from Noja only have to round the headland to come upon yet another splendid beachWith Playa de Ris on one side of Noja and the equally gorgeous Trengandín stretching away on the other (a path links the two), it’s not hard to see how people while away a summer here with swims, picnics, leisurely walks, long lunches and sunset cocktails. Seafood is, of course, excellent, but thenécoras(velvet crabs) are particularly prized.Those who can summon the energy to move on from Noja only have to round the El Brusco headland at the end of Trengandín to come upon yet another splendid beach. Berria is bordered by theSantoña, Victoria and Joyel marshlands, a nature reserve that attracts migratory birds from autumn to spring.View image in fullscreenConsidered a delicacy, Santoña anchovies are served straight from the tin at restaurants and tapas bars.Photograph: Sergio Rojo/AlamyThe adjacent town of Santoña marks the end of the Costa Trasmiera. It’s all about fisheries and canning factories here, which is a lot more interesting than it sounds. As long as you like anchovies, that is. Santoña anchovies are bigger and fleshier than most, with a softer texture and a more delicate flavour, and here they’re expertly filleted and preserved in olive oil. Considered a delicacy throughout Spain, they are served straight out of the tin at top restaurants and tapas bars. Have a look around theanchovy museum– really – before ordering someat a bar, along with a plate of sardines and a beer. Devour the lot while standing at a high table on the pavement outside, then quaff another beer. You may find yourself ordering more anchovies as well.By now you should have tuned into the laid-back Costa Trasmiera vibe. All you have to do, at some point, is make your way back to Santander. It only takes about half an hour by car, but you may be tempted to stop at some of the inland villages along the way. This is not an area to rush around, which – if you’re doing things properly – you will no doubt have gathered by now.Explore more on these topicsSpain holidaysBeach holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Four of them, from a tentative 11-year-old to a fearless four-year-old with zero concept of danger and an arm just out of a cast. Sure, the whole snow experience might give my credit card a touch of altitude sickness, but at this time of my life I’m choosing to invest in memories over inheritance. I’ll remind myself of that when the credit card statement arrives.It was a chance, too, to test out my ski legs at my old stomping ground at Perisher, in the mountains of Kosciuszko national park.On thin ice: three strategies to help you enjoy Australia’s snow season more sustainably | Change by degreesRead moreThis is where family ski trips all began for me. A first taste of skiing etched deeply in memory and immortalised in glitchy home movies. The place we built our first stately snowman; where my dad battled to master a snowplough and lost; where we teenaged idiots hurtled down black runs we had no business being on; and where as motley uni students we jumped maniacally to the thrums of the Angels at the Jindabyne hotel. It was where we took our own kids skiing too.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThat history makes it the perfect place to make new snow introductions,reacquaint ourselves with muscles we haven’t met up with for a while and to start a whole new bank of memories.For a while, Grandude and I considered tackling this initiation on our own but the ratio of adults to beginners was out of whack, so we enlisted their parents to balance the scales. And really, they were up for the fun too.At the lodgeView image in fullscreenCorroboree Lodge bar in Perisher Valley: ‘The kind of place to pad around in socks.’Photograph: Christine AldredFrom the outset, we prioritised ease. That meant choosing on-snow accommodation right in Perisher Valley. With a mere 200-metre scoot to the lifts, Corroboree Lodge is pricier than staying off-mountain but I’m here for the luxury of convenience: no daily kid-wrangling on the ski tube or buses, plus breakfast and dinner included.It is warm and welcoming, cosy and convivial, everything you could hope for in a family ski holiday. The kind of place to pad around in socks, with a fire-lit bar, various lounges to kick back in, and where the kids can roam safely.After a tour of the lodge, the 11-year-old is seriously impressed.“I could get used to this,” she announces.Oh, dear. I feel a twang straight in the hip pocket. Or maybe it’s a tug at the heart strings.View image in fullscreenYogi, the ski lodge dog, is a hit with the family.Photograph: Christine AldredDinner is staggered: the kids eat first while the adults relax. It’s a joy to learn there’s a no-screen rule in the dining room. How wonderfully old-school.It’s not long before the kids are outside making a snowman (a sad and misshapen mound barely 30cm tall but that’s beside the point) and making friends, in the delightfully easy way children do. Later that might include watching movies, testing flexibility over Twister or making cubby houses from whatever’s available in the lounge.The youngest zips down during adults’ dinner with excited updates on how many new friends she’s made in the last 15 minutes. She greets one at breakfast with a massive hug at the “pancake store”.When the ever-hungry nine-year-old sees the breakfast spread and realises he can have anything he want, he declares ecstatically: “This is going to be the best day of my life!”It’s certainly going to be a memorable one.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You look like you could sell drugs in that.”View image in fullscreen‘After an initial flurry of mayhem, the kids are soon finding their ski legs.’Photograph: Christine AldredI don’t know whether to be flattered or horrified. It turns out, her father calls my sunglasses “speed dealers”.After an initial flurry of mayhem, the kids are soon finding their ski legs. We push and pull and cajole them to clamber up the vaguest of slopes to trial some tiny glides while we offer tips on leaning forward and bending knees and explain why they don’t need stocks yet. They bounce back up effortlessly when they fall, a skill I wish I still had.Next morning it’s chaos – braiding hair, checking who’s been to the toilet, matching kids to gloves and goggles, handing out mountain passes and getting four sets of legs into heavy ski boots and on skis. It’s like herding cats. Super-hyped cats.A three-hour lesson is a great introduction to some basics and a chance for the adults to do a few runs unencumbered. When I hear the squeals of glee coming from my daughter as she whooshes along behind me on her first run, I realise it’s not just the little ones having fun. She’s like a child again, actually calling out “weeeeeee”, her face lit in a grin all the way down.The 11-year-old is soon up on her first chairlift and T-bar, managing slow runs and gentle turns. The nine-year-old is all about heading down the middle, turns be damned, which is not always wise. The six-year-old is learning quickly and the wild four-year-old hoots down with glee, arms spread wide and giving a little jump as she goes. Spaghetti-like, she’s not the least perturbed when one ski turns inwards and completely backwards, though my own body clenches involuntarily. She refuses to do up either her ski jacket or her pants on the first day, though eventually succumbs when the snow sets in.View image in fullscreenAn overnight dump gives the kids a chance to build a fine-looking snowman.Photograph: Christine AldredThis skiing business isn’t a cheap pursuit, especially with a tribe of kids, but it’s also a bit like magic – a kind of wintry glue that binds a family across the years and generations.We don’t go as long or as hard as we used to, but with the weather gods on our side we tick off a snowy wishlist: a bluebird day to start proceedings, soft tumbling snow on another, an overnight dump enabling a redemptive fine-looking snowman, successful chairlift rides, no injuries and four elated children hungry for more.LogisticsTheSkitubeoperates between Bullocks Flat and Perisher.

Will they judge us for buying ready-made coleslaw? Will they notice how excessively charred the drumsticks are? But chefs are people too – and they like being invited over for a burger and a beer just as much as the rest of us. It’s just that their burgers might be made from dry-aged steak, minced by hand that morning, paired with a carefully chosen low-intervention wine.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Chefs also like thinking beyond burgers, sausages and all the other traditional barbecue favourites, which is why, when we asked 18 of the UK’s best chefs what they would take to a barbecue, they recommended everything from chilli-spiked watermelon salad and intensely flavoured Korean marinades to dry non-alcoholic aperitifs and beautiful tins of spiced salt. (And not a tub of coleslaw in sight.)The veggie barbie starView image in fullscreenYotam Ottolenghi’s hispi cabbageI always bring a large head of cabbage – hispi if I can find it, but napa or white work well, too. I cut it into thick wedges (keeping the core intact so they don’t fall apart), brush them with olive oil, season generously, and char directly over the flames until the outer leaves are blackened and blistered and the inside goes sweet and tender. Then I make a dressing: either whisk together tahini, a bit of yoghurt, lemon juice, garlic and water to make a creamy sauce, or simply use some creme fraiche with lemon juice and garlic stirred though. I spoon this over the cabbage and finish it off with whatever chilli oil or chilli sauce happens to be around, and a sprinkle of fresh herbs (only if I have them).Yotam Ottolenghi, chef, restaurateur and food writerThrow a few prawns on the grillView image in fullscreenTom Kerridge’s prawns with harissa mayoBarbecued prawns with harissa mayo make a perfect barbecue starter: place 1kg of raw shell-on tiger prawns in a bowl with two teaspoons of crushed cumin seeds, two tablespoons each of rose harissa paste and olive oil and the zest of two limes. Leave for 30 minutes. Make a sauce with 150g mayonnaise, two teaspoons of rose harissa paste, the juice of a lime and one tablespoon of chopped dill. Barbecue the marinated prawns for 2-3 minutes each side over the hottest part of the grill, until cooked through and lightly charred. Serve with the mayo and lime wedges.Tom Kerridge, chef, restaurateur and author ofThe BBQ Book. His newest pub isThe Chalkin LondonThe Italian barbecue go-toIn Italy, when we have a barbecue everyone brings something. My favourite at the moment is spring onions wrapped in streaky bacon. I wrap 20-30 individual spring onions in streaky bacon, chill and then transfer them straight on to the grill. The stems are perfectly salted due to the bacon and are delicious with a homemade spicy mayo.Giorgio Locatelli, Michelin-starred chef, who has a newrestaurant at London’s National GalleryJust add chilli – to everythingView image in fullscreenAna Ortiz’s homemade ají (chilli) sauceI would never arrive at a barbecue withoutají(chilli) sauce: I always have a Kilner jar of it in the fridge. I make it with six large ripe vine tomatoes and 10 red chilies, blackened over the barbecue or in a hot dry pan, then mashed or blitzed with the juice of a lime and plenty of salt. I would also bring a spice mix from Field Blends: they do adelicious maple chilli salt, perfect for sprinkling over meats and salads and they come in handy little tins, so easy to pop in your bag.Ana Ortiz, chef/co-founder ofFire Madein SomersetKnock up an Aperol spritz barView image in fullscreenRukmini Iyer’s Aperol spritz stationI love taking an Aperol spritz station to a barbecue. Arigid coolbox– so the lid can double up as a table – filled with ice, sliced oranges,Aperol, San Pellegrino and sparkling wine. I have a stash of Bonne Maman jam jars to use as glasses. I get no enjoyment from drinking anything – even champagne – from a paper or plastic cup. Sturdy glasses all the way.Rukmini Iyer, chef and author ofThe Green BarbecueKebabs are kingsA particular favourite is chicken or lamb kebabs, marinaded in yoghurt with spices overnight and then skewered with slices of lemon and red onion. With a salad of roast aubergine, cucumber, tomato, red onion and mint finished with a splash of red wine vinegar. And then sauces and flatbreads are king of the barbecue – tahini or chermoula work particularly well here.

At this time of year when the weather is very hot, they are a perfect, big-bellied crowd-pleaser – so refreshing and rehydrating. They can be chopped up and turned into salads, too. I’m partial to a dressing made with smashed garlic, birdseye chilli, palm sugar, fish sauce or soy, tamarind and lime juice; then add roasted cashews and fistfuls of Thai basil. To drink, I don’t think you can do better than rosé.Ravinder Bhogal, chef-patron ofJikoniand author ofComfort and JoyThe best fish for the jobView image in fullscreenNiklas Ekstedt’s turbotI would bring awhole turbot: it’s one of the best things you can cook on a barbecue as its high collagen content keeps the fish moist, creating rich, gelatinous juices under the skin. Pat the fish dry and brush it with olive oil, season with salt, then place in a fish grill.

New potatoes boiled whole, thinly sliced fennel and red onion, lots of fresh dill and a dressing with unrefined sunflower oil, mustard, lemon and honey. Carrot and red pepper tapenade is also ideal with anything grilled. It’s very simple: thinly sliced onions, red pepper and grated carrots are cooked down to a jammy consistency, seasoned with salt, sugar and smoked paprika, doused in olive oil and some red wine vinegar, then rested in the fridge overnight.Alissa Timoshkina, chef, food historian and author ofKapustaA non-alcoholic aperitivoBotivois an alcohol-free drink for grownups, made from cider vinegar with botanicals.

You can grill them whole on the barbecue and then toss with sea salt, plenty of soft aromatic herbs, such as mint and dill, and serve to be eaten a little like edamame.Tomos Parry, Michelin-starred chef ofBratandMountainrestaurantsA showstopper of a saladView image in fullscreenClaire Thomson’s beany saladI would take a big beany salad, one you can make at home and then take with you. It uses ingredients that will sit happily wallowing in their juices for at least a couple of hours and taste better as the flavours develop. Chopped fresh tomatoes, different colours and sizes, plus lots of fresh herbs, a good dressing, some jarred peppers or artichokes, and not forgetting my favourite – some big creamy butter beans. It only takes minutes to mix it all together, but you look like a hero when you place it on the table.Claire Thomson, chef and author ofOne Pan BeansBaked onions, Sicilian styleView image in fullscreenRachel Roddy’s peperonataPhotograph: Dan Matthews/The GuardianIn Sicily, they bake whole unpeeled onions wrapped in foil, like potatoes, nestled in the embers, and let them get so soft they are almost a relish. I also often takepeperonata, a multipurpose marinade, side or relish which is a cooked mix of tomatoes, onions and peppers.Rachel Roddy, Rome-based chef and author ofAn A-Z of PastaA spicy Korean twistWhenever I’m going to a barbecue, the first thing I put in the cool box isSsamjang Korean soybean paste. Made from a mix ofgochujanganddoenjang(fermented pastes), sesame oil and garlic, it makes a great marinade and is the ultimate dip for grilled meats, fish or vegetables. It’s even better if you wrap it all up with raw chilli and garlic in a fresh salad leaf.Kyu Jeon, chef-owner of Korean restaurantsBokmanandDongnaeTake a cooling dipView image in fullscreenAnna Jones’s homemade dipI always take a homemade dip. My favourite is a crispy spring onion one. I crisp a chopped bunch of spring onions in olive oil, add a half a teaspoon of turmeric, the same of dried chilli and a pinch of salt and sugar, then take off the heat. Once cool, ripple it over about 300g of salted thick Greek yoghurt.Anna Jones, chef and author ofEasy WinsExplore more on these topicsBarbecueFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is no trick or trouble to getting them right, but there is a magic about nut ices that is as jaw-dropping as a magician’s act – delicious and sophisticated, without adulterating the childlike joy that underpins every sort of ice-cream. Then, I like to celebrate rhubarb as a sorbet, which is great on its own, or with cold custard, or to accompany stodgier puddings.Walnut and pear lollies (pictured top)This can be adapted for any nuts – it works particularly well with pecans (lightly roasted before making the milk, and consider using maple syrup in place of the sugar), hazelnuts (roasted before making the milk), almonds (roasted or raw, skin on or skin off) or pistachios (skinless, if you can get them, roasted or raw). You can get inventive and seasonal with the fruit, too, but it is really only necessary to add a sweet dimension to walnuts – other nuts can fly solo.Prep5 minCook1 hr 10 minFreeze6 hr+Makesabout 6 x 100ml lollies220g walnut halves or pieces100g white sugar1 ripe pearFirst make a nut milk: put 140g of the walnuts in a blender with 350ml cold water, then blend , until they’re a very fine texture, which will take several minutes.Strain the nut water through a very fine sieve, pressing with the back of a spoon to extract the last bits of goodness. Measure out 450ml of the nut milk (if you don’t have quite enough, top up with more water), then add the sugar and stir until it dissolves.Roast the remaining 80g walnuts very gently in a 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3 oven for 45 minutes to an hour, until light golden brown, then remove and leave to cool.To make the lollies, divide the roast walnuts evenly between six lolly moulds. Peel, core and dice the pear, then divide this between the lolly moulds, too. Top with the sweet walnut milk to come 5mm below the rim, then put on the lid and lolly sticks, and freeze for about six hours, until solid.Rhubarb sorbetView image in fullscreenRhubarb is such a camp monstrosity of a petiole. I always think a bunch of the glorious, pink ribbed stems look like candles destined for a drag queen’s dressing table, or Brighton rock being pulled to perfection.Prep5 minCook10 min, plus churningFreeze30 minMakesAbout 1 litre650g rhubarb200g caster sugar50g light runny honey, or glucose syrupChop the rhubarb into 1-2cm pieces, then put in a saucepan with all the other ingredients and 100ml cold water. Bring to a simmer, then cook for five minutes, until the rhubarb is tender with just a little crunch (it will keep cooking as it cools). Leave to cool to room temperature, then blend finely.Churn the mixture in an ice-cream machine according to the maker’s instructions until fully firm, then put into a suitable container, seal and put in the freezer for half an hour or so, to firm up. If it has been stored in the freezer for longer and is too firm, put it in the fridge to soften until scoopable.Jacob Kenedy is chef and owner ofGelupo,Bocca di LupoandPlaquemine Lock, all in LondonExplore more on these topicsFoodIce-cream and sorbetDessertSummer food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

The other Charlie is my daughter’s sweet little friend who turned eight recently and, in need of a cake, asked if this could be his birthday cake. To the two Charlies!Charlie’s chocolate, mascarpone and cherry cakePrep10 minCook50 minplus cooling timeMakes1 cake, to serve 12125ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for greasing250g plain flour250g caster sugar65g cocoa powder1¼ tsp baking powder½ tsp bicarbonate of soda¼ tsp fine sea salt250g full-fatgreek yoghurt3 large eggs60ml whole milkFor the cream and cherry jam450g frozen cherries3½ tbsp caster sugar300ml double cream250g mascarpone¾ tsp ground cardamomIcing sugar, to decorate200g fresh cherriesHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, and grease and line two 20cm cake tins.In a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, bicarb and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk the yoghurt, oil, eggs and milk until smooth. Pour the wet mixture into the dry and whisk until just smooth.Divide the cake batter between the tins (ie, put 600g in each), then bake for 25 minutes, or until the cakes bounce back like stress balls when gently prodded with a clean finger. Remove and leave to cool completely in the tins.While the cakes are baking, put the frozen cherries in a medium saucepan with two tablespoons of the sugar and put over a medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring every now and then, until syrupy but still a bit juicy (ie,notjam).Using an electric whisk, whip the double cream, mascarpone, cardamom and the remaining tablespoon and a half of the sugar to soft peaks, then cover and put in the fridge until needed.When the cakes have cooled down, assemble by placing one cake upside down on a plate, so the domed bit is on the bottom. Top with the cardamom cream, then spoon over the cherry compote. Add the second layer of cake, dust with icing sugar and try to balance as many cherries on top as you can; if any roll off, eat them on the side.Explore more on these topicsDessertMeera Sodha recipesFoodCakeFruitBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"
